Acquire a censer.,
Buy self-lighting charcoal tablets.,
Get myrrh in gum or powder form.,
Put a layer of sand in your censer.,
Place your censer on a heat-resistant surface.,
Light the charcoal.,
Place the charcoal on the sand.,
Add a quarter teaspoon of myrrh to the censer.",How to Burn Myrrh," Censers come in wide variety of shapes, sizes and styles. They can be made of metals, like brass or steel, or other non-flammable materials like ceramic. The material and style you choose is personal preference, and won’t affect the censer’s performance.


If you don’t want to buy a censer, you can use various items around the house for burning myrrh. You just need to make sure it’s non-flammable and can hold the charcoal. A simple ceramic plate or bowl can do just fine.;
, These round pieces of charcoal typically have a recessed circle on top. This is to stack incense, whether it’s powdered or in chunks. These charcoal tablets are found wherever you can buy incense, such as health stores. You can also buy them online., You can get this substance in either of these forms from any store that sells incense. You can also buy myrrh from online health stores., You’ll want this layer to fill no more than 2-3 inches (5-7.6cm) of the censer. It will help disperse heat from the charcoal so your censer doesn’t get too hot. It will also make the myrrh burn longer.


If you don’t have sand, you can use cat litter or fine gravel in your censer., The censer can get quite hot, and the last thing you want is burn marks on your nice wooden table. If you have pets or children, make sure to place the censer somewhere they can’t reach it, since the incense will burn for about 30 to 45 minutes.

, Turn on your stove and use tongs to place the charcoal tablet on the stovetop. You’ll want to use the tongs to flip the charcoal once it starts turning red and sparking. Leave it on the stovetop until the bottom is completely red and flames start to rise from it.


Don’t do this if you have a glass or ceramic stovetop. You might burn black marks onto it or worse, shatter the glass and risk injury.
Alternatively, you can use a match or lighter to light the charcoal. Be warned that it’ll take a bit longer to light it this way., Once the charcoal is lit and flames start to come up from under it, use tongs to transfer it to the censer. If your charcoal has a small recessed “dish”, make sure it’s pointed upwards., Place the myrrh on top of the charcoal, whether you’re using dust or gum. You shouldn’t add any more myrrh until it’s completely burnt up, and no more than a quarter teaspoon at a time.


If you want the myrrh to burn for longer, you can fill the charcoal tablet with salt before putting the myrrh on top."

Make a spill kit.",How to Build Your Own Chemistry Lab," You want to make sure you have plenty of space to set up and perform your experiments. A cluttered counter is difficult to work with and can lead to spills or damage of equipment. Ideally, you will have enough space to have a “wet” and “dry” side to work with. The “wet” side is for actual experiments, while the “dry” side is for supply storage.You’ll also need plenty of space for the items you frequently use, such as glassware and chemicals.
If you’re concerned about ruining a good counter, place a towel on top of the counter and then a rubber non-slip mat on top of that. This will protect the counter and absorb any spilled chemicals.;
, Many chemicals and chemical reactions release volatile fumes that can be hazardous to your health. Proper ventilation is essential for your home chemistry lab. In addition, you want to work in a dry and temperate space. Temperature is important for the long-term storage of many chemicals.While basements are spacious, they are not an ideal environment because they are usually poorly-ventilated, cold and damp during the winter, and hot and humid during the summer.
An open window and portable exhaust fan can serve to increase ventilation in any room.
If possible, work outside for experiments that produce lots of smoke or fumes.

, Being able to see what you are doing during experiments is extremely important. If your space does not have enough light, buy some floor lamps to increase the lighting. A well-lit space will help avoid injury while experimenting.Rooms with windows provide nice natural light and increase the ventilation.

, Avoid rooms that have a porous floor such as carpet or wood. Spilled chemicals will be absorbed and ruin those surfaces. Vinyl or linoleum floors work very well because they are easy to clean and won’t absorb chemicals. Concrete flooring works as well, but is porous and can absorb spills. Consider coating it with latex or epoxy.You can also purchase rubber flooring mats to cover the area of your workspace.

, Although not essential, having access to running water and the sewer system can be very convenient. It is good not only for your experiments, but also from a safety perspective. If this is not possible, fill a large container, such as a 5-gallon carboy, with water. You will need water for many of your experiments and it is useful to have a large amount nearby.If you get something in your eye or spill chemicals directly on you, rinse the affected area with water for at least 15 minutes before seeking further treatment.

, First, you need to establish the type of work you’re going to do in your lab. Your needs are going to be different if you’re a student doing science fair experiments versus a more advanced scientist performing complex reactions at home.As a beginning scientist, you can start out with a home scientist kit, a few beakers, and work with supplies that can be found around the house.
If you are trying to do more complicated research, you will need accurate measuring devices, heating devices, and well-made glassware.

, Beakers, Erlenmeyer flasks (with stoppers), and graduated cylinders of various sizes will be invaluable to your experiments. Sizes ranging from 250 mL to 1000 mL are good to start with. Small plastic pipettes, test tubes, racks for test tubes, heat resistant tubing, and a funnel are also useful to have on hand.Burettes for titrations might also be useful for some chemistry experiments.
As you use your lab more, you will get to know what you need more of and what you don’t need.
High-quality student-grade equipment is usually sufficient for the work you would be doing at home and is much less expensive than professional grade. Beware though, if it seems too cheap, it probably is.

, Thermometers, pH paper, a milligram scale, hot plates, stir plates, and stir bars are all essential to starting a lab. Tools such as forceps, scoops, and tongs for hot flasks are useful as well. A small basic microscope might also be beneficial.Some of these supplies are not cheap, but consider them an investment. If you buy something cheap, you may not get the results you are looking for.
Many of these basic supplies can be purchased easily online from sites like Thermo Fisher Scientific, Sigma Aldrich, or even Amazon., Many chemicals for your lab can be easily purchased at grocery stores, hardware stores, lawn and garden stores, and pottery supply stores. Chemicals such as baking soda, soda ash, bleach, acetone, vinegar, and ammonia are all good basics to have on hand.Some chemicals that can’t be purchased in stores can be synthesized from those that are easily purchased.
Be aware of the strength of the chemicals that you are using. Read all product labels and material safety data sheets before use.

, Identify the purpose of your lab. Knowing the types of experiments you want to do will help you determine the type of advanced equipment you may need. You may need glass condensers or better more expensive tools.


Some of this equipment can get expensive, so make sure it will really be useful to you if you are going to purchase it.

, A good scientist keeps track of all of their work. Start a laboratory notebook and write down all of your experiments: the procedure you did, what you thought would happen, what actually happened, and what you will do with that information.Date everything and keep your notebook current.
You can also use your notebook to track the use of your chemicals and their expiration dates.

, The most important aspect of lab safety is having the proper equipment to protect you while working. Always wear a lab coat to protect your clothes and skin from damage. Latex or nitrile gloves should be worn at all times when handling chemicals. Goggles that protect both your eyes and the sides of your eyes are also essential.Closed-toe shoes should always been worn while working.
Long pants should also be worn to protect your legs.
Never eat or drink while experimenting.

, Flammable and corrosive chemicals should be stored in a special cabinet to prevent fire or explosions. These chemicals should also be stored in separate containers within the cabinet to prevent them reacting with each other. Never store chemicals near household items like food and drinks.Read the material safety data sheets (MSDS) for all of the chemicals that you own to store them properly.Use the proper storage container for your chemicals. Some strong acids can only be stored in plastic, while other chemicals may need to be stored in glass.
Make sure hazardous chemicals are stored under lock and key or safely away from the access of small children or pets.

, Always have a fire extinguisher nearby and a working smoke detector in the area. Make sure the fire extinguisher is not expired and keep it in an easily accessible location. Get a fire extinguisher that works against ABC or BC fires (can be corrosive to metals, but useful for chemical, electrical, and ordinary burning materials). These work best against chemical fires, but are not effective against strong alkali (basic) or strong acid fires.Check the status of the fire extinguisher and the smoke detector once a month to make sure they are both in working order.
Never throw water on a strong acid. It will explode.

, Spills are inevitable in the lab and having a spill kit will help you keep the spill from turning into something major. Keep your spill kit easily accessible and ensure all materials are within their expiration date. Make a spill kit that contains the following items:latex gloves
eye protection that covers the sides of your eyes
apron or lab coat
a dustpan and brush (also useful for broken glass)
Absorbent materials: kitty litter, sand or clay, and absorbent pads
Neutralizing materials: baking soda for acid spills; citric acid for basic spills
Store all items in a 5-gallon polypropylene (plastic) bucket. Use the bucket to contain all the materials after cleaning up the spill.

;
, The number of elements present in the equation determines how many rows will be in the vectors and matrices that we are going to construct. Below, the order we list corresponds to the order of the rows.


H{\displaystyle {\mathrm {H} }} – Hydrogen


P{\displaystyle {\mathrm {P} }} – Phosphorus


O{\displaystyle {\mathrm {O} }} – Oxygen


N{\displaystyle {\mathrm {N} }} – Nitrogen


Mo{\displaystyle {\mathrm {Mo} }} – Molybdenum


, The vector equation consists of column vectors corresponding to each compound in the equation. Each vector has a corresponding coefficient, labeled x1{\displaystyle x_{1}} to x6,{\displaystyle x_{6},} for which we are solving for. Make sure you understand how to count the number of atoms in a molecule. 


x1(31400)+x2(80421)+x3(10310)=x4(12140312)+x5(40320)+x6(20100){\displaystyle x_{1}{\begin{pmatrix}3\\1\\4\\0\\0\end{pmatrix}}+x_{2}{\begin{pmatrix}8\\0\\4\\2\\1\end{pmatrix}}+x_{3}{\begin{pmatrix}1\\0\\3\\1\\0\end{pmatrix}}=x_{4}{\begin{pmatrix}12\\1\\40\\3\\12\end{pmatrix}}+x_{5}{\begin{pmatrix}4\\0\\3\\2\\0\end{pmatrix}}+x_{6}{\begin{pmatrix}2\\0\\1\\0\\0\end{pmatrix}}}


, There are two major points to consider here. First, recognize that a vector equation like the one above has the same solution set as a linear system with its corresponding augmented matrix. This is a fundamental idea in linear algebra. Second, when the augments are all 0, row-reduction does not change the augments. Therefore, we need not write them at all – row-reducing the coefficient matrix is all that is necessary.

Note that moving everything to the left side causes the elements on the right side to negate.


(381−12−4−2100−100443−40−3−1021−3−20010−1200){\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}3&8&1&-12&-4&-2\\1&0&0&-1&0&0\\4&4&3&-40&-3&-1\\0&2&1&-3&-2&0\\0&1&0&-12&0&0\end{pmatrix}}}


, For such a matrix, it is recommended that you use a calculator, although row-reducing by hand is always an option, albeit slower. 


(10000−1/1201000−100100−7/400010−1/1200001−7/4){\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}1&0&0&0&0&-1/12\\0&1&0&0&0&-1\\0&0&1&0&0&-7/4\\0&0&0&1&0&-1/12\\0&0&0&0&1&-7/4\end{pmatrix}}}

It is clear that there is a free variable x6{\displaystyle x_{6}} here. Those with sharp minds would've seen this coming, for there are more variables than equations, and hence more columns than rows. This free variable means that x6{\displaystyle x_{6}} can take on any value, and the resulting combination of x1{\displaystyle x_{1}} to x5{\displaystyle x_{5}} would be a valid solution (to our linear system, that is – the chemical equation results in further restrictions in this solution set).


, Let's set x6=t.{\displaystyle x_{6}=t.} Since for positive values of t,{\displaystyle t,} none of the variables become negative, so we are on the right track.


x1=t/12{\displaystyle x_{1}=t/12}


x2=t{\displaystyle x_{2}=t}


x3=7t/4{\displaystyle x_{3}=7t/4}


x4=t/12{\displaystyle x_{4}=t/12}


x5=7t/4{\displaystyle x_{5}=7t/4}


x6=t{\displaystyle x_{6}=t}


, Remember that the coefficients in the chemical equation must be integers. Therefore, set t=12,{\displaystyle t=12,} the least common multiple. From our solution set, it is clear that while there are an infinite number of solutions, as we would expect, it is nonetheless a countably infinite set. 


x1=1{\displaystyle x_{1}=1}


x2=12{\displaystyle x_{2}=12}


x3=21{\displaystyle x_{3}=21}


x4=1{\displaystyle x_{4}=1}


x5=21{\displaystyle x_{5}=21}


x6=12{\displaystyle x_{6}=12}


, The equation is now balanced.

Double-check that each side of your equation has zero charge.",How to Balance Redox Reactions," The oxidation state of a species (each element in the equation) is a number equal to the number of electrons that can be gained, lost, or shared with another element during the chemical bonding process.There are seven rules that allow you to determine the oxidation state of an element. They must be followed in the order given below. If two rules conflict, use the first rule to assign oxidation state (OS).Rule #1: An individual atom, by itself, has an OS of 0. For example: Au, OS = 0. Cl2 also has an OS of 0 as long as it is not combined with any other element.
Rule #2: The total OS of all atoms in a neutral species is 0, but in an ion is equal to the ion charge. The molecule’s OS must equal 0, but the OS for each element in that molecule may not be zero. For example, H2O has an OS of 0, but each hydrogen atom has an OS of +1, while the oxygen atom has an OS of -2. The ion Ca2+ has an oxidation state of +2.
Rule #3: For compounds, Group 1 metals have an OS of +1 and Group 2 metals have an OS +2.
Rule #4: The oxidation state of fluorine in a compound is -1.
Rule #5: The oxidation state of hydrogen in a compound is +1.
Rule #6: The oxidation state of oxygen in a compound is -2.
Rule #7: In compounds with two-elements where at least one is a metal, elements in Group 15 have an OS of -3, Group 16 have an OS of -2, and Group 17 have an OS of -1.;
, Although half-reactions are hypothetical reactions, splitting the equation allows you to easily determine whether a redox reaction is occurring. To do this, take the first reactant and write it as a half-reaction with the product that includes the element in the reactant. Then take the second reactant and write it as half-reaction with the product that includes that element.


For example: Fe + V2O3 ---> Fe2O3 + VO breaks down into the following two half-reactions:

Fe ---> Fe2O3

V2O3 ---> VO


If there is only one reactant and two products, make one half-reaction with the reactant and the first product, and one half-reaction with the reactant and the second product. When combining the half-reactions at the end, don’t forget to recombine the reactants. You can do the same if there are two reactants and only one product: use each reactant with the same product for the half-reactions.

ClO- ---> Cl- + ClO3-

Half-reaction 1: ClO- ---> Cl-

Half-reaction 2: ClO- ---> ClO3-




, Using the seven rules for assigning oxidation states, determine the oxidation state for each species in the given chemical equation. Although a compound may be neutral, the elements that make up that compound will have a charged oxidation state. Remember to follow the rules in order.


For the first half-reaction in our above example: OS for the Fe atom alone is 0 (rule #1), OS for the Fe in Fe2 is +3 (rule #2 and #6), and the OS for the O in O3 is -2 (rule #6).
For the second half-reaction: OS for the V in V2 is +3 (rule #2 and #6) while OS for the O in O3 is -2 (rule #6). OS for V is +2 (rule #2), while O is -2 (rule #6).

, Looking at the oxidation states of each species in your half reaction, determine if one species is being oxidized (oxidation state increases), while the other species is reduced (oxidation state decreases). In our example, the first half-reaction is oxidized because Fe starts with an OS of 0 and goes up to 3. The second half-reaction is being reduced because V starts with an OS of +6 and goes down to +2.
Because one species is oxidized and the other reduced, this equation is a redox reaction., Your equation should already be split into two half-reactions from the earlier step of determining whether or not a redox reaction was occurring. If you were already told it was a redox reaction, then your first step is to split it into two half-reactions. To do this, take the first reactant and write it as a half-reaction with the product that includes the element in the reactant. Then take the second reactant and write it as a half-reaction with the product that includes that element.


For example: Fe + V2O3 ---> Fe2O3 + VO breaks down into the following two half-reactions:

Fe ---> Fe2O3

V2O3 ---> VO


If there is only one reactant and two products, make one half-reaction with the reactant and the first product, and one half-reaction with the reactant and the second product. When combining the half-reactions at the end, don’t forget to recombine the reactants. You can do the same if there are two reactants and only one product: use each reactant with the same product for the half-reactions.

ClO- ---> Cl- + ClO3-

Half-reaction 1: ClO- ---> Cl-

Half-reaction 2: ClO- ---> ClO3-




, After you have determined that a redox reaction is occurring, it is time to balance it. Start by balancing all the elements in the each half-reaction that aren’t hydrogen (H) or oxygen (O). These will be balanced in the following steps.


Half-reaction 1:

Fe ---> Fe2O3

There is 1 Fe atom on the left side and 2 on the right, multiply the left by 2 to balance.
2Fe ---> Fe2O3



Half-reaction 2:

V2O3 ---> VO
There are 2 V atoms on the left side and one on the right, multiply the right by 2 to balance.
V2O3 ---> 2VO



, Determine the number of oxygen atoms on each side of the equation. Balance the equation by adding water molecules to the side that has fewer oxygen atoms until both sides are equal.


Half-reaction 1:

2Fe ---> Fe2O3

There are 3 O atoms on the right side and none on the left. Add 3 H2O molecules to the left side to balance.
2Fe + 3H2O ---> Fe2O3



Half-reaction 2:

V2O3 ---> 2VO
There are 3 O atoms on the left side and two on the right. Add 1 H2O molecule to the right side to balance.
V2O3 ---> 2VO + H2O



, Like you did with the oxygen atoms, determine the number of hydrogen atoms on each side of the equation. Then balance by adding H+ atoms to the side that has fewer atoms until both sides are equal.


Half-reaction 1:

2Fe + 3H2O ---> Fe2O3

There are 6 H atoms on the left side and none on the right side. Add 6 H+ to the right side to balance.
2Fe + 3H2O ---> Fe2O3 + 6H+



Half-reaction 2:

V2O3 ---> 2VO + H2O
There are 2 H atoms on the right side and none on the left. Add 2 H+ to the left side to balance.
V2O3 + 2H+ ---> 2VO + H2O



, After you have balanced the hydrogens and oxygens, one side of your equation will be more positive than the other. Add enough electrons to the side of each equation that is more positive to make the charge equal zero.


Electrons will almost always be added to the side with the H+ atoms.
Half-reaction 1:

2Fe + 3H2O ---> Fe2O3 + 6H+

The charge on the left side of the equation is 0 while the right side has a 6+ charge due to the hydrogen ions. Add 6 electrons to the right side to balance.
2Fe + 3H2O ---> Fe2O3 + 6H+ + 6e-



Half-reaction 2:

V2O3 + 2H+ ---> 2VO + H2O
The charge on the left side of the equation is 2+ while the right side is 0. Add 2 electrons to the left side to bring the charge to zero.
V2O3 + 2H+ + 2e- ---> 2VO + H2O



, The electrons on either side of the equation must be made equal so when the half-reactions are added together, the electrons will cancel out. Multiply the reaction by the lowest common factor of the electrons to make them the same.Half-reaction 1 has 6 electrons while half-reaction 2 has 2 electrons. By multiplying half-reaction 2 by 3, it will have 6 electrons and be equal to the first half-reaction.
Half-reaction 1:

2Fe + 3H2O ---> Fe2O3 + 6H+ + 6e-



Half-reaction 2:

V2O3 + 2H+ + 2e- ---> 2VO + H2O
Multiply by 3: 3V2O3 + 6H+ + 6e- ---> 6VO + 3H2O



, Write all of the reactants on the left side of the equation and all of the products on the right side of the equation. You’ll notice that there are like terms on each side including H2O, H+ and e-. You can cancel out like terms, with the remaining terms leaving a balanced equation.


2Fe + 3H2O + 3V2O3 + 6H+ + 6e- ---> Fe2O3 + 6H+ + 6e- + 6VO + 3H2O
The electrons on either side of the equation cancel out yielding: 2Fe + 3H2O + 3V2O3 + 6H+ ---> Fe2O3 + 6H+ + 6VO + 3H2O
There are 3 H2O and 6 H+ ions on either side of the equation that also cancel yielding a final balanced equation: 2Fe + 3V2O3 ---> Fe2O3 + 6VO

, When you’re done balancing, check to make sure that the charges are balanced on each side of the equation. The charges on each side of the equation should be the same.


For the right side of our equation: OS for Fe is 0. In V2O3 the OS for V is +3 and for O is -2. Multiplying by the number of atoms of each element, V = +3 x 2 =6, O = -2 x 3 = -6. The charges cancel out.
For the left side of our equation: In Fe2O3 the OS for Fe is +3 and for O is -2. Multiplying by the number of atoms of each element, Fe = +3 x 2 = +6, O = -2 x 3 = -6. The charges cancel out. In VO the OS for V is +2, while for O it’s -2. The charges also cancel out on this side.
Because all the charges equal zero, our equation has been correctly balanced.

, Balancing in a basic solution follows the same steps as above, with one extra step at the end. Again, your equation should already be split into two half-reactions from the earlier step of determining whether or not a redox reaction was occurring. If you were already told it was a redox reaction, then your first step is to split it into two half-reactions. To do this, take the first reactant and write it as a half-reaction with the product that includes the element in the reactant. Then take the second reactant and write it as a half-reaction with the product that includes that element.


For example, balance the following reaction in a basic solution: Ag + Zn2+ ---> Ag2O + Zn breaks down into the following two half-reactions:

Ag ---> Ag2O
Zn2+ ---> Zn



, After you have determined that a redox reaction is occurring, it is time to balance it. Start by balancing all the elements in the each half-reaction that aren’t hydrogen (H) or oxygen (O). These will be balanced in the following steps.


Half-reaction 1:

Ag ---> Ag2O
There is 1 Ag atom on the left side and 2 on the right, multiply the left by 2 to balance.
2Ag ---> Ag2O


Half-reaction 2:

Zn2+ ---> Zn
There is 1 Zn atom on the left and 1 on the right, therefore it is already balanced.



, Determine the number of oxygen atoms on each side of the equation. Balance the equation by adding water molecules to the side that has fewer oxygen atoms until both sides are equal.


Half-reaction 1:

2Ag ---> Ag2O
There are no O atoms on the left side and one on the right. Add 1 H2O molecule to the left side to balance.
H2O + 2Ag ---> Ag2O


Half-reaction 2:

Zn2+ ---> Zn
There are no O atoms on either side, therefore it is balanced.



, Like you did with the oxygen atoms, determine the number of hydrogen atoms on each side of the equation. Then balance by adding H+ atoms to the side that has fewer atoms until both sides are equal.


Half-reaction 1:

H2O + 2Ag ---> Ag2O
There are 2 H atoms on the left side and none on the right side. Add 2 H+ to the right side to balance.
H2O + 2Ag ---> Ag2O + 2H+



Half-reaction 2:

Zn2+ ---> Zn
There are no H atoms on either side, therefore it is balanced.



, After you have balanced the hydrogens and oxygens, one side of your equation will be more positive than the other. Add enough electrons to the side of each equation that is more positive to make the charge equal zero.


Electrons will almost always be added to the side with the H+ atoms.
Half-reaction 1:

H2O + 2Ag ---> Ag2O + 2H+

The charge on the left side of the equation is 0 while the right side has a 2+ charge due to the hydrogen ions. Add 2 electrons to the right side to balance.
H2O + 2Ag ---> Ag2O + 2H+ + 2e-



Half-reaction 2:

Zn2+ ---> Zn
The charge on the left side of the equation is 2+ while the right side is 0. Add 2 electrons to the left side to bring the charge to zero.
Zn2+ + 2e- ---> Zn



, The electrons on either side of the equation must be made equal so when the half-reactions are added together, the electrons will cancel out. Multiply the reaction by the lowest common factor of the electrons to make them the same.For our example, both sides are already balanced with 2 electrons on each side.

, Write all of the reactants on the left side of the equation and all of the products on the right side of the equation. You’ll notice that there are like terms on each side including H2O, H+ and e-. You can cancel out like terms, with the remaining terms leaving a balanced equation.


H2O + 2Ag + Zn2+ + 2e- ---> Ag2O + Zn + 2H+ + 2e-

The electrons on either side of the equation cancel out yielding: H2O + 2Ag + Zn2+ ---> Ag2O + Zn + 2H+


, Add an equal number OH- ions to balance out the H+ ions. When adding OH- ions, you must add the same number to both sides of the equation.


H2O + 2Ag + Zn2+ ---> Ag2O + Zn + 2H+

There are 2 H+ ions on the right side of the equation. Add 2 OH- ions to both sides of the equation.
H2O + 2Ag + Zn2+ + 2OH- ---> Ag2O + Zn + 2H+ + 2OH-

H+ and OH- combine to form one water molecule (H2O), yielding H2O + 2Ag + Zn2+ + 2OH- ---> Ag2O + Zn + 2H2O
You can cancel one water molecule on the right side, yielding a final balanced equation of: 2Ag + Zn2+ + 2OH- ---> Ag2O + Zn + H2O

, When you’re done balancing, check to make sure that the charges are balanced on each side of the equation. The charges (oxidation state of all the elements) on each side of the equation should equal zero.


For the left side of our equation: Ag has an OS of 0. The Zn2+ ion has an OS of +2. In the OH- ion the OS is -1, but since there are 2 the total charge is -2. The +2 of the Zn and -2 of the OH- ion cancel out to zero.
For the right side: In Ag2O, the Ag has an OS of +1, while O is -2. Multiplying by the number of atoms Ag = +1 x 2 = +2, the -2 of O cancels out. The Zn has an OS of 0. The water molecule also has an OS of 0.
Because all the charges equal zero, our equation has been correctly balanced.

Chemistry of oxygen containing organic heterocyclic compounds is a sub-discipline within the area of organic chemistry of heterocyclic compounds.,
This area of organic chemistry is rarely taught as a course by its self at the university except in universities that have strong disciplines in organic chemistry such universities in Europe.,
Sugars appear especially in the structures of DNA and RNA nucleotides in addition to its appearance in the molecule of ATP.,
For these reasons there was an interest in the chemistry of sugar derivatives which are mostly present in a cyclic form that is the more thermodynamically stable form than the linear form.,
When used in inorganic chemistry it has potential to react with certain metals such as with magnesium to for magnesium nitride.,
As a rule oxygen containing organic compounds are less reactive chemically than the nitrogen containing organic compounds of the same type.,
However, alkoxides can participate in chemical reactions as nucleophiles as well.,
Oxygen mustards are not as reactive as the nitrogen mustards by virtue of the weak reactivity of the oxygen atom in neutral alcoholic materials.,
Heterocyclic compounds that contain oxygen have potential uses as solvents for performing chemical reaction and also they have potential for use as sugars derivatives.,
Other interesting heterocyclic compounds which contain oxygen are the crown ethers group of compounds.",How to Be Familiar With the Chemistry of Oxygen Containing Heterocyclic Compounds," The interest in this type of compounds stems from the fact that many sugars have biological roles in the body that is manifested as their involvement in certain biochemical processes in the body. Examples are the sugars glucose and fructose both of which have important metabolic functions at the cellular level inside the body. Sugars can have open form structure as well as a cyclic form structure. The cyclic form is the more thermodynamically stable compound among the two possible forms.
, The practice of organic heterocyclic compounds which contain oxygen in its molecular structure is basically the practice of sugars chemistry and its derivatives. These compounds and its derivatives have potential uses as pharmacological drugs that can be used to treat certain types of diseases., These sugars are convenient targets of drugs that have slightly different structure but which can mimic their biological function. Thus the result is the interference with the normal function of the physiological sugar. This can for example interrupt the normal function of the DNA molecule by substituting the pharmacological sugar instead of the physiological sugar., Also heterocyclic organic compounds which contain oxygen have other potential uses such as their use as solvents in many organic reactions. An example is the compound Tetrahydrofuran. This compound has unusual chemical properties as an excellent solvent for organic and organometallic reactions. Oxygen containing compounds which are used often in the laboratory as solvents have the disadvantage of their being potential to form peroxides. These compounds are potential explosive material that can harm the user of these compounds. For these reasons the handling of oxygen based solvents must be carefully kept under inert atmosphere of nitrogen or argon. Nitrogen has been shown not be completely inert when used as an atmosphere for a chemical reactions., For these reasons chemists that want to design conditions for their reactions must choose these conditions very carefully., This is ascribed to the fact that oxygen is more electronegative than nitrogen and therefore it is less likely to give its lone pair of electrons in a chemical reaction. For these reasons alcohols are not as reactive as amines. Alcohols must be deprotonated using a strong base in order to obtain a reactive oxygen species that can enter a chemical reaction. Deprotonated oxygen in alcohols is called an alkoxide and has more basic character than nucleophilic character., This is especially true in the absence of an acid in the medium of the reaction. This alkoxide is the predominant species that participate in the cyclization process of alcohols to form heterocyclic compounds that contain oxygen atoms., Activation of alcohols requires deprotonation of the hydrogen that is attached to the oxygen atom. This is usually done using a very strong base such as butyl-lithium or tert-butyl-lithium. These two compounds are extremely unstable compounds that can react with any substance in its environment. Therefore they require special handling such as working under inert atmosphere of an inert gas., A special type of heterocyclic compounds which contains oxygen is the aromatic heterocyclic compound. A typical example is the furan molecule and benzofuran. The aromaticity of these two compounds relies on the fact that they share the electrons lone pair on oxygen as part of the aromatic electrons., These compounds are important due to its ability to solvate positively charged ions that under normal conditions would precipitate in a medium of organic solvent. There are various types of these crow ethers. Each is designed to solvate different type of ions based on its ionic size."

Boil distilled water on a hot plate.,
Remove the hot metal carefully and allow it to dry.",How to Anodize Aluminum," Anodizing works particularly well with aluminum, so, if careful, you can do it at home. Use small aluminum pieces to begin with so that you can submerge it in small quantities of acid.;
, Choose a type of plastic that is extremely hard and durable.

, During the anodizing process, you can dye the metal almost any color. This is the process Apple uses to color iPods. You can also buy special dye for anodizing that may produce better results.

,,, The battery acid may be hard to find; however, it is usually available at auto parts stores. A large battery charger should work as a constant power supply.

,,, (44 ml) of lye in 1 gallon (3.8 l) of distilled water. Use a smaller plastic tub or discarded metal bowl. Allow it to sit for 3 minutes, then remove it and rinse it well.


The lye will remove any existing anodizing on the surface of the metal. Once it is removed, water should pour off the surface easily, instead of beading.
Wear rubber gloves whenever working with lye.
Do not use measuring spoons or cups that are used for food products. The materials used in this process are toxic.

, Set it on a piece of plywood and/or a thick drop cloth in case of spills.


For best results, do this when the indoor temperature is between 70 and 72 degrees Fahrenheit (21 to 22 degrees Celsius).

, Set it on a non-flammable material, like concrete, and make sure it is working consistently.


You will need to connect the positive wire from your battery charger or rectifier to a wire that will be strung to your aluminum.
You will need to connect your negative wire from your battery charger to an aluminum wire connected to 2 lead cathodes.

, 12-gauge aluminum wire works well for this use. Wrap it or connect it to the part on a place that is hidden.


The area of the part that connects to the wire will not anodize.
Make sure it is very tightly wrapped for a more consistent charge.

, This will give you leverage to lift it out when you are done. Make sure you have extra wire extending toward your power supply after you wrap it.


Test the wooden handle to ensure your aluminum part will be fully submerged in the acid mix.

, String aluminum wire between the cathodes and connect them together on your small wood plank. You will attach the negatively charged power supply to this wire.


Make sure the wire connecting the aluminum part and the lead cathodes does not touch. , The amount you use will depend upon the size of the metal part you want to anodize. Be very careful not to spill.


Always pour the water in before the acid. If you spill any acid, cover it quickly with baking soda.
Put on a mask or respirator before you start working with acid. Turn on a fan to ventilate the area.

, Connect the aluminum wire that leads from the lead cathodes to the negative charge supply.

,, Slowly turn it up. You will want to use 12 amps per square foot of material.


Increasing the power too fast or using too much can burn your aluminum wires.

, You will see little oxidation bubbles start to form on the surface of the aluminum. It will also start to change color, turning brown, then yellow.

, Mix with distilled water and heat it to 100 to 140 degrees Fahrenheit (37 to 60 degrees Celsius).

, Remove the metal part and rinse it with distilled water.

, Let it sit for 15 minutes.

, Remove the aluminum part from the dye and place it in the boiling water for 30 minutes. , The surface should be sealed and dyed.

Write down the formula of the ionic compound.,
Write the name of the metal, or the cation.This is the positively charged ion in the compound, and it is always written first in ionic compound formulas.,
Write the name of the nonmetal, or the anion, with the ""-ide"" ending.,

Practice naming more simple ionic compounds.",How to Name Ionic Compounds1," Let's say the ionic compound you're working with is NaCl., Na is sodium. So, write Sodium.

, Cl is chlorine. To add the ""ide"" ending, just drop the last syllable, ""-ine,"" and add ""-ide"" instead. Chlorine becomes chloride.

, NaCl can be written as sodium chloride.

, Once you've gotten this formula down, try naming a few more simple ionic compounds. Even memorizing a few can help you have a better understanding of how to name ionic compounds. Here are a few more:


Li2S = Lithium sulfide






Ag2S = Silver sulfide






MgCl2 = Magnesium chloride

Write down the formula of the ionic compound.,
Write down the charge of the metal.,
Write down the name of the metal.,
Write down the name of the nonmetal.,
Put the first name and second name together.,
Use the older naming method.,
Remember the exceptions.",How to Name Ionic Compounds2," Transition metals can be found in the middle of the periodic tables. They get their name because their oxidation numbers, or their charges, are constantly changing. Let's say you're working with this compound: Fe2O3., You know that the metal will have a positive charge, so cross over the 3 from the O3 and write that Fe has a charge of +3. (For fun, do the reverse and write that O has a charge of -2.) Sometimes, the charge will be provided for you., Since you know that Fe is iron and that it has a charge of +3, you can call it Iron (III). Remember to only use the Roman numeral when you're writing out the name, not writing the formula.

, Since you know that O is oxygen, you can call add the ""-ide"" ending and call it ""oxide.""

, Now you have it. Fe2O3 = Iron (III) oxide.

, Under the older naming method, which is also used, you use ""-ous"" and ""-ic"" endings for the metals instead of the Roman numerals. If the metal ion has a lower oxidation state (a lower numerical charge, disregarding the ""+"" or ""-""), then you add the ""-ous"" ending. If it has a higher charge, then it has an ""-ic"" ending. Fe2+ has the lower state (Fe3+ has the higher state), so it becomes ferrous. The name of Fe2+O can also be written as ferrous oxide.

, There are two transition metals that do have a definite charge. Those are zinc (Zn) and silver (Ag). This means that you don't have to use Roman numerals or the older naming method in describing those elements.

Let's say you're working with the following compound: FeNH4(SO4)2., You'll have to do some math to find it. First, you know that the sulfate, or the SO4 ion has a charge of -2, and that there are two of them because of the 2 below the parenthesis. So, 2 x -2 = -4. Then, you know that the NH4, or the ammonia ion, has a charge of +1. Add up -4 and 1 and you get -3. This means that the iron ion, Fe, must have a charge of +3 to make up for it and to make the compound neutral.

, In this case you can either write Iron (III) or ferric.

, In this case, you're working with ammonium and sulfate, or ammonium sulfate.

, You can name the compound FeNH4(SO4)2 by either writing iron (III) ammonium sulfate or ferric ammonium sulfate.

Write down your given equation.,
Write down the number of atoms per each element that you have on each side of the equation.,
Always leave hydrogen and oxygen for last.

,
If you have more than one element left to balance: select the element that appears in only a single molecule of reactants and in only a single molecule of products.,
Add a coefficient to the single carbon atom on the right of the equation to balance it with the 3 carbon atoms on the left of the equation.,
Balance the hydrogen atoms next.,
Balance the oxygen atoms.",How to Balance Chemical Equations1," For this example, you will use:


C3H8 + O2 --> H2O + CO2

This reaction occurs when propane (C3H8) is burned in the presence of oxygen to produce water and carbon dioxide.;
, Look at the subscripts next to each atom to find the number of atoms in the equation.


Left side: 3 carbon, 8 hydrogen and 2 oxygen.
Right side: 1 carbon, 2 hydrogen and 3 oxygen.

,, This means that you will need to balance the carbon atoms first.

,


C3H8 + O2 --> H2O + 3CO2

The coefficient 3 in front of carbon on the right side indicates 3 carbon atoms just as the subscript 3 on the left side indicates 3 carbon atoms.
In a chemical equation, you can change coefficients, but you must never alter the subscripts.

, You have 8 on the left side. So you'll need 8 on the right side.


C3H8 + O2 --> 4H2O + 3CO2

On the right side, you now added a 4 as the coefficient because the subscript showed that you already had 2 hydrogen atoms.
When you multiply the coefficient 4 times by the subscript 2, you end up with 8.
The other 6 atoms of Oxygen come from 3CO2.(3x2=6 atoms of oxygen+ the other 4=10)

,


Because you've added coefficients to the molecules on the right side of the equation, the number of oxygen atoms has changed. You now have 4 oxygen atoms in the water molecules and 6 oxygen atoms in the carbon dioxide molecules. That makes a total of 10 oxygen atoms.
Add a coefficient of 5 to the oxygen molecule on the left side of the equation. You now have 10 oxygen atoms on each side.
C3H8 + 5O2 --> 4H2O + 3CO2.






The carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms are balanced. Your equation is complete.

Use this tool to accurately measure salinity in liquids.,
Select a refractometer designed for the liquid you wish to measure.,
Open the plate near the angled end of the refractometer.,
Add a couple drops of the liquid onto the exposed prism.,
Carefully close the plate.,
Look through the device to see the salinity reading.,
Wipe the prism with a soft, damp cloth.,
Calibrate the refractometer periodically.",How to Measure Salinity1," Refractometers measure how much light bends, or refracts, when it enters the liquid. The more salts (and other material) dissolved in the water, the more resistance the light will meet and the more it will bend.

For a cheaper, but somewhat less accurate, method, try a hydrometer.
If you are measuring the salinity of soil, use a conductivity meter.;
, Different liquids already refract light by different amounts, so to accurately measure additional salinity (or other solids content), use a refractometer designed specifically for the liquid you intend to measure. If the liquid is not specifically mentioned on the packaging, the refractometer is probably designed to measure salt water.



Note: Salt refractometers are used to measure sodium chloride dissolved in water. Seawater refractometers are used to measure the mixture of salts typically found in seawater or saltwater aquariums. Using the wrong one may result in a reading approximately 5% off, which may be acceptable for non-laboratory purposes.Refractometers are also designed to compensate for the expansion of a specific material due to temperature changes., A handheld refractometer has one round, open end to look through, and one angled end. Hold the refractometer so the angled surface is on the top of the device, and find the small plate near this end which can be moved to one side.



Note: If you have not yet used your refractometer, you may wish to calibrate it first for a more accurate reading. This process is explained at the end of this section, but you may wish to read the following steps first so you are more familiar with how to work the device.

, Take the liquid you wish to measure, and use an eyedropper to pick up a couple drops of it. Transfer this to the translucent prism revealed when you moved the plate. Add enough water to completely cover the prism's surface with a thin layer., Cover the prism again by gently pushing the plate back into position. The parts on a refractometer may be small and delicate, so try not to apply much force even if they become slightly stuck. Instead, wiggle the plate back and forth with your finger until it moves smoothly again.

, Look through the round end of the device. There should be one or more numbered scales visible. The salinity scale is likely labeled 0/00 meaning ""parts per thousand"", and ranges from 0 at the bottom of the scale, to at least 50 at the top.Look for the salinity measurement at the line where the white and blue areas meet.

, Once you have the measurement you need, open the plate again and use a soft, slightly damp cloth to wipe the prism until it is free of water droplets.Leaving water in the prism, or immersing the refractometer in water, can damage the refractometer.


A damp tissue may work if you don't have a cloth flexible enough to reach the whole surface of the tiny prism.

, Periodically between uses, calibrate it to the correct reading by using pure, distilled water. Add the water to the prism as you would for any liquid, and check whether the salinity reading is ""0."" If not, use a small screwdriver to adjust the calibration screw, typically found beneath a small cap on the top or bottom of the device, until the salinity reading is ""0.""A new, high-quality refractometer may only need calibration once every few weeks or months. A cheaper, older refractometer may need to be calibrated before each use.
Your refractometer may come with calibration instructions that specify a certain water temperature. If none are included, use room temperature distilled water.

Use this inexpensive tool for reasonably accurate water measurements.,
Narrow down your hydrometer options.,
Select a hydrometer with a listed temperature standard.,
Take a sample of water.,
Measure the temperature of the water sample.,
Clean the hydrometer if necessary.,
Lower the hydrometer gently into the water sample.,
Shake gently to remove air bubbles.,
Read the measurement on a swing-arm hydrometer.,
Read the measurement on a glass hydrometer.,
Convert the specific gravity measurement to a salinity measurement, if necessary.",How to Measure Salinity2," A hydrometer measures the specific gravity of water, or its density compared to pure H2O. Because almost all types of salt are denser than water, a hydrometer reading can tell you how much salt is present. This is accurate enough for most purposes, such as measuring salinity in an aquarium, but many models of hydrometer are inaccurate or easy to use improperly.This method cannot be used for solid material. If you are measuring the salinity of soil, see the conductivity method instead.
For a more accurate measurement, use the inexpensive evaporation method, or the faster refractometer method.

, Hydrometers, also called specific gravity meters, are sold online or at aquarium shops, in several different basic designs. Glass hydrometers that float in water are typically more accurate than other designs, but often don't have precise measurements listed (a longer decimal).Plastic ""swing arm"" hydrometers may be cheaper and sturdier, but tend to become less accurate over time., Because different materials expand or shrink at different rates as they heat or cool, knowing the temperature the hydrometer was calibrated to is important when using it to calculate salinity.Select a hydrometer with a listed temperature on the device or packaging. It may be easiest to calculate salinity with hydrometers calibrated to 60ºF (15.6ºC) or 77ºF (25ºC), as these are the most common standards for measuring the salinity of salt water. You may use a hydrometer with a different calibration as long as it comes with a reference chart to convert its readings into salinity.

, Transfer some of the water you plan to measure into a clean, transparent container. The container should be wide enough to fit the hydrometer, and the water should be deep enough to submerge most of the hydrometer. Make sure the container has been rinsed free of any dirt, soap, or other materials.

, Use a thermometer to measure the temperature of the water sample. As long as you know the temperature of your sample, and the temperature standard of your hydrometer, you can calculate the salinity.


For a slightly more accurate reading, you may heat or cool the sample to the temperature the hydrometer was built for. Be careful not to overheat the water, as steaming or boiling can significantly alter the specific gravity.

, Scrub the hydrometer to remove any visible dirt or other solids on the surface. Rinse the hydrometer in fresh water if it was previously used in salt water, as salt may have built up on the surface.

, Glass hydrometers can be placed partially in the water, then released to float on its own. Swing-arm hydrometers will not float, and usually come with a small tab or handle that allows you to dip them into the water without getting your hands wet.


Do not submerge glass hydrometers entirely, as this can mess up the reading., If air bubbles are clinging to the surface of the hydrometer, their buoyancy will result in the wrong density reading. Gently shake the hydrometer to remove these, then let the water turbulence settle down before continuing.

, Keep swing-arm hydrometers completely level, with no tilt in either direction. The measurement the arm points to is the specific gravity of your water.

, In a glass hydrometer, read the measurement where the surface of the water touches the hydrometer. If the water surface curves up or down to cling to the tool, ignore that curve and read the measurement at the level of the flat water surface.


The water curve is called a meniscus, and is a phenomenon caused by surface tension, not salinity., Many aquarium care instructions use specific gravity, typically measured between 0.998 and 1.031, so you do not need to convert to salinity, typically between 0 and 40 parts per thousand (ppt). However, if it only provides the latter measurement, you will need to convert between the first and second measurements yourself. If your hydrometer didn't come with a reference chart for this purpose, search online or in an aquarium reference book for a ""specific gravity to salinity conversion"" table or calculator. Make sure you use one designed specifically for the temperature standard listed on your hydrometer, or you may get the wrong result.



This table can be used with a hydrometer calibrated to a 60ºF (15.6ºC) standard temperature. Note that the water sample temperature is given in ºC.

This table is for hydrometers calibrated at 77ºF (25ºC). The water sample temperature is given in ºC.
These charts and calculators will also vary based on the liquid, but the vast majority are used for salt water.

Use this to measure salinity of soil or water.,
Select an electrical conductivity meter.,
If measuring soil, mix it with distilled water.,
With the cap off, dip the EC meter up to the required level.,
Move the meter gently up and down.,
Adjust for temperature according to the EC meter's instructions.,
Read the display.,
Determine whether the soil salinity is appropriate for your plants.,
Periodically calibrate the EC meter.",How to Measure Salinity3," An electrical conductivity meter, or EC meter, is the only common device that can be used to measure the salinity of soil. It can also be used to measure the salinity of water, but a high-quality EC meter may be significantly more expensive than a refractometer or hydrometer.


Some aquarium hobbyists like to use both a conductivity meter and one of the other tools described on this page, in order to confirm their salinity reading.

, These devices send an electrical current through the material, and measure how much the material resists the flow of current. The more salts found in the water or soil, the higher the conductivity rating. In order to get an accurate reading for common water and soil types, select an EC meter that can measure up to at least 19.99 mS/cm (19.99 dS/m)., Mix one part soil with five parts distilled water, shaking them together thoroughly. Let the mixture settle for at least two minutes before continuing.Because distilled water has no electrolytes or salts in it, the measurement you get will reflect the quantity of these materials in the soil.


In laboratory conditions, you may be required to let the mixture settle for thirty minutes, or use a more accurate ""saturated soil paste"" method which can take over two hours.These are rarely done outside of a laboratory environment, however, and the method above is still reasonably accurate.

, Remove the protective cap covering the thin end of the EC meter. Immerse this end to the level indicated on the meter, or just far enough that the thin prove is submerged, if no level is indicated. Most EC meters are not waterproof above a certain point, so do not drop the meter underwater.

, This motion removes any air bubbles that are trapped inside the probe. Do not shake vigorously, as this could drive the water out of the probe instead., Some EC meters automatically correct for the temperature of the liquid, which can affect conductivity. Wait at least thirty seconds for the meter to make this adjustment, or longer if the water is unusually cold or hot. Other meters have a dial which can be manually adjusted to the correct temperature.


If your EC meter has neither of these features, it may come with a chart which you can use to manually correct the reading based on the water's temperature., The display is typically digital, and may give you a measurement in mS/cm, dS/m, or mmhos/cm. Fortunately, these three units are equal in size, so you do not need to convert between them.


Respectively, these units stand for milliSiemens per centimeter, deciSiemens per meter, or millimho per centimeter. The mho (inverse of an ohm) is an old-fashioned name for the Siemens, but is still used in some industries., Using the method described here, EC readings of 4 or higher could indicate danger. Sensitive plants such as mango or banana may be affected at an EC as low as 2, while tolerant plants such as coconut may be fine with an EC as high as 8–10.Note: Whenever looking up EC ranges for a particular plant, find out which method that source used to test the EC. If the soil is diluted with two parts water, or with just enough water to make a paste, instead of the 1:5 ratio used here, the numbers may be significantly different.

, Between each use, calibrate the EC meter by using it to measure an ""electrical conductivity calibration solution,"" purchased for this purpose. If the measurement does not match the known conductivity of that solution, use a small screwdriver to adjust the calibration screw until the measurement is correct.Some calibration solutions may come with a ""check solution"" to test after calibration. If the check solution's conductivity is inaccurate, your EC meter may be broken.

Heterocyclic organic chemistry is a branch of organic chemistry that deals with the chemistry of cyclic organic compounds which contain a heteroatom as one of the atoms in its structure.,
This collection of heteroatoms that can participate in the formation of the heterocyclic ring make these structures very versatile in its chemical behavior.,
The insertion of a foreign atom into a cyclic organic compound is a synthetically challenging task for the practitioner chemist.,
Besides electronic and spectroscopic properties of heterocyclic compounds can be very interesting to study and to evaluate based on its applications in many types of industries.,
Heterocyclic organic compounds have an interesting group of compounds which are called the aromatic heterocyclic compounds.,
Aromatic compounds are organic cyclic compounds which have unusual thermodynamic stability that is conferred due to the presence of three conjugated double bonds in its molecular structure.,
The synthesis of heterocyclic organic compounds is mainly by the process of cyclization of a linear compound that includes a heteroatom in its structure.,
This area of organic chemistry is a relatively new to the chemical science and there is still an actively ongoing research that is done on these compounds and its derivatives.,
The nature of the heteroatom that is incorporated into the ring can dictate its level of application and degree of toxicity.",How to Be Knowledgeable With the Subject of Heterocyclic Chemistry," Usually heteroatoms that participate in the formation of the heterocyclic compound is one of the nitrogen atom group or one of the carbon atom group or one of the oxygen atom group.;
, There is in the chemical literature today whole subject about the chemistry of heterocyclic compounds and its uses in the organic synthetic laboratory. The impetus for generation these compounds is many folds. One of them is an academic goal which forms a challenge to the synthetic chemist on how to prepare these challenging chemical structures. Also another goal of synthesizing such interesting molecules is their possible uses as potential pharmacological compounds and as intermediates in the synthetic pathway of natural products such as alkaloids and steroids.

, Nowadays many organic heterocyclic compounds are available commercially from chemical companies that specialize in the synthesis of organic compounds for laboratory uses. Heterocyclic organic compounds are especially important for the production of pharmacologically similar molecules to DNA bases and to cyclic sugars that have potential as pharmacological drugs. Cyclic organic sugars are a whole group of interesting compounds that are potential for application as pharmacological drugs. Polymers of the sugar glucose are abundant in the cells of the liver in humans.

, Interesting compounds include the insertion of silicon and germanium in the cyclic skeleton of organic compounds. Also these compounds can be used in the laboratory as organic bases and as potential solvents for the organic lab such as THF or Tetrahydrofuran. This is a well known solvent that is used extensively in the organic lab as solvent. However this solvent is difficult to handle due to its potential to form peroxides which can be potential explosives that can harm the chemist that is using them. Therefore handling THF usually requires the presence of a reducing agent in its solution in order to prevent its oxidation and form the peroxides.

, These compounds are similar to the benzene molecule in its chemical structure. Thus they are considered very stable compounds thermodynamically. Examples of such heterocyclic compounds include pyrrole and furan and thiophene in addition to the phosphor analogue that is called phosphole. All these compounds are considered aromatic compounds to a certain degree. There aromatic character will depend on the type of heteroatom that is attached to the ring.

, There is a whole branch of organic chemistry that deals with aromatic compounds and its chemistry. Chemistry of aromatic compounds is basically addition and substitution chemistry. In an analogous fashion heterocyclic organic compounds can undergo similar chemistry to that observed molecules that are benzene derivatives.

, The cyclization process of linear molecules that contain a heteroatom will depend on the size of the formed ring. There are in the organic chemical literature rules that are ascribed to a chemist that is called Baldwin and are called Baldwin's rules of cyclization of organic compounds. These are a collection of data that were collected based on kinetic measurements of the rate of cycles formation in compounds that have potential to cyclize. These rules are still valid nowadays and can be used as a reference for other cyclization reactions.

, Nitrogen containing heterocyclic organic compounds is of particular interest to the chemist due to its potential use precursors to natural products that can have application as drugs.

, For example, incorporating silicon atom in one of these rings can make this compound useful industrially in the electronics industry. Incorporating arsenium into the ring can make this compound a toxic compound. While incorporating phosphorus can lead to a completely different use of this compound such as the application in photodiodes of the molecule of phosphole.

Apply the acid wash to the surface of your aluminum.,
Scrub lightly with a soft abrasive, if needed.,
Rinse the acid away and dry the piece.,
Protect the aluminum from future damage by polishing it.,
Choose an appropriate acid.,
Pour your acid into water to dilute it.,
Keep the acid wash at room temperature.,
Use warm water and a degreaser to wash the aluminum surface.,
Choose a light abrasive for any needed scrubbing.,
Rinse and dry the piece thoroughly before the acid wash. Once you have washed and scrubbed the piece, it is ready for the acid wash. Rinse off any residues left behind by things such as detergent or baking soda.",How to Acid Wash Aluminum," This step will depend on the size of your piece and the stain you are trying to remove. If you have a stain that covers a large portion of the aluminum, it is often best to soak the piece in the acid for one to two hours. If you are removing a small stain or do not have a tank big enough for your piece to fit in, you can put your acid on a rag and rub gently back and forth.Do not go in a circular motion, as this can cause the aluminum to look uneven in the finished product.;
, If the stain does not come off easily with just acid, consider using salt or baking soda as a minimal abrasive. You can rub it in with a rag. Put as little force into the scrubbing as possible to minimize scratches on your aluminum surface. Sometimes, steel wool is used as a more serious abrasive. If you feel that you need to do this, you should look for the finest grade of steel wool that you can buy and be very gentle with it. Scratches in your aluminum will allow things to get stuck on even worse in the future.

, If you leave acid on your piece it can eventually damage the piece and cause pitting. Rinse the piece in room temperature (about 70 degrees Fahrenheit or 25 degrees Celsius) water. Once the acid is removed, simply dry the piece with a soft, clean towel., You can find an aluminum polish at your local home improvement store, or order one online. Apply the polish by rubbing it in a circular motion with a rag, and then removing it with another rag. Buff the surface with a clean rag to shine up your piece.Do not put aluminum polish on any surface that will come in contact with food or fire. It is flammable and toxic.

, Muriatic acid, otherwise known as hydrochloric acid, is a common choice for an acid wash. It is reasonably safe for the aluminum and fairly easy to come by. Keep in mind that this acid is very dangerous and should be kept away from pets and children. It is also toxic to the environment.Another approach is to make an acid solution from vinegar or cream of tartar and water. This is safer than using muriatic acid or other strong acids., It is very important that you do this correctly. When water and acid mix, a large amount of heat is generated. As long as you pour the acid into a container of water, the heat will be safely dispersed.Consult the label or manufacturer for dilution ratios of water to acid.


If you pour the water into the acid, the initial mixture is very concentrated acid, and it may get hot enough to flash boil, sending concentrated acid spewing out of the container. Pouring acid into water prevents this and protects you from flash boiling., Room temperature is ideal for the acid to remove grime and corrosion from your aluminum. This works out great if you have to scrub the piece, as dealing with very hot or very cold acid could be difficult. You should also be sure that the aluminum piece is at room temperature before attempting to clean it with acid.You can also boil a dilute acid solution (e.g. one tablespoon of vinegar in one quart of water) in a corroded pot or pan and then rinse and wipe it clean., The goal is to remove as much dirt and grime as possible. If you are trying to clean corrosion off of your aluminum piece, the acid will need to be able to reach the corrosion to do its job. Washing as many contaminants as possible from the piece prepares it for the acid wash., A little bit of scrubbing might be needed to remove things such as burnt on food. If this is the case, you want to use the softest method that will work. Baking soda rubbed with a rag is idea. Remember to use a back and forth motion rather than a circular motion to ensure an even look., Dry the aluminum surface with a soft rag to before exposing it to the acid solution."

Empty most of the Mountain Dew from the bottle.,
Snap open a glow stick.,
Add the contents of the glow stick to the Mountain Dew.,
Squirt in a little dish-washing liquid.,
Add 1 to 3 capfuls of hydrogen peroxide.,
Mix in a dash of baking soda.,
Seal the bottle and shake it up.,
Watch the glow.",How to Make Mountain Dew Glow1," Drink the soda or pour it into a glass, leaving only ¼-½"" (6-12mm) left inside the bottle.


Warmer temperatures tend to produce a stronger reaction, so for best results, leave the Mountain Dew out at room temperature for approximately 30 minutes before you begin. Do not use a bottle straight from the refrigerator.
There is nothing in the Mountain Dew that makes this reaction occur. People just like the bright yellow color of the soda, but any liquid will work. Try this experiment with any other brightly colored beverage or even just water.;
, Use sharp scissors or a sharp utility knife to open a standard size glow stick. Make sure that both compartments are open.


Work carefully with the blade so that you do not accidentally cut yourself.
As you cut open the glow stick, make sure that the fluid does not spill out onto your skin, clothes, or any other surfaces. You might want to work over a sink, bowl, or plastic mat, just to be on the safe side. You might also wear gloves.
Glow sticks usually have two separate compartments. In the first, there should be a pre-mixed solution of hydrogen peroxide and a fluorescent dye. In the second, there is a chemical known as diphenyl oxalate, which triggers the reaction with hydrogen peroxide and the dye. Both must be present in the Mountain Dew to produce a glow, just as both must be present in the glow stick to make the tube glow.
For the sake of color, try using a green glow stick instead of one in another color.

, Carefully pour the ingredients from both compartments into the Mountain Dew bottle, using up the entire glow stick.


Even though the Mountain Dew and glow stick fluid should produce a little glow, the fact that the glow stick fluid has now been diluted in the Mountain Dew will cause the brightness of the glow to be muted, as well. In order to produce a brighter glow, you will need to add a few more ingredients to the mix.

, Add a good squirt of standard liquid dish soap to the contents of the Mountain Dew bottle.


Use dish soaps without any dyes in them, as dyes will alter the color of the glow..
The dish-washing liquid enhances the luminosity of the glowing liquid simply by the way it reflects light. It will not be involved in the chemical reaction itself, but it can enhance the appearance.

, You need to drop hydrogen peroxide into the Mountain Dew to help produce a stronger glow. More peroxide will cause a brighter glow, while less will cause a more subtle glow.


Even though the glow stick fluid already contains hydrogen peroxide, adding more will create more of a reaction with the diphenyl oxalate inside the glow fluid. As a result, the glow fluid will become less diluted and produce a brighter effect.
If you use too much hydrogen peroxide (more than 3 capfuls) the chemical reaction that produces the glow will become overpowered by the saturation of hydrogen peroxide.

, The last ingredient you need for your Mountain Dew glow stick is ¼ tsp (1g) baking soda. Add this to the contents of the bottle, as well.


Baking soda energizes the reaction, even if it is not strictly essential for the glow effect.

, You might notice a slight glow from the glow stick fluid before you even shake the contents up, but after shaking it, the glow should be brighter and more evenly dispersed.


You do not need to shake the bottle for a long time. In fact, shaking it for 30 to 60 seconds should be plenty, and you should be able to tell once all the ingredients have combined if you shake it in a dark room.
The bottle should be sealed to keep the chemicals in contact with each other. If the liquid is poured out of the bottle, the glow will only last a couple of minutes.

, This is only a temporary reaction and may not last past an hour or two, but during that time, you should have a rather bright bottle of glowing Mountain Dew.


Once the glow starts to fade, you can get a little more life out of it by boiling a saucepan of water and quickly dunking the bottle into the boiling water for about 30 seconds.For standard glow sticks, this can give the fluid an extra 30 minutes of life. For your diluted Mountain Dew glow liquid, however, it may only give it another 10 minutes or so.

Pick out a highlighter.,
Pull out the ink-soaked sponge.,
Pour a little Mountain Dew out of the bottle.,
Place the ink in the soda.,
Seal the bottle and shake it up.,
Hold the Mountain Dew under a UV (ultraviolet) light, also known as a black light.,
Soak clear water beads in the glowing Mountain Dew for added fun.",How to Make Mountain Dew Glow2," For the sake of this experiment with Mountain Dew, a similar colored neon green or yellow highlighter will work best. You can use either a traditional highlighter or one of the liquid kinds.


Note that you can also use this same technique with water, and using water instead of Mountain Dew gives you more options in terms of color. For instance, with water, you can use pink or orange highlighters as well as green and yellow ones. Other colors, like blue and purple, tend not to create a very strong glow, however.

, Pry open the bottom seal of the highlighter using your hands, a utility knife, or a pair of skinny pliers. Once you take off the bottom and can see the ink-soaked sponge inside, carefully pick the sponge up out of the highlighter pen using a pair of tweezers.


If you use your fingers to pick out the highlighter ink sponge, your hands will get fluorescent ink all over them. That is why the use of tweezers or small needle-nose pliers is preferable.
If you opt to use a liquid highlighter, you will still need to remove the bottom, but you should not do anything with the liquid ink yet.

, Take a sip of the Mountain Dew or pour out about 1"" (2-3cm) from the top before you insert the ink-soaked sponge or liquid ink from the highlighter.


You only need to empty out a little of the liquid to provide enough space for the highlighter sponge or ink.
The additional highlighter component will displace some of the fluid and if you do not pour any out beforehand, you could face an overflow from the top of the bottle.

, Use your pliers to carefully lower the ink-soaked sponge into the bottle of Mountain Dew, submerging it completely under the soda.


If using a highlighter with a liquid compartment, simply pour the highlighter ink straight into the soda. Use a funnel only if necessary.

, At this point, the highlighter ink itself will glow, but in order to make the Mountain Dew glow, you need to disperse the ink throughout the soda. Shaking it thoroughly should accomplish this.


You can remove the label of the bottle in order to see the liquid more clearly.
If using liquid ink, you will probably only need to shake the bottle for 30 seconds or so. If using an ink-soaked sponge, you may need to shake it for a minute or more.

, You should be able to see a bright glow. This glow can also last for days to weeks, depending on how fluorescent the highlighter ink is.


In order to see the glow, the bottle will need to remain underneath a UV light.
It is not recommended that you hold onto this for long-term storage or display purposes, even if the glow appears to last past a week. Since the bottle and liquid are not sterilized, and since you are providing a porous surface (the ink-coated sponge), organic growth including bacteria and fungus can start to grow inside the bottle if left too long.
If you do want to use this method for a long-term decoration, you would be better off using distilled water instead of Mountain Dew. The distillation process removes most bacteria. , Soak them in the glowing Mountain Dew for 2 to 3 hours. The beads will absorb the glowing liquid and will glow themselves under a black light.These water beads are safe for children to play with if the highlighter was non-toxic.

Walk as much as you can.,
Take advantage of water buses.,
Invest in a vaporetto pass if you plan to be in Venice for several days and you want to travel by water bus frequently.,
Use traghetti to cross the Grand Canal.,
Stay in budget accommodations.,
Eat small, simple meals and avoid restaurants that cater to tourists.,
Take advantage of free or inexpensive sights.",How to Get Around Venice on the Cheap," Venice is a walking city, with streets that are built for pedestrians only. All you need is a good map, or a willingness to get lost as you wander.


Take advantage of a walking tour if you want to see historic sites with the help of a guide. The twisting, narrow streets of Venice might be frustrating and overwhelming if you have never been there before.;
, The vaporetto is the ferry that takes residents and visitors from bus stop to bus stop on the water.


Take a look at the schedules and times, which are posted all over the city. To get from one end of the Grand Canal (the train station) to the other end (San Marco), it will take 20 to 30 minutes. You can get on and off at different stops on the Grand Canal.
Consider what you get for the ticket price. A single trip costs 7 euros (around $8.70), but you will see beautiful sights along the canal such as St. Mark's basilica, Gothic palaces and restored Renaissance homes.

, You can get reduced prices depending on the number of trips you plan to take.


Buy passes at the train station, or any ticketing kiosk where you buy a regular one way vaporetto ticket.

, If you do not want to travel the length of the Grand Canal or search for a bridge, but you do want to get from one side to the other, take a traghetto. It takes about 1 minute and costs about 1 dollar.

, Most hotels, even economy hotels, have rooms that face a canal of some sort, even if it is not the Grand Canal. The further the hotel is from San Marco, the cheaper the price will likely be.


Consider staying in a hostel. Venice has several hostels that provide dormitory-style housing for travelers on a budget.
If you are staying in Venice for a longer period of time, consider looking for accommodation in the outlying suburbs, such as Mestre or Marghera. Rent is usually cheaper there, and you can easily reach Venice by train or by bus (the train ride from ""Venezia-Mestre"" to Venice proper takes about 10 minutes).

, Unlike other parts of Italy, Venice is not known for its food. Therefore, you should not spend a lot of money on eating while getting around Venice.


Try cicchetti, which is Italian-style tapas. You can order several small plates as snacks or meals. Include a glass of wine and you will still pay less than you would at a restaurant catering to tourists.
Look for pizza and paninis. These can often be purchased from a bar or a cafe for less than you would pay in a restaurant.
When looking for a restaurant or cafè, make sure it's not too close to the main tourist attractions. Food and drink prices are usually much higher around St Mark's Square and along the Strada Nova, that is, the main tourist route that connects the strain station to St Mark's Square.
Refill your water bottle at any of the 122 public fountains scattered throughout the city. The water from these fountains is safe to drink and completely free.

, For example, St. Mark's basilica is free to enter and you can also enjoy the energy of the piazza or take a stroll for no money.


Purchase a Venice museum pass. For 18 euros (about $23), you can visit 9 museums in Venice, including the Doge's Palace and the Glass Museum on the island of Murano.

Determine what you do and don't know.,
Plug your values into the formula C1V1 = C2V2.,
Account for any differences in units.,
Solve.,
Understand how to use your answer practically.",How to Dilute Solutions1," Performing a dilution in chemistry usually means taking a small amount of a solution whose concentration you know, then adding a neutral liquid (like water) to make a new solution with a larger volume but a lower concentration. This is done very frequently in chemistry labs, as, for efficiency's sake, reagents are often stored at relatively high concentrations which are then diluted for use in experiments. Usually, in most real-world situations, you will know the concentration of your starting solution and both the concentration and volume you want in your second solution, but not the volume of the first solution you need to use to get there.


However, in other situations (especially in schoolwork problems), you may need to find some other part of the puzzle - for instance, you may be given an initial volume and concentration, then asked to find the final concentration if you dilute the solution to a given volume. In the case of any dilution, it's helpful to take stock of known and unknown variables before beginning.
Let's tackle an example problem. Say that we're tasked with diluting a 5 M solution with water to make 1 liter (0.3 US gal) of a 1 mM solution. In this case, we know the concentration of the solution we're starting with and the target volume and concentration we want, but not how much of the initial solution we need to add water to to get there.

Reminder: In chemistry, M is a measure of concentration called Molarity, which indicates moles of a substance per liter.

;
, In this formula, C1 is the concentration of the starting solution, V1 is the volume of the starting solution, C2 is the concentration of the final solution, and V2 is the volume of the final solution. Plugging your known values into this equation should allow you to find the unknown value with a minimum of difficulty.


You may find it helpful to put a question mark in front of the unit you need to determine in order to help you solve for it.
Let's continue our example. We would plug our known values in as follows:

C1V1 = C2V2

(5 M)V1 = (1 mM)(1 L). Our two concentrations have different units. Let's stop here and proceed to the next step.



, Because dilutions involve changes in concentration (which can sometimes be quite large), it's not uncommon for two variables in your equation to be in different units. Though this is easily overlooked, mismatching units in your equation can cause your answer to be orders of magnitude off. Before solving, convert all values with differing concentration and/or volume units.


In our example, we use different units for concentration M (molar) and mM (millimolar). Let's convert our second measurement to M:

1 mM × 1 M/1,000 mM
= 0.001 M



, When all your units match, solve your equation. This almost always can be done with simple algebra.


We left our example problem here: (5 M)V1 = (1 mM)(1 L). Let's solve for V1 with our new units.

(5 M)V1 = (0.001 M)(1 L)
V1 = (0.001 M)(1 L)/(5 M).
V1 = 0.0002 L., or 0.2 mL.




, Let's say you have found your missing value, but you're unsure of how to apply this new information to a real-world dilution you need to perform. This is understandable - the language of math and science sometimes doesn't lend itself to the real world. When you know all four values in the equation C1V1 = C2V2, perform your dilution as follows:


Measure the volume V1 of the solution with concentration C1. Then, add enough diluting liquid (water, etc.) to make a total volume V2. This new solution will have your desired concentration (C2).
In our example, for instance, we would first measure 0.2 mL of our 5 M solution. Next, we would add enough water to increase the volume of the solution to 1 L: 1 L - 0.0002 L = 0.9998 L, or 999.8 mL. In other words, we would add 999.8 mL of water to our tiny sample of solution. Our new, diluted solution has a concentration of 1 mM, which is what we wanted in the first place.

Read any packaging for information.,
Add the substance acting as the dilute to the concentrated solution.,
Ignore the volume of powders in most cases.",How to Dilute Solutions2," There are a wide variety of reasons why you might want to make a dilution at home, in the kitchen, or in another non-chemistry lab setting. For instance, the simple act of making orange juice from concentrate is a dilution. In many cases, products that need to be diluted include information about the dilution that needs to be made somewhere on the packaging. They may even have precise directions to follow. Here are some things to look for when searching for information:


The volume of the product to use
The volume of the diluting liquid to use
The type of diluting liquid to be used (usually water)
Special mixing instructions
You probably won't see information about the precise concentrations of the liquids being used. This information is superfluous to the average consumer.

, For simple household dilutions, such as the ones you might make in the kitchen, you only really need to know the volume of concentrate you're using and the approximate final concentration you'd like before beginning. Dilute the concentrate with an appropriate amount of diluting liquid, which is determined relative to the initial volume of concentrate being used. See below:


For example, if we want to dilute 1 cup of concentrated orange juice to 1/4 its initial concentration, we would add 3 cups of water to the concentrate. Our final mixture would have 1 cup of concentrate in 4 cups of total liquid - 1/4 its initial concentration.
Here's a more complex example: If we wanted to dilute 2/3 cup of concentrate to 1/4 its initial concentration, we would add 2 cups of water, because 2/3 cup is 1/4th of 2&2/3 cups total liquid.
Be sure to add your substances to a vessel that's big enough to accommodate the final volume you want - a large bowl or similar container.

, Adding powders (like certain drink mixes) to liquids usually doesn't need to be though of as a ""dilution."" The volume change created by the addition of a small amount of powder to a liquid is usually small enough that it can be effectively ignored. In other words, when adding small amounts of powder to a liquid, just add the powder to the final volume of liquid you want and mix.

, In case you have an opportunity to travel to another country where Schenghen visa approval rates are higher, your chances for receiving a longer stay visa rise significantly. No one prohibits you from getting a visa in another country and there’s no need to be a citizen or resident. For example, it is known that France issues longer visas valid for 1-5 years (though, you are still not allowed to stay longer than 90 days in half a year, but your visa is valid for 1 to 5 years. No need to make visa runs each other month) for Moscow and St. Petersburg applicants.

Adjust your alkalinity accordingly.,
Test your water's pH.,
Adjust your water's pH.,
Retest your water's total alkalinity and pH.",How to Add Hot Tub Chemicals1," You may even want to repeat this twice per week. The goal is to establish how alkaline your water is. This needs to stay between 80 and 120ppm. This will help your hot tub resist pH changes.Use testing strips from your local pool and hot tub maintenance store to test your water. These strips can be submerged for as little as 15 seconds and provide you an accurate reading of your water's total alkalinity. These strips will change color according to your water's alkalinity. Match that color to the label to identify your water's alkalinity level.;
, Although 60-180ppm is acceptable,you want your water's alkalinity to stay between 80 and 120ppm. Too low and your water may become too acidic. Too high and your water may feel soapy. Use pH increaser to raise the alkalinity and pH decreaser to lower your alkalinity.


Different pH increaser and pH decreaser kits work differently. Some are liquid and others are powder. Most adjust pH and alkalinity concurrently. For this application, use one that adjusts both pH and alkalinity together. Follow the directions on the packaging carefully. The chemicals are powerful and you want all of them to go into the water. Be careful if there is high wind and you are using powder.
Give your water time to settle. It may take a few hours for the chemicals to disperse throughout your system. Your system should stay on during this process as normal.

, Although low pH means your water is acidic and high pH means your water is alkaline, be sure to adjust your water's alkalinity independently of your water's pH. Quite often, adjusting the alkalinity will bring the pH into the normal range of 7.2 to 7.6 but this may not always be the case.Low pH will cause corrosion while high pH will case scale formation.

, If you must adjust your pH be careful to not adversely affect your total alkalinity. If your total alkalinity is already adjusted properly, your water will already resist changes to pH.Both pH increase and pH decrease will impact both pH and total alkalinity.


If you already have relatively high total alkalinity (e.g., close to 120ppm) try using a pH increase that is explicitly designed to increase pH but not increase alkalinity.
Give your water time to settle. It may take a few hours for the chemicals to disperse throughout your system. Your system should stay on during this process as normal.
If you are only worried about pH, you can retest your pH after half an hour., After your water has settled, retest both total alkalinity and pH. Hopefully everything will be within the normal ranges. Try to stay in the 80-120ppm for total alkalinity and 7.2-7.6 pH ranges for best operation.


It is generally better to stay in the high end of the range.This is because the consequence of high total alkalinity and high pH is scale build up which is preferred over acid corrosion. Build up you can clean off but corrosion will require repairs.

Learn the vocabulary.,
Learn how concentration is written.",How to Calculate the Concentration of a Solution1," Concentration is a ratio comparing the amount of one substance to the amount of the entire mixture. For instance, if you plan to mix sugar and vinegar together for an experiment, you'll need to calculate the concentration of sugar in the mixture. Here's how each ingredient would be described in the chemistry report:


The sugar is the solute, which is the substance being dissolved. You are measuring the concentration of the solute.
The vinegar is the solvent, which is the substance you are dissolving something in.
After you mix them together, you end up with a solution. To calculate the concentration, you'll need to the total amount of the solution, which you can get by adding the solute and solvent quantities together.
If you forget which is the solute and which the solvent, remember this example. Sugar and solute both contain the letter U, while vinegar and solvent both contain the letter V.;
, Since there are different ways for expressing the ""amount"" of a given substance, there's more than one way to write a concentration. Here are the most common ways:Grams per liter (g/L.) Simply the mass of a solute in grams dissolved in a given volume of solution. Usually used for solutions made from solid solutes and liquid solvents, like our sugar and vinegar example.

Molarity (M.) The number of moles of a solute divided by the volume of the solution. A mole is a unit often used in chemistry to describe the number of atoms or molecules of a substance.

Parts per million (ppm.) The number of units (usually grams or milligrams) of a solute found in one million units of the solution. Usually used for very dilute water solutions.

Percent composition. The number of parts (again, usually grams) of solute found in one hundred parts of solution. The percent symbol % means ""out of 100"" so you can easily write the fraction as a percentage.

Measure the calcium hardness of your water when cool.,
Add hardness increaser to low calcium water.,
Remove hard water if too much calcium is present.If you have too much calcium in your water there is only one way to get rid of it.,
Add soft water to balance calcium hardness.,
Adjust pH and total alkalinity.,
Adjust the calcium hardness of your water when cool.",How to Add Hot Tub Chemicals2," Turn off your heater and let your water cool. Then test your how much calcium exists in your water (i.e., calcium hardness). Too much calcium will cause calcium deposits on your hot tub's walls and heater. Too little and your water will literally pull the calcium from the tub's walls and components.Use water hardness test stripsto determine if your water is appropriately hard. These test strips work much the same as pH and total alkalinity test strips.

, You want your calcium level to be between 200 and 400ppm.This range will keep your hot tub's internal components protected from calcium corrosion and build up. This is particularly important if your hot tub includes tile and grout which may lose their integrity as a result of calcium corrosion.


Be careful with using calcium booster as calcium booster will affect your pH and total alkalinity balancing products. , Drain 6-12 inches of water from your hot tub or spa. This is a big change to your spa system as this could impact your total alkalinity and pH balances. Unfortunately, if you need to lower your calcium level, this is the only way to do so.


Don't be conservative. If your calcium levels are still too high after new water is added you will need to repeat this procedure.

, You want to add soft water with low calcium levels to balance the calcium level. Test the water you are going to put into the hot tub before doing so. Ensure that water has low calcium. If it does not have low calcium, find another source. Fill your hot tub to the original water level.

, After you have adjusted the calcium level in your system, wait 2-3 days,with the system running and warming up, before testing total alkalinity and pH. This allows the water to normalize following the increase or decrease of calcium levels. Follow the aforementioned instructions for adjusting total alkalinity and pH before testing the calcium levels.


This is particularly important if you drained water from the hot tub and replaced it with new water. That new water could have raised or lowered your total alkalinity or pH.

, After the total alkalinity and pH have been adjusted let your water cool down. Then measure the calcium in the water. If your water is still too hard, repeat the drain, refill, and readjusting of total alkalinity and pH. If it is too soft, add hardness booster.


Each time you adjust the calcium you need to wait 2-3 days before retestingso try to make each adjustment as accurately as possible.

Measure the bromine level of your water.,
Open your floating bromine dispenser by unscrewing the cap on the bottom.,
Fill bromine dispenser with bromine tablets.,
Adjust the water flow to the tablets.,
Submerge the dispenser to eliminate air bubbles mixing with pellets.,
Shock your water weekly.Bromine dispensers require regular shocks to function properly.The shocking process activates your bromine pellets.",How to Add Hot Tub Chemicals3," Bromine can be used instead of chlorine to sanitize hot tub water. Use bromine test strips from your local hot tub and pool store to test the bromine level in your water. You want your bromine levels to stay between 4 and 6ppm. If they are dropping below that, you will need to refill your floating bromine dispenser or create a bromine reserve.


Bromine is similar to chlorine but is not UV resistant.It breaks down faster than chlorine in the sunlight. You should keep your hot tub covered when not shocking or in use if you use a bromine sanitation system.
If you have not used bromine before, you will need to establish a bromine reserve.Establishing the reserve will differ depending on the type of bromine you are using. Follow the directions on the container for initially adding bromine to your hot tub. This will include a round of shock treatments and may take a while. Do not enter the tub until the bromine levels are below 10ppm., The floating bromine dispenser will be on the surface of the water and easy to find. Pull it from the water and let it drain. Turn the container upside down. Shake the container gently to let the bromine tablets settle. Unscrew the lid.


Be careful not to spill the tablets or get any of the water in your eyes or on your skin. Flush your skin with fresh water to avoid any potential chemical burns from high concentration bromine contact. This is particularly true if you have recently shocked the tub as the oxidizer activates bromine ions and increases their concentration.

, You may keep the used bromine tablets in the dispenser and refill with new tablets.Once you have filled the floating dispenser with tablets, close the dispenser. You do not need to worry about filling the container too full so long as the lid goes back on properly. The water flow adjustment takes care of how much dispensing will occur.

, You may need to adjust the water flow on the dispenser. Test your bromine levels regularly until you are familiar with how much water flow is needed to maintain your bromine level of 4-6ppm.When you know you have the right flow level, tighten the lock ring accordingly to keep the flow level from accidentally self-adjusting.


This is especially true if you increased the water flow to accommodate low bromine levels rather than refill the bromine dispenser at any time.

, Push the dispenser, upside down, arm's length into the water just to provide more pressure on the air bubbles to escape. Air bubbles between the tablets will cause the dispenser to work less effectively. Once all the air bubble are gone, turn the dispenser upright and allow it to float on top of the water.

, When you shock your water, bromine levels will spike as the shock treatment acts on the bromine tablets to release more bromine ions. Wait until bromine levels are below 10ppmbefore entering the hot tub.

Completely remove the hot tub cover.,
Adjust the total alkalinity and pH of the water.The total alkalinity and pH levels will have an impact on the effectiveness of the oxidizer.,
Turn your hot tub jets off.,
Measure out the appropriate amount of oxidizer.Each type of oxidizer is different.,
Disperse the oxidizer carefully.,
Wait for the oxidizer to have its intended effect.",How to Add Hot Tub Chemicals4," Shocking your water requires proper ventilation. Your water will need air to breath. Go ahead and take the whole cover off and move it away. The chemicals and fumes can be hazardous to so its best for everyone to stay away. Let everyone know not to go into the hot tub until you sure its safe.

, You don't need to worry about water hardness at this point because that takes a lot more time to deal with. Focus on total alkalinity and pH levels. They will have the most impact on the shock's effectiveness.

, Although the jets will mix the oxidizer with the water quickly, they should be turned off. The jets will actually cause the oxidizer to work less effectively. This happens because the oxidizer will evaporate too quickly the more air is mixed into the water. Leaving the jets off lets the oxidizer distribute naturally in the water.

, You will need to consult your package on the proper use of the oxidizer. If a lot of water has evaporated, bring the level back up to its normal level before shocking. Too much shock treatment can damage your hot tub.


If you are measuring strong chemicals like lithium chlorine by the tablespoon, consider using a dedicated measuring container. Even if you use a tablespoon from the kitchen, make sure its a cheap one and leave it with the hot tub supplies.

, This will depend on the type of oxidizer you choose to use. Follow the directions on the box closely as the oxidizer may cause chemical burns if not handled properly. Both liquids, tablets, and powders should be placed into the water as close to the water's surface as possible. Splashing can be very harmful especially to your eyes.


You may want to limit your shock treatments to times when no one is around. This way your child doesn't trip you while you are measuring out chemicals causing you to spill them on the their face. This also keeps people from nagging you about when the hot tub will be ready.

, Ideally you would want to shock the tub in the evening so that you could let it sit overnight.Check the total alkalinity, pH, and bromine levels before entering the tub. These can be greatly affected by shock cycle. Adjust total alkalinity and pH accordingly. Wait until bromine levels drop below 10ppm before entering.

Understand this method.,
Convert the solute measurements to grams.,
Convert the solvent measurement to liters.,
Divide the solvent by the solute.,
Adjust the formula for large amounts of solute.",How to Calculate the Concentration of a Solution2," This is a useful way to measure concentration when you're dissolving a solid into a liquid, and when you're talking about solutions that involve human scale measurements. If the solute is much less than a gram or the solvent is much less than a liter, you'll probably want to use one of the other methods instead.



Example problem: Find the concentration (in grams per liter) of a solution made by dissolving 3 mL of table salt in 2000 mL of water. Write the answer in the form of grams / liter.

, If your solute (the substance dissolved into the larger container) is already measured in grams, skip to the next step. Otherwise, you'll need to convert it. Converting from other units of mass (such as the kilogram) should be simple if you look up the conversion rate, but converting from volume units (such as the liter) is more complicated. Each substance has a density which determines how much mass can fit into a certain volume. Look up this density and multiply it by your volume measurement to get the measurement in grams, after making sure your units match.


In our example, the salt is the solute. It is measured in a unit of volume (mL), so we'll need to convert it to grams.
The density of table salt is 1.15 g/mL.If this information is not included with the problem, you may need to look it up in your textbook or a database of chemical substances. We need to make sure to find the density in the units we are using (grams per mL), or convert it to the right unit.
To find the mass of salt in 3 mL, calculate 3 mL x (1.15 grams / 1 mL) = 3.45 grams salt.

, The solvent should just about always be measured in a unit of volume already so conversion is pretty simple. If it's already written in liters, skip to the next step.


In our example, we have 2000 mL of water. We'll need to convert this to liters.
There are 1000 mL per liter, so convert by calculating (1 L / 1000 mL) x (2000 mL) = 2 liters of water.
Note that we arranged the conversion so that the mL units canceled out (one on top, one on bottom). If we had written it as 1000 mL / 1 L x 2000 mL we would end up with a nonsense result.

, Now that we have the gram measurement of the solute and the liter measurement of the solvent, calculating the g/L concentration is as easy as dividing:


In our example, 3.45 grams of salt / 2 liters of water = 1.725 g/L salt concentration.

, Technically, we should calculate the concentration using the volume of the entire solution, meaning the solvent and solute volumes added together. When dissolving a small amount of a solid into a large amount of liquid, this rarely makes much of a difference, so you can safely ignore the solute and just use the volume of the solvent, like we did above. If the solute volume is enough to visibly change the volume, you'll need to change the formula to (g of solute) / (L of solute + L of solvent).


In our example, 3.45 grams of salt / (2 liters of water + 0.003 L salt) = 1.722 g/L.
The difference between this and our previous answer is 0.003 g/L. This is a tiny difference, most likely smaller than the accuracy of our measurement tools.

Understand the method.,
Convert the measurements to grams.,
Calculate the percent composition.,
Calculate parts per million.",How to Calculate the Concentration of a Solution3," Use this method if you're asked to find the ""percent composition"" or ""weight percent.""In chemistry, you are most often interested in the mass of a substance. Once you know how the masses of the solute and the solvent, you can find the percentage of the solute fairly easily by comparing the two amounts.



Example problem: 10 grams of chocolate powder are dissolved in 1.2 Liters of hot water. First, calculate what percentage of the solution is chocolate. Then write the result in parts per million.

, If any measurements you are given are written in volume measurements (such as liters or milliliters), you'll need to convert them to a unit of mass: grams. Because each substance has a certain density (mass per volume), you'll need to find out the specific characteristics of the substance before you can do this:


Look up the density of the substance in your textbook or online. Convert the density so it is written in grams per (the unit of volume used in the problem), if it isn't already. Multiply the density by the volume of the substance and you'll have the mass in grams.

Example: You have 1.2 Liters of water. The density of water is 1000 grams per liter, so calculate (1000 g / 1 L) x 1.2 L = 1200 grams.
Since our solute, the chocolate, is already measured in grams, we don't need to convert it.

, Once you have the mass of the solute and the mass of the solvent, both in grams, use this formula to calculate the percent composition: (grams of solute (in g) / (grams of solute + grams of solvent)) x 100.


We have 10 grams of chocolate, and we figured out that there are 1200 grams of water. The entire solution (solute + solvent) has a mass of 10 + 1200 = 1210 grams.
The concentration of the chocolate in the entire solution = (10 grams chocolate) / (1210 grams solution) = 0.00826
Multiply this by 100 to get the percentage: 0.00826 x 100 = 0.826, so the mixture is 0.826% chocolate.

, Percentage is really ""parts per hundred"" so parts per million is calculated a very similar way. The formula is (grams of solute (in g) / (grams of solute + grams of solvent)) x 1,000,000. In scientific notation, this is written (grams of solute (in g) / (grams of solute + grams of solvent)) x 106.


In our example, (10 grams chocolate) / (1210 grams solution) = 0.00826.
0.00826 x 106 = 8260 parts per million chocolate.
Normally, parts per million is used to measure much smaller concentrations, which are less convenient to write as percentages. We're just using the same example here for convenience.

Know what you need for this method.,
Calculate the molar mass of the solute.,
Calculate the amount of solute in moles.,
Divide by the liter measurement of the solution to find the molarity.",How to Calculate the Concentration of a Solution4," Molarity requires you to know how many moles there are of your solute, but these can be easily derived if you know the mass of your solute and its chemical formula. If you do not have all this information, or if you've never been taught the concept of ""mole"" in a chemistry context, use a different method instead.


Example problem: What is the molarity of a solution created by dissolving 25 grams of potassium hydroxide in 400 mL of water?
If the solute is measured in units other than grams, you'll need to convert to grams first.

, Each chemical element has a known ""molar mass"" (MM), which is the mass contained in one mole of that element. These molar masses have the same value as the atomic mass displayed on the periodic table, generally under the chemical symbol and name of each element. Simply add the molar masses of the solute's component elements to figure out the solute's molar mass.


Our example uses potassium hydroxide as the solute. Look this substance up in your textbook or in an online chemical formula database to find the chemical formula: KOH.
Use a periodic table or online resource to find the atomic mass of the element: K = 39.0, O = 16.0, H = 1.0.
Add the atomic masses together and write ""g/mol"" after it to get the molar mass. 39 + 16 + 1 = 56 g/mol.
For molecules with more than one of the same atom, add the atomic mass once for each atom. For example, H2O has a molar mass of 1 + 1 + 16 = 18 g/mol.

, Once you have the molar mass (g/mol), you can convert between grams and moles. You already know the amount of solutes in grams, so convert by calculating (solute mass in grams) x (1 / molar mass) to get the answer in moles.


In our example, since we have 25 grams of a substance with a molar mass of 56 g/mol, we calculate 25g x (1 / 56g/mol) = approximately 0.45 moles KOH in our solution.

, Molarity is defined as the ratio of moles of the solute to liters of the solution. Convert the solution's volume measurement to liters if necessary, then do the calculation.


In our example, we have 400 mL of water, which we can convert to 0.4 liters.
The molarity of the KOH in the solution is 0.45 mol / 0.4L = 1.125 M (molarity). (You'll get a slightly more accurate answer if you use a calculator and don't round any numbers until the final step.)
You can usually disregard the volume of the solute, since it rarely makes a big difference. If you are adding enough solute to visibly change the volume, measure the volume of the final solution and use that instead.

Know when a titration is appropriate.,
Set up your titration equipment.,
Fill your flask and burette.,
Begin the titration.,
Slow your titration.,
Calculate the amount of solute in your solution.,
Calculate your solution's concentration.",How to Calculate the Concentration of a Solution5," A titration is a technique used by chemists to calculate the amount of solute present in a solution. To perform a titration, you create a chemical reaction between your solute and another reactant (usually also dissolved in a liquid solution.) Because you know the precise amount of your second reactant and you know the chemical equation for the reaction between it and your solute, you can calculate the amount of your solute by measuring how much reactant you need to add before the reaction with your solute completes.


Thus, titrations can be very useful for calculating the concentration of a solution when you don't know how much solute was initially added.

If you already know how much solute is in the solution, you don't need to titrate - simply measure the volume of your solution and calculate concentration as in Part One.

, Accurate titrations require clean, precise, professional-grade chemical equipment. Set up a titration area with an Erlenmeyer flask or beaker underneath a calibrated burette affixed to a burette stand. The tip of the burette should be in the neck of the flask or beaker without touching any sides.


Make sure all equipment has been previously cleaned, rinsed with deionized water, and allowed to dry.

, Precisely measure a small quantity of your unknown-concentration solution. When your solute dissolves, it spreads evenly throughout the solution, so the concentration of this small sample will be the same as the original solution. Fill your burette with a solution of known concentration that will react with your solution. Record the exact volume of the solution in the burette - you will subtract the final volume to find the total solution used in the reaction.



Note: if the reaction between the solution in the burette and the solute of unknown concentration in the flask doesn't show any visual signs of reaction, you'll need to add an indicator to your flask. In chemistry, indicators are chemicals that give a visual a solution when a reaction reaches its equivalence point or end point. Indicators are commonly used for titrations involving acid-base and redox reactions, but a wide variety of other indicators exist. Consult a chemistry textbook or an online guide to find an appropriate indicator for your reaction.

, Gradually add solution from the burette (called ""titrant"") to the flask. Use a magnetic stirrer or a glass rod to gently mix the solutions as they react. If your solutions react visibly, you should see signs of their reaction - color change, bubbles, products formed, etc. If you're using an indicator, you may still see flashes of color as each drop from the burette enters the flask.


If your reaction results in a change in pH or potential, you can insert pH readers or potentiometers into the flask to monitor the reaction's progress.
For a more precise titration, monitor the pH or potential as above, recording the reading after adding small set amounts of titrant. Graph your solution's pH or potential against the volume of titrant added. You'll get sharp changes in the slope of the curve at the reaction's equivalence points.

, As your reaction approaches its endpoint, slow your titration to a drop-by-drop pace. If you're using an indicator, you may notice the flashes of color it gives are persisting for longer. Proceed as slowly as possible until you reach the exact drop that causes your reaction to reach its endpoint. For indicators, you will generally look for the earliest possible persistent color change in your reaction.


Record the final volume in your burette. By subtracting this from your initial burette volume, you can find the precise volume of titrant you used.

, Use the chemical equation for the reactant between your titrant and your solution to find the moles of solute in your flask. Once you've found the moles of solute, you can simply divide by the volume of solution in the flask to find the molarity of the solution, or convert moles to grams and divide by the volume of the solution to find the concentration in g/L. This will require a basic understanding of Stoichiometry.


For example, let's say that we used 25 mL of .5 M NaOH to titrate a solution of HCl and water to its equivalence point. The HCl solution had a volume of 60 mL before titration. How many moles of HCl are in our solution?
To start, let's look at the chemical equation for the reaction of NaOH and HCl: NaOH + HCl > H2O + NaCl

In this case, one molecule of NaOH reacts with one molecule of HCl to create the products (water and NaCl.) So, since you added just enough NaOH to neutralize all of the HCl, the number of moles of NaOH consumed in the reaction will equal the number of moles of HCl in the flask.
So, let's find the amount of NaOH in moles. 25 mL NaOH = .025 L NaOH x (.5 moles NaOH/1 L) = .0125 moles NaOH.

Since we deduced from the reaction equation that the moles of NaOH consumed = the moles of HCl in the solution, we know that we have .0125 moles HCl in solution.

, Now that you know the amount of solute in your solution, it's easy to find your concentration in terms of molarity. Simply divide the moles of solute in your solution by the volume of your solution sample (not the volume of the larger source you took your sample from.) The result is the molarity of your solution!


To find molarity for our example above, simply divide the moles of HCl by the volume in the flask. .0125 moles HCl x (1/.060 L) = .208 M HCl.

To convert molarity to g/L, ppm, or percent composition, you'll need to convert the moles of your solute to a mass (using the molar mass of your solute compound.) For ppm and percent composition, you'll also need to convert the volume of your solution to a mass (using a conversion factor such as density or by simply weighing it.), then multiply the result by 106 or 102, respectively.

If you have pets, plants, or will need your mail checked for an extended amount of time, ensure that a friend or family member will be there to do so. This will ultimately offer you peace of mind so you can relax and fully enjoy your vacation.

Choose you travel companions wisely.,
Pack effectively.,
Sit down with your traveling companions and make a general outline of where you want to go.,
Find people you know in the places you're visiting and see if you can stay with them.,
When in a new city it’s important to get a taste of the local fair (deli in New York, deep dish in Chicago, BBQ in Kansas City) but eating out three times a day can get extremely expensive.,
Get lost.",How to Do a United States Road Trip on a Budget," Relatives and lifelong friends are best. It would put you in a tough spot if you realized you didn’t like the person you are traveling with; or she/he turned out to be some sort of wacko.;
, Depending on what sort of vehicle you're taking, that will affect what you can bring. Things you will definitely need:


A Reliable Car
Smart Phone - might save a lot of money on many occasions. Groupon deals at restaurant, reliable directions, entertainment in the car, contacting friends on the road. The list goes on forever.
A Tent. A tent will be very useful if you have nowhere to sleep and can’t afford a hotel; just pitch that bad boy anywhere to catch some sleep.
Clothes, you will need less than you think; go prepared for any weather. Bring something waterproof, something warm something comfortable. Bring waterproof shoes, sneakers and something a little formal just in case.
Cooler, Camping stove; these items will save you a ton of money having canned, freeze dried and prepared goods will enable you to not eat out every meal.

, Start with a direction; depending on what time of year it is this will come into play. You don’t want to be at Mount Rushmore in January or New Orleans in August. Then come to a conclusion on where you want to go (cities, National parks, monuments, etc). Map your course out in an atlas; this will also help you create a timeline.

, Lodging can be the most expensive part of a road trip so staying with friends can save you a lot of money. Hostels are an inexpensive alternative to hotels if you don’t mind roughing it a little. There are websites like couchsurfing.org in which people allow traveler to spend the night at their house. Be sure to bring a tent; camping is fun and free most of the time: also when camping at national parks (Yellow Stone, Grand Canyon, Mount Rushmore etc.) having that tent will really pay off because hotels are very expensive around these areas.

, So be prepared for an impromptu meal, have your cooler packed with peanut butter and jelly, canned tuna, ramen noodles etc. This will save you at least twenty-five dollars a day and make the meals you day eat at restaurants all the more enjoyable.

, Getting out there and finding new places and tuning out of your world at home can be the most important part of your road trip.

Book Early.,
Do Your Research Online.,
Take a Camera.,
Check the Carnival Dates and Book Your tickets.,
Learn the Language.",How to Find the Finest in All Inclusive Travel to Jamaica," If you will want to plan your travel trip to Jamaica in the summertime, then it is advised that you will have your vacation booked a few months earlier. Why? Well, you are not the only one that will want to spend some free time in the summer time with his wife or girlfriend and you might end up seeing that there are no sweet places for you to visit, because the offers with the best travel deals have been sold.;
, Also, if you want to save money, you will need to invest time into a lot of research. Most of the times, you will see that the most popular airlines websites will pop up after you will have delved into performing a search for all-inclusive travel on Google, but if you will also turn the page and analyze the results that are on the next 3 or 4 pages, you will realize that there are practically better offers that you can take advantage of. Depending on the travelling package that you will delve into, you will probably be able to also have accommodation included with your flight ticket, yet this is rare.

, First, when you are going into a vacation, you will not just want to delve into it without having a camera. With it, you will always be able to immortalize the places that you have visited and also take some exclusive travel pictures with the locals. If you have a camera, then that is better, for you will be able to record the places, which is much better than having a still photo that pretty much doesn’t say anything vivid.

, You will definitely not want to miss the yearly Jamaica Carnival. You need to know that it might be hard to book convenient travel deals to the country just before the dates, so do your research and stay close to the attractions. You will possibly need to buy extra tickets for different events, and doing it online with a travel agent can save you a lot of money.

, Last but not least, when you will delve into traveling to Jamaica, it is recommended that you will also learn a bit of the Jamaican language. This way, you will understand their culture better and you will not have to ask someone else to buy something for you or order something for you, just because you cannot speak Jamaican.

Go to Disney's Animal Kingdom.,
Stay at the Giraffe Manor in Kenya.,
Try a vacation in Botswana, South Africa.,
Take a trip to Australia.,
Volunteer at animal rescues.",How to Choose a Vacation Destination for Animal Lovers1," Disney's Animal Kingdom is found in Orlando, Florida. It's an African-themed animal preserve where you can see exotic animals like giraffes and elephants. You can go on a safari while at the park, allowing you to see the animals up close.As Disney World has a lot of different attractions, this can be a great option if you're booking a vacation with multiple people. Those who aren't huge animal lovers can spend time elsewhere.;
, If it's within your budget, try booking a trip to Kenya and staying at the Giraffe Manor. This is a private hotel set on 12 acres of land. Giraffes frequently visit the area. Sometimes, they even poke their heads through windows in hopes of getting a treat from guests.Check with workers at the hotel before feeding the giraffes. You want to make sure you're not giving them anything harmful.

, Each year, zebras migrate to the Boteti River in Botswana. If you visit the area around the time a migration is likely to occur, you will see a lot of zebras swarming to the river. This can be a fun vacation if you love observing wildlife., Australia has a lot of wildlife you are unlikely to see elsewhere. About 80% of the wildlife found in Australia is only found there.

Go to the popular singers' concerts.,
Know the prices.","How to Enjoy a Trip to Nakhchivan, Azerbaijan"," You may have to go due to work or personal commitments, or you may choose to visit this the city, either, you can enjoy your trip. In contrast to its history, Nakhchivan is a small city with few places to visit. This means commonly, even four days can be enough for traveling there. Try to plan everything in no more than five days, so you won't get bored.


Know the distance between your location to the destination. Research how much time it will take to arrive in the city, and estimate how much time you need to arrive at hotel, get some rest and etc. This way, you'll know how much time will it take for you to visit all over the city.;
, There are several good hotels in Nakhchivan such as Duzdag hotel, the Tabriz hotel, and the Grand Hotel. Research the prices and the facilities, and then make a choice.


For example, some people prefer the Duzdag hotel because it's newly built. Some others prefer Tabriz hotel because it's located in the center of the city. Research all of them and compare them to your expectations. Book the hotel that suits you best.

, In Nakhchivan, English is not a commonly used language, even hotel staff hardly know English. If you speak another language than English, but not one used in Nakhchivan, install the translation software that will be the easiest for you to use.


Most of the tourists in Nakhchivan are Azeris from Iran, Baku and Turkey. That's why people there know several languages including Azerbaijani, Turkish and Farsi, but not English. This doesn't mean that utterly no one there knows English. There might be people who understand a little English, but can't speak it fluently.
To not come across with any problem, especially when paying for taxis and hotel services, make sure to translate everything.

, The most important spectacular of Nakhchivan is The Mausoleum of Momine Khatun which is an octagonal tower and to a large extent is the iconic symbol of the city. This Mausoleum is one of the most famous spectacles in Azerbaijan. The 26-meter tower is fully made of brick and is features by turquoise tiles with texts in Kufic. It was nominated for the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites in 1998.

, After The Mausoleum of Momine Khatun, the most important attraction of the city and perhaps, the most exciting one is The Aṣḥāb-e Kahf Cave. There, Noah's Ark has been shattered and The Seven Sleepers have slept.


The Seven Sleepers story is about seven youths who hid inside of a cave and slept for 309 years. When they woke up, they found out that the world has been changed a lot. Əshabi-kəhf ziyarətgahı in Nakhchivan is the place (the cave) which have been told they slept there. That's why the place is a sanctuary for Azeris and other believers (mostly Muslims).
The place is full of beautiful and pure fountains which is also holy for Azeris. There are several caves which can be accessed by staircases. It is located 18 km far away from the city, at the end of a narrow road which is separated from the main road. At the beginning of the main road, there's a great white monument with pink bases made of cement and the ""Əshabi-kəhf ziyarətgahı"" is written on it.
If you have children with you, be careful with the rough cliffs and rocks. Make sure you are all wearing appropriate footwear.
You can also bring rock climbing facilities, as there are several beautiful places for this sport.
There are several cafes at the beginning of the path. That way, you can have some tea or coffee to give you energy for the staircases.
Some locals wear scarves when going to the main cave. These are available for free in some wardrobes on the path, but it's not a must.

, It's located in Ehsan Khan's Palace. (Ehsan Khan was the King of Nakhchivan in the eighteenth century). The Palace has been rebuilt since then, and this museum is ideal to identify and recognize the four basic styles of Azerbaijani carpets. Additionally, different kinds of rugs, Soumaks and Palases are exhibited in the museum.

, Twin mosques of Hazrati Zahra, with the modern architecture, are designed in pale yellow brick. It has a big dome made of metal which is very similar to a boiler. Because the investors of this construction were Iranians, this mosque is also well-known as The Iranian Mosque.

, Join others there and make new friends. You might meet many other tourists from Baku, Iran and Turkey. Don't be afraid of communicating and making new friends. The tourists are all fun and open to meeting new fellow travellers from around the world. Share your experiences and let them share theirs with you. Try to learn from their experiences. Ask them about the most beautiful places of the city. If you stay in the same hotel with them, go to the club, pool, gym or whatever you like with them. You might like to play some billiards with a new friend.


Make sure you don't act awkward, creepy, or push the strangers to do something if they make it clear they are uncomfortable.

, There are several entertainments in the good hotels such as carting, clubs, different types of pools, gyms, wide sport fields, etc. Try every entertainment of your hotel at least once. Don't be afraid of trying new experiences.


Since there are many Iranian tourists, hotel clubs might mostly play Iranian and Azeri musics. It's not a big deal either way. Join them and have fun.

, Nakhchivan is full of crowded and good concerts, especially in the summer and beginning of spring (during the Nowrouz). The singers are usually the famous ones from Iran and Azerbaijan, such as Shohre, the Iranian singer. There are also DJs which can bring a lot of festivity and fun. Don't be disappointed if you don't understand the language; music can always bring fun. You'll probably dance to Azeri and Persian music past midnight.

, Ask the hotel reception staff about every price, including the taxi costs. Some taxi drivers might ask you to paying much more than the common prices. For example, it'll probably cost 30 AZN (Azerbaijani New Manat) from the Duzdag hotel to aṣḥāb-e kahf.

For a cheap and quick vacation, try making a trip to a nearby county fair., When seeing domestic animals, you may want to bring your own dog along for the trip. If your dog is familiar with things like farm animals, and generally calm in new situations, think about including it in your trip.Think about how to travel with your dog. For a long drive, make sure to stop regularly to let your dog out of the car. Provide adequate food and water. When flying, do your research. See how much it costs to fly with a dog, and any paperwork you'll need.
Find hotels that allow pets. While some hotels have a strict no pets rule, other hotels are happy to accommodate pets. However, there may be an extra fee for potential damages.
Always check with your veterinarian before traveling with a pet.

, Jerusalem is the capital city of Israel, and is fairly easy to get to by car or bus from Ben Gurion Airport outside Tel Aviv, the country's main international gateway.

, The city is essentially divided into four major districts:



Old City: Home to most of the main historical and religious sites for Jews, Muslims, and Christians, the Old City is walled and is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.West Jerusalem: The modern heart of the city and a developed commercial hub, including several unique neighborhoods as ""suburbs"".

Me'a Shearim: Inhabited by mostly ultra-Orthodox Jews (Haredim), visitors are expected to adhere to strict modest dress, but will find an endless amount of large families and interesting people.

East Jerusalem: Home to the majority of Jerusalem's Muslim and Christian population, East Jerusalem is well worth a look.

, This is where Jerusalem's most sacred and best known landmarks are found, including the Temple Mount/Dome of the Rock, Western Wall/Western Wall Tunnels, Hurba Synagogue, the Cardo, the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, etc.

, Here, you will find the main urban thoroughfares lined with stores and restaurants, along with tourist attractions such as the Botanical Gardens, the Knesset (Israeli parliament building), the Israel Museum, Mount Herzl, and Yad Vashem (the Israel national Holocaust memorial).

, This dense area resembles an old-world European Jewish town, with a strictly observant population. Be sure to dress modestly if visiting this neighborhood, as formal dress code is enforced (though not necessarily required).

, Visit the Mount of Olives for a spectacular panoramic view of the city, then descend the mount and explore the vibrant neighborhoods outlying it.

Some public libraries, county clerk offices, and other government agencies also offer passport application services.In some areas, these offices may provide the service instead of a post office.

Use a map or guide.,
Find a tour guide.,
Hit crowded spots after hours.,
Score last minute tickets.,
Do your dining research.,
Go to a packed show in a tiny venue.,
Get outside.,
Look for a shopping bargain.",How to Visit New York City Alone1," Buy a paper tourist guide or download an electronic copy to your Kindle. You can also download a travel app, such as TripAdvisor, to use as you move throughout the city. Make sure that whatever you use has a good, updated city map that goes along with it. Going with an electronic option will help you to blend in and is less likely to mark you as a tourist., If you have the money, you can pay to have a guide escort you through certain areas of the city, such as Chinatown. Or, you can reach out to a volunteer guide group, such as the Global Greeter Network. Contact the NYC Tourist Board for more information and suggestions on individuals who can help you.You can expect that a volunteer option may request a donation. A casual tour given by a local, as opposed to a professional, may also be a cheaper option.

, Look for extended visiting hours at popular destinations, such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Sometimes they will stay open late on weekends or even on random weekdays. This can also provide you with another option if you would like to avoid hitting a bar or a similar place on your own., You have a much higher likelihood of getting a single ticket to an in-demand play or show than if you need multiples. Go to the TKTS booth in Manhattan or Brooklyn and inquire about which seats are available and when. Be prepared to be flexible and you just might get lucky. You can also go directly to a box office, although you may need to wait longer in line for this option.You will get the best discount if you ask for a single ticket to a same-day show., Browse NYC tourist websites to see which restaurants get the best reviews by single diners. To be the most comfortable, you may want to look for ones with ample bar seating and service. If you eat at the bar, you can blend in with crowd while enjoying your meal.It is also a good idea to eat breakfast at one of the many bakery-cafés spread throughout the city. You will likely feel less self-conscious than in a traditional restaurant and you can also enjoy some great people watching.
For example, Casa Mono is a Spanish restaurant known for counter service and large crowds. There is also plenty of entertainment as the kitchen is open for viewing.You can also choose to browse a grocery-laden area, such as the Flatiron district. Some of these mega grocery stores allow you to wander around and sample their wares., If you would like to avoid the hustle and bustle of Broadway, but still want to see a show, you might try one of the smaller theaters or even a more intimate music club. These spaces often get packed, so you can lose yourself in the crowd.For example, you could go to The Iridium to hear some original jazz. Or, perhaps attend a reading at the Poetry Project.

, NYC is home to a wide array of green spaces that will give you plenty of spaces to roam around and relax. Some of the spaces, like Central Park, can get rather crowded, but you can usually find more secluded and quiet areas a bit deeper in. You could even grab some finger food to go at a local restaurant and have a picnic.Shakespeare Garden is a good example of a more secluded space and is generally more quiet than its crowded counterparts., Hit a thrift store on the Lower East Side if you are looking for a bargain. Or, perhaps visit a shop specializing in vintage records, such as Black Gold Records. Many vintage shoppers choose to “hunt” alone, so this is a great way to spend your time if you’d like to blend in when solo."
"
Try to act like a local.,
Talk to other people.,
Bring a book for down times.,
Use technology to meet others.,
Make time to relax.",How to Visit New York City Alone2," As you move on city streets, go with the crowd instead of against it. Travel like locals by using the subway, the bus routes, and taxis. Choose formal restaurants for the evening instead of mid-day. If you feel isolated, just remember that you are one of millions moving through the city.You can also get to know the city by taking the Staten Island Ferry. Or, you could try a bus tour, such as Hop On, Hop Off, which will give you a good outline of the city., As you shop or eat dinner, reach out to the people around you and engage with them. Ask them about their day or what activities they would suggest. The key is to keep these conversations light and to keep trying, even if you are not a “people person.”If you are sitting next to someone at the bar, you might ask, “Have you been here before? Is there anything that you would suggest ordering or that they are known for?”

, You can’t reach out to strangers all of the time, so when you are alone or if you just want some peace, pull out a good book or magazine to read. This will also allow you to engage your surroundings and people watch more than your phone will., Before you head out on your trip, or even while in NYC, use your phone or laptop to reach out to the locals or fellow travelers. You can visit MeetUp and try to connect to people with similar interests. Or, you can hop onto an app, like Highlight, and see who is going to be where in the city at what times., It can be tempting to schedule every minute of your trip. Resist this urge and try to incorporate some cooling down periods throughout your travels. Go to one of the local spas and get a facial or massage. Hit a coffeehouse and sit outside just to take in the sights. These types of activities are often best done when solo."
"
Be aware of your surroundings.,
Trust your gut.,
Establish emergency contacts.,
Choose safe accommodations.",How to Visit New York City Alone3," Keep in mind that NYC is a big city, even if it doesn’t always feel like it. Make sure to plan your travels ahead if it is dark and take a cab if necessary. Be careful about who you trust and recognize that even new friends are still essentially strangers. When in doubt, rely on your common sense when making plans., If you get a feeling that something is wrong or off-kilter, there is a good chance that you are right. If this happens, get yourself to a safe place and reach out to people who can help you. Don’t be afraid to contact the authorities if you need assistance as well., Before you leave on your trip, get in touch with at least three friends or family members and let them know where you are headed. You can give them your accommodation and flight information as well. You might want to carry one of their numbers with you in your bags, just in case they need to be contacted in case of a medical emergency.Also, make sure that you carry all necessary medical ID cards with you. For example, if you require certain medications these can be used by first responders to help you.

, Whether you will be spending a good amount of time at your hotel or none at all, do some research online beforehand to ensure that you will have a safe stay. Read online reviews and pay particular attention to any comments regarding safety. You can also contact the NYC Police Department to talk with them about crime reports for a certain area."

Understand “unlawful presence.” The deadline for leaving the country actually shows up on a person’s Form I-94 Arrival/Departure Record.,
Identify exceptions.,
Calculate the time bars.",How to Report an Expired Visa," ICE will ask for the person’s name, so you should write it down.People might go by nicknames, so you should report all of the names that you know the person by.;
, You need to report the location of the violation, which will be where the violator lives or goes to school.If you know this information, then write it down. However, if you don’t know this information, then you can ask around.


For example, you might be aware that a student at your school has overstayed their visa but not know where they are currently staying.
Don’t do anything illegal to get information. For example, don’t stalk the person or steal their belongings in order to find out where they live.

, You should write down anything else that might be helpful, including the visa number, if you have it. For example, students might overstay their visa. In this situation, you should have their visa number in your school’s files.


If the person is a tourist or a business traveler, then note that fact as well.
Other helpful information includes country of citizenship, place of birth, or Social Security Numbers., From the U.S. and Canada, you can report an expired visa to ICE at 1-866-347-2423. If you are outside the U.S. or Canada, then you can call 802-872-6199. You should also decide whether you want to report anonymously. If you do, then ICE can’t contact you to get follow-up information.You only need to report a violation once. Accordingly, if you report by telephone, then you don’t need to report online.

, You can also make an online report at the ICE website. The online form will request the following information:your first and last name
your email address
your phone number
the suspected violation (select “F/M Student Violations, Including OPT” if reporting a student visa violation, select “Other” if reporting all other visa violations)
where the person is located
any other relevant information you have
the answer to a math question (to check that you are a living human being and not a spam bot)

, ICE does not provide updates about their investigations. However, they may contact you if they want to give you a monetary award, which they have discretion to do.You probably shouldn’t expect ICE to investigate a visa violation too aggressively. According to watchdogs, they do not systematically investigate visa violations., Although a visa might expire, the person must leave by the date on their Form I-94, which might come later. Once this deadline has passed, the person is considered to be in the country illegally. They then accrue unlawful presence.

, Not everyone accrues unlawful presence. For example, the following people will not accrue unlawful presence for the amount of time they are in the U.S. past their Form I-94 departure date:Under age 18.
Has a pending application for adjustment of status, extension of status, or change of status.
Was a victim of trafficking.
Has a pending asylum application that isn’t frivolous.
Overstayed because of abuse and can prove they overstayed because of the abuse.

, Depending on how much unlawful presence a person accrues, they will be barred from applying for another visa to the United States. The bars are calculated as follows:Three-year bar: you accrued more than 180 continuous days of unlawful presence but less than a full year. You also left before any official removal proceedings were started.
Ten-year bar: You have more than one year of continuous unlawful presence but you left before any formal proceedings were started against you.
Permanent bar: You have more than one year in aggregate of unlawful presence or you are deported form the U.S.

Determine if your passport has an RFID chip in it.,
Decide if you want to merely be passively cautious, actively protect your data, or permanently disable the RFID chip in your passport.

,
If you want to be cautious:


The passport cover will provide some shielding to the RFID chip inside.,
If you want to actively protect our data:


Get a shielded case for your passport and use it actively whenever you travel with your passport
Alternatively, you can wrap your passport in aluminum foil.,
If you want to disable it permanently:


Microwave your passport for a couple seconds - this will fry the chip.",How to Protect Your RFID Enabled Passport," If on the cover there is a rectangle with a circle and a line through it, then it definitely contains an RFID chip and can be read from a distance.;
,, However, it does no good if it is open.
If you carry your passport around loosely in your purse, make sure you store it so that it is closed. Even a slightly opened passport increases the ability to have its chip read.
When carrying your passport in your pocket, make sure it is closed

, This works just fine, but is not convenient and quite unsightly

,
If you can determine exactly where the chip is, a sharp blow of a hammer will disable it

Start the renewal process six months before your green card expires.,
Fill in form USCIS I-90.,

You may or may not be eligible to e-file.,
Send in the fee for renewal.,
Wait for a notification of receipt from the USCIS.,
Attend your biometrics appointment.,
Review the checklist sent to you by the United States Immigration Service and gather your paperwork.",How to Renew a Green Card," It is hard to gauge how timely the renewal process is. Once in a while, the process backs up and it takes months and months. This isn't often, but it's best to take precaution.


You may also want to renew your green card if it's been lost or stolen (if stolen, contact the emergency department), damaged, your information has changed, you have turned 14, or you have taken up commuter status.;
, This form is available at the United States Citizenship and Immigration services website. Or, alternatively, you can file it on paper. The USCIS requires the form to be filled in completely. Processing will not begin until this is done.


The I-90 form can either be filed electronically (the fee may be paid simultaneously) or you can use the U.S. Postal Service. If you would like to receive one by mail, call the form orders line at 1-800-870-3676., Check their website for more information.

, Currently, that fee is $540.00 and is subject to change. It includes an $85 fee for biometrics -- fancy talk for taking your fingerprints, taking your photo, and the electronically capturing your signature. This should be done online with your e-filing or included with your form when mailed in. They accept American Express, Mastercard, Visa, and Discover cards.


If you are filing on paper, send in your application and fee to the following address:

USCIS
Attention: I-90
PO BOX 21262
Phoenix, AZ 85036Pay the fee with a personal or cashier's check or money order drawn on a U.S. bank payable in U.S. dollars to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Do not use the initials DHS or USDHS or USCIS when writing checks. Do not send cash or traveler's checks.


Once payment is received, you will receive a receipt. On this receipt will be the address to which you send the supporting documents. Additionally, if biometrics services are required, they will send you notification of your scheduled appointment time and place.

, This will come either in the form of an email (if you filed online) or as a letter. File this in your records as proof you began the process.


The USCIS will mail you a Form I-797C, or Notice of Action. This is the notice you should use as evidence that you filed this application. Again, this is the notice that lists the information you need for your subsequent appointment.

, Bring your appointment letter with you in addition to some form of photo identification. The biometrics appointment consists of fingerprinting and taking your photo for your green card. It is nothing to worry about unless you have a new and improved criminal record.


If you need proof of documentation while the USCIS is reviewing your status, say so at your appointment. They will stamp your passport to indicate that you have filed for a new card. It will enable you to exit the U.S. and reenter., Once more, wait for notification from the United States Immigration Service concerning further appointments. Otherwise, the next step is receiving your card.


There may be an in-person interview you will have to attend at a regional location. It's just as likely you may not have any additional appointments to attend and will receive your new green card in the mail.

In the United States, for example, all people born in the country are citizens upon birth (unless they were born to a foreign diplomat). This is called “birthright citizenship.”


Other people may qualify for U.S. citizenship even if they were not born in the country. For example, if you were born outside the U.S. but to citizens of the United States, then you probably are a U.S. citizen.By contrast, other countries will have different requirements for citizenship. Australia, for example, does not recognize “birthright citizenship.” Instead, a person born in Australia will be an Australian citizen if born to at least one parent who is an Australian citizen or permanent resident.;
, You should be able to find them on the Internet. Type “citizenship” and then your country. Search through the results.


If you can’t find anything on the web, or become confused, then you can stop by your local town office and ask what the requirements for citizenship are. They will either have the answer or can point you in the right direction.

, People who are not naturalized upon birth may apply to become naturalized citizens. The vast majority of countries in the world allow aliens to become citizens through a naturalization process. Each country’s requirements and processes will differ somewhat.


For example, in Australia, you can become a citizen if you meet the following requirements:Are over 16 years old and a permanent resident of the country
Have lived in Australia lawfully for four total years with no long absences
Know basic English and the requirements and privileges of citizenship
Are likely to reside in Australia or otherwise maintain close connections
Have good character



, If you are not a citizen of the country where you reside, then you cannot falsely claim to be one. In the United States, if you falsely claim to be a citizen in order to obtain a benefit, then you can be deported. Even more, you can be permanently barred from ever returning.A common area where people wrongly claim citizenship is when filling out an I-9 Employment Eligibility Verification form. If you are working in the United States, then you should confirm that you are a citizen before filling out this form.

, If you are trying to establish citizenship, then you will need to meet with a lawyer to discuss how to go about gaining citizenship. You also might want to meet with a lawyer if you are unsure of whether or not you already are a citizen. You can find an immigration attorney by using the relevant bar association referral program for your state or country.


At your consultation, bring whatever proof of citizenship that you have. Also be prepared to speak honestly about your history.

, In the United States, a copy of your birth certificate will prove that you are a citizen. If you were born in the U.S., then by virtue of birthright citizenship you are a U.S. citizen.To get a copy of your birth certificate, you can contact the Vital Records department in the state where you were born.To find your state’s office, you should visit this webpage from the Centers for Disease Control at http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/w2w.htm. Click on the state or territory where you were born. You will be provided the name of the department, contact information, and the cost for a copy of your birth certificate.
If you were born overseas, then you should contact the Department of State to request a copy of your birth certificate., Your passport also serves as proof of your citizenship. If you lost your passport, then contact the appropriate agency to request a replacement.


In the U.S., you must first report your passport as stolen or missing by visiting https://pptform.state.gov/.

There is a $345 filing fee for a replacement., Before a country will issue a passport, it will need to confirm that you are a citizen. The passport will then serve as proof that you are a citizen. Having a valid passport is often the easiest way to prove citizenship.


To find your country’s requirements, you need to contact the government office that issues passports. To find this office, you can stop into your local post office, which often contracts with the government to issue passports. The post office should have a list of requirements.
You will also need to gather appropriate proof of your identity and your citizenship. Acceptable documents vary by country. Typically, however, government-issued identification cards can establish your identity and birth certificates or naturalization certificates can establish your citizenship.

You may be scheduled for an interview.If you have questions, you can call the USCIS customer service center at 1-800-375-5283.You should also download the instructions to form N-600.

, If you are not a citizen but want to become one, then you need to apply for naturalization. This will require filling out a form and filing it with the appropriate government agency. As naturalizations can be complicated, you might want to seek an attorney’s assistance.


Each nation’s specific requirements will be different. Generally, you will need to complete an application form, take a test, and possibly meet with a government official for an interview.

Bring a urination device.,
Bring cleaning supplies.,
Place your urination device somewhere near you in the automobile.,
Pull your automobile over.,
Urinate into the urination device.,
Clean up using the cleaning supplies you brought.,
Get back on the road.",How to Urinate when on an Automobile Trip1," Before you pack and leave for your automobile trip, buy a urination device to take with you. A disposable urinal is the best option because they are the easiest to use. If you have not used one before if might be a good idea to buy a few different types and bring them all with you.You can also just pee in a bottle.


There are a lot of urination devices on the market for both menand women.If you do not want to spend money on a disposable device, you can use materials you might already have. A lot of men will use a milk jug, but milk jugs can be bulky and take up space in the car.Gatorade bottles and Core water bottles have a wide mouth opening, so they are preferable for many women.;
, Since the same hand(s) you will be using to urinate will be operating your automobile, bring something to clean up. Hand sanitizer, baby wipes, or paper towels pre-soaked in soapy water will all work fine.You can find hand sanitizer and baby wipes at any big box store (like Walmart) or supermarket. If you do not want to invest much money, get the travel size.
To pre-soak your paper towels: Take a dry paper towel and place it under running water until it is soaked. Pump one or two drops of liquid hand soap onto it and rub it in until you see the soap lather. Squeeze out any excess water, and fold it into your desired size.

, When you are ready to hit the road, make sure your urination device is accessible and ready to go in case you need it in the vehicle. Ideally, you won’t have to search for it.


You can put it in your center console, the car door pocket, or your glove compartment.

, When you need to urinate, pull your car over to a safe place. The sides of the road, a freeway exit, or some other place away from traffic are all good options. For safety, do not pull your car over onto the side of a major freeway or highway. Do not use your urination device while you are driving.

, Grab your urination device from wherever you stashed it. Remove the lid if it has one. Tilt the device toward your body so the bottom is at a 45-degree angle to the floor. Urinate into the mouth of the device, aiming for the bottom.If your device has a lid on it, make sure you replace the lid when you are done.

, Grab those wipes or hand sanitizer and clean up before you get back on the road. You can dispose of the urination device if there is a receptacle nearby. If there is not, set it aside for now. If you think you will need it again soon, set it nearby. Or, you can get another disposable device if you brought disposables.Do not dispose of your urination device outside the vehicle. Most states have strict fines for finding containers full of urine alongside the road., Continue driving toward your destination, much more comfortable now. Make sure you drink enough water. Dehydration causes fatigue, which is a bad combination with driving."

Get back on the road.",How to Urinate when on an Automobile Trip2," It is generally a good idea to clean up after you have urinated, regardless of where it is. Hand sanitizer, baby wipes, or paper towels pre-soaked in soapy water are all good options.You can find hand sanitizer and baby wipes at any big box store (like Walmart) or any supermarket. If you do not want to buy the large size you can get the travel size.
To pre-soak your paper towels: Take a dry paper towel and place it under running water until it is soaked. Pump one or two drops of hand soap onto it and rub it in until the soap lathers. Squeeze out any excess water and fold it into your desired size.

, When you need to urinate, pull your car over to a safe and discreet place. Make sure you are in a location that is far enough away from traffic that you will have some privacy. Taking an exit from any main road is preferable. Do not pull your automobile onto the shoulder of a major freeway or highway, for safety.

, Step out of your car and look around you. Make sure there are no people nearby who can see what you are doing. If there are, choose another location. It is also important to check that you are not urinating on someone’s private property.

, If you are in a location that is remote (near a wooded area or close to shrubs), walk several feet from your car and find a spot that is semi-to-fully obstructed. This way nobody walking or driving by will be able to see what you are doing.


Standing behind a tree or large shrub, in the middle of some tall grass, or behind a fence are all good options.
Once you find a good spot, go ahead and do your business. If you are female, pull your pants down around your ankles and squat behind a tree or shrub.
If there is no discreet area available, stand behind your open passenger door. Face away from the road. If you are female, pull your pants down around your ankles and squat behind the passenger door. Squat as close to the body of the car as possible for the most privacy.
As a female, if you can't squat because you have a knee problem, or the area seems gross, you can stand by referring to Urinate Standing Up as a Female. Remember that this takes practice, so if you still have a few days before you go to the automobile trip, start the practise right away!
Be careful not to get caught, you could be fined for disorderly conduct. Depending on where you are, fines range from $50 to $500., Once you are done, re-situate yourself and get back into your car. Leave your used tissues or toilet paper in your pee spot. They are biodegradable and will disintegrate quickly. Before you hit the road, it is a good idea to clean up using the cleaning supplies you brought with you.

, Continue driving toward your destination. Make sure you drink enough water. Dehydration causes fatigue, which is a bad combination with driving."

If you do not want to buy the large size you can get the travel size.

, When you need to urinate, look for the nearest rest area by keeping a keen eye out for the blue road signs that say, “rest area” on them. Most of them will have warning signs telling you how many miles ahead the rest area is.You can download apps to your phone that locate rest areas near your location. This way, as soon as you know you will need to urinate you can just open the app and find the nearest rest area., When you locate the nearest rest area, pull in and park. You can stretch your legs, take some photos if you are in a scenic area, or just head straight to the restroom.


Many rest areas offer vending machines, pet areas, free coffee, and sometimes free wifi., Whether it is a gender-specific restroom or private restroom, all rest areas offer a restroom with available toilets and/or urinals. If the restrooms are being cleaned, you can either wait a few minutes or drive to the next rest area.


If you are female: Hopefully the restroom is clean and you can sit and do your business. If that is not the case and the restroom is filthy enough that you do not want to sit on the toilet, you can still use it. Stand on top of the toilet seat, squatting into the toilet bowl.

, If there are soap and water in the rest area restroom, clean yourself up using those. If the rest area does not provide soap and water, you can use the cleaning supplies you brought with you.

, Keep going toward your destination, making sure to drink enough water on the way. Dehydration can cause you to fall asleep at the wheel, which is dangerous."

Look at schedules.,
Look at ticket prices.,
Make a reservation.,
Effective July 30, 2012, Amtrak now uses all-electronic tickets for travel.,
On the day of your trip, get to the train station at least 30 minutes prior to your train's scheduled departure.,
In the major stations, like Portland and Seattle, your e-ticket will be scanned before you board the train, and you will be given a seat assignment.,
Board the train.,
Get ready to leave.,
Walk towards the station building and wait on the platform.,
Enter the station and pick up any checked baggage or take care of any other business.

",How to Travel on the Amtrak Cascades Train," Do you want to travel in the early morning? Late evening? Early afternoon? There are both north and southbound trains that will fit your scheduling needs.;
, On the Amtrak Cascades, the further you buy your tickets in advance, the cheaper they are. For example, if you're going to Tacoma, WA and are purchasing tickets a month (or more) in advance, you'd only spend $26 each way. If you were purchasing a day before your trip, you might have to spend up to $45 each way. Look at different dates and different trains to get the best deal.

, Reservations are required on the Amtrak Cascades. The 3 ways to make a reservation are either online (http://www.amtrakcascades.com), over the phone (1-800-USA-RAIL), or at a ticket counter with an agent.

, The process is somewhat similar to purchasing e-tickets from an airline. Once your reservation is confirmed, you will receive a confirmation email with an e-ticket attached as a PDF. You can print this out at home, pick up your e-ticket at the station, or of course, if you're that type of person, load it on your smartphone. ONE e-ticket will be issued per reservation, no matter how many people are traveling in your party. Lost your e-ticket? No problem. Just reprint it, or go to a ticket agent and they can reprint it for you. Of course, if you purchased (paper) tickets prior to July 30, 2012, these can still be redeemed for travel without a problem.

, If you are checking baggage, Amtrak recommends at least 60 minutes.

, In the other stations along the route, your e-ticket will be scanned on-board and you might get to choose your own seat The exception is when the train is sold out, in which case the conductor will most likely tell you at the door where to sit. No matter how your ticket is checked, you will be given a slip of paper called a seat check. Put this in the slot up above your seat, otherwise your seat might be reassigned, and you'll need to ask for a new one. As the train approaches your final destination, a conductor will come through the train to collect them.

, Find your assigned car and seat, if you were given one, then settle into your seat. Hold on to your e-ticket, as it is proof that you paid for you ride. If you purchased a round-trip itinerary, the same e-ticket will be scanned for your return trip.

, The conductors will make an announcement when the train is a few minutes from your final destination, and what doors will open at that stop. At this time, collect all of your personal belongings and prepare to de-train. Stand in the vestibule and wait for a conductor to come through and open the door. Use the step stool and be careful when stepping off the train, as the platform may be slippery.

, Listen for the train whistle and watch as your former train begins to roll slowly away, and speed off into the distance.

Look at a map closely.,
Look on the Internet for information.,
Travel several of these Interstate highways.",How to Understand the Interstate Highway System's Nomenclature," National Road Maps can sometimes be of help, in that some will even explain this system to you. After looking at them closely, it may stun you when you see the resemblance in the numbers.;
, Sites like Wikipedia will try to explain the nomenclature.


Even numbers are assigned to East-West highways, while odd numbers are assigned to north-south.
Long distance routes(such as from the Atlantic Ocean and points nearby to the Pacific Ocean or vice -versa OR between borders) can be presumed when the interstates number is evenly divisible by five.
Major interstates that run north-south will tend to increase from starting and I-5 (Seattle, WA to San Diego, CA) and run to I-95 (Seattle,WA to Boston, MA) (from Interstate 5 along Western Seaboard and working eastward to Interstate 95 along Eastern seaboard).
Major interstates that run east-west will tend to increase (starting at I-10(San Diego, CA to Tallahassee, FL) running near the California/Texas and Mexico border to I-90 (Seattle, WA to Boston, MA) near the Canadian border.

There are two exceptions: There are no I-50 and I-60.


Other numbered highways with two numbers will tend to run between a few states, but their numberings will not tend to have any pattern.
Auxiliary spur routes that deviate from the parent route but will return later will be given a 3'rd number at the beginning. This third number will tend to be even. If the route ends up terminating at some unknown location that doesn't connect to another interstate or it's own will be given an odd number.

The shortest auxiliary Interstate, I-587 in Kingston, NY only runs about 1.2 miles (1.9 km), and is meant to bring people from the major shopping areas of Kingston's Ulster Ave/Albany Ave (US Route 9W strip) to I-87.


Alaskan route numbers carry no resemblance to the numbering system used elsewhere in the US, as they were numbered in order of the funding they receive.

, As you enter and exit a highway, ask where the highway ends. Some tollbooth collectors yearn to tell you where their interstate ends. Make sure you include the word ""continental"" in your question (such as the ""continental terminus""), otherwise they'll just think you're wondering where in the state the highway ends.

, After you submit your N-400 form, you may be summoned to a biometrics appointment for any necessary fingerprints and signatures. All applicants are required to attend an interview, where you will be tested on your English reading, writing, and speaking skills as well as your understanding of U.S. civics.You have two opportunities (per application) to take these two tests.

If you dress inappropriately, you may be denied entrance to religious sites, and you will be a more obvious tourist target for scammers. Instead, wear loose, flowing clothes that promote airflow, such as linen trousers or cotton blouses.;
, Ground travel within Cambodia allows you to see more of the country and get closer to the Cambodian people, but it will always take more time than you’re told due to poor road conditions and possible vehicle breakdowns. Traveling by plane does not have to be expensive, but you do miss out on the experience of watching the country go by.


By plane – Both Phnom Penh and Siem Reap (Angkor Wat) are well-connected internationally. If money isn’t an issue, you can consider flying to these destinations, as the Siem Reap – Phnom Penh road is in poor condition, and flying internationally into Siem Reap allows you to avoid the hassle of getting a Cambodia visa at the border.
By bus – Public buses connect every point in Cambodia. There are two “types” of buses, “local” and “tourist.” On “local” buses, Cambodians outnumber foreigners, the buses are usually older, it can be more crowded, Cambodian music or TV plays for the whole ride, there are more stops, the tickets are cheaper (and purchased directly from the bus company), and you have a better chance of making local friends. On “tourist” buses, foreigners outnumber Cambodians, the bus feels more spacious, and tickets (purchased from travel agents or guesthouses) are slightly more expensive. When it comes down to it, the buses are similar, so it depends on what kind of experience you want to have.
By van – The vans accommodate only foreign travelers and are a faster way to get to certain destinations (such as from Phnom Penh to Sihanoukville or Kampot). They cost more than buses, but may not necessarily be more comfortable: a 12-seater van, for example, may squeeze in 13 or even 14.

, For transportation advice, talk to hotel/guesthouse/hostel workers, travel agents, and fellow travelers. Every place of accommodation will be able to help you purchase tickets for onward travel for a slightly inflated price. For the most budget-friendly option, buy your ticket directly from the bus station or bus company office.


Note, however, that in some places the bus station is located far from the town or city center, so going all the way out there may not be worth it. Ground travel options in Cambodia are plentiful so you won’t have to book anything more than 24 hours in advance.

, Cambodian roads are notoriously unpaved. During the dry season, red dust from the road seeps into the undercarriage and affixes itself to your bag. Avoid this problem by using a bag cover. This can be a built-in rain cover, a suitcase cover, or even a garbage bag. During the rainy season, keep your bag dry by using a cover or, again, even some garbage bags, tied securely around your bag.

, Refreshing air-conditioning can suddenly turn freezing, especially once the sun goes down. Contrariwise, there’s no guarantee that the AC will work, which means that you may end up in a sweltering vehicle with all the windows rolled down. Therefore, don’t wear too-restrictive clothing, such as jeans, and keep a jacket or wrap on hand.

, As a general reference, in all places except for within Phnom Penh and between Sihanoukville’s Serendipity Beach and Otres Beach, figure on around 0.50 USD per person per kilometer (as of December 2014). Always agree on a price before you get in the vehicle.

, Bus travel times can take up to twice as long as claimed due to poor road conditions, vehicle breakdowns, traffic, and more. If you’re transferring between forms of transportation, give yourself a few hours’ cushion.

, Cambodia isn’t known for its punctuality and abundance of Western amenities, but its people are wonderfully friendly and spirited. Don’t be upset if things don’t go exactly as expected. After all, the misadventures make the best stories back home!

The BritRail ""Senior"" Pass is for those 60+ and receive up to 15% off the regular adult rate.
The BritRail ""Group"" Pass is 50% off for the 3rd to 9th passenger.
The BritRail ""Family"" Pass is for children age 5-15 travel free with one adult or senior passholder. Children under 4 travel for free and do not need a pass.

, The BritRail Passes come in two forms. The ""BritRail Consecutive Pass"" and the ""BritRail Flexipass"". The BritRail Consecutive Pass allows you to purchase 3, 4, 8, 15, 22 days or 1 month of rail travel -- while the Flexipass allows you to purchase 3, 4, 8 or 15 days of rail travel ""within a 2 month period"". Different validities apply to other passes such as:


The BritRail ""Plus Ireland"" Pass - 5 or 10 days within a 2 month period.
The BritRail ""London Plus"" Pass - 2 days within 8 days, 4 days within 8 days or 7 days within 15 days.
The BritRail ""Freedom of Scotland"" Pass - 4 days within 8 days or 8 days within 15 days.
The BritRail ""Central Scotland"" Pass - 3 days with 7 days.

, If you plan to travel in England, Scotland and Wales then the BritRail Pass will be what you need. If it is just England, then the BritRail England pass is enough. Smaller passes also exist for different regions such as the BritRail London Plus Pass which allows you to travel in the Southeast of England, the BritRail Freedom Of Scotland Pass for Scotland only and the BritRail Plus Ireland Pass which allows you to travel in England, Scotland, Wales, Rep of Ireland and Northern Ireland.

, If you are traveling from London to Manchester to Edinburgh to Glasgow for example, a 3 day BritRail Pass will suffice. Don't purchase more days than you need. If you are going to be traveling by for a three day period, then 3 days of rail travel is enough. If your rail travel will be spread out over a number of days within a certain time frame (say three weeks) then the flexipass allows you to choose the number of days to travel over a 2 month period. This will give you the freedom to come and go as you please. The days do not need to be consecutive.

, Reservations can be made before you leave for the UK. But it is quite common to travel without them as most operating companies don't require them. However, it would be wise to make reservations during peak times such as holidays and weekends.

, Validating your rail pass is quite easy. On your first day of rail travel simply present your rail pass at the ticket window where a rail official will stamp the pass with the date. From here on in you will not need to go to any ticket window. Just board the train you are looking for and you are on your way. A conductor will then ask you to present your pass while on board.

, Packing light is the best road to take. Depending on the length of your trip, bring a roomy backpack or a shoulder bag.

, One backpack is perfect for clothes (rolling them up makes them easier to fit,)but you can carry another smaller bag for car entertainment, (books, magazines, iPod.) Put your clothes in the trunk and keep the other with you at all times.

, Stuff a cooler with nuts, fruits, crackers, and other nibbles. Soda, juice, and lots of water are also handy, but steer clear of salty foods and do not drink too much water, as you will have to pee sooner or later.

, When you get in the car, choose a good seat and make it yours! You'll be stuck here for awhile, so make sure it is comfy and roomy.

, Every road trip has stops, so make them count. Use the restroom, get a meal, grab a snack. A good tradition is stopping ONCE along the way to satisfy your sweet tooth. Other stops should be filled with healthy foods and good meals.

, Pajamas and Flip flops are good for guys and girls, but shorts and tanks are good too. Always wear flip-flops! You will want to let your feet air out. A big sweatshirt is also good for winter or nighttime trips.

, This is where you use everything in your car entertainment bag. Play games, chat w/ friends, read a book, read some magazines, and don't focus on the car ride.

, Sleep! Sleep! It passes the time so well, and it is so relaxing. Try going to bed late and waking up early the night before so you are extra tired.

Reduce air travel.,
Buy carbon credits.,
Be a public transport fan.,
Pack light.,
Go local.,
Take your rubbish with you.,
Know the local rules about low impact touring.,
Know what sort of activities you will be participating in before you go and read up on the most environmentally conscious and ethical providers of the activities.",How to Become a Low Impact Traveller," Air travel is loved by travellers because it gets us to our destination quickly and we can cover most of the world this way. The trouble is, it is an environmentally-costly activity in terms of the creation of greenhouse gases and the usage of fuel resources. On the one hand, it is great that so many people can be shifted at one go per plane but on the other hand, travelling a lot by this fashion puts the frequent flyer higher on the ecological footprint scale. What to do? Here are some thoughts:
Try to choose vacations that don't require plane trips. Don't forget that your own country can be a fascinating place to visit too by rail, by bus, by bike and even on foot. If you have borders with another country, you can also prefer the train, buses etc. to flying where possible.



 


Choose the most direct route. That way, you are flying a lot less, both good for your health and good for you too.






Stretch out your quota of flying vacations. Instead of travelling by plane every year, lessen it to biennially instead. Or every three years. Possibly also very good for the budget!






Fly to another destination but don't fly internally. Only take public transport options (if safe) once you arrive at your destination. Or hire a bike or a small car.





;
, Help offset your carbon pollution from air travel by buying carbon credits where possible. While not every person believes that these provide a valid solution to our carbon releasing problems, they are a symbolic and hopefully real start to our becoming more effectively creative about how we shoulder responsibility for our personal energy burden, both now and down the track.

, Find out which options are the safest and most efficient in the destination you are travelling to, before you leave. For example, catching trains is fun, peaceful and lets you have a lot of leg space. Use trains a lot when you travel and you'll have time to take in the sights, meet the locals and get good snaps. Buses can be great but sometimes they are crowded, or unsafe. There are often local transport options too, such as auto rickshaws, pedalled vehicles, and mini-vans etc. Find out before you go and plan to use them as part of your itinerary.

, Lessening your load makes it easier for you to get around and you have less valuables to worry over. Plus, less fuel is used transporting your stuff around. And keep it light; don't go crazy buying things that will just turn into clutter when you get back. The only exception to this is purchasing quality handcrafts from people who rely on this for their livelihoods; you're doing them a good turn, helping their industry, and you get a unique keepsake or two to bring back home.

, See what your own backyard has to offer. During down times, you might need to book in advance as budget-conscious citizens turn to their own country for vacation options. Campsites, fragile walking trails and cheap accommodation might be booked out well in advance, so be prepared to think ahead and book early.

, Low impact travellers clean up after themselves. Always dispose of rubbish in the proper places and never litter. This means both cities and nature trails. It is always a good idea to pack out food scraps from hikes and other nature destinations, so as to not disturb the feeding patterns of local wildlife.

, It always pays to know the rules about the activities you are undertaking. For instance, keep to the trails to preserve the local fauna and know about animal feeding prohibitions. Know when it is impolite and downright improper to photograph people at work or play. Know what gestures and signals are considered rude in the country you are visiting and avoid them. A little bit of consideration beforehand goes a long way to being a low impact traveller.

, Look for local employment for guides, instructors, operators etc. And try to prefer those who are doing their best to provide employment opportunities for locals. Ask questions about revenue return to local communities if you aren't sure, and ask if they are involved in local community projects such as youth training and conservation initiatives.

Decide when and where you are going to go.,
Take time to map out a detailed route.,
Try to limit your daily driving distance to a specific timeframe of 1 to 4 hours.,
Pick at least 1 sight or attraction that you would like to stop at in each state.,
Research and book your lodgings beforehand so you are not wearily searching for a place to stay in the middle of the night in an unfamiliar place.,
Learn all the sights and attractions on or around your route, and then create a list of everything you wish to visit before you leave for your trip.,
Purchase and set your GPS system before you leave.,
Make sure that you get your vehicle serviced completely, assuming you are bringing your own car.,
Bring lots of healthy snacks and drinks for the ride, especially if you have children.,
Pack for your tour across the United States by selecting mix and match items rather than outfits.",How to Take a Road Trip Across the United States," The United States is a huge country with so much to see, but you cannot see it all in one trip. So you have to choose where to go and when the best time of year will be to go there, For example, the northern route includes Washington State, New Hampshire, Ohio, Nebraska and Wyoming, and offers opportunities to visit Acadia National Park, Yellowstone National Park, Niagara Falls and Olympic National Park. The Southern route includes Florida, Alabama, New Orleans, and Texas, with visits to Carlsbad Caverns and Saguaro National Park as options.;
, This may be determined by the timeframe you have to travel in. Buy a map or go online and do research on which direction you want to go in, although this will be determined by factors such as what you plan on seeing and where you plan on staying.

, Allowing time to stretch and rejuvenate will make the overall trip more pleasant.

, Every state has something to offer, so make it a goal to take advantage of this opportunity.

, Make sure you print out copies of your reservations so that you are not fighting with a hotel or campground manager who lost your reservation.

, Purchasing books or printing out information on these different locations will make the visits more fulfilling. This may sound too restrictive for such a trip, but you cannot afford to be spontaneous on a journey across the states. Preparing in this fashion will ensure you see everything you want to see and will save you the time you want to spend enjoying yourself. And if you are traveling with children, you definitely want to be prepared.

, There is no reason to get lost in this day and age. Just make sure the software is up to date. You can set the GPS up for all your destinations and request that it searches for places to eat along the way.

, Let the mechanic know that you are planning a road trip across the US so that he is thorough. Additionally, consider bringing tools, spare tire and fan belt, and anything else you may need on your journey. What you bring will most likely be determined by the climates along the way. So make sure you know the weather in the states you will be visiting.

, You may need to store larger bags of snacks into smaller zip lock bags for the little ones so you can monitor how much they eat. Plan to stop at grocery stores along the way so you don't have to buy for the whole trip in one shopping spree. Keep the sugar snacks and drinks to a bare minimum. Last thing you want is your kids trying to climb the walls in a vehicle.

, You will need to bring a lot, but plan to do a lot of laundry. Obviously the type of clothing will depend on the weather, so make sure you know what you will be facing weather-wise. Decide how you would like to deal with dirty laundry. You can wash by hand as you go, stay in hotels with laundry facilities, or find Laundromats along the way.

"
"
A few days before the trip, make a packing list (which you need to take with you on the trip) and wash all of the clothes you're going to take with you.,
Start packing the day before the trip.,
Be creative with games.,
Bring books you love, or ones that you need to read for school.,
Make sure that you charge everything before you leave!,
Wear comfortable clothes and go barefoot.,
Bring a blanket and a pillow or two, and use those and the luggage to make a sort of nest in the back seat.,
Stay up packing and then get up early to leave, so you can sleep in the car.

,
Schedule stops about every 60-90 minutes to avoid total insanity and/or bladder rupture.

,
Pack a lunch box or small cooler with snacks, juice boxes, Capri Suns, bottled water, etc.,
When you get there, unpack as needed and enjoy wherever you are.,
Do the same for the drive home.

",How to Survive a Long Car Ride (for Only Child Teens)," This will help you to stay organized and make sure you don't forget anything.;
, Fold, or better yet, roll the clothes. Rolling the clothes instead of folding makes for tighter packing and no creases at the fold lines, which means you won't have to iron your clothes.(Pack a plastic garbage or mesh bag for dirty laundry.)

, Okay, now we're down to the main attraction: the car ride. As an only child, you can hardly play those little magnetic travel board games, so you have to get creative. You can play Tic Tac Toe with one of your parents, or by yourself even. Or make your own game.

, Magazines bought at gas stations help, too, because you haven't read them yet.

, It totally stinks to have your iPod or CD or DVD player die and it's still 5 hours to wherever you need to go. If you cannot charge it before the trip or it has a short battery life, bring a portable car charger.

, (Have some flip flops or crocs in the floorboard for rest stops.)

, (Weird, but comfy!)

,,, and stick it in the floorboard where it can easily be reached.

,


If you're well-mannered, respectful, and generally pleasant to be around, your parent(s) will much appreciate it, and the trip will be an overall more enjoyable experience. (Plus, it aids in leniency in the context of money lending or activity preference. ""Well, you HAVE been pretty good... Okay."")
Okay, it's time to go home. Have everything charged up for the drive. Remember that packing list? Use it to repack so you don't accidentally leave anything and check off as you go.

Let your local supermarkets know if they are not carrying the types of vegetarian products that you wish to purchase.,
Choose how ""strictly vegetarian"" you want to be.,
Research local farms in your area.,
Cook as often as you can at home.,
One way to make people more accepting of your dietary choice is to cook foods you enjoy and share them.",How to Be Vegetarian in a Non Vegetarian Country," Such supermarkets are always ready to accept any reasonable changes. Stress the qualities of the products which they like most - popular, quality, price, brand, tasty, delicious, cheap, a brand they already stock. Find similar places in the area and write the same message to them. Do same for one month or two. Simply keep on and be persistent. If you have vegetarian friends in the area, ask them to campaign the supermarkets as well. Many supermarkets have product request postcards available around the store or at the cash register. Start by filling out one of those as well.;
, A vegan diet can be more difficult to pursue than a lacto-ovo one.

, See if the farmers will sell directly to you, or if they participate in a farmer's market. If you follow a lacto-ovo diet and animal cruelty is a concern, ask the farmer about their animal care practices. Look for free-range and vegetarian fed chicken eggs in your local dairy section if you choose to include eggs in your diet.

, If you are staying in a rooming house and don't have consistent access to a stove, ask if you can keep a microwave or rice steamer in your quarters. When eating at restaurants, ask in detail the ingredients of the dish. Not all people assume vegetarian to mean the same thing. You may want to ask if the dish is flavored with animal derived broths or contains gelatin.

, Many people are under the false assumption that eating vegetarian means surviving mainly on salads and bland unseasoned vegetables. You may be surprised at your friends' or family's positive reactions after eating a tasty, filling, yet healthy and 100% vegetarian meal.

Consider your transportation.,
Book into a green hotel or an eco-resort wherever possible.,
Heed the eco-advice of the hotel.,
Take a small carry bag with you wherever you go.,
Support the locals.,
Opt for solar power chargers.,
Send emails in place of postcards and letters.,
Look for organic food, locally produced food, and clothing products.,
Find a green guide.,
Send your loose change to an environmental organisation in the country prior to leaving.",How to Be an Eco Traveler," Shorter flights have less impact on the atmosphere than longer ones; local trips that avoid flying are even better in terms of atmospheric impact. If you are flying, plan to fit in as much as possible, such as possible work conferences, networking, catching up with as many people as possible, volunteering, etc. Consider buying a carbon offset for your trip; most airlines now carry details on how you can do this. In terms of getting around within countries, consider cycling, trains, public transportation options before car rental. Some forms of public transport will offer great deals for weekend, weekly, or even monthly travel.;
, Seek to support those places that walk the talk. These places are often signed up to various country or international schemes aimed at reducing the environmental impact of their operations and concerned with being a sustainable business. Learn about what they are doing online before you book. Some of the hotels or resorts will even take you to see their green features if you ask.

, Many hotels are now into saving water and energy where possible, even if they are not known as a green hotel. Where you are given the opportunity to reuse towels, sleep on the same sheets, open the windows for fresh air rather than using the air-conditioning, etc., then consider doing so. And turn the lights off whenever you're not in the room.

, There are many foldaway bags available now that open into much larger carry bags when needed. Having one of these with you at all times removes the temptation to accept plastic or paper bags anywhere you are. This is great for impulse purchases at craft markets, leftovers from breakfast and lunch, sweaters that become too warm to wear, etc. Alternatively, use your day pack as a means to carry anything purchased while you're out and about.

, Look for local crafts, art, artisanal products, etc. rather than buying mass-produced tourist gimmicks. You can support the local industry in both developed and developing countries and give the craftspeople a big boost. It's nice to let your seller know where you're taking their handwork home to; that often becomes a talking piece for them down the track and is a source of pride.

, This is suitable for a range of items including cell phones, music and video widgets, battery chargers, etc. There are solar cell packs available for laying across backpacks, so that you soak up the sun as you're walking all day. The beauty of solar power charges is their ability to work when the electricity doesn't, making them ideal for back country and electricity-poor visits.

, There are many online postcard choices that you can use.

, It can be really beneficial for tourists to support the local organic industry, especially in countries where this is a fledgling industry. Let others know about the products on your blog or by word-of-mouth to help spread the knowledge.

, If you want to experience travel that includes educational and awe-inspiring elements, find a guide who is keen on eco-travel too and will be able to help you tread lightly as you discover amazing places in the world.

, This can be a great way to tidy out the loose coins and benefit an environmental group at the same time.

Wash yourself before visiting a temple.,
Dress appropriately for the temple.,
Buy offerings to bring to the temple.,
Remove your footwear outside the temple.,
Circulate through the temple.,
Respectfully view the statues.,
Bring your offerings before individual statues.,
Accept any items from the priest.,
Avoid touching shrines or statues.,
Follow rules of common decency.,
Provide a donation, if desired.,
Keep an eye out for beggars.",How to Be Respectful when Visiting a Hindu Temple," Before you plan to go to temple, you should take a shower or bath.Anyone is allowed entry inside a temple, but since temples are spiritual places, it’s traditional to bathe before attending a temple.


To prepare yourself mentally and spiritually, you may also wish to take several moments to pray and think about God or your personal spiritual beliefs.;
, While it’s not necessary to wear traditional Indian clothing to a temple, both men and women should wear modest, conservative clothing to the temple. This will indicate respect for the sacred place, and will allow other attendees to focus on the temple gods and their own acts of worship, rather than being distracted by loud or inappropriate clothing.Women should wear a long skirt or dress. It’s also appropriate for women to wear long pants. Wear something that is loose enough for you to comfortably sit cross-legged in.Men should wear business-casual clothing, such as slacks and a button-down shirt.Avoid wearing animal skin of any kind; this could be offensive to practicing Hindus.

, Deities can be offered various material things: flowers and fruit are common and affordable choices.You could also choose to offer cloth or sweets. Presenting your offerings to the temple deities is a form of respect. Hindus believe that offerings like these will please the Gods and may result in blessings and fulfilled prayers.


Commercial establishments generally set up makeshift shops in the surrounding area selling various things that you can offer the statues.
It is not required to bring offerings; if you would rather not bring offerings for your first visit, you don’t have to.

, Most temples will have a space designated for your shoes: usually a series of cubby-holes along one of the temple’s exterior walls.Removing shoes shows respect for the temple and the deity statues within. This is not optional: removing shoes, sandals, or any other footwear is a mandatory rule of every Hindu temple.


Socks are fine, you can keep wearing them. However, if the temple floor is made of marble or any other slippery stone, you want to remove socks so you don’t fall.

, Traditionally, upon entering a Hindu temple, you’ll see an array of deities and statues arranged around the temple walls. Begin with the deity on your left. From there, continue to walk through the temple in a clockwise direction, pausing before each deity you come across.Many temples have separate queues for men and women, and you will have to follow it accordingly.
If you’d like to know ahead of time if there are separate queues for each gender, you can call the temple and ask in advance.

, When you finally get to see the statue closely, you may join the palms of your hands near the heart into a “namaskara” (a traditional pose) and bow.This is the minimum act you should perform in front of each statue as a respectful gesture.


Practicing Hindus will often bow or fully prostrate themselves in front of statues as a sign of respect and reverence. If you feel comfortable, you can prostrate yourself as well, although it’s not required., If you have brought fruit or flowers to offer to the deity, you may do this as you circulate through the temple.Hand each offering to the priest sitting outside the idol’s chamber. Under no circumstances should you enter the inner chamber. The inner chamber or the chamber where the idol is seated is considered the most sacred and private area and no one can go in without previous sanction.


If there is no priest outside the chamber, there may be a nearby platform for worshipers to place their offerings on., While you are in the temple, you may notice a priest pouring water over the hands of worshipers. This is a spiritual, purifying gesture: if the priest offers you the water, let him pour it over your hands.The priests may also give “Prasad:” blessed food (always vegetarian) which is offered to the deities. Prasad is also considered holy, and you should eat it outside the temple.
Anything the priest gives you should be accepted with your right hand. Avoid taking or giving anything with the left hand., A single temple can house hundreds of statues—do not attempt to touch any one of them; this will be seen as an inappropriate and disrespectful act. In Hindu faith, only priests are permitted to touch the statues.Keep a respectful distance.


Also avoid photography. Taking pictures is restricted or forbidden in many temples.Before taking a photo, look for the temple’s rules. Rules may be written outside on noticeboards, or you may ask someone, including the priest.

, The temple is a sacred, holy space, and you should exhibit polite, constrained behavior when visiting. You can speak quietly, but avoid loud conversation, laughter, or crying. Do not chew gum loudly—or at all—and throw any trash you have in a trash can. To show your respect for the temple, turn your phone off when you enter, and don’t smoke in or around the temple.


A priest may offer to place a small mark on your forehead (usually made from ash or turmeric). You may accept or decline as you feel comfortable; the mark carries no great spiritual significance and does not necessarily indicate a belief in the Hindu religion., As you make your way through the temple, you may see a small donation box.If you feel like donating, fold the bills and put them with your right hand in the donation box. Remember that donations are never required and you do not have to donate.


Even if someone coaxes you to donate, you always have the right to refuse.

, Depending on your location, you may find many beggars outside temples. You don’t have to give them cash if you don’t want to. If you want to help them temporarily, buy them some food.


If you are alone, it would be a good idea to not encourage beggars. They can be persistent, and can keep following you or trouble you for more money.

Act spontaneously.,
Avoid stereotyping your travel experiences.,
Think about the destinations often forgotten, the ones outside the main tourist track.,
Talk with the locals as much as possible.,
If it's free, it's probably good and something the locals would be doing.,
Get on a bus, a train, a local bicycle hire.,
Try to learn the language basics.,
Visit other parts of the country that are not really detailed in the guidebooks.,
Stop the 5 star hotel trawl.,
Be prepared to feel the historical, social and cultural life instead of emphasizing you've been somewhere by showing the pictures of all the famous places to your friends.",How to Be a Traveler and Not a Tourist," Plans are for tourists, change of plans are for travelers. While the basics like flight times and hotel bookings can be planned in advance for some parts of the journey, don't box yourself in. Make sure you have wriggle room to cancel those bookings and go where fancy takes you.;
, Don't try to squeeze in all the highlights in a short space of time. Does it really matter if you don't see all the sights and miss the tourist gift gimmicks? Even a small country has much more to offer than the tourist stalls and gimmicky local tours.

, Suppose, for example, you want to visit the more than 1000 big or small museums in the rest of the Netherlands outside the capital Amsterdam. Indeed, you'd see a great deal more and soak in much more of the real culture than simply seeing the great museums in the main city.

, Instead of listening a tour guide, interact with locals and have a chat in a park, in a pub or even on a bus. Especially the elders are fantastic sources for helping you to better understand the culture of the city/country you visited. If you are lucky, you can make a good friendship in a very short time.

, Cycling and walking around, visiting forests, watching people on the streets, and resting in parks. These cost nothing but are great ways to immerse yourself in everyday life, to get a real taste of the culture.

, Do not be afraid to use public transport. You will meet people, see amazing sights, go to places that you might not otherwise and you'll save money.

, One hour is usually enough to learn how to say ""Hello"", ""Thanks"", etc. Greeting and asking someone ""Do you speak English?"" in his or her own language, before switching to English, will make the person appreciate you more than trying to speak directly in English., Discover something worthwhile somewhere else for a change.

, You don't need expensive hotels with air-con, fridge and room service all the time. You can be happy with the personal touch from 'bed and breakfast' places and small hotels in the countryside. Staying in people's homes is another great option.

, Your friends can see all that online; go and find the unique, the truly unusual, and connect with real people. In the end, you're going on holiday for yourself, not to impress other people.

Make a list.,
Pack your clothes.,
Pack toiletries and hygiene items.",How to Stay Entertained on a Family Road Trip (Girls)1," Add everything you want to take with you, starting with needs such as clothing and toiletries and ending with things you don't need as much. This will help you be more organized. You can also bring the list with you on your trip so you don't forget something on the way back.
, This one's pretty obvious but also very important. Bring one to two more tops than the days you're traveling and one to two less pants/shorts than the days you're traveling. Make sure you bring a bathing suit no matter where you're going in case there's a place to swim on your trip. Roll clothes instead of folding them to save room, and put socks and underwear into plastic bags to stuff in your shoes to keep their shape and save space., If your trip is at least a night, you'll probably find yourself taking a shower and wanting to wash your hair. While every girl uses different products, some good things to bring are:

Shampoo, conditioner, and body soap (travel sizes work best)
Lotion (also travel sized)
Hand sanitizer
Toothbrush and toothpaste
Hairbrush
Pads or tampons if needed
Makeup if you wear any
Makeup remover if you bring makeup

Keep your makeup simple.,
Sleep on the plane or in the car.,
Stay hydrated.,
Eat a healthy meal or snack.,
Freshen up before you arrive.",How to Look Good when Traveling," Choose loose, breathable fabrics to stay comfortable all day. Knit fabrics are great for traveling, as they wear well and can also be rolled up in your luggage. Spandex blend fabrics are also wrinkle-free and will keep their shape longer than 100% cotton. Synthetic fibers are a good choice as well, especially if you choose something that wicks away moisture.Avoid wearing linen, as it rumples quite easily.;
, Choosing one of your favorite outfits will help you feel confident when traveling. Your favorite outfit is also likely pretty comfortable, or it wouldn’t be your favorite.

For girls, consider a maxi dress paired with a cute jacket. They’re easy to move around in and are also chic. Alternatively, opt for leggings, a long top, and a fun scarf.For guys, consider dark jeans and a polo shirt. That way, you’re more dressed up than you would be if you chose a t-shirt but aren’t restricted by a suit or button-down shirt. Alternatively, choose a lightweight sweater and comfortable dress pants in a neutral color, such as black or navy., Layers are great for traveling, as they can be added or removed depending on the temperature of the car or plane. Layers are helpful if the temperature is significantly different between where you are traveling from and your destination. Add a scarf or sweater to your outfit and remove it if you get too warm.Bringing a jacket with you will keep you warm on the plane and also free up space in your luggage.

, Though you’ll want to choose comfortable clothes that wear well while traveling, you can still be fashion forward. Make your look a bit more bold by adding a printed scarf or fun handbag to your outfit. Layer a few necklaces to dress up your look, or add a stack of bangle bracelets. You could also add a printed headband or oversized sunglasses., Pick a pair of shoes that are comfortable and go well with your outfit. You should never wear new shoes on a trip. Break them in first to avoid blisters or other issues.Wear slip-on shoes or shoes you can take off easily. This is especially true if you are flying to your destination, as you may have to take your shoes off in the airport for security reasons.
Wear socks so your feet don't get cold. Choose socks that wick away moisture, such as those made from bamboo.

, No matter what climates you are coming from or traveling to, moisturizing your skin will help keep it healthy and looking great. Put lotion on your body as well as a moisturizer with an SPF on your face.Slather hand cream over your hands while traveling. Use one with a scent you enjoy, as the familiarity will help you relax.

, Some people prefer to wear their hair up, while others like it down. Choose what you enjoy the most, but keep it simple; don’t spend hours creating curls that are only going to be limp or crumpled by the time you arrive. To get hair off your face, a braid is a simple but stylish choice.


If you’re traveling to a humid region, apply anti-frizz serum to your hair before styling it.

, Many travelers opt to not wear makeup, as there’s no need for a full-on glam look while traveling. If you dread skipping your makeup routine, be sure to use a primer under your foundation to keep your makeup from sliding off. Choose a neutral eyeshadow, add liner if desired, and finish with a few swipes of mascara. Opt for a bold lip color if you want something a bit more dramatic.Keep blotting paper in your purse or carry-on for reducing oil and shine.
Don’t forget lip balm to keep your smile shiny and smooth.

, A little sleep along the way can do wonders for how you look and feel at the other end. Do your best to include some snooze while you're traveling, or take the time to rest. If you find you can’t sleep, put an eye mask on and meditate or simply relax.

, It’s important to stay hydrated when traveling, especially if you are on a plane. Drink at least one glass of water per hour to help you feel better and look more refreshed. Add mint or fruit to your water for flavor if you desire.Limit your alcohol when traveling. Stick to one drink, such as a glass of wine.

, It’s often easier to grab fast food while traveling or to pack your carry-on with junk food. Neither of these things will help you look or feel your best though, so avoid the temptation. Instead, prepare a healthy meal or snack for the trip. Consider:


Sandwiches or wraps with your favorite filling
Fruit that travels well, such as apples, oranges, and bananas
Nuts and seeds or trail mix
A small salad in a container
Carrot and celery sticks

, Brush your teeth, chew mint gum, or pop a breath mint to freshen your breath. You can also reapply deodorant and spritz yourself with perfume or cologne.


Carry a small spray bottle filled with water and a couple of drops of lavender oil. Spritz it onto your face to freshen skin.

Set a date.,
Establish your budget.,
Choose your activities.,
Ease into your vacation.,
Let go of chores.,
Spend time in the backyard.",How to Be a Tourist in Your Own Hometown3," Just as you would for an out of town trip, the key to enjoying a successful staycation is planning ahead. Start your preparation by figuring out how much time you can take off work or school, and plan accordingly. In order to give yourself plenty of time to relax and to feel refreshed upon returning to the daily grind, aim for about a week off.


If you only have a weekend or a few days off, don’t worry! You can still have a wonderful time playing tourist in your hometown in just a couple of days.
Try to give your work plenty of notice, in order to avoid the stress of trying to quickly finish up projects before your vacation begins.

, Treat your hometown vacation as you would any other holiday, and create a realistic and inclusive budget. No matter how much or little you have to spend, you can have a great time and usually not spend nearly as much as you would on traditional vacation.A budget of around $500 for a week is generally a good place to start.
Make sure to take the cost of activities, eating out, gasoline, and any spa treatments into account when planning your budget.

, Mix it up and include a variety of activities. For instance, plan for some outdoor activities if the weather is expected to be nice, include some physical activities such as hiking or sports, and incorporate something new that you have never tried before.Pick up a copy of your city’s travel guide, and start choosing the activities that sound intriguing to you.Take care to not pack too much into each day. You should leave plenty of time to relax between activities.
Build anticipation for the staycation by creating a vision board to inspire your vacation plans. Cut out pictures out from magazines to add ideas to your collage.

, When you leave the office, try to leave your work worries behind and make a smooth transition into vacation-mode. On the evening before your staycation officially starts, plan a stress-free dinner, put on some lively music, open a bottle of bubbly, and let the relaxing begin!


By creating an ambiance of fun and relaxation on the very first night, you’ll set the mood for your entire vacation.
Try incorporating physical reminders that your home is your vacation retreat for the week. Candles and fresh flowers help to create the illusion that your home is a temporary hotel., Use your time off having fun and exploring your hometown, not cleaning and catching up on chores. As you’re relaxing, you will inevitably create at least a little mess. Try to turn a blind eye to it for now, and let it wait until after your time off is over.If you must occasionally lightly clean or do dishes during the course of your staycation, try to tackle it first thing in the morning in order to get it out of the way for the day.

, In order to make your staycation extra restful and special, you may want to consider purchasing a new hammock, or renting a hot tub for the week, which costs around $300. If you have children (even if you don't), you might drag out the tent and sleeping bags, and after a backyard campfire, enjoy a night of sleeping under the stars.

Remove old airline tags.,
Know your airline’s policies.,
Pack fragile items gently.,
Hand carry important items.,
Make a list of what you have.,
Choose a place for your travel documents.,
Mark your luggage.,
Make your luggage distinctive.",How to Avoid Lost Luggage1," This is a simple step, but a really important one. Stickers or tags from flights you’ve taken before can confuse airport baggage scanners.Peel them off, and scrapbook them if you’re really going to miss them.;
, In recent years, many airlines have stepped up their game when it comes to reimbursing travelers for lost luggage. The policies will vary from airline to airline, but should be accessible from the company’s website. However, most airlines don’t reimburse for valuable items.If you want to bring things like cash, jewelry, and electronics in your checked baggage, know that you might be responsible for their replacement., It’s best to travel without very delicate objects, but sometimes you just can’t resist picking up a souvenir. If you are bringing home something somewhat sturdy, like a bottle of wine or box of chocolates, wrap them carefully in bubble wrap and place them in the middle of your suitcase. Extremely fragile things, like blown glass, should be wrapped in soft cloth or bubble wrap, sectioned off with hard items (like books), and placed in your carry-on., Any item you can’t survive without should go in your carry-on bag. This way, if your checked luggage is lost, you will still have your basics. What counts as an essential item? That depends on what you personally need. If you need any small liquid items, like eye drops, make sure to pack them in a clear quart-sized plastic bag.Some common items include:


Medication
Wallet
Traveler’s checks
Change of clothes
Electronics and chargers
Empty water bottle

, Mark down all the things you take with you, noting brands or colors if applicable. In the case of lost luggage, the airline will want some type of proof of loss, and they may still deduct a percentage of the cost depending on the age of the article. Obviously, don’t put this list in your luggage. Stash it in your carry-on instead.

, Before you go to the airport, make sure your carry-on luggage has a spot to put your ID or passport, boarding passes, and luggage receipts. This will keep you from scrambling when you’re at the airport.Furthermore, if you have stashed your receipts in a safe place, they’ll be easier to access if your luggage is delayed.

, Using either a built-in or store-bought tag, neatly label every single piece of baggage you bring to the airport. You’ll want to note your name, home address, and phone number, at the very least. You can even slip in an extra note behind your permanent address with your hotel’s address and phone number., You want to mark your luggage to make sure the airline can keep track of it, but decorating your luggage is more about making sure none of your fellow travelers walks away with it by mistake. The decorations are actually functional, but they’re also fun to choose and apply.


If you’re buying luggage, pick suitcases in bright colors or prints. Most baggage is a dark neutral, like black, navy, or olive, so yours will stand out. Alternately, some companies will monogram your initials onto your bag.
Tie a bright ribbon or scarf around the handle of your bag.
Attach eye-catching tags or charms.
Use fabric-safe spray paint to stencil on your initial, or a simple shape."

Keep in mind that negative comments may simply be an unhappy guest who just wants to ruin the hotel’s reputation. However, if you see several comments around the same topic like bed bugs, consider it a legitimate concern.;
, Don’t hesitate to ask if they have ever had any issues in the past and what preventative measures they take to prevent bed bugs. If they can’t answer your questions, scratch them from your list of hotel options.

, If you’re traveling to a location where you know someone, think about staying with them instead of a traditional hotel. Crashing with a friend or family member will alleviate some stress and may be more enjoyable.


Enjoy the outdoors Head to the nearest camp ground and sleep under the stars or in a cozy tent. Many camps are extremely clean, and offer hot showers for very reasonable rates.

, If you can’t get around a hotel stay and are concerned about the itchy critters, inspect the your room for any signs of bed bugs. You shouldn't need any special tools to do this. Remove the sheet and mattress pad to inspect the four corners of the mattress and box spring.


Bugs are brown with a long, oval shaped body. Most are tiny, about the size of an apple seed but they can be larger, about the size of a nickel. You should also look for black fecal matter and a musty smell., All furniture around the bed will need to be checked. This includes the headboard, nightstands and any pictures on the wall. These bugs can hide behind all of these items., During your stay, use the provided luggage racks after they’ve been inspected for bugs of course. Bugs can hide in the small crevices and climb right into your bag.


Place the luggage rack away from any furniture. If the closet is large enough, keep it in there.

, Folding them and placing in drawers is an unnecessary risk. By hanging them, you significantly reduce your chances of having one or a few crawl into a shirt collar.


Before wearing any garment, shake it out as an extra precaution.

, Store your dirty clothes in a bag as bed bugs can smell and are attracted to the chemical that we leave behind on our clothing.


If you forget, ask the hotel to supply something like an extra trash bag.

, If you suspect your room has a bed bug problem, let the staff know immediately. Ask to be moved to another room as soon as possible.


Do not move to an adjacent room. Request a move to another floor.

, Before entering your home, check the outside of your bags for any bed bug evidence like small eggs, a faint smell, etc. If you suspect you brought a few home with you, leave the bags in the garage or backyard. Do not take them inside.


If your luggage is a dark color it may be difficult to see. Use a lint roller, covering the entire bag, seams and zippers., While you typically may unpack and throw your clothes onto the floor or into a hamper, this could spread any bugs you brought back with you. Instead, unpack and place your items directly into a washing machine or in a sealed bag until they can be laundered.


Don’t hang dry your clothes either. Tossing items into a scorching hot dryer will kill the bugs.
Even items that weren’t worn should be washed. Bugs could have crawled throughout the bag. Better to be safe than sorry.
Shoes can be wiped down with a cloth and some hot water. Leave them outside in the sunlight if possible for a couple of hours too.

, After unpacking, vacuum all pieces of luggage inside and out. Immediately remove the collected debris, seal it, and place it outside. You can also place suitcases in sealed plastic bags, and store them away from your bedroom, such as in the basement or garage.


Never store suitcases under your bed.

, If you are itching or have red bumps on your legs, you may have a case of bed bugs. It may take you a while to discover what the problem is, and by that time, you could have a full outbreak.Confirm your suspicions by visiting a doctor. They will have solutions for clearing any sores.


Contact a professional to discuss the extermination options available to you. They may recommend chemical or steam treatments.Research pesticides but be clear on their use. While some are great for indoors, others can only be used outside."

Bring any other medications you may need on your trip as well.

,
Bring clothes according to the season when you are traveling.,
Dress the part.,
Be careful not to get any water in your mouth when you shower.,
Consult your physician(s) or a travel clinic in advance of travel.,
Write the contact information for each of your doctors on an index card.,
Stock a hip pack for each member of your party with a small roll of toilet paper, and a small bottle of hand sanitizer.,
Take traveler's checks, and some cash, as credit cards are not accepted by many restaurants and shops.,
Other things you may need: deodorant (can't be found even in big cities), raincoat and/or umbrella, hat, sunglasses & sunscreen (depending on the season and your destination), insect repellent, converter (power adapter) if you have one or if it's necessary for you to have one.",How to Pack for a Trip to China," Don't forget your passport with all necessary visas, and your international airline tickets.;
, It's required by Chinese law. Keep a photocopy on hand, too, in case the original gets lost. Or, upload a scan to a place you can access.

, Though there is shopping on every street corner, many of the things you may be used to may be unavailable to you in China. Bring toilet paper as most restrooms will not provide it. Plan ahead by saving leftover partial rolls of toilet paper, in advance of the trip. Each time you have a partial roll left, place this in a baggie and toss it into your suitcase. Six to eight small rolls will last a family of four through a two week trip. Five-star hotels will always have western-style toilets and toilet paper. Most larger airports will have at least one western toilet in the lavatory as well. Take only a key to your house or a car key with you. Leave all others at home.


You need your own toilet paper, especially if you are traveling by train.
These toilets are only available in the 'country-side', not in the metropolitan areas in China.
You can buy toilet paper in China. It's not expensive.

, Water quality in China is very poor and you may develop slight intestinal problems if you use tap water to brush your teeth, or if you eat vegetables which have not been cooked after having been rinsed in tap water. Chew two Pepto Bismol tablets before your meal to help prevent intestinal troubles.


Again, only in the country-side places, not in the 'metropolitan' areas.

,, China gets hot and rainy in the summer, and very cold in the winter. Bring plenty of clothes, but remember you can always find a laundromat to get your clothes washed, or use the laundry service at your hotel. Beware, however, some laundry places use detergent that can irritate sensitive skin. Having your clothing dry-cleaned instead will avoid this problem.

, The standard dress for most places in China would best be described as ""smart casual."" If your tour involves some formal occasions, bring along a formal suit or dress, too.


China is somewhat like the USA. Summer in the south is very hot and humid, and winter in the north is cold and dry.

, It tastes normal, but could easily make you sick. Always brush your teeth with bottled water.


In small cities, bottled water that was filtered with cheap nylon filters is still being sold. Buy name brand bottled water in big supermarkets.

, Your doctor or health-care provider will determine what vaccinations you will need, depending on factors such as your health and immunization history, areas of the country you will be visiting, and planned activities. Be sure to have your prescriptions filled before your trip. China requires that you present a letter from your doctor indicating the need for the use of any psychotropic medicines you might be taking. Bring antibiotics and any other prescriptions you will have to take during your travel. Count enough for your days of travel, plus a few spare pills. Bring all of this in the original prescription container. The Centers for Disease Control also keep an updated page on health information for travelers to China., Take this with you during your day trips in case you have a medical problem, and need to call home.

, Non-alcohol hand sanitizer or wipes are best, as Chinese airport security will occasionally confiscate alcohol-based sanitizers (especially in Guangzhou). Enclose also a granola bar, some cough drops, and some gum, if you'd like. These will come in handy as you travel around town. Include a flashlight since electrical blackouts can happen at any time, and you might find yourself in a dark room.


Remember that you are in China and not anywhere else! In bathrooms in China, to reduce the amount of waste used in the area there will most likely be no toilet paper so carry around lots of tissues. Tissues can also be found in local markets for only about 1-2 Yuan.

, Bring a security pack or money belt which will allow you to keep any return flight or train tickets and your traveler's checks, credit cards, and or cash, safely attached to your person, underneath your clothes. This way you can keep essential items safe if there is no safe in your hotel room.


The major banks in big and medium size cities have ATM that accept foreign ATM debit cards.
In small cities, some banks would not even exchange your USD for RMB.

, If you are a woman, bring your own feminine hygiene products.

Understand the way the economic market works.,
Consider other tourists.,
Expect to be taken advantage of sometimes.,
Consider visiting a supermarket where the prices are indicated before going out to the street market.,
Watch how other shoppers behave with the seller.,
Never pay the first price stated.,
Learn how to put on a show.,
Never personally insult the seller or his country.,
Set the maximum price you would pay for the item in your mind before you begin.,
Don't look desperate for the item.",How to Bargain Abroad," Keep in mind that no one is going to sell you something unless they are going to make a profit.


Don't worry about insulting the merchant by offering an incredibly low price. If the merchant turns up his nose and appears insulted, move on to the next stall. You just established that the item cannot be bought at that time for or below the price you quoted.





;
, Remember that by paying an outrageous price for something, you are dooming the next poor traveler to pay the same or higher price for that object. By not getting ripped off you are not only benefiting yourself, but future travelers.

, This is part of traveling, and it keeps you sharp.

, Prices are often indicated much like any western shopping center and they will give you a rough idea of what things cost. Usually, purchases at the supermarket cost more than the same items sold in the street market.

, Try to imitate their attitude.

, In developing countries, start with a maximum of a quarter of the first price, and don't go over half of the first price. You can often buy something for 10% of the original price.

, Start to walk away, show an empty pocket or a handful of change. Smile sadly and shake your head. Smile happily and wink at the nice try, but signal no thanks.

, This is bargaining, not diplomacy or war. Don't throw the money down, or act like a rude bully.

, Make an offer much less than that, and don't go over your limit. Walk away first. You can always buy it elsewhere.

, The seller then has the advantage. Pretend indifference if you have to.

Volunteer to be on a crew.,

Check your boat routinely and at every port.,
Have a plan for coming back.",How to Sail Around the World," If you didn't win a boat in a contest or inherit one from your rich uncle or decide on an impulse buy at your local boat store, a good way to get on a vessel that can circle the globe is to be on a crew. Contact or visit the nearest marina to you to find out if any boat owners are seeking workers on their boats. Generally your work will pay your way.


However, you could also obtain a position on a cost-sharing boat. Such a boat has a crew that shares the costs, which are typically $20 to $70 per day per person. But beware of boat owners that advertise cost-sharing arrangements that will cost you more than $1,000 per week. Typically, this is a very high amount and the boat owner is trying to make a profit off of you instead of having you simply share some of the costs.;
, Sometimes those already spending their lives sailing just want companionship. If you're lucky, you may be able to find someone you trust who can give you a free ride just for being the charmer that you are. It might not last forever, but would they want company for a few months? You can help out as needed, of course.


Just make sure you're not jumping on just anybody's boat for the free ride. When you're in the middle of ocean with someone, you are literally in the middle of the ocean with them. You're completely stuck with nowhere else to go and no one else to turn to. So before you sign up, make sure you can at least tolerate them willingly.

, Another way to get on a boat that's already sailing the seven seas is to help out with children. There are families that find themselves living on the water, needing help with raising their children and keeping them on track for when they resume a ""normal"" school schedule. Whether it's a private yacht or a corporate vessel, the kids still need to learn and be taken care of while the adults are sailing the ship., Organizations like Green Peace and Dolphin Trust are constantly going to sea to conduct research.They don't only need scientists and researchers – they also need deck hands, administrative workers, maids, etc. It's essentially a business on the ocean, and you could be part of it.


These mostly pertain to environmental groups. If there's a specific cause you care about, do some research online. Many positions will be volunteer, for the record – they pay you get is the experience.

, Most teams going to sea need able individuals to cook, clean, provide entertainment, interpret, bartend, instruct, and more. If you have a skill, why not take it to sea? It could be anything from a large cruise line to a family's private super yacht. You just have to find the gig.


Gigs on a cruise ship are easy enough to find with today's technology. Getting a position on a smaller boat can be a little harder. Stick to your local port and keep an ear to the ground. A lot of it is networking, knowing the right people, and timing.

, If you have $75,000 to spend, you could just buy your own boat and get it up to snuff – provided you have the sailing skills, of course. If you're a newbie to the global sailing community (and most of us are), speak with others in your sailing community who have taken long journeys on their boats. Ask for their recommendations on which types of boats work best and what you can do to join the elite.


In general, you'll want to purchase a boat that is 35 to 45 feet (10.7 to 13.7 m) (10.67 to 13.72 m) long. The boat should be a sailboat. Using the wind instead of fuel will save a lot of money on a journey of this length. That being said, you need a boat that fits your needs. Cruisingworld.com has a nice website full of information on this topic that can help you get to researching., There are close to a million things you have to consider when you're planning your route (well, at least several). It's gotta be safe, for starters. It's gotta have bearable weather (hopefully), it's gotta be doable, and it's gotta be where you want to go. And that's not even mentioning the prevailing winds, ocean currents, and tropical storm systems. Entire books are written on this topic, but for now let's just touch on a few things:


The route from Panama to the Torres Strait is believed to contain some of the most attractive cruising destinations in the world, and there are a whole bunch of variations you can take even within this route.
Many sailors yearn to visit Tahiti. Over the years, Tahiti’s capital, Papeete, has turned from a quiet seaside refuge to a bustling city taken over by traffic. That being said, old Tahiti still survives if you know where to look for it.
If you've planned a stop in Bora Bora, you can either taken a northern route to the northern Cooks, Tonga, and Samoa, or a southern route to the Cooks, Tonga, and Niue.
Take your time and do your research online and by reading books. Jimmy Cornell has some great references on the matter; reading a couple of his books will help you make your decisions and leave no doubt for room in your mind that you've made solid, safe, choices., Again, figuring out when to sail is a wikiHow article (or six) within itself. You need to account for wind, weather, pirates, your own schedule, etc.


Most boats will choose to transit the Panama Canal before the onset of the hurricane season in the Caribbean (June to November), with most arriving in February and March. This is the same time boats sailing from Mexico and Central America should leave for the South Pacific.
If you're coming from the West Coast of North America, most boats travel it downward to South America, working their way to Tahiti via Easter Island and Pitcairn. The winds make it easier to sail this direction; trying to go back toward the east coast will likely prove troublesome. If you're leaving from Australia, you have two choices in crossing the Indian Ocean: the northern route to the Red Sea and Suez Canal or the southern route to South Africa and Cape Horn. The southern route is more challenging and has bigger seas, but the northern route has pirates.

, Research any area that you intend to stop in thoroughly before you decide to stop there. Be sure to take safety and expenses into account. How much does it cost to port? What's their infrastructure and government like? What are the odds you'll be taken advantage of in the best of scenarios and seriously hurt in the worst?


Research the health laws of any country you plan to stop in. Obtain any necessary medical certifications prior to embarking on your journey to make sure you don't get sick while thousands of miles away from home.
Research what you can't get, too. If you need a specific medication or other item and can't get it at your next destination, stock up from the one prior. What part of life will be difficult in this area of the world, if any?

, Speak with an insurance agent to make sure your trip is covered – after all, this is your entire life. Be sure that you have all of the required visas for your trip, too. Whether you come in by sea, by land, or by air, the rules and regulations are all still the same. If you want to visit other countries, you've got to play by their rules.

, Contact the relevant healthy agency in any country you plan to stop in for further information and do your research online. You'll be glad you got the necessary vaccinations when the time rolls around. Being sick when you're away from good doctoral care could mean the end of your trip.


Get a physical exam from a licensed physician before you leave. If you have any issues at all, they can be taken care of and you can start on preventative medication.

, Stock up on non-perishable foods, water purification tablets, and water filters, just to start. Make sure your boat has everything intact from radar to anchors to chartplotters. Bring things to do and methods to document your trip. Take into consideration what you can buy from place to place, too.


You want to travel light, but not too light. Keep a running list of everything you're bringing, adding to it as ideas come to you. What's more, keep a list of what'll be easily available and what won't be to determine your budgeting priorities.

, Thought you could just up and do a French leave, it's probably best if you take care of loose ends before you go off the map for a couple of years. Here's a few things to cover:


Make sure your bills are paid up to date. Arrange a way for them to stay in the black while you're gone through a friend or an automated billing system.
If you plan to stay at certain locations for extended periods, have your mail forwarded to each location for the duration of your stay. Have someone check your home regularly and alert you if anything important arrives in the mail.
Let friends and family know your itinerary and schedule. If things go wrong, they'll have a decent idea of where you are (or at least intended to be).

, Even the Titanic sunk, so be sure to get your boat checked out and given the ""all-clear"" before you take it to sea. Never skip any of the maintenance parts, even if it takes you off schedule. It could mean the difference between life and death.


In some cases, your boat will have to be ""refit."" This could cost as much as the initial cost of your boat, if not more.Be prepared to shell out a chunk of change if need be.

, Things will happen in the ocean that you never, ever would've been able to account for in your wildest imagination. Someone will get a contagious rash, a tribe of natives will think you're their savior, you'll wake up to feel the bow wake of a massive ship, leaving you seconds from death, etc. These things will happen. Though you can't prepare yourself for everything, you can get yourself prepared as much as possible.


Carry a firearm and bullets with you if you have them. Keep them in a safe but accessible location. Better safe than sorry.
Make sure your boat is equipped with all the necessary supplies to successfully either A) get you to shore quickly or B) get you off the boat quickly.
Keep a fire extinguisher, a life-raft, flares, and a first-aid kit handy.
Keep a list of whom to contact in case of an emergency handy, like 112 to reach emergency personnel in Europe., It's easy to think to yourself that you'll be sailing around the Southern Hemisphere and everything is going to be tropical birds, turquoise waters, and pearly-white sands. That'll be true some of the time, and then there will be other times when you dip so far south or north that you'd be freezing your limbs off if you didn't pack some long underwear. Do your research about the climates you'll be in (or could be in if things go wrong). Your life requires you to be ready.


You'll need foul-weather gear, fleece, long johns, gloves, hats, and socks if you're going far north or south. Two of your highest priorities should be staying warm and staying dry., Quick – if there's a hurricane, what do you do? If there are pirates, what do you do? If the waves are crashing onto your stern, what do you do? If a man has gone overboard, what do you do? In any imaginable situation, you have should a procedure mapped out and everyone on board should know it. So when you call, ""Fire!"" everyone knows the job they have to do.


Run practice drills routinely, especially if you know you're coming upon an area that's prone to big gusts of winds/storms/pirates, etc. The more ready you and your crew are, the better your experience will be.

, Months, potentially years, of hard work are about to pay off. You've put in the money and the time and now all that's left is going. Take one last look at your situation – is there anything you could have possibly forgotten?


Throw a party, say your goodbyes, stock up on champagne – however you want to give yourself one last hurrah on land. Check your boat for mishaps, check the weather, gather all your documents, and get excited. It's time to set sail.

, As you're in the open water, it cannot be stressed enough that you have to be careful. Pirates are not just old folk tales made up as scary bedtime stories. Crazily enough, they are real. Stick to areas where you know you'll be safe.


Pirates roam the seas, especially in areas off of the African and Indian coasts. They can even be found in the questionably boundary-less waters around the Philippines and Malaysia (few know who monitors what). For the latest piracy hotspots, visit the ICC's website.Limit your time in other areas due to dangerous sea conditions or threats from other people. These areas include Cape Horn, the Malacca Straits, the Bering Sea, Southern Ocean, Cape Hatteras, the North Atlantic, the Bermuda Triangle, and the Andaman Sea.

, When approaching the coast of any country, you are within that country's territory when you are within 12 nautical miles (22.22 km) of it. Otherwise, you are generally within your home country's jurisdiction when at sea. When you are within this range, you have to abide by that country's rules. Everything will be easier if you meet their requirements.

, Just like how you need to keep an eye on your health when at sea, you also need to keep an eye on your boat's health. At every port, give her a look. Any minute mishap should be addressed immediately. And the great part is that you'll be surrounded by people who can help, too.


If you're traveling solo or almost solo, this can be a bright spot in an otherwise lonely existence. There are usually day laborers that hang around marinas just waiting to help out. For that day, you could meet some interesting people, spicing up your stories and upping your morale.
Check the equipment, too. The last thing you want is a malfunctioning radar or emergency telephone gone haywire. It's a pain now, but it could save your life later.

, After years at sea, you're either going to be ready for some time on solid ground or think that a normal lifestyle is unfathomable. That being said, living your entire life at sea is pretty hard to do, so you'll need some time of after-plan to make ends meet. After you've sailed around the world, what next? Hot air balloon, maybe?


Try to come up with a budget of how much money you'll need post-trip. You'll need time to live and find a job, housing, and to get situated in your new life. Having at least six months of financial padding will make the transition much less stressful.

Learn key phrases or words in the language of the country you're going to.,
Check the weather if traveling domestically and dress appropriately.,
Conduct research on the country’s or state's customs and traditions.,
See what vaccines you need to get before visiting.,
Ask your tour guide questions.",How to Be a Good Tourist1," When you travel to a different country, it's important that you are able to communicate with people. While learning an entirely new language is unrealistic for most people, learning a couple of key phrases in the local language is not. Make sure to pick up a translation book before you travel so you can memorize important phrases.


Even if you aren't very good at speaking the language and only know a couple of words, locals in the country you're visiting will appreciate and respect the gesture.
Some common phrases tourists should learn are hello, goodbye, thank you, I need help, and do you speak English?While many countries teach English in primary school, don’t rely on it. The locals will appreciate it if you try to speak in their native tongue.;
, Countries will sometimes boast a wide variety of climates. Before you visit another region of your country, make sure that you know what the climate will be like so you can pack clothing that makes sense for the place you're visiting.Places in the south like Florida and New Mexico in the U.S. enjoy a mild climate during the winter and get extremely hot in the summer.
Countries in South America differ drastically, from warm dry climates to hot and humid ones., Being a good tourist includes being knowledgeable about the country or region you’re visiting. You also will want to find out what the local clothing looks like so you can dress appropriately.


When traveling domestically, wearing clothes that resemble the local style will help you fit in.
Figure out a couple of historic locations that you’d want to visit while you’re there and write them down in a list.
Research any events that are going on in the city or else you may miss out on a unique cultural experience., Different countries have different infectious diseases, so it’s important that you get vaccinated so you don’t contract or spread sickness to locals or other people visiting with you. For instance, when traveling to Thailand it’s recommended that you get a Typhoid vaccine. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention has an online tool that allows you to see what vaccines are recommended in certain countries., A tour guide is able to give you more intimate knowledge of the country or city you’re visiting. This know-how goes beyond what can be typically found in a guidebook or when searching online.You can ask your tour guide about local businesses or services you can use while you’re visiting.
Because your guide is likely a resident of the area, you can ask them about restaurants or bars that they prefer.

Check in early.,
Consider luggage insurance.,
Know the policies for connecting flights.,
Be ready for security.,
Keep your carry-on with you.,
Find the right carousel.",How to Avoid Lost Luggage2," Give yourself plenty of time. Get to the airport 90 minutes before a domestic flight, and two hours before an international flight. (Allow even more flexibility if you’re flying from an airport known for its backups, or traveling around a holiday.) You’ll be in less of a rush, which will give you peace of mind. Furthermore, the airline will have lots of time to get your bag to the right spot before your flight., You can often purchase additional luggage coverage by paying the airlines an added fee for a higher value for your luggage when you check in. Just let the check-in person know that you’d like to do this, then follow the steps they lay out. Make sure to have a credit card ready to pay additional fees.

, Some larger airports will pass your bags from flight to flight for you; other airports (especially smaller ones, but some large ones too) will require you to pick up your bag as you get off one flight and transfer it to the next.Make sure you know the particular policies of whatever airports you’re flying into. The people who check in baggage should be able to help if you have any questions.

, If you’re a careful packer, you’ve planned to put your travel documents in a safe place. Stay calm and don’t throw your carry-on belongings all over the place as you move through the security line. Make use of the bins to make sure you don’t lose track of small items like your phone or watch., Since all your most important items are in your carry-on, it makes sense to keep it with you at all times. Make sure it is zipped and secured, and carried close to your body. Leaving a bag by itself may attract thieves. Worse, someone might see it, assume it’s an explosive, and panic., When you are at the tail end of your journey, the flight attendants will probably announce the right claim for those picking up their baggage. If they don’t, there should be a screen that lists it. Go to the correctly numbered carousel and wait, but keep your ears open: sometimes airlines need to switch the claim they use. The airport will make an announcement if this is the case.

Be mindful of your speaking volume.,
Dress yourself according to the local customs.,
Participate in local festivals and parades.,
Respect the wildlife and don’t feed animals.,
Don’t litter under any circumstances.",How to Be a Good Tourist2," Different cultures have different views on what the acceptable speaking volume is, but one way to make locals really hate you is to speak loudly when in public. Try to keep your volume at acceptable levels, and avoid yelling in public.


In places like Japan, speaking loudly is a sign of disrespect.In Muslim countries, speaking loudly is also a sign of a disrespect., Dress according to local customs and be mindful of their religions which may look poorly upon some clothing choices.In many Muslim countries, it's customary for women to wear a hijab in public.France has a ban on any clothing that covers the face., Instead of being a spectator, you should be a participant when it comes to local events. Whenever you get an opportunity, you should be engaging with the people who live in the place you’re visiting.


When traveling domestically, many major cities celebrate different cultures and regions of the world in parades or festivals, that the public can attend.
The Macy's Thanksgivings Day parade happens every year in Manhattan New York and has been a tradition in the U.S. since 1924.The Holi festival is celebrated in India, Sri Lanka, and Nepal and is an event where people cover themselves in multi colored dyes.Carnival is a huge festival that happens in Venice, Italy each year and is one of the biggest costume and art celebrations in the world. , There’s a good chance that the indigenous animals that live in the country or region you’re visiting will be different than your local wildlife. However, this is not an excuse to feed or interact with them. Feeding wildlife can actually throw off the ecosystem and hurt and endanger the animals you’re feeding.As a result of tourists feeding monkeys in Morocco, the animals have become larger, more susceptible to disease, and more stressed.Feeding wild animals can also be incredibly dangerous if you’re not familiar with the species.
If you’re a hunter, make sure you are hunting legally in government designated areas.

, One of the biggest signs of disrespect in any country or region you're visiting is to throw trash on the ground. If you can’t find a waste bin close by, just keep the trash on you until you have the opportunity to properly dispose of it.


In Hong Kong, the penalty for littering or spitting is $1,500."

Buy locally made products and utilize local services that support the community.,
Try different cuisine and support local restaurants.,
Purchase local currency when traveling abroad.,
Talk and interact with local people.",How to Be a Good Tourist3," Seek out locally owned businesses and buy products or services from the people who live there. Do not fall victim to patronizing establishments that can be found in your home country or state because it feels comfortable.


Supporting the local economy will encourage people to appreciate tourism.
Take an interest in how products are being produced and the methods that they use. Many manufacturing methods in different countries are different than in the U.S.
Remember to keep in mind customs regulations when purchasing products overseas. You may not be able to take some products back to your country., Even if you’re not the type of person who enjoys trying new things, it’s important that you try the cuisine found in local restaurants. You don’t need to eat something you don’t like, but putting in the effort will show the local people that you respect their culture and are willing to try.


When traveling domestically, there can still be massive food variation from region to region.
Be careful of unsanitary conditions in under developed countries. Some of these countries may have different hygienic standards and their food may be unsanitary and could make you sick.Spread out your experiences over different restaurants in the area to get a full taste of the local food., While major credit cards are accepted overseas, it will make your experience richer if you purchase products in local currency. You'll be able to purchase things from street vendors and local businesses who take cash only, and get a more organic experience as a result.


Most major banks carry foreign currency which you can purchaseSome major banks offer international ATMs so you can withdraw cash in a foreign country.
Inform your bank, even when traveling domestically, so they don’t think there’s suspicious activity on your account.

, Even if you don’t understand the native language when traveling abroad, it’s important that you engage with the local culture to better your traveling experience. Even though this may not mean engaging in complex conversation, it could be doing business with a local shop owner, or celebrating local traditions.When traveling domestically, make it a point to go out of your way to talk to local people.
Sharing meals with people is a bonding experience that’s universal.
If you’re traveling in a group, don’t rely on people in your group. Do your own thing and experience different cultures.

Plan to do laundry during if your trip to Chicago will last three weeks or more.

,


This provides more room in a suitcase and clothes are less wrinkled.
Another trick to limit wrinkles is to roll clothing in tissue paper.
Stick shoes, belts and other rigid items in the outer edge of the suitcase.
Let no space go unused.

,


Packing heavier things on top and lighter things on the bottom allows the backpack to rest on your lower back, which is much more comfortable than having it cut into your shoulders.
Place items that you need most often at the top of a backpack or in one of the zippered pockets so they are most accessible.

,


Ask yourself what you know you will need, not what you think you might need.

,


Trip planning should always include plastic bags, such as Ziplocs. This keeps toiletries from leaking onto clothing. Plastic bags can later be reused for dirty clothes or garbage.

,


Everyone still has clothing if one suitcase is lost.

, Diaper bags are usually a safe place for important items. Things to keep with you might include:


Electronic items.
Visa or passport if you're coming from outside of the U.S.
Chewing gum may help your ears if you're flying.
Change of clothes for long flights.
Jewelry.
Identification, credit cards.
Prescription medication in original containers.
Tickets, travel itinerary and trip planning notes.
Important contacts and phone numbers.

,


Make one pair of shoes fancy and the other casual.
Save even more space by wearing one of the two pairs of shoes and packing the other.

,


You don't want anyone to know that your house will be empty, so a business card is a better choice than a home address.
Write your cell phone number and destination address on a self-adhesive label to stick inside your suitcase. This is helpful to the airline in case the baggage label comes off.

, Other items you might need when you travel to Chicago include:


Camera with additional memory, and if you're coming from outside the U.S., you may need an electrical adapter and plug converter.

Guidebooks and maps.",How to Pack for a Trip to Boston,"


Boston's weather has a reputation for unpredictability, so packing with layers in mind is usually a good idea.






Pack for a trip with at least 1 or 2 items of rain gear, such as a slicker, umbrella or waterproof shoes.






If you're planning a summer trip to Boston, bring sunglasses, sun block and perhaps a swimsuit for swimming in a hotel pool or at a Boston beach.






Travel to Boston can be fairly humid, so think about 100% cotton clothing for comfort.;
,


A good plan is packing one outfit for each day.






Plan to do laundry if your trip to Boston will last at least three weeks.






Some clubs have dress codes, so bring one dressy item.






Black is always a good color for dressing up.






Choose multipurpose clothing items for greater versatility and to save space when packing.







,


Be certain that everything has more than one function.






If it's not on your list, don't pack it.







, Use every space.


Folding takes up too much space in a suitcase and often adds wrinkles to clothing.






Stick shoes, belts and other rigid items in the outer edge of the suitcase.







,


Trip planning should always include plastic bags, such as Ziplocs. This keeps toiletries from leaking onto clothing. Plastic bags can later be reused for dirty clothes or garbage.







, That way, if the airline loses one suitcase, everyone still has clothing.

, Items you might want to keep close include:


Chewing gum to help your ears if you're flying.






Tickets, travel itinerary and trip planning notes.






Visa or passport if you're coming from outside of the U.S.






Identification, credit cards.






Electronic items.






Prescription medication in original containers.






Jewelry.






Thieves aren't usually tempted by diaper bags, so they can provide a safe place for important items.







,


Boston is geared toward walking, so you'll probably be doing lots of it.






Charming cobblestone streets can be murder on toes and high heels.







,






Camera with additional memory.






Batteries or chargers.






If you're coming from outside the U.S., you may need an electrical adapter and plug converter,

Know if you are going to use a carry on or a checked bag for a suitcase.,
Pick the right size.,
Keep in mind what you can carry.,
Try not to over-pack.,
Figure out the weather for your trip.,
Think about who you’re visiting.,
Lay out your clothes.,
Roll clothes instead of folding them.,
Bag your jewelry.,
Think about what hair supplies you really need.,
Remember, you can buy some things there.,
Pack the large items first.,
Fill the nooks and crannies with smaller items.,
Have the important things on you.,
Bring your purse.,
Bring things for entertainment.,
Remember airplane mode.",How to Pack for a Plane Ride As a Teen Girl," This will determine the amount and type of things you can bring.


Know that you will also have your purse as a second bag to fit some of the smaller essentials.
If you are planning on bringing full size liquids or aerosols, a carry-on is out of the question. You will need to check your bag if your containers are more than 100ml. Things such as perfume, shampoo, body lotion, and sunblock must be under the size limit.;
, Whether you decide on a carry-on or a checked suit case, think about what size you will need.


If you chose to bring a carry-on, it must fit within the dimensions outlined by the airline you’re using. Most bags will need to be under 22”x14”x9” for domestic flights. However, check with your airline before packing to be sure your bag is the right size because the allowed size differs from airline to airline. Most of the time, you can check the allowed size on the airline's website.
Think about the amount of clothes you will need to fit in the bag. Clothes will take up the majority of the space in your bag. Think about how many days you’ll be gone for, and therefore how many outfits you’ll need.
Depending on the time of the year and where you’re travelling to, you may need a different sized bag. Winter clothes take up more space than summer clothes.

, If you pack too heavily, you may have difficulty picking up your bag.


Shoes add weight quickly to luggage. Be smart about how many pairs, and what kind, of shoes you’ll need for you trip.
The luggage itself weighs a certain amount. If it has wheels, you will be able to carry more items than if you have to carry the bag on your shoulder.
Along with dimension limitations, most airlines have weight limitations for carry-on and checked bags. Check with your airline for these limits.

, It costs quite a bit to pay for another bag. Using compression bags to shrink clothes and other essentials you have is a good idea, although then you need to worry about the weight of your bags.

, Check the 10-day weather forecast. If your trip is longer than the time available, you can check for the weather, bring a few of your favorite fashion items for the weather you are planning to encounter, and otherwise bring blacks and neutrals. This makes it simpler to mix and match with clothing and make lots of different outfits.

, It matters when choosing clothes. If you’re visiting someone you are close to, you may be able to use their clothes.


If you are the same size as the person you are visiting, you can borrow their clothes. This works more easily for heavy things like jackets and sweatshirts. Ask them before you travel if you can borrow their clothes.
Are you going to buy clothes while you’re there? If so, you’ll need to leave some room in your suitcase for the return flight.

, Don’t pack directly out of your closet. Lay your clothes out in outfits on your bed to see everything you’re bringing.


Pants are re-wearable. It is easy to get a couple wears out of jeans before they are considered dirty or stretched out. Keep this in mind when you’re choosing your outfits.
Know what kind of things you’ll be doing. If you need a fancy dress, some hiking clothes, or anything in between, it’s important that you pack the right clothes.
Bring one extra outfit in case of emergency.

, Once you’ve picked out your outfits, roll the softer, wrinkle-resistant garments like T-shirts, cotton pants, and jeans. Rolling clothes will save space. Keep in mind that it may wrinkle your clothes, so fold clothes that you can’t have be wrinkled, like cotton dresses.
You can put rolled clothes inside your shoes as another space saver.

, Jewelry should be wrapped separately. Using separate baggies for each piece of jewelry will keep it from tangling while you travel.


You can spread these separate baggies out among your suitcase.
Keep pairs of earrings together just in case a baggie gets lost. An empty plastic-pill box is a great way to store earrings for travel.

, Hair supplies take up a lot of room. If the person you’re visiting has them, don’t bring double.


Hair straighteners, curling irons, and hair dryers are basic appliances that most girls have at home.
Specific sized wands, hairbrushes, or hair ties are more likely to have to travel with you.

, Toiletries add weight quickly to your bag. Go through the list and think about what you need to bring versus what you can buy there.


Toothpaste and toothbrush
Face wash
Deodorant
Body wash
Shampoo/Conditioner
Shaving cream and razor
Hand sanitizer
Body spray
Body lotion
Make-up
Sunblock.

, You’ll be able to tell early in your packing if you need a different sized bag, or if you need to remove some clothes from what you planned on bringing.


Rolled clothes and shoes should go on the bottom.
Place the folded items on top of the rolled items.
Alternate hem-lines to avoid uneven packing.

, Socks, jewelry, and accessories are perfect items to fill spots between clothes.


Stuff the cups of your bra with rolled up socks to help them keep shape.
Belts can easily line the perimeter of your bag.
Stuff your shoes with small items to save space.
Stick your underwear and socks in the sneakers, then put the shoes in a plastic bag, so that the rest of the luggage doesn't get dirty.
Stick your pillow in a compression bag. Squeeze the air out of the compression bag, then pack that between the two ridges in the middle.
Pack your solid toiletries in the front pouch, then stuff your quart-size bag of liquids into the little remaining space in your bag.
It is good if you have a little extra space, it is good for souvenirs, and if you are bringing a pet, you can put their food in.

, Just in case anything happens to your suitcase, keep all your expensive and important things in your purse.

, Your purse is usually your personal bag. All airlines will allow you to have a personal bag along with your carry-on suitcase. Make sure to keep all of your important, personal items in this bag because it will stay with you at all times. (If a plane’s overhead storage gets too full, the airlines will ask you to check your suitcase.)


Laptop
Passport/picture ID
Travelers checks
Wallet
Expensive jewelry
Phone
Chargers

, Along with your important items, you should pack some things to keep you entertained during the flight. If you’re on a long flight, they might offer you a choice of movies. More often, you’ll be on your own for entertainment.


Headphones
Puzzle book
Cards
IPod
Books
Magazines

, Just because you have your phone and laptop, doesn’t mean you’ll be able to use them. Some of your games and music sources won’t be available to you while you’re in the air. Having other sources of entertainment will come in handy.


More and more airlines are beginning to equip their planes with Wi-Fi for you while you’re in flight. This is only available through purchase on a credit card and ranges from $5-$28 per flight."

Consider location, location, location.,
Account for the length of your trip.,
Remember the essentials.,
Bring some sort of water bottle, or two.,
Prepare for severe weather.,
Pick appropriate footwear.,
Be prepared for anything.,
Don’t forget the fun stuff.,
Check the festival’s websites for banned items.,
Make sure your bag meets festival guidelines.,
Bring your tickets.",How to Pack for a Music Festival," Always think about where you’re going when you’re making a list of what to pack. You probably won’t need a winter coat if you’re headed to Florida, and you don’t want to wear fancy shoes if you’ll be stomping around in the dirt all day. Think about the weather and terrain of the festival’s location, and make your list accordingly.
, If the festival is in your area and you’re just going for the day, you only need to make a list for that one day (obviously). If you’re traveling out of town for a few days, include all of your vacation essentials on the list, then add in festival-specific items. You may even want to make two lists — one for your trip in general, and one for things you’ll bring to the festival itself.

Some items that you need for extended travel may be banned at the festival venue. Making a festival-specific list will make sure that you leave all your banned items back at the hotel (or your friend’s house or wherever you’re staying).

, There are a few things you carry with you no matter where you go, so don’t forget to add those to your list. These may seem too obvious, but you definitely don’t want to get to the festival and realize you forgot your wallet or cell phone. If you’re on any medications, remember to bring those too. If you’re staying in a hotel, remember things like toothbrushes and deodorant., Definitely check the festival’s website to make sure your water bottle is festival-friendly — there are almost always rules about what kind of water bottles and containers are allowed. But hydration is a must. Spending a full day on your feet outside can take its toll, especially if you’re dehydrated. This goes extra for hot climates.

If you’re pressed for space, look for a water bottle that can be flattened and folded when empty., Rain or shine, you should be ready. Check the weather the day of the festival, and pack accordingly. In case of rain, bring rain boots, a poncho, and an umbrella (but check with your venue first — many festivals ban umbrellas). If it’s going to be hot and sunny, pack sunscreen and extra water bottles. Hats and bandanas are also good options to consider., You’re going to be on your feet all day — this is not the time to break out the heels. Pack comfy shoes that can handle the wear and tear. Brand new shoes that aren’t broken in are probably not a good choice, but neither are old shoes that are threatening to fall apart at any moment., Consider adding some emergency supplies — you never know what kind of problems you’ll run into.Portable phone chargers can be a lifesaver if your phone goes dead during the day. If you have one, add it to the list. If not, you can buy one for fairly cheap.
Some basic first-aid supplies are never a bad idea. You can buy a travel first-aid kit or just throw in a few bandages.
If it’s summer or you’re headed somewhere with a lot of bugs, add some bug spray to the list.
For hot and sunny locales, bring sunburn relief products (that’s assuming you’ve already packed your sunscreen, too).
Throwing an extra pair of socks in your bag is generally a good move. That way if your socks get wet, you don’t have to suffer through the whole day with cold, wet feet.
Layers are your friend. Bring a light jacket or a sweatshirt, even if it’s warm. It may get colder during the night, and you can easily stow your extra clothes in your bag if you don’t need them.

, Getting dressed up for festivals tends to become an event in itself. If you know you have specific things you want to wear, make sure to add them to your list. Maybe it’s your favorite band tee, maybe it’s neon face paint — you do you., Most music festival websites include lists or guides that will tell you what items are/aren’t allowed in the venue. After you make your initial list, check it against the website to make sure you’re not bringing anything that isn’t allowed. It’s much easier to do your research beforehand than being turned away or having your stuff confiscated. Commonly banned items include outside food/beverages, professional cameras, explosives, weapons, and glass or metal containers., Another thing that festivals often specify is what kind of bags are allowed. There may be size limits, or certain styles may be banned. You don’t want to risk being turned away, so make sure to stow your stuff according to festival rules., Last, but not least: check, double check, and triple check to make sure you’ve packed your tickets. What’s worse than getting to the music festival of your dreams and then realizing you forgot your tickets? Nothing; that’s what. Now go have the time of your life."

, On a road trip it is extremely important to keep some sort of food that you can snack on to keep you going, especially if you aren't stopping to go to a shop or restaurant. Bring a mixture of healthy and unhealthy foods that you like to keep you interested (i.e. potato chips, whole wheat muffin, carrot sticks, candy, plantain chips, gum, granola bar, almonds, brownie). Make sure to bring foods that travel well and always bring a bottle of water.

, You never know if your hands get dried out from the wind or if its cold in the car so some lotion will be really handy for whenever that happens

, Your lips may tend to get chapped after long hours in the car, so take an un-scented lip balm in case you get carsick of the fragranced one. Also some lip gloss so it will compliment your look.

, Items such as hand gel or hand wipes will be really useful for cleaning sticky or smelly hands if you had a stain along the way.

, During the road trip you don't want to be exhausted of boredom so you could just whip out an article and read to pass through time.

, If it gets chilly on the way back bring some sort of cover up to keep you warm.

, This can range from an MP3 player to an iPod to a smartphone to a laptop or tablet. If you're going on a family road trip, this is especially important to block out the annoying oldies music and sibling squabbles.

, Weight limits depend on the airline, and what exactly you need depends on how long you will be staying, but make sure the case is within the weight limit. If not, you could end up paying extra for extra luggage.

, If your case is too heavy, decide what to remove. Alternatively, move some things into a fellow traveller's case. If your case is over the limit, move some items into a family members case (if theirs is underweight).

, Search up on something about the holiday and enjoy the last day while in your home country.

Create a list of what to pack for a trip to Buenos Aires.,
Limit your packing to luggage you can comfortably carry.,
Think of extra items you might need:


First aid kit.,
Pack comfortable shoes.,
Plan packing to include casual dress-up clothes, such as slacks and skirts, in addition to jeans and t-shirts.,
Bring appliances and electronics that you can't live without on your trip to Buenos Aires.,
Use a backpack if you want your hands free.,
Use of plastic bags for packing toiletries in order to save clothing from any spills or leaks.,
Split family clothing between various suitcases so, if one suitcase is lost, everyone still has clothes.

",How to Pack for a Trip to Buenos Aires,"


Check Buenos Aires weather reports.
Remember that the seasons are opposite when you travel to South America from the Northern Hemisphere (U.S., Europe, etc.).
Buenos Aires has summer from December to February. Pack for a day at the beach.
The rain is usually most frequent in Buenos Aires during February, March and October.;
,


Place most of your clothing in the larger suitcase.
Valuables, papers (including a valid passport), medication and one change of clothing should go into a smaller bag that will be your carry-on bag at the airport.

,
Diarrhea medicine.
Insect repellent.
Guidebooks and maps.
Camera with additional memory.
A good hat or bandanna.

, There's a lot of walking when you travel to South America.


Most women in Buenos Aires prefer flats to heels.
Keep shoes to no more than two pair in order to make room for clothing.

,


Bring a light jacket or sweater for cooler night temperatures and winter.
If you're traveling during the summer, look for 100% cotton. You'll be more comfortable in clothing that breathes.
If you're going somewhere fancy at night, you'll want to pack an outfit suitable for nightlife.

,


Items like blow dryers and curling irons are very expensive.
Packing a voltage converter is necessary if you're coming from the U.S., which uses 110 volts of electricity. Buenos Aires uses 220.
Add a plug-in adapter in case you need to alter the shape of a plug.

,


Pack heavier things on top and lighter things on the bottom to allow the backpack to rest on your lower back, which is much more comfortable than having its straps cut into your shoulders.
Place items you need most often at the top of a backpack or in one of the zippered pockets so they are accessible.

,


Use travel size or small containers for toiletries.
Unless you're tied to certain types of shampoo, consider waiting to buy most of your toiletries in Buenos Aires.

,"
"
Find out information about your destination, including the weather conditions, typical local standards of dress, and what items can be purchased at a reasonable cost at your destination.

,
Choose clothing in basic colours.,
Work out how many different outfits can be made using the chosen clothes.,
Choose three pairs of shoes.,
Consider offloading clothing.,
Keep accessories to a minimum.",How to Pack for a Long Trip2,", Follow a unified colour scheme.


For example, choose bottoms in black or khaki, with a matching sweater or jacket if appropriate. This will allow you to take a smaller number of clothes.






Choose tops that will match all bottoms. As tops are generally lighter than pants, you will be able to pack a few more without adding extra weight.






Generally, three bottoms (black or khaki cotton pants, dress pants, and jeans) should be sufficient, with three long sleeved shirts, one to two sweaters, a jacket, and a few t-shirts to layer under clothing.







, You may surprise yourself considerably!

, One for walking, one for business/formal wear and one for the weather you'll be encountering.


Consider hiring or buying boots if you encounter snow or wet environments. These can be too heavy to cart around on a long trip. All sports boots or shoes should be hired.






Flip flops cost nothing. Buy them when you're in the country or area rather than dragging them along with you. Then leave them behind when you're done.







, If you're doing a round-the-world trip, you are likely to encounter all sorts of weather, including cold, wet, hot and dry. This makes carrying clothing a bit of a logistical nightmare. What can make it easier is to either send home clothing mid-way, especially after cold country visits, or decide to give it away to people before leaving the country.


Choose clothing you don't mind giving up if you're going to give it away. Perhaps select a wardrobe of items you're never going to wear again, but are close to being donated anyway. Or, do a deliberate shop at the thrift store to purchase gear only for the trip and to be given away as you go. You won't be so invested in it that way but do be sure to choose stuff that looks fabulous on you, or you'll regret taking it with you.







, Don't travel with valuable jewelry unless you want to advertise the theft opportunity. Leave that stuff at home. Take only what is useful, such as a watch, a money holder, a scarf, a hat, etc.


Consider buying accessories as light, easily carried mementos of your trip. You can wear them and bring them home that way.







"
"
Consider what non-clothing items you will need.,
Consider how much of your digital devices can manage all the tasks with just one machine.,
Get small chargers that can charge various of the same things at once.,
Pile your favorite books onto the eReader.,
Consider whether you need food supplies.",How to Pack for a Long Trip3," When working this out, always choose the bare minimum. You do not want to be marring your trip with a bunch of unnecessary stuff that you're constantly worried about losing.

, A smartphone or an iPad can do the work of many gadgets at once, making it easier to take less with you. Attach a keyboard to either and you've got your word processor too, all for a lot less weight than a laptop.

, That way, you carry less and have less cords and chargers to remember to repack each time.

, No more carting heavy piles of books around, and you're always assured of a huge reading list, wherever you are.

, If you have a specific diet or medical condition, you might need some specialized food. Try to choose items that bring the most bang for weight, and find out in advance if you can get your specialist dietary needs wherever you're traveling. Use the internet to help you.

"
"
Roll your soft gear.,
If toiletries are readily available at a reasonable price at your destination, consider buying them there, and only take a few days supply with you.,
Lay everything you're taking out on the bed.",How to Pack for a Long Trip4," Generally clothing that is rolled takes up less space than folded clothing. You may also wish to investigate ""bundling"" techniques when packing. Pack smaller items in ziplock bags, press down to remove any excess air. This compresses items into a smaller package.

,


Always place liquids inside resealable bags. These will contain any leaks that might occur. Leaks are inevitable when flying, due to pressure changes, so don't take any chances.






How much makeup do you really need? Mineral makeup can make it easier to have one or two items do many different contouring, highlighting and concealing jobs all at once, rather than carrying all the different containers.







, Remove anything that seems as if you could live without it. Then take a photograph of it all on your smartphone. That way, you'll have a permanent visual record of what you've packed; no need to remember any lists when repacking at each hotel, campground or resort.

Bring a place for dirty clothes.",How to Pack Clothes in a Suitcase," When you're packing a suitcase, you can't afford to take your whole wardrobe, so be judicious. You want to be able to include the most useful and reusable clothes for a short period of time on your trip. Bring only items that you'll be able to wear a few times without needing to worry about washing them, or looking like you're unkempt.


For example, you'll probably want to bring a jacket that is suitable for most weathers instead of bringing one for rain, one for cold weather, and others for various purposes. Bring clothes that can be worn for most occasions.
If you can, try to only bring one pair of shoes. Taking extra shoes tends to take up too much space and can cram your suitcase. When in doubt, go with a good pair of sturdy all-purpose shoes.;
, Wherever you're going, and for whatever length of stay, you need enough socks and underwear for each day of your trip. You can always get away with re-wearing a t-shirt if you can't do a wash, so you need to make sure you've got enough underclothes to cover the entire trip.


If you're going somewhere long term, it's usually a good idea to bring at least five or seven pair of socks and underwear to keep yourself from having to find laundry facilities more often than every week.

, You might not need to bring any heavy fleeces for your beach trip, but then again, the Atlantic coast gets awfully cold in winter. What kind of weather are you likely to encounter on your trip? Research the typical weather and bring clothes accordingly.


It's always good to have layers, even if you're expecting good weather. You don't want to get caught in unexpected downpours and have no clothes to prepare for it.

, Packing to go to a wedding is obvious–you're going to need some nice clothes. But what about a family reunion? A vacation? Will it all be shorts and sandals, or will you need something nice for an evening out? Make sure you plan ahead and know about any pre-planned formal events that will require a certain quality of items.


A good sweater is a versatile choice. It can help keep you warm in the event of cold weather, and can look formal enough for a nicely dressed evening, plus it's way more portable than a full suit or another dress.

, Pack all of your bathroom essentials into one toiletry bag, preferably something with a hook that you could hang on the towel bar. It's also sometimes desirable to use a waterproof bag for toiletries, so nothing gets wet in transit.


If you think that your bottles of shampoo might leak, just tape the cap individual bottles, then remove it when you arrive.
If your vacation is between one to two weeks long, don't bring those huge toothpaste squeezers. Opt for the travel size. If you use an electric toothbrush, small ones can also be purchased in most stores.

, The best suitcases for packing clothes should be lighter and with plenty of space for all the items you'll need. Older or traditionally hard cases are extremely limited in capacity and can be quite heavy. Thinner material suitcases can fit more items that it seems, because material stretches. If you've got a rolling suitcase, all the better for your back.

, One excellent way of saving space and organizing at the same time is to think of your bag in terms of different layers. Lay down a layer of heavier rolled items, like jeans, sweaters, and light jackets, packing them in as tightly as they'll go. This not only minimizes wasted space, it also prevents the rolls from coming undone during transit.


If you have any fragile items that aren't being brought as carry-on, place them in the center of the bag on top of the heavy-roll layer to protect the items from breakage.

, On top of the bottom layer of heavy items, place delicate or formal items that need to remain folded. This will allow easier access to them upon arrival for unfolding and hanging. You can also place these items in a dry cleaner bag to help prevent wrinkling, if necessary.

, The next layer should consist of lighter rolled items like t-shirts and undergarments, tightly packed to prevent unrolling. This is typically the best way to get these items to fit in the bag, since it's not necessary for them to remain creased. Rolling helps to keep these items compact and easy to pack. It also helps to nest the items in at the last minute, if necessary.

, Any additional lightweight item like underwear, belts, socks, and other smaller items should then be crammed into any available nook or cranny to help stabilize the packing. If it doesn't matter if it gets crammed, cram it.


Your shoes are excellent opportunities to nest items in unused space. Always make use of additional zippers, sacks, and little nooks in your particular suitcase to get the most space out of it.

, Put your toiletry bag on top of the clothes, then simply close the suitcase lid and you're done. If you can't get the zipper to close, it's important to avoid struggling and risking ripping the fabric or breaking the zipper. Use pressure to force the lid down as far as possible, if necessary, but if it won't go, it won't go. Don't force it and risk having to go buy a new suitcase at the last minute.

, Check with your airline for baggage and weight limits before packing to make sure you don't have a crisis at the airport, if you're flying. Some airlines will allow you to check two bags for free under a certain weight, while most only allow for one checked bag under a certain weight. Some airlines charge for checking any baggage and there are additional fees for excess weight.


It's also a good idea to check carry on restrictions. TSA has limited all passengers to one carry-on item and one personal item, which can include a purse, small backpack, camera bag or book bag. You typically do not have to pay for carry on.

, If you're going to be living out of your suitcase for a while, it's a good idea to make the most important items, or the most useful items easily accessible so that you can get them quickly without having to unpack everything. What's most important for your trip will likely depend on you and your trip, so plan accordingly for yourself.

, Some travelers like to use mesh or netted bags to keep all your things in place in certain groups. For example, you could pack all your pajamas, underwear, and miscellaneous things in one mesh bag. Then you can have another for your shirts, and another for your pants. This keeps everything organized and easy to find, as well as easy to repack when it comes time.

, If you're feeling particularly type-A, it's also possible to plan out your individual outfits to keep them packed by day. If you're a planner, go ahead and figure out what you'd like to wear for each day of the trip and pack the pants and the shirts you're going to wear, rolled up together, or included in the same mesh bag. When the time comes, you can unroll the outfit or the bag and your'e ready to go.

, Bring an extra mesh bag for laundry, to help keep your dirty clothes separate from your clean clothes. This way you don't have to wash the clothes yourself on your trip, or you can have them all corralled in one place if you do have to make a trip to the laundromat.

If you live in North America, you may decide to fly into a major city in the country, such as Santiago, and then take public transit to get around or fly within Chile. If you live in South America, it may be possible to take a bus or a train into Chile, depending on your budget and your timeframe for the trip.There is no special visa required for you to travel into Chile and no fee to cross the border into Chile. However, you will need your passport to enter the country.;
, Next, determine where you are going to stay while you are travelling through Chile. The cheapest option is staying at youth hostels, where dorms are around 6,5000 Chilean Peso (CLP) or 10 dollars USD a night. Many hostels offer free breakfast and free WiFi. You can also stay at budget hotels, which often start at 25,000 to 35,000 CLP or 40 to 50 dollars USD a night.You can also try finding accommodations through rental sites like Airbnb, which is often available in larger cities in Chile, like Santiago.
If you enjoy camping, you can camp with your own tent on campgrounds throughout the country for around 7,000 CLP or 10 dollars USD per night.

, Determine how much money you plan to spend on the trip, from your accommodations to your transportation to food to excursions and sightseeing. Chile is pretty budget friendly and you can likely do a lot with a decent amount of money set aside for the trip. You may create a daily spending amount to ensure you stay in budget. A daily budget of $40-$65 a day all in will likely get you far in Chile, especially if you’re good with travelling on the cheap.Consider what kind of traveller you are as you make the budget. If you are a traveller who likes being thrifty, you may be able to get by on a lower daily budget. If you are a traveller who prefers a fancy accommodation or who is willing to splurge on food, you may end up with a higher daily budget.
Make sure you set aside a small amount of money in your budget as an emergency fund. Having a few hundred dollars as a reserve will ensure you are not strapped for cash while you are travelling.

, Do a search online for the top destinations and sights in Chile so you do not miss anything on your trip. Plan to spend time in Santiago, the capital city, and visit San Marco’s Cathedral in the northern city of Arica. Check out Easter Island, the most isolated inhabited island on earth as well as Torres del Paine National Park, where you can see the Andes and the Patagonian steppe. There are many great sights in Chile so you may narrow down your options by interest and budget.If you are a Pablo Neruda fan, visit his homes, which have become historic sites scattered throughout Chile. If you enjoy wine, you may do a wine tour and sample some of the best wine at Chilean vineyards.

, To ensure you see everything you want to see during your trip, and to budget your time well, make a daily travel plan. Note where you will stay on each day of your trip and list a few planned activities for the day. You may also identify a few options to eat in the area so you are not stranded without a meal during your trip.You should also think about how you travel from one area or sight to another. Do research beforehand to determine if there is public transit or other transportation you can take to a specific area.
If you plan to do any guided tours during your trip to Chile, book them in advance so you have a reserved spot. You can often get the best prices by booking tours in advance.

, Chile can be cool in the mornings and evenings and warmer in the afternoon, especially in spring, fall, and winter. If you are travelling during these times, make sure you pack warm layers like a long sleeve sweater or a light, breathable jacket. Bring undershirts made of wicking material to ensure you do not get too cold when you sweat during the day in the heat.You should also pack long pants and shorts so you can alternate based on the weather. Santiago, the capital city of Chile, is known for being conservative so you may pack a scarf or a shawl to cover up if needed.

, Bring a day pack so you can leave your luggage in your hostel or hotel. This could be a small backpack or a purse. Make sure you can wear the backpack on your front comfortably and that the purse can be held close to your body. This will deter pickpockets, which may be present in certain areas in Chile.Look for a day pack that has a hidden pocket in the back for your travel documents, such as your passport or your citizenship card.

, Avoid pulling out a wallet to pay for goods and services in Chile, as this can encourage pickpockets. Invest in a money belt or a small pouch you can wear around your neck to carry your money. Try to keep only immediate cash in the money belt so you do not have to pull out a large amount of money every time you pay for something.Make sure you leave any other valuables locked up in your hostel or hotel. Carrying them with you puts you at a higher risk of theft.

, As you travel around Chile, you will likely walk a lot in major cities and in natural settings. Be prepared by packing good walking shoes that have traction and arch support. You may pack one pair of athletic shoes for walking in urban areas and one pair of hiking shoes for going in natural settings, especially if you are planning to do hikes or strenuous walks.Make sure you do not overpack or overstuff your luggage, especially if you are planning to backpack through Chile. Shoes often weigh the most in a backpack so try to limit yourself to one to two pairs of shoes, if possible.

, Though some locals do speak English, Spanish is the main language in Chile. To make getting around easier, learn some key Spanish phrases before your trip, such as “Hello,” “How much?,” “Can you help me?,” and “Where is the bathroom?” Practice these phrases so you are ready to use them during your trip.You may try to connect with a local in Chile who speaks Spanish so they can help you get around easier, such as a host at your rental. You can also try to make local friends, as they will speak Spanish and can help translate for you.

, As a solo traveller, you may try connecting with other travellers so you can experience certain sights together. You may make friends with travellers at your hostel or your budget hotel. Perhaps you connect with people in Chile online and meet up in person to explore an area together.Connecting with other travellers can help you feel more safe, especially when you are walking in areas that seem dicey or at night in major cities. Your travel experience may also be that much more fun if you experience it with new friends.

, Though Chile is considered a safe country to travel to alone overall, there are certain areas in Santiago and other major cities that may not be safe. Avoid walking alone at night in these areas. Walk with a friend or join a group of people so you are not walking alone.Another option is to take public transit or a taxi home instead of walking. Taxis are common in major cities in Chile and are not too expensive for a short trip.

, To ensure your location is known to others, stay in contact with family and friends back home. Do weekly or daily email updates and use social media to stay in touch. Make sure a friend or family member knows your plan for the day, especially if you are going out alone. This will ensure that if anything happens, someone will know where you are.


You may bring a cellphone that you can use in Chile with you on your trip so you can stay in contact with loved ones back home. You may also pack your laptop so you can take advantage of the free wifi at your hostel or hotel and keep in touch with loved ones through Skype or FaceTime.

If you are visiting areas in both Chile and Argentina, flying into one and out the other will save you a day of backtracking.,
Learn a little bit of Spanish before arriving in the region.,
Bring clothes for warmth and even for heat if you are traveling during summer.,
Take into account a “fauna calendar” and choose months to travel according to your needs.,
Be informed about the real distances between main attractions.,
Don´t rent a small car if you decide to go through inner landscape.,
Don´t expect to find mobile signal everywhere.,
Take cash with you.,
For some accommodations it is necessary to book in advance.,
Be cautious if you follow a special diet and decide to visit areas off the main circuits.",How to Travel to Patagonia," There shouldn't be a penalty in airfares for doing this but double check to make sure. For example, you can take American Airlines from New York to Buenos Aries (there are two airports in Buenos Aries, EZE and AEP, one typically for domestic flights and one for international flights), Aerolineas Argentinas from Buenos Aries to El Calafate, and Lan Chile from Punta Arenas to Santiago, Chile and from Santiago to New York.;
, Speaking at least a few phrases will increase your experience with local people. Patagonians are friendly people but many of them don´t speak English at all. Do not expect to be able to find someone who can translate for you. Welsh is also useful in Chubut river low valley.

, Temperatures can really get over 20 °C (68 °F) even in the furthest latitudes, in particular in the coastal region. Be also equipped for sudden temperature drops and rainfall while traveling in the mountains.


Patagonia is well known for its wind!
The sun can be very strong and there is less ozone above in this part of the world to protect you from the sun here so liberal use of sunscreen (with a high SPF) is recommended.

, E.g. December is not the best month to watch whales although can be ideal to enjoy Andean flowers or take the best mountain trails.

, This is an immense region twice the size of Italy and England, together!

, Gravel roads are pretty rough in several places and there are not so many villages in between some routes. A 4-wheel drive vehicle (i.e. a Jeep Cherokee) will not be as punishing.


Some towns only have one gas station and there could be well over a 100 miles (160 km) between towns (i.e. El Calafate to El Chalten) so plan ahead. Also, not all gas stations are open 24 hours a day. Alternatively, take the bus. Many areas in Patagonia are linked by regular bus service. Most trekkers use this form of transportation and given the low quality of the roads in this area, leaving the driving to someone else might be a good idea. It is also a reasonably priced option.
You will need special paperwork to cross the border in a rental car. Crossing at Cancha Carrera is fairly painless and probably much faster than crossing near Puerto Natales.

, Even some famous tourist destinations, like El Chaltén in The Glaciers National Park, don´t have one. There can be very little infrastructure between towns and that may be a reason to carry a satellite phone, as there is no cell coverage outside of larger towns and very few services available to help you if you break down. If you rent a satellite phone before you leave, try it out before leaving for Patagonia to make sure you understand how to use it (it is different from a cell phone) and that the unit works.

, If you are traveling around by car, in some areas it's hard to find an ATM.

, E.g. Some ranches or “estancias” within Santa Cruz province don´t have many rooms and are located far away from food supplier chains. They´ll be grateful if you do so.


Hotels in the Torres del Paine have their own electrical generators and use satellite phones as there seems to be no alternative. Hotels in Torres del Paine book up early!
If you stay at the Costa Australis hotel in Puerto Natales, don't open the windows at night for fresh air or a large number of insects will enter your room!

, It could be hard to find a variety of vegetables or fruit. In general it can be hard to be a vegetarian in this part of the world. You probably won't have any problems within the tourist villages or most populated regions set mainly in the north, however. In El Calafate, El Chalten, Puerto Natales, and Punta Arenas there are a multiple of restaurants and/or food markets.

Belo proper has a population of about 2 1/2 million with the greater metropolitan area reaching approximately 5 million. The ethnic makeup of the population is diverse contributing to a wide range of skin tones. A good share of the population has Italian roots. Catholicism is the predominant religion even though Protestant churches and spiritism are also found.;
, The principal airport is found approximately 38 kilometers (24 mi) from downtown Belo. It serves many domestic and international flights, making the city quite accessible. You can rent a car if you like but it isn't vital. A large amount of taxis, scores of buses and an effective train system make reaching every place in the city easy.

, The city has a tropical savannah climate with an annual median low of 9 and high of 35 °C (95 °F). Spring commences in September whereas summer starts in the month of December, autumn in March, and winter in June. The climate is nice during most of the year. Nevertheless, one should note that it is ""coldest"" in July and hottest in January. Also, Belo receives the greatest volume of rain in December and January. The middle of the year is really dry.

, The state of Minas Gerais is renowned for its excellent food. Being a modern metropolis, Belo Horizonte presents vacationers with the finest in international and local cuisines that are both delectable and affordable. One of the favorite local dishes is tutu. A few of the main ingredients are black beans, pork sausage, garlic, onions, tomatoes and manioc flour. There are many versions of this local treat and all are outstanding in flavor. If you are not into the local cooking, several restaurants in Belo serve the basic foods and international dishes that are sure to please your taste buds.

, Being a big urban center in a remarkably productive nation, Belo Horizonte is also known for having big shopping malls and markets that sell a large selection of goods and services. The Alta Vista Shopping Mall is among the most visited in the city for it provides lots of things to do, recreational areas and the luxury of browsing in high-end and niche establishments. BH Shopping was the first large-scale shopping centers in the city, built years ago but still supplies the same merchandise of excellent caliber.

, The neighborhood of Pampulha is a popular destination because of its different recreational areas and galleries. In particular, tourists should check out the Museu de Arte da Pampulha - The Pampulha Museum of Art. It was designed by the notable Oscar Niemeyer. It is also referred to as the Crystal Palace. Additionally, there is a zoo in this district that both young and old can enjoy. Another attraction is the Praça Sete de Setembro - 7th of September Square which is located in the center of the city. An obelisk was built there in observance of the centenary of the Independence of Brazil. The Church of Saint Joseph was constructed in 1910 and showcases Dutch features and form. Murals and artwork of a prominent artist beautify the interior of this magnificent church building. Finally, travelers will surely want to consider the program for Chevrolet Hall. This venue presents performances of well-known singers, festivals, trade fairs, art expositions, plays and several other activities during the year.

, Brazilians are known to be hospitable and friendly, so in Belo, you will probably find locals who are eager to help in any situation. There are also good hospitals and clinics around the city where you can get assistance, if needed. Belo is a large urban center. As such, crime and violence is much higher than in rural areas. However, this is true of any large city. Use common sense and you should be fine. One basic principle is to try not to do or wear things what will draw unnecessary attention to yourself.

, Learning a few phrases in Brazilian Portuguese can go a long way. Not only will it help you communicate better, it will open doors to making new friends.

Take a breather when you need.",How to Adapt to Brazilian Culture," Show your respect to Brazilian culture by learning at least basic Portuguese. True, English is spoken in many of the larger cities, but because Brazil as a whole is so diverse, Portuguese is the go-to as most people understand it.


There are a number of apps, YouTube videos, and websites (wikiHow included) that can facilitate your language acquisition – without the hefty fees of a CD program, like Rosetta Stone. Do a few quick searches online and start teaching yourself if shoving out a chunk of change isn't your style.;
, To fit in, it’s imperative to know how to greet people. The “air kiss” is stereotypical: one in some contexts, two in others. It's more of a cheek bounce than anything, though. Don't try to lip-lock a local!


Word of warning: Paulistanos (those from São Paulo) kiss-greet only on the right cheek. Cariocas (those from Rio de Janeiro) do their greeting with two kisses (beijos), one on each cheek. If you don’t know how many to give, pause after the first kiss. The other person then will or won’t initiate the second. , Many foreigners come to Brazil and are shocked by how late they eat – 8 PM is pretty normal for the start of a long, casual dinner. Taking a siesta or spending hours to eat are totally accepted, normal, and, in fact, important to life in Brazil.


This is mirrored in all of life in Brazil. They naturally take everything easy and go at a slower rate. At first it will seem strange, but after getting used to it, you'll never want to go to the harried pace that's overtaken the West.

, ""Feijoada"" (black beans and pork stew) and ""Churrasco"" (all you can eat barbecue) are sure bets. In the state of Minas Gerais, try dozens of kinds of cheese with doce-de-leite (custard-like paste) and homemade jams.


Craving a taste of the West? Ordered a pizza? While the pizza in Brazil is very, very good, it’s also different. It will come with olive oil drizzled on top, and mayo and ketchup for dipping.
Do not always buy snacks at the beach because there's a possibility of food poisoning. On the other hand, drinking in public on the beaches is perfectly normal and allowed.

, In Rio, you’ll likely see fabulous colors donned by both men and women (though women in particular). But in the south and in the interior of the country, people tend to be a bit more conservative.


If you’re in a business setting, wear a full suit if you’re a man or a women (for women, skirts are acceptable). This is true even if it’s a whopping 43°C (110°F). And in church or government buildings, don’t wear shorts, tank tops, flip-flops, or a miniskirt – you won’t be allowed in. But everywhere else, just about everything goes.
Let your body acclimate. Don’t always turn the air conditioning on (if you have it). The more your body experiences the heat, the easier it will be to take. The extreme heat and humidity can tire a person very quickly. Allowing your body to adjust to the different weather is important for thriving in Brazil.

, Pedestrians do not have the right of way, especially in larger cities. Those crosswalks and signs you’re seeing? Most of those are considered as decorations to the drivers. Always be on the lookout – you may not necessarily be stopped for.


Avoid the commuter hours if you can, whether you're on foot, in a car, or using public transit. Imagine LA or New York at 5 pm, and that’s Brazil more often than not. If you need to get somewhere by a specific time, allow a lot of extra time for traffic.
This also means you’ll be dealing with loads and loads of pollution, at least in the big cities. Plan rural escapes to get away and literally get a breath of fresh air when you need it.

, The average Brazilian has three religions: futebol, dancing, and Christianity. Deadline at work? It can wait until the game is over. Friday night? They'll be out dancing at their favorite club. And as for when things get tough, 88% of them turn to a Christian God. If you want to be in the mind of a Brazilian, try out these 3 things. Take time out to go to a game, go dancing, and participate in a mass. You'll fit right in!


For the record, 73% of Brazilians are Catholic, and 15% of Brazilians are Protestant.""Catholic"" also encompasses regional religions like Umbanda and Candomble.
They don't literally have three religions – these are just three things Brazilians really, really, really take to heart. Brazil would not be the same without any one of these three ways of life.

, It’s traditional to bring the hostess flowers or a small gift. Orchids are considered a very nice gift, but make sure to avoid purple ones. In fact, avoid giving the host anything purple or black – these are mourning colors.


Don't give handkerchiefs, either – they are associated with funerals and do not make good gifts.
For the record, the gifts will be opened when received, right in front of you.Be at least a half hour late! When they say come over for dinner at 7:30, they don’t mean it. Even an hour late is fine. They likely won’t be ready for you anyway!

, Brazilians are notoriously chill. Have a deadline at work? No big deal if you’re late. Two hours late to dinner? No problem (that’s normal). Need to get something done? Wait till the last minute and then rely on your luck – Brazilians do, and they call it “jogo de cintura.” They believe that everything will be fine in the end.The hardest part of this won't be doing it yourself, it'll be remembering that everyone else does it. When you make plans with a friend, you'll have to keep in mind that they won't be on time. It's easy to get frustrated, sure. However, you will get on ""Brazilian time"" eventually.

, Expat women generally find it harder to adapt to Brazilian culture than men. There’s a large machismo culture in Brazil, which most men don't find too hard to adapt to. However, women are largely expected to take on submissive, traditional roles.Needless to say, Brazil can still make strides in its gender equality.


If you're a woman, think about this. Is it something you can deal with? It's not the Middle East, but it will be something you ""have to put up with"" if you're used to a more gender-equal lifestyle.

, Need to get your visa renewed? Give it a few weeks, and don’t be surprised if it’s difficult to get back. There’s generally a lot of red tape when dealing with official paperwork, and as you’ve seen, Brazilians don’t care much for a “sense of urgency.”


This is another aspect of the ""don't worry about it"" mentality. It's the same for the government! As long as you give everything more than adequate time, you should be fine in the paperwork arena. Try to account for lateness when possible.

, Many expats make a good living in Brazil, being able to afford at-home help and taking trips often, and often overseas. However, there are a few differences in Brazilian culture, and, believe it or not, some things will be ‘’more expensive.’’


Stock up on your children’s toys ‘’outside’’ of the country. They are, in general, around four times as much due to duties and demand.Have a bit of money on hand for the parking people, or flanelinha. This is the guy that’s ushered your car to its spot, if even that. You may see him pop up next to your window never having seen him before. But everyone pays them anyway – it keeps the economy moving!

, Think America is bad? Brazil has embraced plastic surgery with open arms. And no one is ashamed! In fact, they’ll likely let you know what you should get done, too.


They're fairly open about their opinions on your weight, hair, and look, too. If they think they have a good idea to make you more attractive, they'll likely let you know. Try your best not to take it personally – they do mean well in their own way.

, Assimilating to a culture’s ways is a very important part of feeling like you fit in and feeling “at home.” Embrace their traditions and etiquette to get a feel for their way of life and to truly experience the country. However, if something doesn’t make sense to you, don’t do it! You still have your own mind. No culture is better than any other, and therefore their way of life doesn't necessarily have to be adopted.


Take traffic rules, for example. If you see a pedestrian timidly crossing the street, you may wish to resist that Brazilian influence growing inside of you and let him or her pass. Never compromise safety or your happiness just to fit in.

, Going to Brazil on your own can, at least initially, be very daunting. To make the transition easier, find other expats to help pad the culture shock. They are going through the same thing, or have at one point or another.


They can point you to all the wonderful ""bits of home"" they've cultivated. Brazil is huge and multicultural – you'll be able to find certain comforts (brand names, certain foods, etc.) if you know where to look.

, In addition to expat friends, you need native friends, too, to show you the ropes. They’ll know all the happening spots, the best places to get food, and show you a side of the country that expats aren’t able to. They'll be the ones that give you the most memorable stories, too.


Don't know where to start? You can meet people hanging out at cafes, clubs, at futbol games, or through your students if you teach them your language. What's more, some families love taking in foreigners. Next time a friendly looking older woman smiles at you, initiate a conversation just by saying hello and asking her name. You may be a few minutes away from a home-cooked meal!

, Many expats take trips back home often, or at least take many opportunities to travel. The pollution may get to you if you're in a bigger city, so you’ll literally need some fresh air!


Listen to your body and mind – when are things starting to get to you? It’s then that you need to take a break from life – that way you can come back rejuvenated and ready to go.
If Brazil does start getting to you, sleep on it. Don't write it off quite yet. Sometimes homesickness seems like it's staying forever, but it can be fought through. The rewards, stories, and memories will be virtually limitless if you stay!

Decide what you will realistically need for your trip.,
Consider the absolute essentials.,
Think about which toiletries you will need.,
Consider what you'll be wearing.,
Think about the gear that you'll need.,
Think about what you'll need to entertain yourself.,
Pare down your list.",How to Pack Efficiently2," Write each item out in a list to help you visualize the contents of your pack. Think about where you're going, how long you'll be gone, and what you need to maintain a comfortable quality of life while you're on your trip. If you're not absolutely sure that you will need something, consider leaving it behind. Unless you're traveling somewhere especially remote, you'll be able to buy most non-essential or emergency items while you're on your trip.

, Identification, medication, money, food. How will you get around, how will you survive, and what will you need in an emergency?


Think about what, if any, identification you will need: a passport, a driver's license, a work visa, a backcountry permit, a return ticket? Make sure that all documents are current, and that they aren't going to expire while you're on your trip.Think about any medical or dietary requirements that you can't live without. Do you need contact solution? An inhaler? Dietary supplements? Birth control? If there's anything health-related that you won't be able to easily find on your trip, be sure to bring it.
Think about how you'll pay for goods, services, hotels, travel. If you won't have access to a bank, bring plenty of cash. If you're traveling abroad, be sure to change plenty of currency in the airport.
Think about what you'll eat, and how you'll eat it. If you're backpacking into the wilderness, you'll need to carry enough food to survive until you return, and you'll need a way to cook or prepare it. If you're traveling in a populated area, you probably won't go hungry--but make sure that you don't have any allergies to common ingredients of the local cuisine.

, Consider buying travel-sized versions of anything you need; you can find travel toiletries in drugstores and travel-supply stores. Bring dental hygiene goods, as needed: toothbrush, toothpaste, floss, mouthwash, retainer. Bring optical necessities: glasses, contact solution, extra contacts, eye drops. Bring deodorant, sunscreen, lotion, chapstick--what ever you will realistically use.


Be aware that most airlines follow the 3-1-1 rule. The bottles containing the liquids must be 3.4 oz (100 ml) or less, they must all fit within one, 1 quart transparent plastic bag, and the total volume of liquids contained in the bag must not exceed 1 quart.
Keep in mind that if you're traveling to an urban, populated area, you will probably be able to find most toiletries in stores near where you're staying. The most important things to pack are those for which you have a personal prescription: contacts, retainers, medications.

, How many changes of clothes will you need? What sort of weather conditions will you face? Which activities do you need to prepare for?


Consider how long you'll be gone and how many times you'll need to change clothes. Consider whether you'll have the opportunity to wash your clothes; consider whether you're willing to wear any items multiple days in a row.
Make sure to bring appropriate footwear. If you'll be walking a lot, bring sturdy, comfortable shoes or boots. If you're going to be going out in a city, bring lightweight ""night out"" shoes. If you're going to be somewhere hot, or near the beach, consider wearing sandals. The more functions or situations that any given pair of shoes can meet, the better.
If you're going on a business trip, or to a wedding, and you need to look presentable, be sure to bring a mixture of formal and casual clothes. If you're going to a resort by the sea, be sure to bring a swimsuit to take into the water.
Consider the weather. Run a web search to find the forecast for where you're going, and exercise your best judgment. If it will be raining, bring rain gear. If it will be cold, bring warm clothes. If it will be warm, bring lightweight, breathable clothing. If the weather conditions will be mixed, bring a mix of clothing so that you're prepared for any situation.

, If you'll be spending a lot of time outdoors, bring the equipment that you'll need to safely conduct your adventures. If you'll be working remotely, be sure to bring your laptop or tablet, a charger, and any relevant documents. Only bring what you absolutely need: gear can be heavy and space-intensive.


Consider whether you can rent gear where you're going. Perhaps you already have your own scuba gear, but it's heavy and unwieldy and you're only going to be scuba diving for one day of a week-long trip. Look for scuba rentals near where you want to dive, and search for tour companies that might be able to provide you scuba gear for the day.
Gear can be expensive; shiny gadgets like laptops, tablets, and phones may catch the attention of opportunistic thieves. You don't want to bring your laptop on a trip, only to have it stolen--so carefully consider whether you truly need something before you bring it with you.
The danger of thievery is highly dependent upon where and how you will be traveling. If you're going to be staying in five-star hotels and renting a car to get around, you probably don't need to worry much. If you'll be busing your way between grimy hostels, you may want to leave the laptop at home unless it's absolutely necessary.If you're staying in hostels and other shared rooms, consider bringing a combination lock to secure your gear. Most hostels offer closets and lockers in which you can store personal items.

, Do you want to read a book in your spare time? Listen to music on your iPod? Play games on your PSP during the plane flight? Be judicious with your entertainment, and bring only what you actually need--unread books are just needless weight.


Be honest with yourself. How much are you actually going to read on this trip? How much have you wound up reading on similar trips in the past? You don't want to fill your pack with a stack of books, but only read one of them. Consider bringing a Kindle or Nook, or saving e-books onto another gadget, to bring a lot of reading material without filling up your luggage.
As with other gear: be careful when traveling expensive electronics. Laptops, iPods, tablets, and game consoles can be magnets for opportunistic thieves and pickpockets. If you bring anything that you don't want to be stolen, keep it secure and avoid whipping it out in public.

, When you've finished your list, consider the contents with a critical eye: which items are really essential for your trip, and which items are you bringing ""just in case""? Cross off any non-essential items, and leave them behind.Think about past trips, and what you did and didn't need. Perhaps you brought four pairs of shoes last time, but you only wore one of them. Perhaps you brought two books, but just wound up reading the local newspapers.
Keep in mind that you may be able to buy many things at local shops, if you're traveling to a populated area. This applies especially to toiletries and clothes. If you're not absolutely sure that you will use something, consider leaving it behind and planning to buy a local version in the case of an emergency.

Only pack as much as you can carry.,
Only bring carry-on luggage.,
Pack as many outfits as you think you need, then subtract one.,
Pack one exciting, versatile accessory.,
Avoid bringing more than two pairs of shoes.,
Leave whatever you can buy at your destination at home.",How to Pack Efficiently3," If you're going to be lugging a backpack around from hostel to hostel for two weeks, you don't want to pack more than you comfortably carry. Weigh the pack before you leave--you can use a luggage scale, or weigh yourself and the bag together. If it's more than 20 or 30 pounds, consider what, if anything, you can leave behind. Walk around with your pack and make sure that it's comfortable.

, If you can limit yourself to one carry-on bag and eliminate the need to check in any luggage, you will save yourself a world of time and hassle. It may sound daunting - but seasoned travelers swear that one small bag provides easily enough space for the travel essentials, you just need to cut-down on any non-essential items.Limiting yourself to carry-on luggage makes the process of traveling much easier - you will get in and out of the airport a lot faster, and enjoy the convenience of having all of your travel essentials directly on hand throughout your flight. You will also avoid the risk of incurring charges on overweight check-in bags, particularly on smaller local airlines.Packing a single small bag also has its advantages once you reach your destination. You will be a lot more flexible when it comes to moving from place to place, making it easier to take advantage of any opportunities or adventures that come your way. You will also appear as less of an easy target to pick-pockets and con artists.
Bear in mind that many airlines impose a weight limit upon carry-on luggage--often to the order of 20-30 pounds. Before you try to fly, visit the website of your airline and find the carry-on limits. If you will be flying with multiple airlines, make sure to check the requirements for all of them.

, It's easy to pack more clothes than you will end up wearing, so pack fewer outfits than you think you'll need. Think about how many days you'll be away, and which activities you plan on doing while you're there. Consider what the weather will be like. If the weather has consistently been at 90 degrees for the last month, odds are you won't need more than one sweater.


You'll probably end up wearing some items more than once, so think about clothes that you can mix and match. For example: for every one pair of shorts you bring, pack two or more shirts that will go with them, as you won't need to change your shorts everyday.
Pack clothes that can be adapted to suit the situation. Men: try packing versatile pants, along with a light button-down shirt that can be worn out at night as well as on day trips. Women: try packing a simple dress that can be worn casually with flat sandals and a sun hat throughout the day, or dressed up with heels, a belt and some jewelry at night.
Find out whether there is a laundromat near your accommodation - if there's one within easy reach, you will be able to wash your clothes, thus increasing the number of times you can wear them!
Remember that it's not the end of the world if you end up needing to buy a couple of cheap t-shirts or a rain jacket while you're away - and chances are you won't need to. When travelling light, always pack for the best case scenario, not the worst case.

, This is a great way to keep your wardrobe fashionable while packing light. Make sure that it will go with as many of your planned outfits as possible and that it serves a definite purpose.


A large, decorative scarf can serve as a funky accessory to wear around your neck, can be worn in place of a cardigan if draped around your arms and shoulder, can turn into a make-shift sarong at the beach, can be worn as a head-scarf to protect your head from the sun, or can serve as a belt if worn around your waist!

, Shoes are the heaviest, bulkiest items that you will need to bring with you while travelling, so try to limit yourself to the absolute minimum. This can be a difficult choice to make for those who love having the perfect shoe for every occasion, but try to think about what's really necessary.


If you're going on an action-packed sports holiday, you're hardly going to need a pair of dress shoes. A light-weight pair of flats or sneakers will carry you through any situations (restaurants, bars, museums, etc.) where you need to dress up slightly more formally.
If you're going on a business trip, pack appropriate shoes for any meetings you have to take, along with comfier, more casual pair to wear while travelling or during down time.
Don't pack your running shoes unless you are absolutely sure that you will be exercising while you're away. If you're going on a relaxing, indulgent holiday to a sunny destination, will you really get up at 7 am every morning for a 5 mile (8.0 km) run? Unless the answer is a resounding ""yes"", your running shoes are taking up valuable space.

, Did you know that they have supermarkets in Europe? And pharmacies? And fashionable clothes stores? As mentioned earlier, unless you are travelling somewhere extremely remote, it's unlikely that there are many items you won't be able to find wherever you go. So unless you're particularly picky about the type of hair conditioner or shaving gel you need to use, leave these items at home and just pick them up when you get there.


Buying as you go may seem like an unnecessary expense, but it will help you to significantly cut down on weight and free up some extra space in your bag. It's all about priorities!
Remember that many large brands are universal - you should be able to find Gillette shaving cream, Colgate toothpaste and Pantene conditioner no matter where you are in world--or at least something comparable. You can also see this trip as a chance to try something new.
If the worst comes to the worst and you can't find a particular product, ask yourself how the locals manage to live without it. Do they have some kind of alternative? Or is just an unnecessary comfort? Travelling light may require some sacrifices! Consider it an adventure.

For cultural or urban tourism, it is best to fly between major cities, as bus routes are slow and unreliable. Options such as the Mercosur Air Pass and the Visit South America Airpass allow travelers to fly around Latin America at reduced rates.
For budget travelers, bus travel is easiest and cheapest, and will allow you to reach more remote areas.

Arrange the contents of your bag to fit tightly and compactly.,
If you're bringing a heavy jacket, consider wearing it while you're in transit.,
Roll your clothes.,
Pack layers rather than bulky single items.,
Learn to bundle.,
Use compression bags.,
Use the space inside shoes for extra storage.",How to Pack Efficiently4," If space is more of a concern than weight, you will need to compress each travel item into its most compact form. Roll or bundle clothes; put smaller objects inside of larger objects; fit things together so that minimal space is left in between. Many airlines and buses limit the size of carry-on bags, so you may need to pack tight to make sure that your carry-on fits the requirements.


Avoid folding and stacking clothes. Folded clothes take up a lot of space and are more prone to becoming wrinkled during transit. Try to roll, bundle, or compress your clothes into their most compact form so they take up less room.
Put large, heavy and solid items--books, laptops, shoes, blow-driers--at the bottom of your bag. Heavy things are more secure at the bottom, and thus less likely to move around during travel. Clothes may get wrinkled when they're trapped beneath heavy objects. As a matter of convenience, you may find it easier to find small objects if they aren't trapped beneath large objects.Place fragile or easily-wrinkled items on top. Item like suits, pressed shirts, or easily-creased dresses should be laid out flat at the top of your suitcase, in a protective garment bag, if possible. Remove them from the bag and hang them up as soon as you reach your destination.

, You can put books, devices, food, and other small items into the pockets to free further space within your luggage. If it's hot, don't worry--you can always take your jacket off once you've gotten situated into a seat. If you're especially pressed for space, consider wearing several layers of clothing to free up room in your bag.

, If you roll your clothes tightly, they can take up less space than folded clothes, although perhaps more space than bundled clothing. You will need to exercise your own judgment regarding the most efficient way to roll each item. Bear in mind that rolling clothes—especially if you fold them first—may leave them wrinkled when you unpack. Do not try to roll suits, pressed shirts, and easy-to-wrinkle items.


Put socks inside matching socks, and consider putting socks inside shoes. Roll the socks into a ball, or leave them flat inside one another. You can stuff rolled socks in between other items to fill space.
Roll shirts as tight as possible. Fold the sleeves of shirts in toward the center, then roll from the bottom of the shirt up toward the neck. This applies to short-sleeve shirts, long-sleeve shirts, and jackets. Use your best judgment.
Fold pants in half so that one leg sits flat atop the other, then roll from the bottom of the pants up to the waist. These will be the bulkiest items no matter how you roll them, so plan space accordingly.
Fold underwear, then roll it as tightly as it will go. Stuff it in between other rolled items, wherever it will fit.

, If you are at all unsure about the weather conditions at your destination, consider packing layers rather than bulky ""just-in-case"" items like rain jackets or jeans. That way, you can layer up or down depending on whether it's hot or cold.


For example, you can pack a combination of long-sleeved and and short-sleeved t-shirts which you can wear individually or layer up if it's cold. Consider packing long-sleeved button-down shirts, and rolling the sleeves up or down as needed.
Instead of bringing bulky jeans, try packing some light-weight but cozy leggings which you can wear underneath dresses and skirts.
If you're going somewhere warm, tropical, and beachy, consider wearing your swimsuit as underwear, or wearing your swim trunks as shorts. You'll ""wash"" them when you go in the water, and you'll always be prepared for a dip!

, Bundling is known as an efficient packing method that makes excellent use of space and prevents clothes from becoming seriously wrinkled. You will need to wrap several items of clothing tightly around a central object such as an organizer pouch (filled with more items - of course) to form a cylindrical shaped bundle. You can pack several of these bundles into a relatively small space, making for economical packing.


When using the bundling method, place the most wrinkle-resistant items like jeans and jackets on the inside of the bundle, and more delicate, wrinkle-prone items like linen trousers and fine knits on the outside.Wrap each item individually, rather than all at once, making sure the fabric is pulled taut enough that it doesn't wrinkle, but not so tight that it stretches the material.
Once you have reached the bottom of your pile of clothing, place the bundle into your bag or suitcase and pack tightly or secure tightly with the bags tie-down straps. If the bundle is not secured properly before travelling, it may unravel, causing your clothes to crease.

, Compression bags are a great way to fit bulkier items, like ski gear or heavy winter coats, into a limited space. Compression packing bags work by removing all of the air from the bag, pushing the items within into their most compact form. Many brands offer their own version of the compression packing bag, including Spacepak bags from Flight 001 and Space bags from Ziploc.

, Don't forget about all the empty space inside your shoes that you can use for storing smaller items like socks, underwear, jewelry or anything else you can think of. When packing efficiently it is important that you use up any and all available space.


Once the shoes have been packed, place them at the bottom of your bag or along the edges of your suitcase.
If your shoes are a dirty and you don't want them touching your clothes, wrap each shoe tightly in a plastic bag before you place it into your bag. Consider wearing your dirtiest shoes--say, your hiking boots--when you're in transit so you don't need to store them amid your other things.

Obtain a Passport.,
Brush up on your Spanish.,
Bring local currency.,
Bring an outlet converter.,
Obtain vaccinations.,
Review travel guides.,
Research the best time for visiting.,
Obtain climate-appropriate clothing.,
Bring appropriate shoes.",How to Prepare for a Trip to Costa Rica," Passports can be obtained at post offices around the country. To enter Costa Rica, travelers also must have an exit bus ticket or plane ticket already purchased. While a visa is not required for American citizens, travelers are only allowed to stay for 90 calendar days.;
, While there are regional dialects, Spanish is the official language of Costa Rica. Be sure to memorize common phrases or bring an English to Spanish Dictionary when visiting.

, The national currency is the Costa Rican colon, and while hotels and restaurants in larger cities such as San Jose will accept American dollars, most smaller and rural areas only accept cash colones. Larger tourist areas also accept credit cards.

, Voltage in Costa Rica is the same as it is in America, but the outlets are only 2-pronged. Bring a converter if any appliance you are bringing requires 3 prongs.

, The United States Center for Disease Control recommends up-to-date routine vaccinations, as well as vaccinations for typhoid and hepatitis A and B. Travelers from Africa and from other South American countries must also obtain a yellow fever vaccination.

, Make sure you have all the information you can gather when preparing for a trip to Costa Rica. This includes locations of resorts, lists of national holidays, types of local wildlife, and locations of famous or unique national parks.

, Different months during the year in Costa Rica have their own particular attraction. Make sure you know when to visit Costa Rica so you will be able to experience and see everything you want to. For instance, late winter and early spring is a high tourist season, so tourists traveling during December to April will want to schedule their flights, hotel rooms and attractions well in advance.

, Costa Rica has a dry season and a wet season, though the temperature maintains a steady average of 76 degrees Fahrenheit, or 24 degrees Celsius. Be sure to bring short sleeve shirts, short pants and a wide brimmed hat. The wet season lasts from May to November, so travelers are advised to prepare for sudden downpours by bringing quick-dry clothing, waterproof footwear and standard rain gear.

, Sandals are recommended for the tropical Costa Rican climate, though travelers who want to explore the region by hiking or camping should bring hiking boots, tennis shoes, or other sturdy footwear.

If you haven't felt like you've had enough adventure yet and still have plenty of money to spend take a trip to the ancient Mayan pyramids of Tikal and El Mirador.,
Once you've found an agency you like, continue to use them to get a ride back to the airport.",How to Plan a Trip to Guatemala," As you walk out of the airport you will find many trusted taxi services and shuttles to take you anywhere you wish.;
, Plan on spending between $25-35 American dollars to get you to Antigua depending on how many passengers there are. You will find many travel services branching out of Antigua to take you anywhere in the country.

, You will be able to find hostels as low as $8 per person a night to 5 star hotels that will easily run you $300 per room a night. You´re bound to find something in your budget range and you'll enjoy Antigua regardless of where you stay. La Antigua is a walking town so your won't need much money for transportation once you get there. If you ever get caught in the rain and want a quick ride back to your hotel just catch a tuk tuk for 10 Quetzales which is around $1.25 and can take you anywhere within the city limits. There is a lot to do in Antigua so don't waste a minute! It's a good idea in the beginning to just take a walk, you will be able to find a map in most any shop. Take time to sit in the park, get your shoes shined by a local shoe shine boy, buy a few scarves and necklaces from the Mayan girls and breathe in the fresh mountain air. Don't forget to tour the ruins. The main ones being San Francisco, La Merced, Las Capuchines, the Main Cathedral by Central Park and don't miss Santo Domingo!

, There's nothing stateside quite like it! If you buy any of the fruits or vegetables make sure to wash them really well and dry them before consumption. For all the coffee lovers out there, there are several local coffee farms just waiting for you to take a tour and enjoy a freshly roasted cup of goodness.

, It shouldn't cost you any more than $20 round trip per person. Plan to stay at least 3 days here as well to really enjoy it! Lake Atitlan is a must see! All the natural beauty is to say the least, breathtaking! There's no other place quite like it. If you start your journey in Panajachel, I recommend taking a boat taxi 25Q which is around $3 to San Tiago and from there taking a tuk tuk to Posada de San Tiago. It's located beautiful on the lake and the service is wonderful. For a couple, expect to pay $40-90 a night depending on what you want. If you have a group of 10 or more you can stay for $15 a night per person. Make sure to reserve ahead of time! Once settled spend your first afternoon nestled by the pool which overlooks the lake. There is also an outdoor hot-tub & sauna to be enjoyed. Take out a canoe, go around the bend and see the Mayan women washing their clothes and children in the lake. The next day, take a boat tour around all the surrounding villages. Each village has something different to offer. If you plan on buying a painting while in Guatemala, this is the place to do it as the prices are unbeatable!

, It's a 10 hour drive or 45 min. plane ride. You can book a trip/tour with most any of the travel agencies in Antigua. A private tour is best so that you can spend time doing what you're really interested in. I would set aside at least 3 or 4 days to truly enjoy this majestic piece of history.

, Usually you can better deals if you do multiple trips with the same agency. Have a great trip!

However, generally you’ll need a suitable photograph, evidence of your citizenship (and a photocopy), a valid photo ID (and a copy), a completed application, and payment for the passport.


The photo required for your passport must be a certain size and you must be clearly visible in it. It is not recommended you smile in this photo. Most drug stores with a photo lab offer passport photo services.
The cost for a regular US passport book, which is valid for all international travel, is $110 plus an execution fee, which is generally $25.
It’s best to get your passport as soon as possible, as it can take some time for it to be processed and issued. Standard processing, which is free, can take up to 6 weeks. Expedited processing ($60) will take 2 to 3 weeks.;
, To prevent having to spend time on your solo trip sick with a preventable bug, see your general practitioner or a physician. Verify with them that your inoculations are current. In preparation for your trip, you may want to:


Get a flu shot. You’ll be in close proximity to others while traveling, especially while on a plane or using transit in Costa Rica. This greatly increases your chances of being exposed to the flu.
Get a hepatitis A shot. This infectious disease can be easily caught through contaminated food or water, regardless of where you are staying or the quality of lodgings/restaurants.
Get a typhoid shot. This bacterial infection is recommended for most international travelers, as typhoid can also be caught through contaminated food and water., You’ll find that many Costa Ricans, especially those involved with tourist activities and those who live in tourist friendly areas, can communicate in English. However, it might be helpful to review some simple Spanish so you aren’t completely lost when Spanish is spoken.


Go to your local library to pick up a Spanish phrase book, or purchase one from a bookstore or online. These books are generally written with common phrases useful to travelers and non-fluent speakers.

, The beauty of traveling on your own is you can do whatever you want. However, having a general idea of things you want to do, see, and experience, will help prevent you from feeling lost when you arrive. An itinerary will also help you budget for your trip, and will provide you peace of mind where lodgings are concerned.


Travel guides, both physical books and online ones, are a great way of scoping out must-do activities before you arrive. These frequently have popular sights, resorts, hotel listings, and other attractions.

, Depending on your plans, you can get by on relatively little money in Costa Rica. If you buy from and visit local establishments, which are often less costly, your daily budget can drop as low as $25 to $35 (13,800 to 19,400 CRC). A comfortable budget would be closer to $45 to $50 (24,900 to 27,700 CRC).One night's lodging in a typical hostel generally costs roughly $10 to $18 (5,500 to 10,000 CRC). If you’re the kind of person that prefers a private room or hotel, expect to pay between $25 to 40 (15,000 to 22,100 CRC).

, Beyond clothing, footwear, and toiletries, you’ll also need to pack your prescription medicines and supplemental items, like a power converter. Most plugs in Costa Rica are dual prong, so if any of your devices have a 3-prong cord, you’ll need a converter.Bring comfortable, durable footwear for daily activities, and a pair of something slightly more comfortable (like flip-flops) for relaxing.


In addition to your prescription medication, you might also want to bring travelers’ diarrhea antibiotic and altitude sickness medication, especially if you have a weak stomach or are uneasy flying.
Bring spares for important medicinal supplies, like glasses, contact lenses, syringes (for diabetics), inhalers, epinephrine injectors, mosquito repellant, and a medical alert bracelet or necklace, just in case.
Costa Rica has an average temperature of 70 to 81°F (21.1 to 27.2°C), but it can be rainy at times and quite cool in the highlands. Remember raingear and light layers to cover all your bases., CRC stands for the Costa Rican colón, which is the country’s national currency. Changing your currency over at the airport or the hotel you are staying can be quite pricey. Save yourself some money by exchanging your home currency with a local bank or moneychanger.


When using a moneychanger, it’s best to shop around. These businesses make their money from favorable exchange rates and service fees. Some moneychangers may be more economical than others.
Avoid making purchases with your debit card while abroad. If an error is made charging something to a debit account, it can take days (or longer) before the charge is removed. Furthermore, debit cards are common targets for thieves and fraudsters., When you’re traveling solo, you can do whatever you want. This can be overwhelming at first, but let your interests lead you in your exploration. You may even want to adjust your travel itinerary to make time for something that catches your attention, like a local festival, a natural feature, or a museum exhibit.You can make the most out of a day at the beach by paying for individual surf lessons or, if you plan on staying for a length of time, a weekend surf camp.
Wildlife tours and national parks are a great way of getting to know the local flora and fauna of the country. Besides that, these places are usually great for pictures., Tourist buses are generally quicker and have multi-lingual staff, but local public transit is half the price or less. Buses are the most common form of public transportation and can get you most places without a hitch.For extra freedom or to visit sites that are off the beaten path, consider renting a car. However, you may have difficulty finding an automatic transmission, so you might want to practice driving stick shift before you leave for your trip.

, Unless you want a photo album full of selfies, you’re going to have to reach out to strangers to have pictures taken of you. To prevent the possible theft of your phone or an expensive camera, you may want to purchase a cheap digital camera or a disposable camera to hand to strangers for picture taking.Even though it may feel outside of the norm, reach out to locals and fellow travelers at eating establishments, cafes, and bars. You might be surprised at how often you find a new friend with whom you can share a new experience., Guided tours, like a bike tour or a hiking tour, will give you plenty of opportunities to get to know your fellow travelers. You can use this same tactic when visiting famous sites, like Tortuguero National Park, La Paz Waterfall Gardens (which includes an aviary, hummingbird and butterfly gardens, and more), and Poas Volcano (or any one of the many volcanoes).You may be able to find a traveler meetup online or online listings on classifieds (like Craigslist) from other solo travelers looking for companionship.

, Since you’re traveling alone, it’s likely there are going to be moments when you’re all by yourself. Use this time to relax and unwind. Bring a book or a digital book reader so you can dip into your favorite novel when you’ve got a spare minute. You might also:


Bring a handheld game, like a Gameboy DS or PSP, so you can spend time that would otherwise be spent sitting (like while in transit) setting new high scores.
Bring a notebook and some pens. Being somewhere completely out of the ordinary can be inspiring. You never know when you’ll have a thought you want to jot down or a sketch you want to make.

, While it is not automatically true that people without money are more likely to steal, those who are desperate can sometimes do desperate things. If you find yourself in a less affluent, rundown, or dangerous looking part of town:


Do not pause to get your bearings while walking. Act as though you are calm and know exactly where you’re headed.
Hail a taxi or find a visible, public place where you can either ask for help or call for a taxi to pick you up.

, Some visitors to Costa Rica won’t have any problem drinking water straight from the tap or eating food from street side food vendors. However, you could catch Hepatitis A, typhoid, or travelers' diarrhea from any source. Especially likely culprits include tap water, street side food vendors, and less hygienic appearing restaurants. You may only want to drink bottled water or water that has been boiled first.


Your doctor may be willing to prescribe general antibiotics before you leave to help fight gastrointestinal distress, should it occur., While you’re enjoying yourself sightseeing and making new friends (and maybe enjoying an alcoholic beverage or two), it’s easy to become dehydrated. These activities on top of the relatively high daily temperature can lead to heat exhaustion.


Keep a bottle of water or a thermos in a travel backpack or on your person at all times. This way, you'll have water whenever you're thirsty., Blogs are a fun way of involving friends and family, both those you see daily and those who live faraway, in your travel adventures. If you have a suitable travel laptop or tablet, these can be useful tools for you to record your experiences.


You might want to record a few significant things at the end of every evening or the beginning of every morning, then complete and upload this info to your blog after you’ve returned.
If you’re not comfortable traveling with technology abroad, you can use a notebook to jot down notes and then use these later in your blog.

, A pen and paper journal is a cheap and safe way of recording your travels. Not to mention, you’ll be able to tape physical items into your journal that you might want to use in the future for a scrapbook or to make a memento of your trip.


You don’t need anything fancy for your journaling. Bring a couple of extra pens, just in case one stops working or gets lost.

, This is an especially great idea if you’ve collected souvenirs, newspaper or informational pamphlet cuttings, programs, tickets, and similar items over the course of your trip. These can be easily added to scrapbook pages to create a visually appealing record of your solo trip to Costa Rica.


A scrapbook like this would make a great coffee table book. This way, friends and family visiting your home can peruse your journeys when they have free time.

Find a good snorkeling spot.,
Put your snorkeling mask on.,
Put your snorkel in your mouth and blow through it to make sure it's clear.,
Put your flippers on tightly.,
Practice with those flippers.,
Protect yourself from the sun.,
Find a safe spot to snorkel.,
Take a breather when you need it.,
Use a camera if you have one, but don't get so involved taking pictures for ""later"" that you miss enjoying the ""now.""",How to Snorkel in the Caribbean," You can usually get good information from your hotel or from locals.;
, If it is your first time using it, you will want to clean it with toothpaste to remove the inner film and help prevent fogging. After that, some Sea Drops or a little bit of spit will do the job. Putting on the mask properly is going to mean the difference between having a good time or being miserable. Does your mask fit and is it water-tight? Put it on your face, bend forward and inhale sharply. Your mask should stay on until you exhale. Now put the strap high on the back of your head. Don't make it too tight or when you're done you'll have a ring around your face that will last for hours. Make sure there is no hair hanging down into the seal, as this will cause leakage.

, There are a lot of different styles out there from the $2 sticks to the $40 dry snorkels. Look for one that is comfortable for you. Bite down on the mouthpiece and close your lips. Practice breathing through the snorkel before you get in the water.

, Do you really need flippers? Only if you are snorkeling over a large area or in a heavy wave area. Please be careful with them, lots of coral damage is done with flippers.

, Kicking properly will mean seeing a huge number of fish everyone else will miss. Legs together, ankles together, now GENTLY, toes up, toes down- you want to be barely moving in the water. No big kicks, no splashes, no huge arm movements, just slow and easy. Fish will appear where there were none a few seconds before.

, Wearing a bathing suit is an obvious beginning, but you might want to be a little more covered than that. A shirt will keep your back from being sunburned and also protect you from some jellyfish. Board shorts will keep the back of your legs from being sunburned. Apply a water-resistant sun block and thoroughly cover exposed skin. Note that you can get sunburned through a shirt, so be sure to use sunscreen on your torso even if you are wearing one.

, Look for signs of coral and rocks in the water; that's where the fish will be. Take the time to scan the area. Boats, water toys, wind conditions? Pay some attention to the surroundings above the water before you get too engrossed with everything under the water.

, Time will pass quickly and you will get tired. Forty-five minutes is a long time to be in the water. Plan on some beach or boat breaks to keep from getting over tired.

, If you do use a camera, photograph fish from a distance. Close range usually ends up blurred. Also, focus on the reef some, too,

To visit the famed Blue Hole you need to first travel to Ambergris Caye.,

As many of you may still be researching the perfect Caribbean destination, here are some pointers that will help you in your efforts.


There are many popular on-line travel companies that offer excellent ""destination guides"" as part of their website. These include the likes of the travel giants Expedia, Travelocity and Orbitz.
In addition, there are location specific travel brochures that one may request free of charge. Please access these highly informative guides through both the Lonely Planet's Caribbean Island destinations,as well as American Express's Caribbean electronic brochure. This free guide will help you in all facets of your research efforts towards making your own Caribbean travel itinerary.;
, There are many popular Caribbean destinations. These are some of the most popular possibilities:


Antigua - Anguilla - Aruba - Outer Islands Bahamas - Bay Islands, Honduras - Bermuda, North Atlantic - Barbados - Bonaire - Grenadines - Curacao - Grand Cayman - Cancun, Mexico - Isla Mujeres, Mexico - Cozumel, Mexico - Roatán Nevis - Martinique - Jamaica - Puerto Rico - Guadeloupe - Grenada - St. Vincent - Tobago - Dominican Republic - St. Martin/St. Maarten - St. John, U.S. Virgin Islands - St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands - St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands - Tortola, British Virgin Islands - St. Lucia - St. Kitts – Tobago - Turks & Caicos

, You can enjoy a dramatically discounted ""summer"" by visiting the islands during the lengthy low season, mid-April to mid-December. Prices of hotels can fall by 40% or more, package deals can be common and popular port towns can be far less crowded this time of year. The downside is that many of the more popular resorts close their doors during this off-season. In addition, the trade winds aren't as prevalent in summer, so the chance of encountering oppressively muggy weather is higher. Summer is also the hurricane season, and it is particularly bad in August and September, when some hotels, restaurants and shops close for the month. If your primary interest is in the culture of the islands, however, this can be an ideal time to visit.

, If your Caribbean dream vacation includes hiking through a rain forest, snorkeling along colorful coral reefs, exploring Mayan ruins and sunbathing along the miles of picturesque white sand beaches -- you will find it all here, but paradise does have its price. The cost of living is relatively low on most Caribbean islands, but by the time you add up your expenses for activities, lodging, meals, transportation and a little nightlife, a Caribbean vacation could cost more than you might expect. It is recommended that you write a chart out with all these facets of travel in order to realistically plan your Caribbean trip. By doing this, you will have a clearer picture of where you could save money. For example, if you are normally a first-class flyer perhaps you could think of allocating more money into a higher class resort with the money you would save flying coach.

, If you are on a tight budget, review these pointers:


1) Island choice: Choose your Caribbean island wisely, as there is a huge difference in price. Flights to Jamaica and Cancun are plentiful, therefore the price is going to be significantly lower than if you fly to the Dominican or St. Marteen.
2) Consider a Caribbean cruise instead: This is a marvelous option should you be interested in seeing many different islands. Great for the whole family, but can also work well if you are single. Many cruises cater specifically to singles; Club Med vacations were built upon this tradition.
3) Look for package deals, where your flight, hotel and car rental if needed, are priced as a single unit. This will invariably save you time and resources in planning out your perfect Caribbean vacation.
4) Remember to always barter. This is after all the Caribbean islands, where bargaining is the rule not the exception. Do not over tip! This can be a mistake, as it could signal thieves in the area into thinking you are an easy target.
5) Remember that Summer and Fall months are the cheapest, though this is also hurricane season. Most expensive time is during March and April, as the Caribbean Spring Breakers are out in full force with many hotels sold out.

, After selecting your destination, your island(s) of choice, it is then time to find the Caribbean hotel that will meet your needs. This is a rather critical step, as where you stay will greatly dictate the activities available to you. The majority of travelers vacationing in the Caribbean stay between 3-7 days. On the internet, one can simply go to any of the reputable on-line travel companies and type in the destination city. From this, you will get a list of hotels and resorts in the area. The advantage of an on-line travel provider is that you can easily sort the ""results"" out; such as by hotel star rating, lowest to highest price, sort by amenities,etc. Here is what to look for:


1) Does the resort cater to families?
2) If you are going there to party and meet new friends, or Spring Break, than look for the hotels known to be ""hot spots"" for the younger crowd. Read the hotel reviews. Trip Advisor is the leading and most trusted site, providing literally millions of travel reviews, helping you make more informed decisions.

, An ""All Inclusive"" is where you pay one low price that includes your lodging, food, drinks and recreation. They even include your tips. Most ""All Inclusives"" in the Caribbean include all the recreation you could ask for, though things like scuba diving may have an added charge. Also, know that ""All Inclusives"" rarely will include spa treatments even though you book at a ""spa resort all inclusive."" Book Caribbean all inclusive vacations far in advance for best deals. Though it is known that ""last minute deals"" can save money, this is only because the hotel is trying to fill the space last minute as well. By waiting like this you run the enormous risk of not getting a room at all. In addition, these ""last minute"" travel bargains will almost never be ""choice"" rooms, rather these are the rooms no one else wanted. Booking in advance simply outweighs any benefits of waiting.

, Caribbean restaurants are plentiful and represent a wide range of local and international dining options. Caribbean recipes combine African, Amerindian, French, East Indian, and Spanish styles of cooking. These traditions are a reflection of the early settlers of the region. Rice is the staple of a Caribbean meal - you'll find the rice on each island may be a little different. It is eaten with a variety of sauces and beans. Another Caribbean recipe favorite is called ""Cook-up"", or Pelau. This dish combines meats like chicken, beef, pigtail, saltfish, and vegetables with rice and pigeon peas. Seafood is one of the most common Caribbean recipe delicacies in the islands due in part to their geographic location. Each island will likely have its own specialty. Some prepare lobster, while others prefer certain types of fish. Barbados is known for its ""flying fish,"" while Trinidad and Tobago is known for its cascadura fish and crab.


Conch is common among many islands including the Bahamas, though some islands have strict laws on how conch are fished. Turtle was once considered an island delicacy though since 1990s most of the Caribbean islands have made any sea turtle fishing, capture and sales illegal.
Lime and garlic are commonly used in Puerto Rico and Cuba.
Other common flavors throughout the region include cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg. There are many locals that prepare Caribbean vegetarian food should your diet require this, especially in places like Jamaica. What is noteworthy about Caribbean dining is this - tourism being the number one staple in all the region dictates that they will have a restaurant for almost any international food. It may require some search, but many Caribbean restaurants have a great variety of tasty foods to enjoy. Most of the larger resorts offer quite a large selection of dining options. Caribbean foods purchased in the markets are surprisingly cheap, if you have a place to cook it.

, Listing all the wonderful places to see and things to do in the Caribbean could literally fill up volumes of pages. Adding difficulty to the task lies in the fact that each island has something unique to offer. This part offers a simple overview of what the major resorts in the Caribbean offer. Seek specific activities and events out at each of the locations you plan on traveling to–in this way, you will have an updated list you can count on. In polls of Caribbean Travel, the highest priority of most vacationers is the beach. They want dazzling sand where the warm turquoise sea mirrors an azure sky.


They also look for beach activities such as swimming, para-sailing, skin diving, scuba diving certification, kayaking, sailboat excursions, jungle rides, cave exploration, sightseeing and shopping.
If in the right location, such as the Mexican Caribbean, you will not want to miss seeing the Mayan ruins, such as at Tulum or Chichen Itza - large pre-Columbian archaeological sites built by the Mayan civilization.
Additional Caribbean activity plans can be made through Viator. Research, plan and book Caribbean activities, events and tours with this highly reputable company - they are currently the largest ""travel activities & tours"" company in the world, listing 217 separate ""things to do in the Caribbean. Consider some of the following activities below when planning what to do on your trip--

, Of particular fondness to children and adults, is the experience of playing and interacting with the dolphins. There are known reputable companies that specialize in dolphin encounters, such as ""Dolphin Cove in Jamaica"", ""Dolphin Excursions in Bahamas"" and ""Dolphin Discovery"",with dolphin adventure locations in Cancun, Isla Mujeres, Riviera Maya, Grand Cayman, Cozumel, Vallarta and Tortola.

, Many of the leading hotels in the Caribbean now have serious spas, not just a few treatment and beauty rooms, but full-service operations led by leading spa companies. So you can expect to relax in the lap of luxury. Even side-by-side, on his and hers beds, if you’re feeling romantically inclined. These fabulous spa services are always ""extra"" charges, so inquire at your destination resort for rates and services.

, The islands have some of the world's most beautiful and challenging Caribbean golf courses, and hosts many major and local tournaments. Most golf courses in the Caribbean have in-season and off-season prices, as well as guest and non-guest prices (many courses are part of resorts or hotels) and member and non-member prices. Some of the more famous Caribbean golf clubs require carts and a mandatory caddy. Most offer club rentals. You should always call, email, or visit a specific courses website (if available) for the latest information, greens fees and tee times.

, The Caribbean offers plenty to do when the sun goes down. But not all Caribbean islands have non-stop nightlife. Most all large Caribbean cities have something for everyone, from sophisticated hotel lounge bars to Caribbean dance clubs crowded by college kids. If you're looking for something on the tamer side, look into what your hotel has to offer. Many Caribbean hotels have planned activities for guests including tropical nights, beach barbecues and cocktail parties, Caribbean kids activities. And for those wanting a crazier evening? It is usually easy to find a ""booze cruise"" that goes out after the sun goes down and does not return until the wee hours of the morning. Legal drinking age varies, though 18yrs.old is the norm.

, Caribbean boasts over 114 casinos spread throughout its various islands. The Dominican Republic has more casinos than any other country in Caribbean, with 32 Caribbean casinos and 2105 slots. Next is found at Netherlands Antilles, which has 25 casinos. Following this is Puerto Rico with 17 casinos and Aruba and Jamaica with ten Caribbean casinos each. Antigua and Barbuda has 6 casinos. The largest casino in the Caribbean is Atlantis at Paradise Island Resort and Casino which is located in Nassau, Paradise Island, Bahamas. Caribbean gaming and Caribbean gambling are located these select island locations. Please note Caribbean casinos are not on every island, so plan accordingly. Caribbean is also popular for its Caribbean Casino Cruises.

Do your research and find the hotel that best fits your needs.,
If you are a snorkeler then this could be heaven for you.,
After you have found the perfect place to stay, it's time to plan some outings.,
Don't waste your time at Magen's Bay.,
After you get off the ferry in Cruz Bay take a look around this small town and enjoy island time.",How to Enjoy Your Trip to St. Thomas Usvi," Staying at a hotel on the east end of the island, you are away from the crowds of Charlotte Amalie and have close access to the ferry out of Red Hook to Cruz Bay, St John. Pay the extra fee to have a beach front room, you'll be glad you did. Nothing beats walking out your front door and having your toes in the sand.;
, The cove at Secret Harbour is protected from the open ocean waves and is usually very calm and visibility is excellent. A wide range of fauna and flora can be found here. Stingrays, turtles, lobster (at night), crabs, eels, schools of beautiful Tangs, Cow fish, incredible corals and too much more to list here.

, You didn't come here to watch cable TV all day. A trip into the main town of Charlotte Amalie is a must, especially if you're a shopper. Low cost liquor, cigarettes and jewelry can be found on nearly every corner here. Watch out for crowds from cruise ships during peak months though. A short climb up the hillside in town will take you to Blue Beards Castle. Spend a few bucks and take the tour. You get to see some very interesting colonial homes and their original furnishings. Also the lookout tower has one of the best views of the town and harbor you will find. Snoop around the rest of the town and you will find many fun things to see and do. Just remember to be cautious here at night and stay off the back alleys.

, It is a tourist trap where you have to pay to get in and it has the feeling of a city park in the middle of a town. The scenery and snorkeling are better at just about any free beach on the island. If you want to lay in the sun go to Sapphire Beach, it's close. If you want to snorkel go down to Secret Harbour. If you really want to see a nice beach, hop on the ferry to Cruz Bay on St John. It only takes 15 minutes or so and it's cheap.

, The pace is as laid back as it gets and there are a number of small shops to peek into. Open air taxi's or trucks with seats in the back of them, will be waiting to take you anywhere you want to go. Every beach is a must see here! Check out Cinnamon Bay, Hawksnest, Trunk Bay, Leinster and the rest if you have time. Ask how to get to the sea turtle breeding area if you are up for a short hike down the coastline that takes about 25 minutes. Once you arrive to the beach, take a walk into the trees and you will find some small ruins. Hermit crabs are everywhere in the rocks and on the ruins. If you swim out to the small key, there are very large starfish in just a few feet of water. Swim around back and you might just find yourself a nurse shark. When you are done in the water climb the path that leads up the hill. There are two different sets of ruins to look through. Bring your camera for some breath taking pictures from atop the hill. When you get back to the road you started from, the Annaberg Plantation is a few steps away. This is a very interesting historical site that is home to the ruins of a sugar cane plantation. Best of all, it's completely free.

Determine your layover time and subtract from that one hour for security screening and returning to your gate, and another hour for round-trip travel.,
If you have friends in Puerto Rico who live reasonably close to the airport, your best bet is to call them and ask them to give you a small tour to see places that interest you.,
If you like nature hikes, your layover is eight hours or more, and the weather is reasonable, find a tour to El Yunque, the only tropical rain forest in the United States and a Federal Forest Reserve.A visit to El Yunque is an experience you will not soon forget, but dress light, put on some sneakers (do not wear dress or heeled shoes, or flimsy floppy shoes), wear some sort of light hat and sunblock and do not bring a heavy handbag or purse.,
If you like to gamble, the airport has a casino in the hotel located in the main terminal!

,
If you have three or more hours available during the layover and would like to see the Spanish colonial influence on the island, take a taxi ride to Old San Juan's ""Plaza de Armas""(pronounced ""PLA-za de AR-mas"").,
Walking in Old San Juan can be a very pleasant, relaxing experience.,
If you want to hit the beach and soak up some rays, ask the taxicab to take you to the closest one, the Balneario de Isla Verde (pronounced ""bal-neh-AH-rio de IS-lah VER-deh"").,
If you want to get something to eat, check out Frommer's list of San Juan restaurants.If you want to try some classic Cuban food, the closest to the airport and very much a favorite for locals is Metropol (pronounced ""meh-tro-POLL"").,
If you like art, there are many options in San Juan.,
Would you prefer some retail therapy instead?","How to Kill Time During a Long Layover in San Juan, Puerto Rico"," If you have less than two hours left over, leaving the airport may not be a good idea, particularly on weekdays when rush-hour traffic can be very heavy. Rush hour in the area of the airport is from 7AM to 9AM (westbound traffic) and from 4PM to 7PM (eastbound traffic). Traffic is generally light on weekends. If you have a short layover and would like to see more of San Juan, talk to the airline you will be flying and ask if you can change your departure date. There are many inexpensive and charming hotels in the areaand you will not regret having the opportunity to see more of this city and its 500+ years of colorful history.;
, All cellular phones that work in the United States (and most of the foreign ones that have roaming service) will also work in Puerto Rico.

, Do bring your camera and a large bottle of water.

,, This very nice plaza is located in front of San Juan's City Hall and is within walking distance of shopping areas as well as the imposing Spanish colonial El Morro Castle. This amazing 15th century military structure guards the entrance to San Juan Bay, and is in and of itself a half-day experience.

, One of the best places to walk is the ""Paseo de la Princesa"" (pronounced pah-SEH-oh de lah prin-SEH-sa). Literally translated, it is the ""princess' walkway"" but actually refers to the building where the Tourism Department is currently housed. The structure used to be a very nasty jail called ""La Princesa"" that dated from Spanish colonial times. It was not until the 1970s that a federal judge issued an order to close it.

, It is located about ten minutes from the airport and parallel to the north of airport's runway number eight.

, The same area in Isla Verde also boasts many types of cuisine, from affordable fast food to world-class fare.

, If you would like to visit a museum with local art, there are many in the San Juan metropolitan area as well as in Old San Juan., Tell the taxicab to take you to Plaza Las Américas (pronounced PLA-sah las a-ME-ri-cas), the largest and most up-scale shopping mall on the island. It takes approximately 20 minutes or so to get there if traffic is light – during the rush hour periods it can take up to an hour to get to the mall! The main entrance to the mall is where you will find the taxicab line to get back to the airport.

Decide on what the most important elements are for you.,

Take the flight to Charlotte Amalie, St. Thomas (S.T.T).,
If you're in a hurry, expect additional travel.,
Take a charter if in a hurry.,
Arrive.",How to Arrive in Tortola," Are you looking to just save time? Or is money more important to you? Maybe they both are, or maybe neither one matters?;
, No commercial airlines fly to Tortola from the U.S. So your best bet is to hop on the cheapest flight to San Juan, Puerto Rico (SJU). However there are good flight options from Florida to St. Thomas (STT), which is a 50 minute ferry ride to Tortola.

, It will almost always be the cheapest option. You will only need to book one flight and have a cab get you to the ferry. The ferry ride cost between $25-$30 one-way. About an hour later you will either arrive in Road Town (the capital) or on the West End.

, Getting there in a hurry requires an extra flight. Most of which come from San Juan (SJU). There are only a few airline options commercially, there are a handful more charter airlines available. The options will be listed in the tips section below.

, Finding the quickest way to Tortola also happens to be the most expensive. You can catch a charter flight out of Ft. Lauderdale's executive airport (FXE) from Island Birds Charters.

, By air you will arrive on Beef Island (neighboring island just east of Tortola connected by a bridge) at the Terrence B. Lettsome Airport.

Do not expect everyone to speak English.,
Learn basic Spanish.,
Familiarize yourself with the local customs and social mores.,
Do not forget that the majority of Latin American countries, including Panama are still third world countries.,
Prepare yourself for very slow assistance at restaurants and stores along with little to no customer service.,
Do not complain about being ""broke"" or how incredibly expensive things are.,
Treat everyone with respect.,
If you get homesick connect with Expat groups.,
Travel the country/countries.",How to Be a Better Expat in Panama and Other Parts of Latin America," You've moved to a country where Spanish is the mother tongue and it's non-sensical to think that everyone is going to speak English in addition to Spanish. While some Panamanian's and other Latin Americans do speak English, it's the minority rather then the majority.;
, Because everyone speaks Spanish it is common sense to learn basic Spanish. How to greet people, how to ask for things, even just a few phrases will help you tremendously. And the locals will appreciate your attempts to speak their language. What is important is that you're understood, so don't worry about being perfect, as long as you're trying you'll find everyone is friendlier and more welcoming, as well as more helpful. It makes a huge difference in how you're treated.

, As an example, it's polite to say ""Buenas"" when you see someone, in the elevator, at a store, in a bus. It doesn't matter if you know that person or not. And when someone says ""Buenas"" to you, you answer with ""equal"". Learn about the culture and why people do the things that they do and how they do it. If you try to fit in and respect their culture you will be treated better in return.

, That means most of the amenities you're used to overseas are available here, but in limited amounts and for a premium price. Air conditioning is very expensive, American style homes and condos rent and sell at a premium and imported food is sometimes difficult to find.  When you do find imported items there is a huge markup. While these things can make it more difficult to live in a third world country, there are other benefits that outweigh the negatives. You can live on the beach for much less than overseas and the weather is much nicer, though it is very hot in most places, especially in Panama.

, Panama and Latin Americans do not have the same expectations regarding restaurants and stores that Expats do. Therefore when you move to Latin America you need to prepare to wait to be served, wait for the cashier, wait in line and generally just wait. Take deep breaths, tell yourself you'll be done soon and that you're not overseas anymore and you will get through it. Find places where they get to know you and then the service improves and continue to go to those stores and restaurants, after being in Latin America for a while you will learn where to go and where to avoid.

, The average Panamanian lives on $440 a month and in some Latin American countries it's less then that. So as someone who is local will not understand how you can have so much money and complain. In addition their average work week is around 70 hours including their commute and it's likely that many expats will be complaining while sitting at the beach drinking margaritas. Do not be one of those expats.

, No matter where they are from, what their social standing is, no matter if they are a maid or the President of the country, treat everyone as equals. When you show respect to people you get a huge amount of respect back. There is no reason to be contemptuous towards household help or people who are poorer or have less education then you do. Consider yourself privileged and you will find you are much more content with your life in Latin America.

, There are groups all over Panama and Latin America for Expats to connect and spend time with each other. There will be times you just need to be around people from home. When that happens contact a group, go to a get together or just hang out at the local Expat restaurant or bar. Most communities have happy hours each night for Expats at a local restaurant. Find out what the schedule is and keep it handy for those times you really need it.

, Learn more about where you're living and the different areas and history. The more educated you are about where you're living the more interesting you'll find it and enjoy it. Panama has an amazing eco-culture as does much of Latin America and you can travel almost anywhere for dollars by bus and find hotels for a fraction of the cost of the USA. Traveling can become a regular part of your life rather then a once a year vacation somewhere.

Hamilton International Airport (YHM) - about 1 hour to the north.

Buffalo Niagara International Airport (BUF) - about 30 minutes to the south

Niagara Falls (New York) International Airport (IAG) - about 15 minutes to the east;
, The airport that you fly into will depend on various factors such as where you are flying from, the price of the flights, and whether or not you have a preference with connections.

, It is a major airport and is Air Canada's international hub with over 150 direct flights to and from the airport. Various bus and taxi companies provide services to and from YYZ to Niagara Falls. Or, if you prefer a rental car, it is a 1.5 hour drive via highway 427 and the QEW highway.

, Not only is it cheaper, but it's also closer to the falls. There are many low cost air carriers with service into Buffalo, including Southwest, JetBlue and AirTran. There are various bus and taxi companies that provide service from Buffalo Airport to Niagara Falls. There are no direct flights from outside of the US to Buffalo airport; however, if you are coming from overseas and do decide to fly into Buffalo airport, you will first need to connect at a major US airport such as JFK, Philadelphia, Boston, etc. If traveling to the Canadian side from Buffalo airport, a passport and at least one form of photo ID is required to cross the border.

, There is also Niagara Falls International Airport in Niagara Falls, New York and Hamilton International Airport in Hamilton, Ontario. Niagara Falls airport is served by Spirit Airlines and Allegiant Air with flights to and from Myrtle Beach, SC and various Florida airports. Hamilton Airport is served year-round by WestJet to and from Calgary, AB, and Aeromexico operates seasonal service to and from Mexico City. These two airports are mostly used by locals in Ontario and New York for flights to warm destinations, but if you live in one of the areas served by these airports, you will probably be able to get a low airfare.

,, If you're flying into Toronto or Buffalo, be sure to book tickets for shuttle services to Niagara Falls before embarking on your journey. However, if for whatever reason you don't get around to this, there are many taxis available 24 hours a day at Toronto and Buffalo airports.

Yellowstone National Park
New England, e.g. Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine etc.
Adirondacks, Appalachians, Smoky and US Rocky MountainsCanadian Rockies, Alberta (Lake Louise etc.)
Laurentian Mountains, Quebec

Stay on the beaten path.,
Good places to stick to are: La Antigua, Lake Atitlan, Rio Dulce, Tikal, Chichicastenango, Quetzaltenango, Livingston, Flores/Santa Elena, SOME parts of Guatemala City, and Monterrico (or other Pacific shores).,
Don't miss Guatemala City!,
Don't Travel at Night.,
Don't be afraid.",How to Travel Guatemala," While in other destinations you may try to leave the ""beaten path"" in search of hidden gems, Guatemala is not the best place to do so. Nevertheless, Guatemala's popular destinations are breathtaking and beautiful, and even if you did leave the beaten path, you probably wouldn't be as satisfied.;
, Regardless of this info, there ARE areas where you can venture off, we just don't recommend driving alone into the countryside, unless of course you are headed to a destination. Those roads tend to be more popular and safe.

, Most travelers to Guatemala leave Guatemala City out of their itineraries, but in order to get a better understanding of the country, it's a fun idea to visit. There ARE dangerous places, however. Try to stick to the safer zones, such as Zone 10. NEVER stay overnight in Zone 1, or in the case most of the other ones besides Zone 10. Try not to stick around in Zone 13 too long, as there have been reported robberies. We aren't trying to frighten you from Guatemala City, just be alert and travel it with caution. Most incidents do NOT involve tourists.

, Even in the safest parts of Guatemala (probably Antigua and Panajachel), it is not a good idea to walk or drive at night. During the day throughout Guatemala, it is usually just as safe as the U.S., it's during the night when most crimes are reported. Chances are nothing will happen to you, but exercise caution, just to be sure.

, No country is 100% crime free, and Guatemala is no exception. It is true Guatemala has a higher crime rate than most countries. The thing is, most crimes happen in Guatemala City and in the northwestern part of Peten (Not where Tikal is). However, due to the high crime in those places, the whole country gets bad statistics. There are many places in Guatemala that are safer than places in Europe or America. Another thing that might worry you, that about 6 tourists a year are killed in Guatemala. Here are some reasons that ""terror"" is debunked. Firstly, millions of tourists visit Guatemala yearly. Only 6 die. What are the odds it will be you? Another reason not to be afraid is that the tourists who are attacked are usually the uninformed ones who go to dangerous places. Sure, there are some RARE exceptions, but don't pretend nobody ever is killed in New York or Los Angeles! All in all, Guatemala is not too much more dangerous for tourists than, say, Mexico. In fact, in some ways, Mexico is MORE dangerous. And chances are, you will be fine on your Guatemalan vacation!

, There are several languages spoken there, such as Taiwanese -- or Minnan, Mandarin Chinese, other Asian languages, and Austronesian languages. Mandarin is a common language spoken in Taiwan, but 70% of the Taiwanese population speaks Taiwanese as either their native language or a secondary language.


In the northernmost region of Taiwan, the majority of the population speaks Mandarin as their first language, but many people also speak Taiwanese. However, in the southern region, Taiwanese is much more common.

, There are many big cities and towns there. Some of them that you may want to see are:


Taipei - the capital, as well as the ""center of commerce and culture"". It includes Taipei 101, the world's fourth tallest skyscraper, as well as other attractions.

, In lowland Taiwan, the name for the climate is known as ""marine tropical"". During summers, which last from June to September, it is typically humid and very hot. It is rather cold during winters; temperatures in northern Taiwan can be as low as 46 degrees Fahrenheit, or eight degrees Celsius.


Northern Taiwan is rainy all year, but winters are dry in the Southern region. The best time to visit is from October to December, since it is more rainy in spring than in autumn.
The tall mountains in Taiwan experience very cool weather. Heavy rains occur, which present a risk to visitors that are not prepared for this weather. For instance, it's snowy every year on Taiwan's highest mountains!

, There are six regions of Taiwan; the cities that each region is home to are highlighted below.


Northern Taiwan contains the capital, Taipei, the principal airport of Taiwan, and several other cities such as New Taipei and Keelung.
Central Taiwan is comprised of Changhua County, Miaoli County, Sun Moon Lake, Nantou County and Taichung. Eastern Taiwan consists of Hualien County, Taitung County, Taroko Gorge, Hualien and Taitung.
Southern Taiwan contains: Kaohsiung, Tainan, Chiayi County, Pingtung County and Yunlin County.
The Outlying Islands are a set of islands that many locals head to for a ""mini-vacation"". They are called Green Island, Kinmen, Matsu, Orchid Island and Penghu.

, Generally, the Taiwanese are very polite people, and Taiwan has many of the same cultural taboos as many other Asian countries. For example, it is extremely rude to mention unlucky possibilities, as some Taiwanese people believe in superstitions about dying. In addition, there is no tipping in Taiwan; however, bellhops may still expect at least 50 TWD in return for carrying your luggage. Listed below are several other cultural norms in Taiwan.


Do not ring your doorbell or blow a whistle at night; this is thought of as an ""invitation to ghosts"".
Never point at a grave or cemetery; this is considered disrespectful to the dead.
You will need to take off your shoes before entering someone's house, and even before entering a balcony or bathroom.
When greeting a teacher or someone high-ranking in a professional field, like education, economics, etc., bowing down is a sign of respect. Some Taiwanese people also do it in other countries.

, Some countries allow for a visit to Taiwan without a visa as long as their passports are valid for at least half a year (six months) when it comes time to arrive. However, there are other countries in which a visa is required to visit Taiwan. Below, you can see how long you can visit Taiwan without a visa, or whether you need a visa, dependent on the country you live in.


For up to 90 days without a visa: states of the European Union, Canada, Iceland, Israel, Japan, Liechtenstein, Monaco, New Zealand, Norway, United States and Vatican City. With that, citizens of Belize, Burkina Faso, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nauru, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Sao Tome and Principe, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and Swaziland can also visit for 90 days, under the condition that they have official, service or diplomatic passports.

If people residing in these countries show an ""emergency"" or temporary passport, it will be necessary to complete an application for a landing visa. This will need to be done by giving out a passport photo and paying a fee of 2,400 Taiwanese dollars.


People who reside in India, Indonesia, the Phillippines, Thailand and Vietnam -- as long as they have obtained a permanent resident card from a Schengen country -- can secure a 30-day visa when arriving after applying online. Residents of Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States can also do so.

, There are five main airports in Taiwan, in addition to several others.


The main international airport in Taiwan is the Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport near Taipei with very restricted international service to Taichung and Hualien. It has great connections to well-known Asian cities, as well as several places in North America. In addition, the airport has buses that go to Taipei, Taichung and other cities close by.
In Kaohsiung International Airport, international and domestic airports are found in the same network. International flights are limited to other cities in Asia, such as Hong Kong, Bangkok and Singapore. Flights to mainland China are also provided.
Taipei Songshan Airport is located in downtown Taipei. It mainly provides domestic flight service, in addition to everyday flights to mainland China and to the Haneda airport in Tokyo.
Taichung Airport contains both domestic and international flights to Hong Kong, Vietnam, as well as cross-strait and charter flights to the mainland portion of China.
Hualien Airport has mainly domestic flights, but some charter international flights to Japan, Macau, and South Korea. It is also eligible to serve direct cross-strait flights.

, For an alternative experience besides flying, you can also travel to Taiwan by boat. There are several ways to make a boat trip, especially from China.


For instance, you can take one of the two daily boats to Matsu from Fuzhou, Fujian Province in China. Go to the Fuzhou train station, and then make a trip from there to Wuyilu on bus 69. After that, you'll need bus 73 to Mawei harbor, which is the ending station. This is a two-hour trip. Once you have finished the train ride, you will need to find one of the two daily ferries to Keelung. One of them is TWD1050, which has a bed since the trip takes ten hours!
You can also purchase a ticket to Taipei from the Mawei harbor in Fuzhou. That will cover the Fuzhou to Matsu ferry as well as a flight from Matzu to either Taichung or Taipei.

, There are several methods of transportation in Taiwan, such as trains, buses and metros. See the ""Getting Around"" section for more info on transportation.

, Festivals in Taiwan include the Spring Scream, Buddha's Birthday, and Dragon Road Festival, and they are described below.


The Spring Scream is an annual three-day rock concert held in the outdoors in Kenting. For every day, tickets cost $1,400 with all venues. This is a crowded festival.
In the Buddha's Birthday festival, there are simple and colorful rituals held at Buddhist monasteries. During these ceremonies, people often wash statues of the Buddha and hold a vegetarian feast. This festival is always held on the eighth day of the fourth month, according to the Lunar calendar.
The Dragon Boat Festival is held in remembrance of the loss of Qi Yuan, a patriotic Chinese poet. He felt intense melancholy that Chu, the country he always loved, was being stolen by a neighboring country because the people who belonged to him betrayed him. Thus, he drowned himself in a river. This festival always takes place on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month.

, Taiwan offers a lot of wonderful beaches and marvelous national parks; many of them contain hot springs. There are several of these, such as the Baishawan Beach, the Fulan Beach, and the Taroko Gorge (which is a national park).

, It contains canyons with marble walls, lavish vegetation, and mountainous scenery, and many tourists find it to be a beautiful sight. , As mentioned earlier in this article, it is the fourth-largest skyscraper in the entire world, and it has 101 floors. There are beautiful sights that can be found in observation decks, and even an outdoor deck if the weather is fine. There is even a food court as well as several malls. It is also the largest ""greenhouse"" in the world., They are the Taiwan High Speed Rail and the Taiwan Railway Administration.

, It is a system of high-speed trains that go 345 kilometers, or 215 miles, on the West Coast of Taiwan, from Taipei to Kaohsiung in only an hour and thirty minutes. Stops during the train ride include Banqiao, Taouyan, Hsinchu, Taichung, Tainan, and Chiayi.

, There are TRA stations located in every well-known city, and one can often find train stations in the middle portions of most cities and towns. The train system provides leeway to bypass highways, which can get very, very packed on holidays as well as weekends.


If you are traveling by train during the weekend, it is highly advisable that you book tickets, especially if the trip you are taking is long-distance. You can get tickets at the TRA website. Note that purchasing a ticket online will only work between 8AM and 9PM, and you will need to pay a fee of $7 if you are booking online. You will need to book your ticket no later than two weeks in advance.

In order to receive your tickets, you will need to pay them at the local train station or post office. Children under 45 inches, or 115 centimeters, can ride for free, and taller kids that are shorter than 57 inches, or 145 centimeters, or are under 12 years of age, will be eligible for a half-price ticket.



,


The Tzuchiang train is the most pricey and the fastest, and it includes assigned seating. There are three types: regular Tzuchiangs, Puyumas, and Tarokos.
The Chukuang train is the second fastest train, and assigned seating is also provided.
The Commuter train is the cheapest; there are stops at all train stations. There is no assigned seating. If you are looking to go to a nearby city, the Commuter train is the best choice since they stop about once every 10-15 minutes.

, That way, you won't miss it. Find the destination in English, and then look for the Taiwanese characters that match the destination in English. You should also have your destination written in Taiwanese before you embark on the trip!

, The bus network in Taiwan is very extensive, and the private bus companies mostly operate it. Typically it is cheaper to get around with the intercity bus than on the train. However, note that travel time may take much longer on holidays due to traffic, and it is more probable that holiday tickets will be sold out.

, That being stated, route maps are almost completely in Taiwanese, but the destinations shown on the front of the bus are available in English. Ask for route advice from the clerk if you are staying at a hotel, and find your destination on the map and circle it.

For greetings, you can always say a simple ‘Hi’ or ‘Hello’.,
Note that the 'e' in 'Selamat' is not pronounced.,
If you greet a person using ‘Apa Kabar?’ ('How are you?,
Bahasa Indonesia is usually read and pronounced phonetically.,
In most polite situations, use the honorifics ‘Mas’ or ‘Pak’ or ‘Bu’ or 'Mba'(spelled embak) before a person’s name.,
The Indonesian way for naming does not always use the surname or family name.,
Don’t be offended if an Indonesian you barely know addresses you by your first name.,
Married women will likely be using their husband’s name, but in the way they like.,
Speak in English if you get suddenly stuck and don’t know what to do or to say.,
Smile when you speak.",How to Greet People in Indonesia," In non-formal situations, you might say ‘Apa Kabar?’ (How are you?). More formally, you might want to use ‘Selamat Pagi’ in place of Good Morning, ‘Selamat Siang’ for Good Afternoon, ‘Selamat Sore’ for Good Evening, and ‘Selamat Malam’ for Good Night.Selamat malam is not used if you want to go to sleep.;
, To pronounce it correctly simply say 'slamat'. Also its perfectly OK to omit the 'selamat' completely and simply say 'pagi'. Similar to English where Good Morning is abbreviated into 'Morning.

,'), the answer will most likely be ‘Baik-baik saja’ or ‘Kabar baik’ which means ‘I’m fine, thank you.’

, Say it the way you see it. Rarely will anyone laugh if you accidentally slip. Just continue on speaking in your usual accent and you'll eventually get it right.

, ‘Mas’ meaning one younger than you, 'Pak', sir or mister (Can be used to address any male, except boys, which would be 'Mas') 'Ibu' is also used everyday, such as ""Hai, Ibu!"" Abbreviation is used normally, Indonesians constantly shorten things. ""Bu"" is an abbreviation of Ibu. Ex: Mas Bayu (young male); Pak Mulyawan (male, formal) ; Bu Kartini (married female); Mba Elita (Ms. Elita). While for married females the honorific 'Ibu' does not often change, you might also hear ‘Bapak’ (father) when a young person speaks to a male who’s clearly older or has higher position. Ex: a person middle-aged person named Djoko might be addressed as 'Bapak Djoko.'


The K and the NG are the only 2 somewhat tricky sounds of Bahasa Indonesia. The former has a dual function. Sometimes it sounds exactly like the K in English, while at other times (like in Pak) it marks a 'glottal stop:' a glottal stop is the opposite of the ahhhh-sound, as you intentionally choke off the air in your throat to end the syllable. It sounds like the Uh in Uh-oh! The second is the NG combination which produces a ""velar nasal"" sound similar to the way you would pronounce 'sing.' All that said, it is a minor matter that the Locals will tolerate until you eventually refine it as you learn more of the language.

, If a person is named ‘Arif Perdana,’ it does not mean his family name is Perdana. Feel free to call him with just ‘Pak Arif’. Some Indonesian even named with one single first name, without middle name or family name.

, Indonesian people use first name basis in daily life, with whomever they meet. The exceptions are married women, nobles and royalty.

, Use the name she told you when you were introduced to her. Don’t forget to add ‘Bu/Ibu’ before you speak her name.

, Experience shows that Indonesians are very intuitive communicators who can make out what you're trying to say, regardless.

, Indonesians are as a whole, open and friendly people. Smiles will do magic to oil social interactions with them. A slight nod/bow is also a common practice. The bowing should not be equated with subservience, but with extreme politeness. Westerners should not let it bother them.

Sign papers.",How to Relinquish Parental Rights in Texas," You cannot give up your rights just because you feel like it. Instead, a Texas judge must determine that it is in the “best interests of the child” to terminate the rights. Because terminating your rights would leave the child with one parent, Texas judges are unlikely to terminate your parental rights unless there is a legitimate reason.The most frequent reason a judge will terminate parental rights is that there is another person willing to adopt the child, usually the custodial parent’s partner. By giving up your rights, you make way for the other person to adopt the child and become the legal parent.
Another situation where you can give up your rights is when Child Protective Services (CPS) believes that you are a threat to the custodial parent and child. In that situation, CPS will move to involuntarily terminate your parental rights.If you agree with CPS that your rights should be terminated, then you could voluntarily relinquish them by not fighting the termination.;
, Few judges will find that it is in the child’s best interests to have only one means of financial support.States are afraid that the child might end up on public assistance if your child support obligations are terminated. Accordingly, few judges will allow you to relinquish your parental rights for this reason., Once you relinquish parental rights, you no longer will have a say in how the child is raised, including the child’s education, religious upbringing, or where the child lives.Although the other parent might agree to allow you to see the child, you are not guaranteed that right as a matter of law.

, If you are thinking about giving up your parental rights, then you should talk it over with the other parent. Even where the other parent agrees that you can give up your rights, a judge must still approve that decision.


However, if the other parent is married to someone who wants to adopt the child, then you should work together on drafting your petition to the court.

, You should talk over your options with a qualified family law attorney. A lawyer can offer advice going forward on petitioning the court to terminate your rights. To find an experienced family law attorney in your area, contact the Texas Bar Association, which runs a referral program.The phone number for the referral service is (800) 252-9690. Someone is available Monday through Friday, 8:30 am to 4:30 pm Central Standard Time.
Many parents desire to give up parental rights to avoid child support. Since a judge will not terminate your rights for that reason, you should talk over other options with your lawyer. Your lawyer might have creative ideas for temporarily suspending payments or reducing the amount of child support. For example, you can petition the court to reduce the payments until you find a better-paying job.

, You or the custodial parent will need to file a petition in court to terminate your parental rights. Since relinquishment of rights will typically happen along with an adoption suit, the custodial parent can prepare the petition.


The petition to terminate will be included with the petition for the adoption. They will be a joint document. For this reason, you should have the other parent’s attorney draft the petition.
As the parent hoping to give up their parental rights, you will need to sign an “Affidavit of Relinquishment of Parental Rights.”You may hire an attorney to draft it for you or you could have the other parent’s lawyer draft it and then look it over with your own attorney.

, If you do not want to work with a lawyer, then you can try to draft your Affidavit yourself. Texas law lays out certain requirements for the “Affidavit of Relinquishment of Parental Rights.” You should make sure that your affidavit contains the following:your name, county of residence, and age
the child’s name, age, and birth date
whether you are currently obligated by court order to make child support payments
a description of all property owned by the child and its value
your belief that termination is in the best interests of the child
the name and county where the other parent resides
an acknowledgement that you have been informed of parental rights and duties
whether the relinquishment is revocable and the timeframe for revocation (put in bold type)
who revocation must be made to, if you exercise it
the name of the prospective adoptive parent
whether you waive service of process for a prospective adoption suit

, You must sign the affidavit in front of at least two witnesses. You must also have the Affidavit notarized.Notary publics can be found at most courthouses and in large banks. You and your witnesses should bring sufficient personal identification to show the notary. Usually, a valid driver’s license or passport is sufficient.

, Parents who relinquish their parental rights must complete a medical history report.You can find the form for download at https://www.dshs.state.tx.us/vs/reqproc/Health,-Social,-Education-and-Genetic-History-Report-Forms.doc.


The form will ask about the medical history of you, your parents, and other relatives like aunts, uncles, grandparents, etc. You should take sufficient time to go through the report and complete it accurately.
You will need to report whether your family has had birth defects, allergies, eye or dental problems, as well as developmental, circulatory, or hormonal disorders.
Once you complete the report, return it to the other parent’s attorney, who will need to file it.

, Either you or the custodial parent will need to file the petition and supporting affidavits with the court. If you waived service of process in your Affidavit, then you will not receive notice if the other parent files the motion. Although you generally are entitled to notice whenever a motion or petition is filed that impacts your rights, you can waive that service of process since you know that you are giving up your parental rights to facilitate the adoption.


You may have to pay a filing fee in order to terminate your parental rights. The fee can vary, depending on the county, but should cost a few hundred dollars. You should contact the court clerk and ask.
In Tarrant County, for example, you must pay $315.00. In Dallas County, you will pay $318.00.In Harris County, the fee is $267.00.This fee may be included in the fee for the adoption suit. If so, then you and the custodial parent should decide between yourselves how to split the cost of the fee. If you cannot afford the filing fees, then ask for a fee waiver form and fill it out.

, You may have to attend a hearing to answer any questions that the judge has. Whether you have to attend a hearing will depend on the court and other circumstances.


Be sure to dress conservatively. Men should wear slacks with a dress shirt or a solid color polo. Shirts should be tucked in, and you should wear a belt. Always wear dress shoes and socks. Keep you facial hair trimmed and comb your hair.Women should wear business casual attire: slacks or skirts with a nice blouse. A conservative dress is acceptable is well. Avoid clothing that is too revealing. Do not show your bare shoulders or too much cleavage.Always wait for a judge to stop asking a question before answering, and be sure to address the judge as “Judge” or “Your Honor.”, You may have to sign papers with the court to relinquish your rights. This will depend on the court. Ask for a copy of any papers that you sign.


You also should receive a copy of the court order terminating your parental rights. If you did not need to attend a hearing, then contact the other parent or the court clerk if you do not receive a copy of the order.
After your rights are terminated, the child will then be adopted by his or her step-parent. However, you will have no role to play in the adoption proceeding once you have relinquished your rights.

File for bankruptcy.",How to Stop Wage Garnishment in Illinois," When a creditor initiates the process of garnishing your wages, they must send you a notice to that effect. If you believe the garnishment is invalid in some way, or if you believe you can claim an exemption, you have the right to ask for a hearing to make your case in front of a judge.You must do this on or before the return date, which is the date listed on the notice that represents the date and time your case will be heard in court.Your employer must usually begin withholding your wages immediately after receiving the notice from your creditor. Your employer then holds these wages until a judge issues a court order directing payment of those funds to your creditor.;
, Ensure that the total amount being withheld is correct. In Illinois, a garnishment is a continuing garnishment. This means it will continue to be applied until the entire debt is paid off. If the amount being garnished is incorrect, you should make an exemption claim to correct the amount being withheld.Compare the amount of the garnishment to the amount of the judgment.
Add any attorney fees for obtaining the garnishment. This should be listed on the garnishment.
Add any interest that has accrued. This should also be listed on the garnishment.

, Most exemptions are based on how much disposable income you have. Therefore, you should first calculate your disposable income so you can use this amount to determine if you qualify for any exemptions to wage garnishment. To calculate your disposable income:Start with your gross pay.
Subtract the amount of any mandatory deductions, which in Illinois are: federal, state, and local taxes; social-security payments; required disability and retirement contributions; and mandatory union dues and health insurance.
The resulting total is your disposable income.

, Illinois law provides greater protection than federal law. Under Illinois law, creditors can only garnish the lesser of (1) any amount of your disposable income that exceeds 45 times the federal or Illinois hourly minimum wage (whichever is higher) or (2) 15% of your gross pay.The current federal minimum wage is $7.25/hour.The current minimum wage in Illinois is $8.25/hour.Since the Illinois minimum wage is higher, you will use that amount for this calculation.
Due to the above figures, if you net less than $371.25 per week, nothing can be garnished.Be aware that certain types of wage garnishment, such as that for child-support payments, can exceed this number—as high as 65% of your disposable income., Certain types of income are, by law, exempt from garnishment. If any of the following are being garnished, you can claim that they are exempt at the hearing to have them excluded from garnishment:Social-security benefits.
Railroad Act retirement benefits.
Veterans' benefits.
Other government benefits, such as unemployment insurance benefits or welfare.
Pension payments.
Proceeds of student loans.
Child-support, maintenance, or alimony payments.

, If the amount of the valid garnishment keeps you from meeting your basic obligations (such as food, housing, and health needs), you can argue for an exemption on this basis.Collect evidence to support your claim, like rent or mortgage payments, grocery bills, or medical bills.

, On either the return date or the date of your requested hearing, you will need to go to court and explain to the judge why the garnishment should either be cancelled or adjusted.Be sure to appear in court at the date, time, and place specified in the return date (or, if you requested and were granted an earlier hearing, use that information).


Dress professionally for the hearing.

, There is a simple procedure to follow once you arrive at the courthouse for your hearing. After arriving, do the following:There should be a bulletin board outside of your specified courtroom on which the scheduled court cases for the day are listed.
Find your case on that list. There will be a number (known as a ""line number"") to the left of your case listing.
Enter the courtroom and wait in line to give the clerk your name and line number or, if no line number was listed, to tell the clerk your case is not on the list. Wait for your case to be called.
When it is called, go to the front of the courtroom and tell the judge your name.

, Once you have introduced yourself, it is time to present your case. You will want to draw the judge's attention to any factual inaccuracies regarding your wages, your debt, or the amount being withheld. If the amount being garnished is incorrect, tell this to the judge and detail the amount that should be withheld.This is also the time to argue that you meet any of the above exemptions.


During the hearing, speak only to the judge and court personnel, not to the creditor.

, After both you and your creditor have had an opportunity to present your respective cases, the judge will issue his or her ruling in the case. Whatever the outcome, make sure to obtain a signed copy of the judge's order, as this will govern your actions going forward and/or provide the basis for a potential appeal., If the judge rules against you, you can file for an appeal of the decision. After the court's judgment, you have 30 days to file a Notice of Appeal stating that you want to appeal the decision. Talk to an attorney about the specific facts of your case to decide whether you're likely to be successful with your appeal., The statute of limitations establishes a date on which a legal claim is too old to be enforced. In Illinois, the statute of limitations on a judgment is 20 years. If the judgment being enforced against you is greater than 20 years old, it is invalid and cannot be used as a basis for wage garnishment., Creditors must comply with Illinois state law governing wage garnishment. If any of the following are true, the statutory requirements have not been met and the judgment is invalid:You must have been given notice of the garnishment and an opportunity to present your side of the case.
You must have been given the option to pay your debt prior to judicial intervention.
You must have been provided a notice of the garnishment judgment at the time garnishment begins detailing the amount of the judgment, the creditor's name, the maximum amount of your wages that may be garnished, and that you have the option of requesting a hearing to dispute the judgment.

, If the court that issued the garnishment judgment did not have the proper jurisdiction to do so, the judgment is invalid.Whether or not a particular court has proper jurisdiction is a question best answered by an attorney, as there are varying types of jurisdiction established by statute, and determinations of jurisdiction are often complicated legal inquiries.

, The quickest way to stop wage garnishment is to pay the amount of your debt in full. Try to do this as quickly as you are able to protect your credit rating. If you are able to pay the amount of the judgment in full, make sure to ask your creditor to sign a Satisfaction and Release of Judgment form which you will file with the court to show your debt has been paid in full.If your creditor refuses to sign such a form despite you having paid your debt in full, you can file a motion to ask the judge to sign the form releasing you from debt.

, If you cannot pay the full amount of your debt, try talking with your creditor to see if you can make regular, smaller payments to satisfy your obligation, rather than having your wages garnished.If your creditor agrees, put the payment plan in writing and have your creditor sign it.
Even if your creditor doesn't agree, the judge can order an installment-payment plan to pay off a small-claims judgment. Having such a plan can stay the garnishment judgment (meaning it won't be enforced while you are making payments), but the plan must pay off the entire debt within three years.Make sure you can make the payments if you seek a court-ordered payment plan, because you can be held in contempt for not making them., Your last resort is to file for bankruptcy. This should truly be your last resort as this will stay on your credit report for up to 10 years, seriously affecting your ability to secure additional credit or obtain loans.The benefit is that your creditors cannot garnish your wages during bankruptcy proceedings because initiating bankruptcy proceedings places an automatic stay on any collection actions against you."

To use the HOV lane, you must have at least one other person in the vehicle with you. Look for the white diamond painted on the road or the sign reading “HOV” or “Carpools and Vanpools.”The I-95 and the Beltway have HOV lanes, which are often less congested than other lanes."

Get to Cancun.,
Take the ferry to Isla Mujeres.,
Choose a suitable hotel.,
Get around the island.",How to Travel to Isla Mujeres," Though Isla Mujeres has a very small private planes airport, the usual method for tourists is to fly into Cancun, Mexico, and then catch the high-speed ferry over to the island. Flights and hotels can be booked through your local travel agent, or for additional savings, one of the premier online travel websites.;
, Originally, son's of local fisherman would take small launches over to the mainland and pick up visitors for their stay on the island. Eventually, Isla Mujeres established a regular ferry service, making runs to Puerto Juarez once or twice a day and in the last few years, every half hour.

, There are luxury accommodations on the island from $500.00 plus per night to moderately priced hotels $80.00-$175.00 per night. There is even an international hostel that includes a continental breakfast and starts at $7.00 per night to $33.00 per night.

, You can rent a taxi, but perhaps the real charm of seeing Isla Mujeres is in renting either a moped or a golf cart.

Identify what you can garnish.,
Calculate the amount of wages you can garnish.,
Obtain a writ of garnishment.,
Serve the writ on the garnishee.,
Provide the debtor notice.,
Contest the debtor’s exemption.,
Attend a court hearing, if necessary.",How to Collect a Florida Judgment1," You can seize many different financial assets from the debtor in a process called garnishment. Consider whether to garnish any of the following:Future wages. The debtor’s employer will withhold some of the wages and send the amount to you.
Financial accounts, such as checking or savings accounts. You can get the bank to turn over the money in the accounts to you.
Stock accounts.
Any payment owed to the debtor. Instead of paying the debtor, they will pay you.;
, Florida law prevents you from garnishing all of the debtor’s wages. The amount you can garnish depends on what kind of judgment you are trying to collect on and how much the debtor makes.


Generally, you can only garnish up to 25% of someone’s wages or the amount that exceeds 30 times the minimum wage (currently $8.10 an hour), whichever is less.However, the debtor might only make $243 or less a week. Since this is less than 30 times the minimum wage, you can’t garnish any wages.
If the debtor owes child support payments, then you can garnish 50% of their disposable income.

, Go to the clerk’s office with your certified court judgment and ask for the writ. You will have to file a short motion and pay fees and a deposit.Your clerk might have a fill-in-the-blank motion, or you can find a sample online to use as a guide.Also pick up a claim of exemption form, which you’ll need to give to the debtor.

, This is the person that owes the debtor money. For example, if you are garnishing future wages, then serve the writ on the debtor’s employer. If you’re garnishing a bank account, serve the writ on the bank.

, Eventually, you do need to give the debtor notice. Provide the notice within five days of receiving your writ of garnishment or within three days of serving it on the garnishee, whichever is later. Provide the debtor with the following documents:A copy of your motion for writ of garnishment
A copy of the writ of garnishment issued by the court clerk
The claim of exemption form

, The debtor might believe that the property is exempt. For example, the money in their bank account might be unemployment compensation, Social Security benefits, or public assistance. Also, a debtor is exempt if they are a head of household who provides more than half of the support for a child or other dependent.If the debtor wants to claim an exemption, they will send you a copy of their exemption form.

If you receive the statement by fax or by hand, you have eight days to respond. You must make a statement under oath contesting the exemption and file it with the court.
If you receive the statement by mail, then you have 14 days to file your statement with the court., If either the debtor or the garnishee fights the garnishment, you’ll end up in court. A judge will have to decide whether to garnish. Gather all of your paperwork and take it with you to court."

Notify other lienholders.,
Advertise in the newspaper.,
Receive payment.",How to Collect a Florida Judgment2," Real property includes land and buildings. You can sometimes get a lien on this property, which is a legal right to payment. However, the following rules apply:

The real estate can’t be covered by a homestead exemption. In Florida, this means you can’t levy the debtor’s home, but you can levy other property.The debtor must own the property in their name only. If they own it jointly with their spouse, then the property is probably exempt unless you have a judgment against both spouses., You’ll work with the county sheriff to levy the property. Some counties have detailed instructions for what you need to do, so pick up a copy of the instructions from the sheriff or the court clerk., Take a certified copy of your court judgment to the land records office for the county where the property is located. Tell the clerk you want to file the judgment lien. Your lien is good for 10 years and can be renewed for another 10 years., Go to the court clerk’s office and take your certified court judgment with you. Make several copies, in case the sheriff needs more than one.Ask the clerk for a writ of execution.

If you misplaced your copy of the court judgment, you can pick up another from the clerk.

, The sheriff needs to know if other creditors have put liens on the debtor’s real property. Go to the land records office and check to see if any have been filed. Write down the names of any other lienholders as well as their addresses and the date they recorded the lien.Include all of this information in a signed affidavit.

, You must specifically describe the real property for the sheriff. Look at the legal description of property (and not the tax records). Your instructions for levy should state the amount due and the amount of prior payments.

Check with your sheriff’s office. They may have sample language you must include in your instructions for levy.Your levy instructions should be typed, not written.

, You must gather the following to take to the sheriff’s office with you:The original writ of execution
A copy of the signed final judgment
Your affidavit of judgment liens
Your specific levy instructions

, Hand all documents to the sheriff and pay your cost deposit. This will cover the sheriff’s costs, such as advertising fees, recording fees, etc. You’ll be refunded your deposit if the sale brings in enough money., Either you or the sheriff will notify them of the sale, depending on your county. Check the instructions. For example, in Palm Beach County, the sheriff will send notice using certified mail.However, in other counties, you should send notification this way.

Your notice should tell the lienholders the date and time of the auction.

, You also need to give the public notice of the auction by advertising in a local newspaper for several weeks. The advertisement should list the time and location of the auction. Ask the court clerk or sheriff about which paper you should advertise in., The highest bidder for cash in hand pays the sheriff for the property. At the end of the auction, the sheriff will distribute the proceeds from the sale based on the following priority:The sheriff recoups their fees and costs. If enough money comes in to cover all costs, you get your cost deposit refunded.
You get $500 for expenses, whether you really spent that amount or not. This amount is set by Florida law.
The sheriff pays lienholders based on their priority on filing their lien. You might end up getting nothing if the sheriff runs out of money before getting to your lien.

Identify personal property.,
Check if the property is exempt.,
File your lien with the state.,
Ask for a writ of execution.,
Research if there are other liens.,
Provide the instructions for levy.,
Visit the sheriff.,
Provide notice to other lienholders.,

Receive payment after the sale.",How to Collect a Florida Judgment3," You can ask the sheriff to seize and sell the defendant’s personal property. This includes things like boats, cars, furniture, jewelry, horses, etc., so long as it is in Florida.You need the locate this property. The sheriff won’t find it for you.


You can serve interrogatories or ask the debtor questions under oath in a deposition to find out what property they have. If they lie to you, then they’ve committed perjury.
You can hire a private investigator, if necessary, to find out if the debtor has property in the state.
If you search yourself, don’t do anything illegal, like trespass on the debtor’s property.

, You can’t have the sheriff seize all property. For example, the debtor can exempt $1,000 in a motor vehicle and $1,000 of other personal property. These exemptions don’t apply if the debtor is a business.The debtor might also own the property jointly with their spouse, in which case it is exempt. To be exempt, they must have an equal interest in the property and have taken ownership at the same time while married.For example, if a couple buys a boat together while married and receive joint title at the same time, then it is probably exempt.
However, if the husband buys the boat and two years later puts his wife’s name on the title, then it is not exempt and the sheriff can seize it.

, Fill out the judgment lien certificate, which you can find at http://dos.myflorida.com/sunbiz/forms/judgment-lien/. Make a copy for your records and then file the certificate with the Florida Department of State.You can file and pay the fee online or submit through the mail.


A judgment lien for personal property lasts only five years, but you can renew for another five years., Go to the court that issued your judgment and speak to the court clerk. Show them a copy of your signed judgment, and ask the clerk for a writ of execution. You’ll need to take the writ to the sheriff’s department., Before the sheriff can sell the property, all people with a lien on the property must be notified. Florida requires that you search the www.sunbiz.org website to find out if there are other liens.Also check if any Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) security interests have been filed in the debtor’s name at www.floridaucc.com.
You’ll need to create an affidavit for the sheriff and include all of the information you found about other lienholders. The sheriff might have a sample affidavit you can use, or you can find an example online., You must describe the property you want seized, so that there’s no mistake about what the sheriff takes. You also must tell the sheriff where the property is located., Take your court judgment, writ of execution, affidavit, and levy instructions. The sheriff might need multiple copies of these documents, so call and ask ahead of time.

The sheriff will require that you deposit money to cover some of their expenses and costs associated with the levy and sale.Bring your check book.

, Tell them the day and time of the sale and hold onto proof that you contacted them. Their contact information should be included with their filings with the state.In some counties, the sheriff might contact them., In the local newspaper, advertise the date, time, and location of the sale.Check with the court clerk if there is a particular newspaper you should use. Also ask how long you must run the ad.

, The sheriff will sell the property at auction, and you can bid on it if you want. The sale proceeds will be distributed in the following sequence:The sheriff pays the costs of the sale. If the proceeds cover all costs, the sheriff will refund your deposit out of the proceeds.
The sheriff then pays you $500 for your costs, even if you didn’t spend that much.
Finally, the sheriff pays judgment liens based on priority. So, if someone filed a lien before you did, they will get paid first.

, Try previewing each ride on YouTube, or take a peek at the ride through photos from others. Learn from what others see. This can help decide which rides and attractions will take priority during your visit.

, Food is expensive to buy in the parks, and a simple snack like a granola bar could fit into even the smallest of backpacks.

, You are usually allowed in through the barriers before opening, but you won't have access to most rides unless you are staying at a Universal Orlando Resort hotel. (Guests staying at Universal Resort hotels have Early Park Admission privileges at different times throughout the year.) Getting through the barriers early will give you time to pick up a park map and plan your route to the first ride of the day.

, Discuss some of your other options that exist for the other nearby Universal Resort area. Those options include Universal Studios and CityWalk. With all three of these within a short walk of each other from the walking path and even from the moving walkway in the parking garage, these can be easily accessed without too much additional walking I you later choose to go to these instead. If you'd like, you can also visit Walt Disney World. Its four parks or local attractions are in the area, and they include ""Epcot, the Disney (Hollywood/MGM) Studios, the Magic Kingdom and Disney's Animal Kingdom. There's also SeaWorld Orlando in the area, as well as the Aquatica water park.

, The address to the parking lot for Universal Orlando is located at 6000 Universal Blvd, Orlando, FL 32819. The cost to park your car at this park will run you about $17 for cars, and upwards from there (depending on the complexity of your vehicle)..

,, Although this park is shaped in a circular pattern with seven different lands, the inside of each of these lands will give you a different viewpoint, as each ride is sporadically placed behind the world-famous entrance of the Islands of Adventure lighthouse. These lands include Port of Entry, Marvel Super Hero Island, Toon Lagoon, Jurassic Park, The Wizarding World of Harry Potter Hogsmeade, Lost Continent and Seuss Landing.

, You'll know you've reached the turnstile areas when you see a great big, brightly-colored overhang hanging above you as you enter.

, With the exception of two to three small take-out restaurants and other eateries, no real attractions exist here.

, This roller coaster will leave your heart pounding for about an hour or more, and will definitely psych most people up.

, This ride is Islands of Adventures and Universal Resorts one and only teacup-like ride that exists. Do this if you want the more laid-back version of the roller coaster you did moments ago.

, This ride can be fun, and has plenty of possibilities for many people to ride in/with.

, This ride is especially good just after lunch when stomachs need to settle before letting the heart race again. In addition, this can be a good ride to take in for any Spiderman fan.

, This attraction is recommended if you have kids who love playing without too much supervision. This whimsical playland will keep your kids entertained for a little while, while you wait nearby and watch.

, However, if water isn't your thing, you may want to skip this ride. People tend to comment that this ride will get everybody soaked to a ""point of no return""., Much less watery than it's competition nearby is this log flume that will get you less drenched but can still get your hopes up to get other people nearby just as wet as the boat vehicle exits the flume building at a quick pace.

, You will notice that it looks like a replica of the one from the movies in the Jurassic Park series. Marvel in the glory of seeing this one close-up at least once or twice.

, These swings will swing you back and forth from one place to another, and back to the entrance gate on a track higher in the air than most other swinging rides. But don't loose your grip. Most people report that the popularity of this ride seems to be well closer to the historical mark, but the reason that Universal still offers this ride as a Express pass is questionable to most who ride it to this day.


Be aware that you do need to ride this ride with a child who is between 36 and 56 inches if you are over that height range. ,, Do this if you love the movie version of Jurassic Park and if ultimate log flumes are your enjoyment of a park experience. If you've ever been on Journey to Atlantis, you'll love this ride.

, You will feel like you've entered the museum portion in this completely-walking exhibit from the movie Jurassic Park.

, However, be aware that these can be a bit pricey.

, While this ride is very short, it often has very long waits, so this one may be a good attraction to do first thing, or at the very end of your day.

, Follow a journey that portrays 'Harry Potter's one ride in Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey. This ride too can often have long waits, and the express pass cannot be used, so if you are more of a thrill seeker, then this may be the ride to do first for your group.

, This ride is recommended if you love thrill rides. With the double helix spins that will turn you around a second time before you even exit the first spin at one point, this one is definitely a keeper for some.

, Look out the rather-fake looking windows to watch the Harry Potter journey, or watch out the entryway door as you see people gather and talk about your journey.

,, If other people aren't around it when you reach the area where it lives/hides, he should return something of interest to you that will be on cue with what you said; so ask it a question or answer it's own questions and you can be assured you'll have something that's worthwhile to watch in real-time. The fountain will quite potentially have something witty to tell you about, if it can understand what you have said. Strike up a conversation with this fountain.

, This interesting exhibit compares to nothing else worldwide except to learn a little more about Poseidon. This is entirely walking though, so this may not be the attraction for you if your feet are tired from walking a lot during the day.

,, Learn about Dr. Seuss through some of his excellent ideas that were never truly written down.


Just after leaving the train's entrance gate (into the first building), look down at the restaurant called Circus McGurkus Café Stoo-pendous. It's interesting to watch people from the train, and see what other weird things happen when the train goes past. If you're in the restaurant much later, watch upwards into that corner to see the train as it rolls past to see what stuff you can observe.

, This whimsical carousel will entertain you for a little while.

, This ride is recommended if Dumbo, Flying Carpets of Aladdin and a few others at Disney World along with Kang & Kodos Twirl n' Hurl in Universal Studios Orlando next door wasn't enough thrill for your little one. You may also even get a little wet.

, Try previewing each ride on YouTube, or take a peek at the ride through photos from others. Learn from what others see. This can help decide which rides and attractions will take priority during your visit.

, Food and water are expensive at the park, and easy snacks like graonla bars can fit into even the smallest section of your bag.

, You are usually allowed in through the barriers before opening, however you won't have access to most rides unless you are staying at a Universal Resort hotel. (Guests staying at Universal Resort hotels have Early Park Admission privileges at different times throughout the year.) Getting through the barriers early will give you time to pick up a park map and plan your route to the first ride of the day.

, Discuss some of your other options that exist for the other nearby Universal Resort area which include Islands of Adventure and CityWalk. If you'd like, you can also visit Walt Disney World with it's 4 parks or local attractions in the area including. Epcot, the Disney (Hollywood/MGM) Studios, the Magic Kingdom and Disney's Animal Kingdom. There's also SeaWorld Orlando and the Aquatica water park to choose from., The address to the Universal Studios Orlando is located at 6000 Universal Blvd, Orlando, FL 32819 .The cost to park your car at the Universal Orlando resort will run you about $17 for cars and upwards from there (depending on complexity of vehicle)..

,, This area with the park globe and theatre area gate is what gives this park it's ""remembered"" appearance. If you have other members of your group, consider stopping here to take a picture, as this is a fun photo opportunity.

,, This park is divided into about seven lands spread sporadically behind the world-famous entrance. These lands include Production Central, New York, San Francisco, The Wizarding World of Harry Potter-Diagon Alley, World Expo, Hollywoodand Woody Woodpecker's Kidzone .., This motion simulator animated adventure, if you like the movie Despicable Me will have your heart pumping. Hit this ride right when you enter the park, as wait times will most likely be super long throughout the entire day.

, This experience is similar to ""Despicable Me Minion Mayhem"", and often has very short wait times, so this one is a good one to do if someone in your party doesn't enjoy minions, or right after the ride is over.

, With a really steep incline towards the beginning, this ride can be terrifying but really fun. It's located in between the Despicable Me and former home of the Nickelodeon Studios building.

, Strap on a pair of 3D glasses the movie provides and you'll be in for a thrill of your life.

, The 20 minute show (at the Aquos Theatre in Universal Studios) that is put on there will have you in awe of wanting more Blue Man Group than what you'll see during this visit.

,,, This comical show will have you laughing non-stop for a few hours thereafter.

, This live show is rather entertaining and, in non-Halloween times, is rather interesting to watch.

,,, Talk to the interactive shrunken head who is able to hear every word you say. Few people ever gather around, so there's little chance that you'll ever been more than a minute or two away from talking with the driver. The Knight Bus is across the walkway from the rest of the section near the far right corner of the park, and the entrance to this section is through the gate straight ahead of the front of the bus.

, You'll find this train station just to your left as you enter into this land. Look out the rather-fake looking windows to watch the Harry Potter journey, or watch out the entryway door as you see people gather and talk about your journey. However, unless you have a park-to-park ticket, that allows you to cross into the other park, try not to even enter this attraction, as the other park is outside of Universal Studios

,,, It's gruesome to watch for some, but if you don't mind seeing other people try to face their fears, this attraction can be interesting to watch.

, Similar to Buzz Lightyear's Space Ranger Spin, this ride is rather funny if you have someone playing next to you. Challenge the other player or challenge yourself to beat previous scores, if you've been at this ride before.

,, Much like it's Disney counterpart Dumbo The Flying Elephant Ride at Walt Disney World but with different ride design vehicles, this ride doesn't do much but twirl around a center pole in an endless fashion.

, Even if you are an adult, this funny and comical show gets everyone to have a great time.

, In this indoor show, you'll spend some time with Barney the big purple dinosaur. So whether you are trying to remind yourself of some of the moments you've missed in songs that Barney uses or something else associated to Barney, most of it is here., Although designed for kids to roam around, most often parents participate in the play and watch the kids play closer. This little village features several buildings housing things devoted to some of the Curious George stories over the years.

,,,,,,, This informative show is creative and popular, so expect to arrive at it early. It's viewing area is near the entrance to the Hollywood Blvd and KidZone areas of the park.

Recognize that there are few other real theme park options near Winter Haven, FL (in or near Orlando, FL) with Universal Orlando and Sea World Orlando nearby, #* Recognize the sections of the park that exist here. When you first walk through the gates, you'll enter into several different areas called ""The Beginning"" and DUPLO Village, Fun Town, Pirates Cove, Land of Adventure, Imagination Zone, Lego City, Lego Technic, Lego Kingdoms, World of Chima and this all happens around one final great big land around a final pond in the center in an area many know called Miniland. There is also a separate area for the Water Park that is on site that LEGOLAND calls Water Park on their park map


, The address to this park is located at 1 LEGOLAND Way, Winter Haven, FL33884 The cost to park your car at Legoland will run you about $17 for cars and upwards from there (depending on complexity of vehicle).
, The park contains a total of 12 lands each placed in a circular pattern following a short walk in from the entry area. Their lands here are called The Beginning, Heartlake City, Miniland, Lego Technic, Pirates Cove, Imagination Zone, Lego City, Land of Adventure, Lego Kingdoms, Duplo Valley and Fun Town along with 3 other special lands called World of Chima, Cypress Gardens and the LEGOLAND Water Park.
, This colorful section consists of mostly guest service locations (wheelchair rental, First Aid and the like), shopping and a few quick-service dining options and one ride., The ride doesn't take too long, but it will give you a general perspective of everything you can do in the park later on once you arrive at the entrance gate to the attraction.

, This area is known as Heartlake City. Heartlake City is LEGOLAND Florida's newest land that was unveiled in May-June 2015, Although it first premiered in June 2015, it seems like a pure winner for a little fun for the older aged crew. It seems to be a little wild for the younger crew, but everyone is strapped in tight onto these horse-themed seats.,,, It is this famous, thanks to the creations that are created here. These creations make them famous and help portray the LEGO image on their guests who play at the park.


Look at all the minute details of each LEGO block item that has been constructed. Each item has so much detail - and it was all made to be so...realistic.

,,,, You'll see many of the famous sites of Washington DC shown in LEGO blocks including the White House (including the president and his pet dog, Bo) and Capitol, the Washington Monument, Jefferson Memorial as well as some of the Smithsonian National Mall all carved in Lego blocks.

, Look at the intricate detail of the New York skyline with it's Statue of Liberty and Empire State Building, Times Square and many other places in this section that are devoted to New York (City).

, This section houses such items as the Naboo, Genosis, Kashyyk & Mustafar, Tatooine, Hoth, an Endor village, and the Christophea (from the Clone Wars).

,, Although still quite small, it'll pack a pretty punch and shows what the LEGO designers really can do when given time to create on and near water.

, This section contains such LEGO figures as Key West's Mallory Square section and some of the famous war mansions from the panhandle to Central Florida's Bok Tower.

,, This attraction, though themed as being in the LEGO Technic style, is actually nothing like a LEGO Technic complexity and is full-blown metal on metal!, This power ski-like ride is positioned around a small moat as you dodge water blasts from water blasters positioned on the outside of the moat looking in. Be careful though- as on this ride, you'll be standing on the wave runner the entire time.

, Although Technicycle is much like the Dumbo rides in the Disney Parks, the LEGOLAND Technicycle ride is unique in that it looks like a Lego block with bicycle-like propulsion features that allow it's rider to move the vehicle up and down (at will) in the shaft.

, With the exception of the sides of some of the buildings here and the music sections playing overhead, there isn't much to see here. You can find a ski show in the Water Ski Show in the Pirates Cove Live Water Ski Show venue or pick a drier show in the Special Events Venue (when used) and watch that show instead. But this section is rather uninteresting to most people at this time.

, Although there is a minimum height requirement, this fun attraction can be ridden by many, and can be fun to teach your children what happens during a freefall event all while keeping the guest safe. The freefall towers are colorful and fun to look at. Many kids adore the ride towers and the colors tend to draw the kids eyes quite quickly as you reach into this area of the park.,, With several games inside (in the style of some new gaming systems), there's no way that no one can find something they don't like., For many, you'll need to make special reservations at the building inside the Imagination Zone area.However, careful; as this attraction isn't open long to suit school hours nearby. It is open from 10am till 2pm Eastern Time., Also, again, this attraction also tries to suit school hours nearby (10am til 2pm Eastern Time)., Even if you are an experienced boater and can deal with not having a propulsion system that isn't generated by the park at the entrance to the ride, this can really cut you a small break.

,, Much like that of the Tommorrowland Speedway in Walt Disney World in Florida or Autopia in Disneyland in California, this will have you and your kids driving these LEGOLAND cars around like a pro.


If your kids aren't up to driving cars yet, walk up to the Ford Jr(Junior) Driving School instead. There, they don't even have to worry about driving, and can be left up to sit in the car and watch it move around a circular track by themselves, looking at all the other LEGO stuff nearby. Ford Jr Driving School is by far the first building you come to of the two Driving School items, but adults can watch their children ride.







,, You'll feel like you really are flying in a hang-glider under more extreme g forces around some tight curves and corners. No helixes exist on this ride however,so don't worry about that.

, The Jeeps they ride in for this safari will have your kids laughing. They will see several cute bricked animals made completely of Lego/DUPLO blocks as they ride around a track for a few minutes.

, Although short, the ride operators will send it's guests around this out-and-back coaster track twice before returning to the station to debunk it's guests.

, This super-mild attraction will leave your kids jumpy for a few minutes and want to make them become more like the beetle that all kids think they are. This ride raises them about 15 feet in the air, then bounces them back to earth rather gently.

, Although not fast, most people find it rather interesting to see all the LEGO creations here. Each room tells it's own story, so explore each room as the ride unfurls.

, This area will keep your kids thrilled that they've enticed some pharaohs. The only LEGO creations you'll see are in the queue for the attraction on the outside, so don't worry if the kids think it will be scary when you mention about what a pharaoh is and what could happen (what could happen, won't happen); most kids come out happy and some even come out laughing, having learned a little about the pharaoh lifestyle in a ""fun"" way.,, This attraction can be amusing to the parents, but it is especially meant for the children.

,, This part-roller coaster and part-LEGO looking attraction will leave you baffled before you even realize the roller coaster segment even started. Out of the starting gate, this attraction doesn't accelerate much, but does show you a few LEGO items that have been constructed and is indoors. But then things get wild - the ride then becomes the roller coaster everyone fears. It features several corkscrew turns at a moderate intensity level, it doesn't get much beyond that.

, Whether it's building with DUPLO blocks or sliding down a rather colorful slide or something the youngest children will adore, this area can keep these small kids active and yet enthused., With all the water games happening here, it'll be hard to steer your children away from all this fun watery areas.,, This super-slow moving train will bring your children on a ride that will make them think they've taken a real train ride through the countryside - only to find out that the residents of this countryside are DUPLO block residents who don't particularly move a whole lot - if at all!, This active play area will keep your kids amused and active for a little while.,, Fun Town doesn't have too many rides, but what rides it does have, it really tries to excel at., You will be able to see LEGO bricks being made in front of your eyes in action.

, Ride a larger LEGO-looking horse on a carousel wheel on this double-decker carousel. This Carousel is one of the few Carousels that exist inside a LEGOLAND park.

, With three movie types - from a Movie called LEGO Legends of Chima, to a Clutch Powers 4D Adventure to even a Spellbreaker 4D movie, these 12 minute shows will excite all who come to visit this building., You will be able to play in the water area called ""Cragger's Swamp"" or shoot water out of a small water cannon at a bird-looking ornament in ""The Quest for CHI"" or run a Speedorz Lego-action figure through an obstacle course. Having only been opened in 2014, this area might be small, but it will eventually grow to become a viable playing area - but for now, we'll just have to wait and see to what it becomes at a more smaller scale.

, Whether it's sailing down a lazy river in a raft (filled with water and several LEGO blocks) or it's playing in other water-areas onsite in this land, this area can meet most guests expectations. However, be prepared to bring some water clothes (bathing suit) underneath regular day clothes to play in this area of the park.

, It might be a far cry from what it was pre-LEGOLAND days, but with Legoland's thought of bringing back a park that was here after people's cries were heard by the management team, there is now a Cypress Gardens area of the park where you can sit back and relax or stroll around and calm down from the rest of the park's excitement.

Make all your reservations for all of your traveling party.,
Pack for your trip.,
Recognize that there are a lot of kid-friendly places in Orlando you can choose.,
Get to know what your kids are into.,
Look to visit Walt Disney World for a few days.,
Look at viewing the kid-friendly SeaWorld Orlando.,
Look to take in LEGOLAND Florida at the former home of Cypress Gardens just a few minutes from Orlando in Winter Haven, FL (part of the suburbs of Orlando).

,
Look to take in one day at the Universal Resort.,
Look for awesome museums the kids can visit, if time still persists.",How to Visit Orlando with Kids," This should include your airfare, car rental (if renting a car), hotel reservations and wealth of other choices for both the adults and children in your family.;
, Bring clothes that are meant for warmer weather, even in the Winter months. Pack enough clothes for both the kids and the relatives that are traveling with the child.

, Recognize some of the ideas that draw kids ecstatic upon the knowledge of going to Orlando (Florida).

, Depending on the kid's tastes, they can either be into theme parks and fun or into not so much fun and more education. Between zoos and the wealth of libraries that present education to the child, to the wealth of more fun and educational places, to the few (non-Disney/Universal places), there's actually a wealth of stuff to do with the kids just in Orlando alone.

, Between a few days at the Magic Kingdom and Disney's Animal Kingdom to Epcot and Disney's Hollywood Studios, almost all kids' eyes will light up when you say that you can take them there. Plan at the bare minimum 1 day at each of the parks, and make sure that one of those parks is the Magic Kingdom park.

, With so much live-action animal attractions, this should be another spot you can take in on a kids trip to Orlando.

,, Plan at least one day at Islands of Adventure where a whimsical land called Seuss Landing, and Toon Lagoon even has a few attractions that inspires the kids everywhere you are. Look for a few attractions in Universal Studios across the walkway to offer a few attractions that are kid-friendly (such as the Animal Actor's Stage and a few others around the park).

, With the wealth of other museums in Orlando, what better places to visit than museums. But be careful as some museums are not very kid-friendly. One of the great choices lays just at the corner of the Orlando, FL border at WonderWorks on International Drive. This whimsical-looking museum (as seen from the outside) will have your kids wondering if it will fall over once you get inside. Until later, they realize that it won't, all pointing to the fact that they've learned a little science.


WonderWorks is so close to the border, its literal neighbor has a Kissimmee, FL address, and it has an Orlando, FL address.






Look for other awesome exhibit places on International Drive in Orlando, to exist. For those chocolate lovers, browse through the World of Chocolate Museum.
Take a stroll through the Ripley's Believe it Or Not Museum.






Learn about the Titanic. Near Orlando, there's a museum that's completely devoted to the Titanic.

This can help decide which rides and attractions will take priority during your visit or which attractions you'll feel you or your family will want to miss.



Busch Gardens doesn't allow video taping on any ride without prior approval by park staff. Ask them for permission, they potentially will. For most rides on YouTube, you'll need to include a true statement that says that you received permission before riding - as anything that doesn't will get taken down if found by Busch Gardens staff. This is to ward off those who post their journey for others so others don't have to ride if they don't want to; they want these videos to be only a preview of the park's attractions and nothing more.

,, Although Tampa is mostly about MLB spring training, there are other minor league parks in the area that double as other entertainment values, as well as other smaller areas in the immediate vicinity. Look for the Tampa Bay Rays to play their major league games at Tropicana Field inside Tampa-St Petersburg, FL (April to early, early October). If you want, you can extend your search north east towards the towns of Lake Buena Vista and Orlando, FL where there are more choices to choose from including Walt Disney World's metropolitan complex of parks and resorts as well as Universal's system and even a SeaWorld. Or if you want, you can extend yourself over to St Petersburg and take a dip in the Gulf of Mexico's crystal clear beaches and shores.

, The address to Busch Gardens Tampa is 1165 N McKinley Drive, Tampa, FL 33612The cost to park at this park's parking lot is $18 per day, though for closer spots you'll need to spend a little more at $24., Due to the traffic problem and roadway situation being very hefty to try and cross and confusing to most who aren't from the Tampa area, Busch Gardens wants all it's visitors to take a tram or quick access vehicle to drive them up to the gate instead.

, Busch Gardens Tampa has only one gate at the corner of three area lands called Morocco, Nairobi and Egypt.

, This park is divided into about ten different lands. These lands include Morocco, Bird Gardens, Sesame Street Safari of Fun. Stanleyville, ""Jungala, Congo, Pantopia, Nairobi, Egypt, and Cheetah Hunt., It's neat to look at all the Moroccan themed-motifs here. Although when you walk to the grand entrance of the park the theatre will be directly in front of you, you'll be positioned with it's back end facing towards the entrance. You'll need to walk to the other side of the building following the path to get to the entrance of it.

,, Although themed to paragliding and airplanes, this hub-and-spoke ride is rather bland, but important enough that some children will choose to ride it.

, Although most shows are done at night, you can come back to this area later that day and take in a show. Most nights that the park is open, you'll be able to catch a showing here.

, However, you can move around them without touching them or interacting with them. If you are severely allergic to birds and feathers, you could walk around this park starting in the Egypt land and walk towards Nairobi and walk back later, tacking Morocco last, but if you don't have a feather allergy, walk through this exhibit.


Talk to a park employee if you have a severe allergy to feathers or birds, as they might have other suggestions for you to follow to get you around this problem or to take an alternate route few people actually know about.

, There are two areas that are devoted to types of birds.

, This area is for special events, but if you are an invited guest or they are holding an event there, you may be able to take a look around. According to the Busch Gardens map, although paired to Bird Gardens-land, it's actually in the area held for Morocco-land.

, The many birds that exist here use locomotion as their main transport method, though they do have feathers.

, (You could even call this area Lorikeet Landing and the staff would understand what you mean for this attraction). If they have you feed the birds, you can do so with their supplied food. If you've walked across the walking path bridge near the Sesame Street Safari of Fun (that goes overtop of the train tracks), you've gone too far.

, Most days there is, but you'll have to inquire at the gates for exact times of shows. There is no need for a reservation, but come a little early before the show to ensure you have a good spot where your kids can watch your favorite Sesame Street Muppet in action. Some of the bigger-than-life Muppets are there to put on a performance in front of your kids.

, To see if your children will tolerate bigger nastier roller coasters later in life, try them out on this one. Although the ride is short, it'll prepare them and you for whatever lies ahead with thrills and them.

, This area also includes three other attractions called Telly's Jungle Jam which is an interactive play area as well as a swing ride called Rosita Djembe's Fly-Away and a water play area called Bert&Ernie's Watering Hole., You'll see several pieces of wide open plain where the animals roam freely in the ride from Stanleyville. It has three stops at Nairobi and Congo along with this one here in Stanleyville. (Watch out, if you are getting out at Congo; the platform is on a slight up-grade.)

,, Although this roller coaster is popular and almost new, it's also well worth the wait in line as the length of track and ride is long enough to become more than bearable.


This is not a kiddie roller coaster. This roller coaster is the ""real deal here"".
If you choose to skip the train, circle counterclockwise in this land around to the right to get to this attraction.

,,, However, much like it's Williamsburg brother, the Skyride vehicles here are enclosed buckets. You'll find this attraction's entrance very near to the entrance to the Jungala land of the park. There is another Skyride location located in Cheetah Hunt later, but this one is open if you'd like to visit it and leave the animals well alone.


When these two rides run into the building to turn around, they sometimes meet next to each other, but you're always above and will never touch each other arm-to-arm.

, The attraction will be on your right as you enter.

, Although this ride sounds mighty, it's not! It bobs your ride vehicle up a pole several times and then within 90 seconds, brings you back down.

, This jungle gym will have your kids loose some of their energy over the course of the day. Interact with your kids inside, if you want, the opening and entrance is sturdy and big enough for most to fit adults to fit through.

, Work this land clockwise from the point of entry, and this ride will board near the back of the land.

, Kumba is Busch Gardens Tampa's other famous roller coaster, with all it's metallic helixes that will turn you upside down several times.

, If you haven't taken a round trip on this train already, take a complete ride on it for at least one full loop. Make sure you've gone past the Serengeti Plain at least once. It has three stops consisting of other stops at Stanleyville, Nairobi and this one.

, With this ride, it's safe to bump with your cars. However, this attraction is faced the opposite way compared to the direction you originally were headed in, and you must double back for it if you plan to ride it.

, Stop yourself from going past the Painted Camel Bazaar archway that crosses the walking path, until you've ridden yourself on each ride that sparks your fancy in this land.

,,,, Formerly known as Cheetah Chase, this Wild Mouse roller coaster will take you on a journey no one will ever forget.

,, These games are mainly just repeats of earlier attractions in another location in the park, with the same general reason for existing.

,


The Plain can only be legally seen from the train ride or at the edge of where the Skyride will take you to if you look far off into the distance before it turns and heads back to it's ""home base"" just before it heads back towards Stanleyville right next to Jungala. Also, the Skyride from the Cheetah Hunt area will take you overtop of the Plains 100%.

,,, This building is the location where you can ask questions about the plains or how to reserve your spot in one of the few tours that go on nearby.

, The Nairobi train station train will take you through the Serengeti Plain past several animals about 10-15 minutes away. Nairobi train station's train is your best view of the Serengeti Plain as it takes you from place to place as you watch and interact with their freely-roaming wild animals such as birds, giraffes, lions, etc. that, if tempted may even come up to your train car and say ""hi"" to you.

, If you interact with one, you won't have enough time to interact with the other. You'll have to skip one of these two for time constraints.

, ""Aren't the penguins cute with the tricks they play?""

,, Although the land comes off of the main entrance area, it's main concourse is a small strip of land across from the Edge of Africa area of the park on the opposite side of the train tracks.

,, However, much like it's Williamsburg brother, the Skyride vehicles here are enclosed buckets. You'll find this attraction's entrance very near to the entrance to the Jungala land of the park. There is another Skyride location located in Stanleyville/Jungala area later, if you don't want to see any animals that this park is famous for.

, One of the two last roller coaster will finish your day, but when the temptation pangs express thrill, run wild with them. You will feel like you are really chasing cheetahs on this ride, though you won't see any.

,,, This roller coaster will be opening in summer 2016 - so stay tuned. There were some computer sketches and previewed by the ride's engineers in 2015."

,, Discuss some of your other options that exist in Orlando. Between the Universal Orlando theme parks and the 4 major theme parks in Walt Disney World and a mess of other things nearby, this might or might not be the right fit for your family.

, The address to SeaWorld is 7007 Sea World Drive, Orlando, Florida 32821 .The cost to park your car at the SeaWorld Orlando resort will run you about $17 for cars and upwards from there (depending on complexity of vehicle).. And even if you factor in SeaWorld's owned separate theme park called Discovery Cove, SeaWorld is another experience to nourish for a day.


For free parking, challenge yourself to walk a tiny bit further away at the Discovery Cove lot across the Central Florida Parkway. Discovery Cove is directly across from SeaWorld, and with the great value this lot contains for the price, it's well worth the extra effort to walk a few extra yards.This lot is tiny and may fill up fast. Have some better reason to be there than just the price. This lot is only about one-fifth the size of the SeaWorld direct lot.

, With it's lighthouse on a pier display, it's interesting to take a few seconds to look at it. You won't find this display at other places. This area is known as Port of Entry.

, Although SeaWorld Orlando has several lands, it's lands have little to no signage behind them. Each land is formed by at least one major attraction and several smaller attractions. With the exception of the entry area these lands include Sea of Shallows, Sea of Legends, Sea of Ice, Sea of Delight, Sea of Mystery, Sea of Fun and Sea of Power.

, For the first time, you'll be able to see many different turtles up close that you wouldn't otherwise see.

, This is the location of the very funny Pets Ahoy! theater production number.

, This show will have you laughing for a little while.

, With the Shark Encounter exhibit located in this area, it's actually a bit interesting to look at for adults, but be careful with children as some children will seem scared to enter. Only until they can realize that there's a cage that separates them from the sharks, will they feel they can enter safely without getting bitten or hurt.

, It is by far confusing for most visitors to watch a show as weird as the one shown in this area.

,, Skip them if you feel the sun beating down on you is too powerful or you have no experience with other paddle boats. Plus, there is little to no extra protection from drowning (should a drowning occur here) due to no supervision onsite.

, Sea of Fun is actually the water-fun and kid-friendly part of the park (not geared towards any animals). It features several water-fun (splash) areas..

,, Get to know a lot more about his habit and environment and a little more information about how powerful his fins really are.


Be careful to know exactly what times the Shamu show is showing on that particular day. It normally only has a few times it shows.

Be careful of the Splash Zone at the Shamu zone. They take safety extra-seriously here. So this article doesn't spoil the fun, you'll see why this article and the theatre cautions you to sit back in the upper deck if you don't want to get super soaked. If it looks like fun after one round, go ahead and sit through another show in the bottom row of seats.

Explore the island.","How to Have a Vacation in Marco Island, Florida"," Marco Island boasts a tropical climate that's generally ideal for vacations all year long, with hot, humid summers and dry, mild winters. The peak season is roughly May-October (when most hotels will be booked and tourists descend onto the island), and the off-season is roughly November-April (when less crowds are present and bargains abound).;
, While there are plenty of nice hotels to choose from, you can often get better deals renting a condo or even a fully-equipped vacation home with a private pool. If you don't or can't find somewhere to stay in Marco Island that meets your needs, consider looking slightly further up the coast for lodging in Naples.

, The white-sand beaches of Marco Island are gorgeous, and the sunset views are incredible. You can also:


Go swimming in the calm Gulf waters
Look for seashells (there are plenty)
Rent a charter boat and go fishing, ask your captain to filet your fish, and then take your catch to the Snook Inn and they will personally cook it to your liking
Explore the many smaller islands and sandbars
Go on a dolphin-spotting cruise

, While Marco Island isn't renown for its nightlife by any means (there is a noise ordinance in effect at night, and most venues close before midnight), you can go to one or more of the several bars. Some places worth checking out are La Casita with live entertainment on the weekends, and Vandys With An Edge that is a sports bar with TVs in every booth.

, If you like to walk in the morning, check out Tigertail Beach, which is the best spot to find shells and sand dollars. The front of the Marriott Hotel is a good place for tourists to visit; there is a walk-up bar, and at night there is sometimes entertainment nearby on the beach. South Beach is where all of the locals go. When you get tired of the beach, you can go to plentiful shops. Once you get on South Collier, go towards the Marriott and there are many shops, stores and places to eat. There is even a movie theater with the latest releases.

Keep the climate in mind.,
Bring a swimsuit.,
Carry a wrap, a cover up or a light jacket.,
Show some skin.,
Focus on Latin culture for fashion inspiration.,
Dress up for dinner.,
Wear something that makes a statement when you dress for Miami nightlife.,
Accessorize.,
Choose shoes that suit the occasion.",How to Dress in Miami," Miami is very close to the equator and is the only US metropolitan city that is considered to have a tropical environment, meaning summers are hot and humid and winters are dry and warm. Consider the following fabric facts when you dress for Miami:


Sheer fabrics. During the summer months, especially, sheer fabrics are ideal for letting a breeze in and cooling the skin.
Natural fabrics. All-natural fabrics like silk and cotton wick moisture away from the skin. However, natural fabrics also absorb the air's humidity and can become very heavy and shapeless after only a short time in the Miami heat. Choose thin weaves when wearing natural fabrics, as opposed to linens.
Synthetics. Synthetics or synthetic blends will not soak up the moisture in the air. However, they do not breathe well and can trap sweat inside just as well as they keep the humidity out. Avoid thick, 100 percent polyester materials in favor of thin, rayon blends.;
, Part of the Miami experience is spending time in the South Beach area. Therefore, a swimsuit is a necessity when dressing for Miami.

, While it is true that Miami stays warm throughout the year, even during the winter months, you will need something to put on quickly when going from the outside heat to the inside air conditioning. Some form of cover is also important if you want to dress for Miami parties, because many Miami parties are held on rooftops, which can get very breezy at night.

, For Miami style, the trend is toward showing as much skin as you are comfortable with-the more skin, the better.

, Remember that Miami style is based on Latin influences. This means bold colors, tropical prints and, if you are a female, form-fitting silhouettes that flatter the body's curves.

, It is customary for people in Miami to wear more formal attire when they frequent dining venues. Women often wear short dresses and men often dress in brightly colored button-ups and slacks.

, Miami club goers tend to exaggerate the Miami style when they go out at night, opting for eye-catching colors, patterns and silhouettes.

, Big, sparkly jewelry and bold wardrobe embellishments are ideal compliments to the Miami style. Additionally, hats and sunglasses are necessary for protection from the Miami sun.

, This means that you should bring a variety of footwear to Miami:


Walking shoes are a necessity for sight-seeing by foot. These may be tennis shoes or comfortable walking sandals.
Flip-flops are ideal for a day at the beach. Just remember that South Beach is a place to be seen and your flip flops, however casual they are, should match your swim attire.
For dinners and clubbing in Miami, your shoes are the crowning jewel of your nighttime attire and should be reflective of the no-holds-barred Miami style. For men, shined leather dress shoes are appropriate. For women, high heels are advisable.

, Try previewing each ride on YouTube, or take a peak at the ride through photos from others. Learn from what others see. This can help decide which rides and attractions will take priority during your visit.

,, You are usually allowed in through the barriers before opening; however you won't have access to most rides until opening. Getting through the barriers as early as possible will give you time to pick up a park map and plan your route to the first ride of the day.

, The address to Universal Studios Hollywood is located at 100 Universal City Plaza, Los Angeles, Universal City, CA 91602.. Be on the lookout for the parking garage for the Universal Studios Hollywood resort, as the Jurassic Parking garage and Curious George parking garage and Woody Woodpecker lot are for CityWalk guests only. Parking rates vary by time of entry costing about $17 to park before 3PM and $10 after that time period up until park closing., This area with the theatre area gate with accompanying red carpet is what gives this park its memorable appearance.

,, This park is divided into two areas, based on whether or not the item is on the ""Upper Lot"" or the ""Lower Lot"". The Upper Lot hosts most of the rides, shopping and food establishments, while the backlot (Lower Lot) hosts the TV shows that are taped here. Each ride inside of the park makes up its own ""land"" and is placed in an almost circular pattern around a replica Universal Box Office tower.,, Although this show has changed over the years, this show may still be dazzling.

, Whether Homer, Bart, Marge, Lisa or Maggie is your favorite, you'll want to ride alongside them.

, Although Universal Studios Orlando in Florida (2000 miles away) once had a tour like this, this park still has the Studio Tour which allows you to take a studio tram through all these different places, showing you just some of the backlot. The tour features many houses and cars from all different movies, and you may be able to see the house that the new ""Home and Family"" TV show (Hallmark Channel) uses to tape, so be prepared to look out for it.

, Even if you are an adult, this funny and comical show gets everyone to have a great time.

, This area is bound to let your kids run off all the excess energy that they may have, so the parents can wind down and ready themselves for the rest of their time in the park.

, This motion simulator animated adventure will have your heart pumping, particularly if you like the movie Despicable Me.

, The entrance to the Lower Lot is between the Universal Animal Actors and Super Silly Fun Land attractions.

, This daring raft ride is part raft ride and extreme log flume combined, so only those who are up to the challenge should take this ride.

, Strap on a pair of 3D glasses the movie provides and you'll be in for a thrill of your life.

, While many folks feel uncomfortable not having the actual address of the home ahead of time, think of this: How would you like to stay in a vacation home when the entire world knows you’re vacationing and probably will be at Disney most of the time.

, You'll be surprised how many are not.

, If you are not a smoker, be certain to obtain a guarantee that the house is smoke-free. The same holds true for pets. If you are allergic to animals, make certain that no animals have been allowed in the rental home.

Recognize that there are few other real theme park options in Carlsbad, CA (near San Diego, CA) with the only real exception being SeaWorld of San Diego, but if you are willing to drive for about an hour or so, a wealth of other choices exist in the nearby Los Angeles and Anaheim, CA area.
Recognize the sections of the park that exist here. When you first walk through the gates, you'll enter into several different areas called ""The Beginning"" and ""Explorer Island"", DUPLO Village, Fun Town, Pirate Shores, Castle Hill, Land of Adventure, Imagination Zone and this all happens around one final great big land around a final pond in the center in an area many know called Miniland USA.

, The address to this park is located at 1 LEGOLAND Drive, Carlsbad, CA 92008 .The cost to park your car at Legoland will run you about $15 for cars and upwards from there (depending on complexity of vehicle).

,, This area is the primary shopping and guest services area for the park., If you can like, you can make up his own name for your own records as you get there., Although short, the ride operators will send it's guests around this out-and-back coaster track twice before returning to the station.

, Much like a few digging areas of some of the Disney parks, this digging pit will allow your child to dig for dinosaur bones in the sand pit.

, Much like what DUPLO is meant to be for, this DUPLO-based area is designed to work in the age factors of those younger than 4 years old.

, This whimsical ride is fairly slow and is easy to explain to your kids as they ride around in this slow-moving boat.

, This super-slow moving train will bring your children on a ride that will make them thing they've taken a real train ride through the country side - only to find out that the residents of this countryside are DUPLO block residents who don't particularly move a lot.

, This Jeep safari will have your kids laughing at the cute bricked animals made completely of Lego/DUPLO blocks.

, Look at the fine craftsmanship of the area to see just what detail goes into making the famed Lego Movie on such a small size. With the magnifying glasses, you can see anything that is too small to see all of the finer points., With all the water games happening here, it'll be hard to steer your children away from all this fun.

,, Much like that of the Tommorrowland Speedway in Walt Disney World(Florida) or Autopia at Disneyland nearby, this will have you and your kids driving these LEGOLAND cars around like a pro.


If your kids aren't up to driving cars yet, walk up to the Junior Driving School instead. There, they don't even have to worry about driving, and can be left up to sit in the car and watch it move around a circular track by themselves, looking at all the other LEGO stuff nearby.







, Being similar to the Dumbo ride at Disneyland but styled to portray an airplane, this will have you and your kids exploring the rest of the park's outside attractions in a real-fun way for a few minutes.

, This fun attraction, although a minimum height is set, can be ridden by many and can be fun to teach your children what happens during a freefall event. This colorful ride towers are attractive to many kids and can easily make most children's eyes spot them quickly.

,,, However, arrive early (at rope drop time) to this attraction, or come later in the day when lines have significantly cooled down.

, This motorized vehicle is much similar to PeopleMover in Walt Disney World. However, due to the transportation of this vehicle being by footpower (and by the same method as a bicycle), guests should be in shape enough and have some knowledge of bicycle riding to ride this attraction.

, To get an idea of what it takes for this ride, watch it once or twice. As the helicopter spins around in a circle, you can change it's direction via the steering wheel in front of you. However, these helicopters move around super-slowly that this really isn't a great place to go if you are psyched for faster-action items to try.

, Most of these attractions in this area/land are only open during a certain season, due to the fact that most of this area is devoted to water attractions that squirt water and sometimes soak the visitor.

, This attraction is open all-year long.

, Not only is the attraction out in the outside during the time, but the drops aren't that high or powerful. This attraction is the only other ride in this area that is open year-round.

, All of these attractions feature water-attractions. And if that's not enough, they even have a piece that can come pouring down on you at all times of the year. The bad thing is: it's a seasonal attraction.

, This ride has larger drops and even has a bridge near the drop-zone when people pass under it. This ride is more popular than Treasure Falls in terms of intensity, but even those LEGO enthusiasts will love it for it's LEGO creations near the border of the track.

, This attraction is a seasonal attraction.

, This is a seasonal attraction.
,, With all the catwalks and rope ladders, and play areas and what, there's no telling when the kids will want to stop. This attraction has one area where there are much larger-than-life LEGO blocks that your kids can play with. However, with all the energy-busting of this attraction, keep an eye on your kids for when they tend to lose strength and break free for becoming cranky for the remainder of the day. Don't over psych your kids on this attraction otherwise you may lag behind the rest of the day.

, This robotic arm will spin you around, upside down and close to inside out (with safety barriers in place). And with a selection of intensities to choose from, there's no telling how wild your particular ride can be until you choose one of the predetermined levels.

, This attraction can be amusing to the parents, but it is especially meant for the children.

, This part roller coaster, part LEGO looking attraction will leave you baffled before you even realize it's over. Although this ride features several corkscrew turns at a moderate intensity level, it doesn't get much beyond that. However, out of the starting gate, this attraction doesn't accelerate much to show you all the LEGO items that have been constructed to show you.

, This attraction, though not wild in the least, will leave your kids jumpy for a few minutes and want to make them become more like the beetle that all kids think they are. This ride raises them about 15 feet in the air, then bounces them back to earth rather gently.

, On the suspended fixed track, you and your kids can soar round and round for a few minutes to make your children think they've taken flight in the airplane-themed ride vehicle, which will raise them no higher than 6 feet above the ground.

, Although featured to be a LEGO-styled wave slide, it is just that: a slide. It might have a few pairs of double-helix corkscrews, but it won't rock your roller-coaster mind when you get up to the top, and later end up at the bottom there for many enthusiasts.

, Although not fast, most people find it rather interesting to see all the LEGO creations here. Each room tells it's own story, so explore each room as the ride unfurls.

, Styled much like Hideaways (as you learned about earlier), this area will keep your kids thrilled that they've enticed some Pharaohs. The only LEGO creations you'll see are in the queue for the attraction on the outside.

, Ride a power ski around a small moat as you dodge water blasts from water blasters positioned on the outside of the moat looking in. Be careful though, as on this ride, you'll be standing on the wave runner the entire time.

, Shaped like BIONICLE creations, these ride vehicles will keep your mind spinning for several minutes after the ride actually stops.

, However, careful; as this attraction isn't open long to suit school hours nearby. It is open from 10am til 2pm Pacific Time.

,, For many, you'll need to make special reservations at the building inside the Imagination Zone area. Also, again, this attraction also tries to suit school hours nearby (10am til 2pm Pacific Time).

, This attraction, though themed as being in the LEGO Technic style, is actually nothing like a LEGO Technic complexity and is full-blown metal on metal!

,, It is located around the lake near the front of the park. If you were looking at your map, it would be on your right hand side, near the bridge that crosses from Fun Town/DUPLO Village.

, It is this famous, thanks to the creations that are created here...they are so notable and all.


Look at all the minute details of each LEGO block item that has been constructed. Each item has so much detail - and it was all made to be so...realistic.

, This section houses not only George Washington, but other famous people as well.

,,,,, Whether it's the Empire State building or its Freedom Tower or it's one of many other skyrises in LEGOs, the New York section should have it all.

, You'll get to see the Golden Gate Bridge in LEGOs along with other things that make San Francisco stand out from all the other cities in the country.

, Whether it's the Griffith Park Observatory or it's Greumann's Chinese Theater, the intricate details is intense and what makes this section stand out.

, The designers even tried to portray the election outcomes of each of the last few presidents we've had since the park opened in 1999. The Washington DC section houses such sights as the Lincoln Memorial, the Capitol and Washington Monument.

,, Sometimes classics are great, and this classic is no different than the mainstream phrase.

, Although the Coast Starlight runs primarily in the day, you may want to sleep for a duration during the long ride.

Assess your vehicle and group size.,
Identify whether or not you need it to be portable.,
Evaluate your projected usage.,
Ask your car company.,
Determine which pass you need.,
Visit your local Sunpass service station or turnpike.,
Check in with local pharmacies.,
Visit AAA.,
Hop online.,
Purchase via mail or fax.",How to Buy a Florida Sunpass," If you are using a Sunpass for a single vehicle, the mini Sunpass transponder will work well for your needs. If you have multiple vehicles or a vehicle with more than two axles, you will need a standard Sunpass transponder.Sunpasses may be shared between family members. If you have several members of the family who will regularly pass tolls, the full-size will best suit your needs.;
, The greatest difference between the two types of Sunpass is portability: the mini is a sticker affixed permanently to a single windshield, while the standard pass is able to move from vehicle to vehicle. If you need to move your Sunpass, avoid the mini.


The mini is ideal for a single traveler or people who share a single vehicle.
The mini is also $20 cheaper than the standard Sunpass, which makes it the more economical choice.

, If you anticipate a lot of usage, you may qualify for special discounts. If you anticipate a lot of usage between multiple vehicles, purchasing the standard size is the best option.Some routes provide yearly passes, while others provide frequent user discounts. Check with your local routes to determine what discounts may be available.

, If you are just visiting Florida and want a Sunpass to cut down on tolls, check with local car rental companies. Many have deals on Sunpasses to draw customers in. Choosing to go this route may wind up being less expensive than driving your own vehicle.If you already have a standard Sunpass, you can also use a rental car, but must record the rental car’s license plate number.

, Not all retailers offer both the Sunpass and Sunpass mini, so knowing which one you choose will weed out which locations you are able to purchase from.


If you are purchasing directly from the state, you can decide on either pass. If you are unsure which is best, Sunpass customer service can help determine what makes the most sense for your needs.

, The most straightforward way to purchase a Sunpass is to visit a state store or turnpike. Purchasing a Sunpass in these areas is great if you are unsure what your needs are, as you can discuss your lifestyle and travel habits with the vendors.This option is best for individuals who are not familiar with the Sunpass system.

, Pharmacies such as CVS have been authorized to both sell and reload Sunpasses, making it as easy as a trip to the pharmacy to enjoy the convenience of pre-paid tolls.

, AAA is another authorized retailer. This one is particularly helpful if you have AAA insurance, as you can kill two birds with one stone and pay your bill while purchasing or refilling your Sunpass., You can also purchase Sunpasses online, though you will need to either have the pass shipped or pick it up from an authorized retailer. This is a convenient option if you don’t need your Sunpass immediately, as you can purchase from the comfort of your home and await delivery.This option is fairly painless, and requires you to complete a basic online application and payment form.

, If you are not comfortable using online forms, you can also purchase a Sunpass through the mail or through a fax. This functions much in the same way as purchasing online, in that you must then wait for your pass to be shipped to your home.This is a great choice for older men and women who are not comfortable or familiar with technology, but still want to purchase from home.

Decide what are the reasons for buying land in Florida.,
If you are looking to live in Florida, which areas are you considering?,
Do your research on the seller/broker.,
Ensure that you have researched the local area for amenities, attractions and schools, as this will have an impact on the value of your land or property should you build on it.

,
Buy a plot of land in Florida.,
Always use a Title company to purchase, especially their escrow account.,
In order to complete the purchase, you will need to sign a contract that is then countersigned by the seller.,
Once the title deed has been transferred, the purchase is complete.,
If you want to hold onto the land as an investment, there are little maintenance expenses.,
If you decide to build on the plot, as well as the cost of the building project itself, you may incur other costs such as impact fees; a fee that goes towards the local community, funding services such as local schools and fire service.

,
Building a property in Florida can be different from building in the UK, as many homes are made using timber frame.",How to Buy Land in Florida," Will it be for building your dream home? Or do you just want to invest?;
, There are several main regions, which have different cultures, attractions and weather.

, It is recommended to do some thorough research into the plot itself, and the area in which you are buying.

,, From a UK perspective, it is important to understand the differences buying property/land in the US compared to the UK. It is advisable that you seek out legal advice in the UK and Florida before committing to any purchase. It is possible to complete a purchase of land without acting through a solicitor/lawyer, but many people feel more comfortable acting through a lawyer to complete the process. You should at least seek legal advice to go through the contractual paperwork if you are unsure. A seller/broker of land plots should be able to advise you on how to build, and where to find a good contractor for the type of build you require.

, This means any money you pay is secure in a third party account.

, Once this is completed, it will be passed to a Title Agent, who will start the process of transferring the title deed. This can take several weeks to process.

, The Title Agent should send the final title deed to the buyer, and then, providing the balance has been paid, the buyer becomes the legal owner of the land.

, You will have to pay a relatively small land tax each year, as well as paying to maintain the plot; such as keeping grass cut, etc.

,, Also, it is becoming popular in Florida to build modular homes. However, there are still many homes constructed in Florida using more traditional on-site construction methods. Either method will cost around the same; anything from $80,000 - $150,000 all in for a 3/4 bed house, depending on your individual specifications. Although, this cost can be higher for more luxury specifications."

Some specialized legal fields require a certain undergraduate degree. For example, if you want to be a patent lawyer, the United States Trademark and Patent Office requires that you have a degree in an approved technical field. The American Bar Association (ABA) does not recommend any particular undergraduate majors or courses; however, statistics show that prelaw and criminal justice majors are less likely to be accepted to law schools than students who major in fields that require intensive reading and writing.
Prestigious universities have a reputation for being competitive. Not attending a prestigious or expensive university is certainly not a bar to being accepted to law school, but a degree from a competitive university will impress admissions boards and future employers.;
, Several universities in the United States offer 3/3 programs, which allow students to enter law school after only three years of undergraduate study.

, You can build your legal experience early by completing an internship at a law firm or government office during your undergraduate years. This experience will teach you how to think like a lawyer and give you a preview of what to expect after law school.

, The LSAT is offered four times a year, in June, September/October, December, and February. It is offered on Saturdays, but there are special sessions for those who observe a Saturday Sabbath. Register early. You must take the LSAT in September or October at the latest to qualify for fall admissions. If you take the June exam and are disappointed with your score, you will have enough time to take it again before applying for the fall.

, The LSAT may be the most important factor in your law school application, so take it seriously. It tests reading comprehension, analytical reasoning, and logical reasoning. Test prep companies offer tutoring, but you can also study on your own.


A top-notch study program should provide adequate time to study for the exam. For the summer examination, begin studying in January.Your local library or bookstore should have copies of old LSAT exams. Find the most recent to take as practice exams and then move backward through older exams.

, ABA-accredited law schools only accept students who complete the LSAT. The LSAT is designed to evaluate reading comprehension, analytical reasoning, and logical reasoning.Scores are indicative of the likelihood of an applicant's success in law school, and are an important factor in a law school's decision to admit an applicant., Applicants are allowed to take the exam more than once. Schools may choose to accept your higher score, or they may choose to average the two. If you take the LSAT twice but your score does not improve, you should reconsider before taking it a third time.

, CAS is a service offered by the Law School Admission Council, which is the same organization that administers the LSAT. CAS is used by all law schools, and allows you to submit your transcripts, letters of recommendation, and evaluations to multiple schools all at once. The service requires a fee. Register early and make sure to send your transcripts to CAS in a timely manner. You can find more information on registration here.


, Ask your professors if they will write a letter of recommendation for you. You can also ask for recommendations from present and past employers, as well as church or volunteer organizations.

, Law schools require that you write a short statement, typically on a topic of your choosing. The statement is usually only 500 words.


Follow the directions in each school's application materials. If the school wants you to write on a specific topic, write on that topic. If you are given a word limit, stick to the limit.

, An addendum can be a great way to explain something that looks bad in your application. A solid addendum will provide context for any information that might raise “red flags.” For example, an addendum might clarify why one LSAT score is much higher than another, or it might explain why your grades were low one semester. Remember to explain, not make excuses.
A sample addendum might read: ""I am writing to explain why my grades dropped the fall of my junior year. Late that summer, I fell sick with mononucleosis. Although I could have taken the fall semester off, I wanted to graduate in four years for financial reasons. Accordingly, my grades suffered as I fought my illness, but they improved once I physically recovered.""

, Law school tuition can run upwards of $50,000 a year. Recent graduates often carry debt loads totaling over $150,000.Research the average annual salary for new attorneys in your geographic area, as well as the average starting salary for graduates of law schools you are considering.


Many public law schools are less expensive than private schools, but some private schools may have more financial aid available. Carefully calculate the total cost, including average annual living expenses.
If you are interested in attending a public law school in a different state, contact the Admissions office to ask about establishing residency. Residents of a state may qualify for lower tuition than non-residents.
Understand that you will most likely not be able to work a regular job while attending law school full-time. Some programs require students to seek permission from the administration to work during the school year, especially during the first year.

, Every law school in Florida is ABA-accredited, but some law schools in other jurisdictions are not. Florida does not permit graduates of non-ABA-accredited law schools to sit for the bar exam, unless additional requirements are met. Graduates of non-ABA-accredited schools must apply to the Florida Board of Bar Examiners for permission to sit for the bar exam, and must have practiced law for at least ten years in another jurisdiction, be in good standing with that jurisdiction's state bar, and submit a compilation of work product demonstrating the ability to competently practice law.As of 2015, Florida has 12 law schools, with University of Florida Levin College of Law being the top-ranked school in the state according to U.S. News and World Report and StartClass.com.You can also attend an out-of-state law school and still take the Florida bar exam.

, Since the purpose of going to law school is ultimately to work as a lawyer, look at how well schools have prepared their graduates for passing the bar and finding employment.


Pay careful attention to employment numbers. The most relevant statistic is the number of graduates who are working full-time in legal occupations.
Avoid schools with low bar passage rates. Your law degree loses most of its value if you can't pass the bar exam. Having to take the bar exam twice will also lengthen the time it takes to become a lawyer.

, Applying to more than one school increases your chances of being accepted. If you don't get into a school, then you will have to wait another year before sending more applications.


Divide your applications into three pools: safeties, targets, and reaches. A safety is a school where your GPA and LSAT are above the median. A target school will have medians equivalent to your scores, with reaches being those schools where you are well below the reported medians.
Send a few applications to reach schools, but focus most of your attention on targets and safeties.

, Since most law schools do not have a national reputation, they feed their graduates into the local legal economy. You should apply to a law school located in an area where you would be happy to set down roots.

, A J.D. degree generally takes three years (more if you attend part-time) to complete. Your first year will be foundational coursework in bar-tested subjects. You will be able to add electives in your second and third years. Plan in advance what courses you want to take to make sure that you meet all graduation requirements.


After earning your J.D., you may consider applying to an LL.M. (Master of Laws) degree program. This is an advanced law degree in a specialized area, and usually requires an additional year of study., Law school is often stressful and isolating, and a study group is a great way to meet people. Study groups help with exam preparation, sharing notes and outlines, as well as just blowing off some steam.

, Most schools grade on a strict curve, requiring you outperform your peers, rather than merely keep up with them, to get a top grade. Study hard and focus on putting forth your best effort.

, Most jobs are found by word-of-mouth and personal recommendation. Use your law school years to meet as many local attorneys as possible.


Many law schools employ practicing attorneys as adjunct professors. Adjuncts are a great resource for learning more about the local legal market.

, There are many opportunities to gain practical experience during law school. Each can improve your resume with new skills and expand your professional network, and some may lead to job offers upon graduation. Some opportunities include:


Internships and externships. Work for a government office or a private firm in exchange for money (internship) or course credit (externship).Clinics. School-sponsored clinics provide free or low-cost legal aid to the community.Work is performed by law students, under the supervision of law professors. Clinics may be repeatable for course credit.
Judicial clerkships. Work for a judge doing research and writing.Practical courses. Some courses, such as mock trial, mediation, and motion practice, have a large practical participation component.
Competitions. Represent your school in mock trial, moot court, or other competitions.
Clubs and associations. Campus groups are usually organized around a specific community or academic area of interest. Participation in such organizations shows leadership and a strong commitment to a subject or topic.
Law review. Writing for your school's law review journal requires strong writing skills, and gives you the opportunity to publish original work.

, The Multistate Professional Responsibility Examination (MPRE) is required to practice in all but three jurisdictions in the United States. The exam consists of 60 multiple-choice questions that tests the applicant's knowledge of the rules for professional conduct in the practice of law You will take the exam in your third year of law school.


You are allowed to take the MPRE during law school, which allows you to get this requirement out of the way. Then you won't have to worry about it while studying for the bar exam, and your admission to the bar will not be put on hold while you take the MPRE.
Since you have already taken the LSAT, you should know how to prepare for this standardized exam. Gather practice materials, set a schedule, and approach the exam seriously. Give yourself enough time to fully prepare.

, The exam tests whether a candidate is qualified to practice law in the state.It is administered in February and July, and lasts for two days.The first day consists of three hours of essay questions and three hours of multiple-choice, testing knowledge of general law and Florida law. The second day is the Multistate Bar Examination (MBE), a six-hour, 200 multiple-choice question test of general law.Register for a commercial bar preparation course, such as Barbri, Kaplan, Themis, and others.These courses typically supply books, instruction, interactive online content, and individual grading of your writing. Commercial bar prep courses are the norm, and will be strongly recommended by your professors.
Realistically, you will need to study full-time from the time you graduate in early June through the beginning of the test at the end of July. If your school offers additional bar preparation services, take advantage of them in addition to a commercial prep course.
Many bar takers don't pass on the first try. Don't be discouraged; you can try again.Applicants who have been disbarred must wait five years to apply for readmission to the Florida Bar, and must pay an additional application fee of $600. Applicants with a felony conviction must wait until their civil rights are restored before applying to the Florida Bar., Each state bar investigates the moral character and fitness of bar applicants, and will inquire into relevant criminal issues, untreated substance abuse or mental illness, untruthfulness, and financial irresponsibility., If you did not take and pass the MPRE during law school, study and take the test now. A passing score is required for admission to the Florida bar.

, Job opportunities can come from people you meet in law school. Use the network of classmates, professors, and attorneys you met during law school to get recommendations for places to apply.

, Law firms will register to interview students on campus.This typically happens the summer before your third year, but firms can come any time during the year. Even if you don't think you have strong credentials, it doesn't hurt to introduce yourself to potential employers.


Be sure to bring copies of your resume, transcripts, and writing samples, as well as the names of references. Being prepared creates a great first impression.

, Firms of all sizes post job opportunities online with services like Monster, CareerBuilder, LinkedIn, Symplicity, and even Craigslist. Check daily and have a resume and writing sample prepared to send electronically on a moment's notice.


If the job posting requires a cover letter, customize your letter as much as possible instead of sending a form cover letter.

, After taking the bar exam, you should identify attorneys whose practices you would like to learn more about. Draft a letter (not an email) and introduce yourself. Be sure to mention who gave you their name.


In the letter, explicitly state that you are not asking for a job. You will get a better response this way.
Develop a list of questions and take notes. Be engaged.
Ask the attorney if she knows anyone else you can talk to, and be sure to send a thank you note afterwards.

, Bar association membership and individual events may cost money, but these networking opportunities could reap big rewards. Be sure to have a business card available. You can find up-to-date information on events at FloridaBar.org

, In 2015, ValuePenguin.com published its top 100 ""Best Cities for Lawyers,"" evaluating the average salary, availability of jobs, and cost of living in each. Miami placed at #4, followed by Orlando, North Port, West Palm Beach, Tampa, Fort Lauderdale, Tallahassee, Naples, and Jacksonville. Hot practice areas include immigration, international trade, and divorce.

, Even though you are a qualified attorney, you might still need to volunteer in order to keep your skills sharp and to build a resume. Volunteer opportunities may be posted online, but you can also mail a resume or pick up a phone and call.


Working for free can pay off big time. You may be considered for the next opening that becomes available.

, Remember, even if you are having trouble finding a job, you are still a licensed attorney. You can take cases on your own, or collaborate with other attorneys. You may be able to pay your bills with a few traffic ticket clients each month. Before long, you may be ready to open your own practice.

For example, say you move to Florida on January 15, 2017. You can’t claim a homestead exemption for 2017. However, you can claim the exemption for 2018.;
, You can only get the exemption if your home is your permanent residence. There are no set number of days you must be in Florida. However, the following factors show permanent residence:If you file income tax returns, you file them as a Florida resident.
If you vote, you vote in Florida.
If you drive, you have a Florida driver’s license.
If you claim another residency-based exemption in another state, then you aren’t a Florida resident and you can’t claim the homestead exemption in Florida., You can receive a homestead exemption if you have legal or beneficial title in the property and it is your permanent residence. You have beneficial title if the property is owned by a trust but you can use the property. However, you can’t own the property as a corporation.


If you rent part of the property, the benefit applies only to the portion that is owner-occupied., Generally, only U.S. citizens and permanent residents can claim Florida’s homestead exemption. However, non-citizens can claim the exemption if they have children born in the U.S. who live in the home and are dependent on you.You will need to collect birth certificates and other proof that the children use the home as their primary residence.

, You might do something that will cause your county to deny you a homestead exemption. For example, don’t do the following:Avoid renting your home for more than 30 days each year, for two consecutive years.
Don’t get a driver’s license in any other state.
Don’t forget to register your vehicle in Florida if you drive in the state.
Avoid registering to vote anywhere else. You should register to vote only in the county where you are a permanent resident.

, Every home receives a $25,000 exemption. However, you might also receive up to an additional $25,000 depending on how much your home is worth. This additional exemption won’t lower your school taxes, but it will lower other taxes.Consider the following:If your home is worth $50,000 or less, than you don’t receive the additional $25,000. Instead, your exemption is $25,000.
If your home is worth $55,000, you receive an additional $5,000. Your total exemption is $30,000.
If your home is worth $70,000, then you receive an additional $20,000. Your total exemption is worth $45,000.
If your home is worth $75,000 or more, you receive an additional $25,000. Your total exemption is worth $50,000.

, You need to show the appraiser quite a bit of documentation in order to claim the homestead exemption. Accordingly, you should gather this material as soon as possible. Collect the following for each of the property’s owners:Florida driver’s license or, if you don’t drive, a Florida ID card. If you own the property with your spouse, then both of you need to submit ID.
Florida vehicle registration if you own or drive in Florida. Leased vehicles are included.
Florida voter information card or a declaration of domicile which you have recorded with the Clerk of the Court.
If you aren’t a citizen, you should bring your permanent resident card and your declaration of domicile recorded with the Clerk of the Court.
Social Security card or a document (such as an income tax return) that has your number on it. You need to submit your spouse’s card even if they are not a co-owner of the property.
Copy of your deed, tax bill, or Notice of Proposed Property Taxes.Copy of your trust document if the property is held in trust.

, You can apply at this office, or download an application and submit it with documentation to the property appraiser. Look online to find the address and hours of business.


If you are homebound, then contact the office and schedule a visit., Download the application from the county website or stop in and pick up a paper copy. You must provide the following information on the application:name and mailing address
previous address
whether you received tax exemptions for the property
whether you or your spouse received or claimed tax benefits in another county, state, or country
proof of residence for all owners
other information about the property
signatures and date

, You must submit your application by March 1st of the current tax year. For example, if you want to claim the exemption for 2017, you must file by March 1, 2018.


However, you might be able to late file. Contact your Property Appraiser’s Office. In Martin County, for example, you can late file up to 25 days from the date Notices of Proposed Property Taxes are mailed., You can appeal a denial of the homestead exemption by filing a petition with your county’s Value Adjustment Board.However, you should probably first ask for an informal conference with the appraiser. You can file your petition after meeting the meeting.You can get a petition form from the county appraiser or clerk in your county. You may also download the form, which is available at the Florida Department of Revenue’s website. File your petition within 30 days of the date you are mailed the denial notice.
You can have someone help you at the hearing. For example, you can ask a friend or family member. Alternately, you can hire an attorney or a licensed real estate appraiser.
If you lose before the board, you can appeal to a circuit court., The homestead exemption is not transferable. You’ll need to complete a new application when you move. List your new home address.Once you receive your exemption, the assessed value of your homestead cannot increase more than 3% a year or the percentage change of the Consumer Price Index. Although you can’t transfer the homestead exemption, you can transfer this tax savings to a new home., Veterans in Florida may qualify for additional property exemptions or discounts. You can apply for them with the county appraiser. Consider the following:Former servicemembers who were honorably discharged and are partially disabled while serving in wartime may obtain a $5,000 deduction in property assessment value. This deduction can be applied to any property, not only your homestead. In some circumstances, a veteran’s surviving spouse may qualify.
Veterans who were honorably discharged and have a total and permanent disability may qualify for total exemption from taxes on their homestead property. In some situations, a surviving spouse may also qualify.
Veterans 65 or older may qualify for a discount on the assessed value of their property if they are partially or permanently disabled.
Current or former members may also receive an exemption if they were deployed during the previous calendar year outside the U.S. Your deduction will equal the amount of time you were outside the country. This benefit is available to members of the U.S. military, Coast Guard, and the Florida National Guard.

, This exemption is available to those 65 or older who meet certain income requirements. You must apply by March 1st. To qualify, you must meet the following:The property must qualify for a homestead exemption.
One homeowner must be 65 years of age on January 1 for the year you claim the exemption.
Your household’s gross income must not be too high. As of 2017, the limit is $28,841.You’ll need to present proof of income, such as your Social Security Statements and Federal Income Tax Returns.

Walk along Fisherman's Wharf and have some Clam Chowder in a Sourdough Bread Bowl; make your way to the Buena Vista for world-famous Irish Coffee.

,
Eat some Chinese food and browse the shops in Chinatown, or in the ""new"" Chinatown on Clement (pronounced 'clu-MENT')in the Richmond District.

,
Stroll along Chestnut Street in the Marina neighborhood.

,
Take a hike through the beautiful Japanese Gardens at Golden Gate Park, or if you're visiting with kids stop by the Academy of Sciences for a fun museum experience (also located in Golden Gate Park).

,
Ride the cable cars.,
Go to Ocean Beach.",How to Spend Three Days in San Francisco," Was it the history? The impressively colored Victorians? The time of year may have an impact on what you want to see or do, September and October are generally the warmer months in the city, while January and February can be quite rainy.
, It would be impossible to see and do everything in three weeks, let alone three days. Do research on the city and upcoming events at SF Gate. In particular, research the area where you'll be staying, and avoid booking hotels online that are located in the Tenderloin district. Although the Tenderloin is endearing in its own right and the hotels may be cheaper, dealing with the local conditions of the neighborhood may not be worth the trouble.

, A suggested plan is to first visit the Legion of Honor Museum and then take the hike around Land's End. This will bring you up through Seacliff and by Baker's Beach to the Golden Gate Bridge. You could also take a bicycle ride along the waterfront and over the Bridge to Sausalito. Lastly, rent a GoCar/ Bike and take a tour around the Presidio, it's an interesting more park-like part of San Francisco, has some great views, and it's an easy ride to reach the Golden Gate. Note: if you do ride across the bridge you will ride on the East side from Sunrise to 3:30 p.m. Monday to Friday and on the West side from 3:30 p.m. to Sunset and on the Weekends. Also when riding be very alert at the towers as there are blind turns and there can be many riders on the bridge during nice weather.

, Tickets should be booked in advance, but try not to get caught up in the fun at Pier 39; San Francisco has too much to offer for you to spend much time at this well known tourist trap.

, Depending on the season, the San Francisco Giants have games in South of Market quite often. Tickets range in price from $11 to as high as you want to pay to see a ballgame. The 49ers play south of the city and tickets are harder to come by. Similarly, the Oakland A's play a BART ride away in Oakland and the Raiders play at the same stadium.

, The twisting road leads to the top of Twin Peaks - and the 360 degree view from the top is a site you will never forget.

, With an impressive permanent collection (including works by Rene Magritte, Frida Kahlo and Andy Warhol) and frequent exhibits, SFMOMA is one of the most impressive art museums on the US West Coast.

, Have a stroll down Haight Street admiring both all of the eccentric shops and even more eccentric panhandlers. Have a pint of a local microbrew at Magnolia. Continue west to Haight Street until you've reached the edge of Golden Gate Park.

,, There are plenty of Mexican restaurants in the Mission district.

,,,,, Either pay cash on board or, if there are others in your group, let them buy tickets while you wait in line. If you are offered transfers, take them. They are good for 2-3 hours and can be used to go any direction after you get off.

, Here you can see the Sutro Bathes remains and eat at the famous Cliff House. Take a walk down the beach, watch some surfers, or enjoy the view.

Get a Florida driver's license.,
Register your out-of-state car.,
Register to vote.,
If you live in two different states, file a Declaration of Domicile.,
File for a homestead exemption.,
Accept employment.,
If applicable, enroll your child in a Florida school.,
File federal taxes after becoming a Florida resident.,
Transfer all accounts to Florida institutions.,
Notify the parties necessary of your address change.,
Renew any licensure for the state of Florida.,
Get involved in your community.",How to Become a Florida Resident," The sooner you get a Florida driver's license (or Non-Driver ID) the better. If you already have a license from another state, you will not have to take the written or driving tests to get a Florida license. For the record, you have 30 days after filing the Declaration of Domicile to get a Florida driver's license (you may get a Florida license with or without this declaration, which we’ll discuss in the second section). To get your license:


Bring your out-of-state license to your local Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles (county tax collector). Take an identify document with you too, such as the original or certified copy of your birth certificate. It's also okay to bring a US Passport, or a Certificate of Naturalization.
Provide proof of your Social Security number. This could be your Social Security card, a W-2 or pay stub.
Offer two documents that prove your Florida address. A mortgage deed, Florida car registration or recent utility bills are the most commonly accepted, but anything with your new address should suffice.
If you don’t intend to drive, you need to get a Non-Driver ID card. This is the same exact process as getting a Driver’s License (without any tests, of course).;
, Transfer your car title and get registration for your car ‘’in Florida’’. You have 10 days after establishing Florida residency status to complete this task.Get car insurance in Florida. Submit proof of your policy to the county tax collector.
Show the original title to the county tax collector.
Bring the car you want to register to your county tax collector's office, so they can check out the VIN.
Pay the fees. It costs around $400 to title and register your car for the first time in Florida. You will also have to pay the typical registration fees, which vary depending the age, type, and weight of your vehicle.

, It is convenient to do this while getting your Florida driver's license – often at the DMV (county tax collector) they will attach a voter registration form along with your new address forms. However, you can also register with the Supervisor of Election. You must wait until the voter registration books open, as they close 30 days prior to an election and reopen after an election.


This is a simple form that takes about 5 minutes to fill out. After you hand it in, your work is done. It's as simple as that!

, Just having a home in Florida technically isn’t enough. Because plenty of “snowbirds” go to Florida just for the winter, a Declaration of Domicile confirms that it is your primary residence. Your signature on this document, once approved, confirms that you now reside in Florida, and that the state is your permanent residence. This is done through the clerk of the circuit court.


To get this declaration approved, you need two things: physical presence in Florida and intent. The former is pretty self-explanatory. As for the latter, “intent” can be shown through employment, having a doctor, being registered to vote, being involved in the community – the list goes on and on, and we'll discuss many aspects below.
Having this means that all your taxes now go to the state of Florida and nowhere else (starting with the next full calendar year, of course). Because Florida has no income, death, or estate tax, this may be a wise move.If you only have one residence, a declaration of domicile isn't necessary, though it is wise (for tax benefits).

, Florida’s Homestead Law protects any Florida resident from losing his or her home to a creditor or any other lien holder, with the exception of mortgages. Should you have to declare bankruptcy, having a homestead exemption can let you breathe a sigh of relief. You can file this once you have a Declaration of Domicile to your name.


It also affects your taxes (for the better). The Florida “Save Our Home” Act says that once qualified for the homestead exemption, the assessed value of your property for tax purposes carries an exemption for the first $50,000 of taxable value for all taxing entities except the school district (which allows a $25,000 exemption). In addition, once qualified, the assessed value for tax purposes cannot rise more than 3% in any given year. That means equity you won’t have to pay on., One of the clearest methods of making it hard to argue legally that you are a resident of any other state is to accept employment in Florida. With wages coming from Florida and a residence in Florida, no one will question you otherwise!


If you are looking to provide intent between two states, this is a good way to do it. Having employment in Florida will add weight to your case should your Declaration of Domicile be in question.

, Another way of showing intent and moving toward veritable Florida residency is to enroll your child in a Florida school, public or private.Child here meaning under the age of 18, of course. With a child in the Florida school system, this too adds weight to your Declaration of Domicile case.

, You will send your tax returns to the Atlanta, Georgia location of the Internal Revenue Service Center when you move to Florida. When you file your final tax return for your previous state, write ""final return"" on it, and use your current address so it is clear that you have moved.


If you live in two states in the same year, look into filing part-year returns. States combine differently (each state has different regulations), so look into your specific situation before assuming anything. , If you belonged to any banks, clubs or churches in your previous state, find a Florida location to join. Doing so will show that you are committed to being a resident of Florida, rather than another state. Here are some ideas:


Bank
Church
Gym
Community groups, organizations, or affiliations
Insurance-approved medical group

, Whether it’s your magazine subscriptions, distant relatives, or your dessert-of-the-month club, notify the parties necessary that your new address is now in Florida. Start by filing an address change with the Postal Service and then contact organizations individually.


This can show intent in your Declaration of Domicile, too. Should any tax issues arise, this will certainly help your case.

, If you have any licenses or certification that are good state-by-state, make sure you get reassessed in Florida so your licensure is valid and you can still practice. Whether you’re a nurse, a lawyer, or a real estate agent, this is necessary not only for your workflow, but also to show that Florida is where you intend to stay.


If there is any doubt, it's always best to check out your situation. What's more, you may run into new rules and regulations you didn't know if in your research.

, To further prove that you are a Florida resident, start getting involved. Vote, join a gym, be a part of your neighborhood association, find a doctor and a dentist, and establish your roots. The more engrained you are, the more you’ll truly be a resident of Florida.


It wouldn’t hurt to get an annual pass for Disney World, either!

Plan your visit.,

Take a moment to look at the unique architecture of the museum building.,

Go through the storefront glass doors at the entrance, and you will see restored vintage aircraft hanging from the building's structural steel overhead.,
Continue into the lobby of the museum, and you will be greeted by one of the hosts who volunteer their time and energy to greeting and helping visitors to the museum.,
Note that the museum charges no admission to visitors who simply want to tour the main display floors and visit exhibits.,

Walk around the front display area, and you will see large, scale models of various flat-tops from the history of the U.S. Navy.,

,

Look to your right, if you choose a path along the right wall of the South Wing, and you will see the entrance to the Cubi Bar and Grill, which was dismantled at Subic Bay Naval Base, Philippines, and reassembled completely here in the museum.,

Visit the tribute display to the late comedian, Bob Hope, honoring his many Christmas visits to cheer up troops deployed overseas during the holidays.,

Continue forward, across the south wing, and you will find the Modern Aircraft display, and the Top Gun Simulator, a real pilot training simulator used to familiarize Naval Aviators with the cockpit of an F-14 Tomcat aircraft.,

Continue through the south wing, and you will travel into the Blue Angels Atrium, where you will see a complete formation of A-4 Skyhawk aircraft flown by the Blue Angels in years gone by.,

Travel to your left, again, if you are exiting the Blue Angels Atrium, and you will find the flight deck, removed from the USS Cabot and reassembled on the museum floor as an exhibit.,

Look beyond the USS Cabot flight deck and you will see the Korean War display to your left, and to your right you will see the Museum Library, named in honor of a museum benefactor, Emil Buehler.,

View the outside museum exhibits by going out the doors located at the left side of the Blue Angels Atrium.,
Consider making a contribution to the museum foundation, as donations are the sole source of funding for maintaining, expanding, and operating the museum.",How to Visit the National Museum of Naval Aviation," For local residents, this will be a simple step, since the Museum is easily located and can be visited and toured in a few hours, but out of town travelers will find the following information helpful:




 The Blue Angels in formation in the sky behind the museum.

Plan your visit during the months of March through November to coincide with the Blue Angels practice schedule, and from the rear of the museum you will have the opportunity to watch these skilled aviators push F-18 Hornets to their limits as they exhibit precision flying at its finest. You can check the Blue Angels practice schedule online at BlueAngels.com for specific times and dates, but typically, practices are held on Tuesday and Wednesday mornings from 8:30-9:30 AM.
If entering the Greater Pensacola Area from Interstate 10, the main traffic corridor through the area, you will want to exit at Pine Forest Road, and travel south to Blue Angel Parkway. Take a left, and continue travelling south until you reach the West Gate to board NAS Pensacola. Once on board the Navy base, continue driving until you see the large, white building on your left with the F-14 Tomcat fighter jet mounted on a steel pylon in its front. You will see signs indicating the entrance to parking lot, and the front entrance of the museum itself.




 The large sign in the front of the museum is hard to miss.

For travelers arriving at the airport, you will need to either rent a car, or take the ECAT (Escambia County Area Transit) bus system to NAS. Bus schedules and routes are available at the courtesy/information desks located in the terminal building at the Pensacola Airport. The route from the airport grounds to NAS is to travel west on Airport Blvd. to 9th Ave., then south to Fairfield Dr. Turn right, then continue on Fairfield to Blue Angel Parkway, take a left turn, and follow the directions in the bullet point above.;
, When you arrive, and as you walk to the entrance, view the static display of the Tomcat, with the bronze statues of Navy personnel who appear to be preparing the aircraft for flight. You will also see a large anchor to the left of the front door, which will give a novice an idea of the size of the Navy ships which serve as floating airfields for the aviators who launch and land their aircraft at sea., Hanging completely restored and intact aircraft from special beams in the building's ceiling allows the museum to accommodate almost 150 aircraft in a relatively small space., They will offer you a museum guide, which is a helpful pamphlet with interesting information and photos detailing the many exhibits of the museum., There is a ticket office inside for those who want to attend the IMAX theater or ride the Flight Simulator ride, which is similar to rides at theme parks. There is also a schedule of movies playing in the IMAX theater, and their viewing times.

, These Aircraft Carriers have sailed and served in wars beginning during World War II, up through conflicts occurring around the world today. Many of these models are twelve feet long, or longer, and are detailed exactly to represent the ship they represent, including the aircraft you would have seen if you were looking at the ship during its actual service.,,, The original bar top, with its many carved messages from sailors who visited it at Subic Bay, along with patches and decals from their squadrons is there awaiting visitors who want to take a break, and have a cold beer or a burger in this historic atmosphere., In front of this display you will see the World War I recreation of a sandbagged observation post, complete with a propeller driven aircraft, a machine gun nest, and other artifacts from this time period., Try your hand at piloting the simulator, even attempting a carrier landing, one of the most difficult aviation maneuvers there is, where a supersonic warplane is landed on a moving deck scantly wider than a football field, and less than a quarter mile long., Here, you will find seating and a stage used for military functions such as change of command ceremonies, medal awards, and museum fundraising activities hosted by the museum foundation, which is the source of operations and construction of the facility you are visiting., Along the rails of this walkway you will see signage describing the aircraft immediately in front of you with historical information to help you learn more about the exhibit you are viewing., The actual wood planks that were in place of the aircraft carrier are now tread upon by tens of thousands of visitors each year., This library contains manuscripts dating from 1910 until the present, and is open to researchers and scholars who have interests in Naval Aviation and other historical information about the United States Navy. Materials in the library are not circulated, but facilities are provided for visitors to read and view them within the library itself. Appointments are recommended if you expect to require the assistance of library staff to meet your research needs., Outside you will see the many aircraft which are not housed inside the museum building itself, along with others that are awaiting restoration by the museum's staff of dedicated workers., You can also purchase souvenirs at the Flight Deck store, located behind the IMAX theater."

Pick the right neighborhood.,
Live with roommates.,
Exchange your car for a bike.,
Take advantage of free fun.,
Consider living outside of the city.",How to Live in San Francisco on a Budget," There is a very wide range of average rents across San Francisco neighborhoods. You will want to avoid most of the neighborhoods in the north to northeast section of the city: the Financial District, Russian Hill, Pacific Heights, the Marina, North Beach, and so on. Your best bet are neighborhoods like Outer Sunset and Outer/Inner Richmond, Lakeshore, and Outer Mission/Excelsior. These are the only neighborhoods with average rents of less than $2000 for a 1-bedroom apartment.Of course, these neighborhoods require a commute to downtown.;
, Living by oneself in San Francisco is a very expensive proposition. The average price of a 1-bedroom apartment is $2800.If you spend 33% of your income on rent, as most finance experts recommend, this would mean you need to be earning at least $100,000 per year to afford this rent. Splitting an apartment with roommates, however, quickly reduces the amount you will have to pay.

, More than 28% of San Francisco households do not own a car, the 14th highest percentage in the nation.You will save several hundred dollars per month by eliminating your car payment each month--money which can be devoted to your rent, if need be. San Francisco has excellent public transportation, thanks to BART and Muni, and the city boasts the second-highest bike score in the country.Additionally, the city has a number of services like Zipcar and City CarShare that allow residents to have a car when they need one. In recent years, on-demand transportation services such as Uber, Lyft, and Sidecar have grown significantly in San Francisco, offering yet another viable option to car ownership.

, San Francisco is loaded with fun activities that won't drain your bank account, from Fleet Week to Hardly Strictly Bluegrass to Anchor Brewing Company tours to the Randall Museum simply hanging with friends in one of the cities many public parks. It seems that every weekend offers some kind of free--or at least affordable--event, if not a wide range of them. Pick up one of the local (free) weeklies to see what events are coming up soon.

, Although the entire Bay Area is expensive compared to the rest of the country, you can save a lot of money by living outside of the city itself. If you work in San Francisco, this could add significantly to your daily commute, but transit systems like BART, CalTrain, and ferries make it possible to live in the East, South, or North Bay without spending a lot of time in traffic. Within a 50-mile radius of the city, rents drop by up to two-thirds."

Thoroughly research exactly where in Florida you wish to live.,
Prepare for the weather.,
Check potential homes for Chinese drywall and mold or mildew.,
Start thinking about hurricane safety for your new house.,
Take precautionary measures for your skin.,
Learn to speak Spanish.,
Be patient on the road.,
Become a resident.,
Enjoy all that Florida has to offer.",How to Move to Florida," Aside from basic necessities (area schools, jobs, hospitals, etc.), Florida is a huge state and is equally diverse. If you don't have your mind set on a specific city, then it helps to understand that there are five distinct regions of the state, one of which might be more attractive to you than the others. These regions are:


The Florida Panhandle: This is home to the state capital of Tallahassee and is known for its beautiful Gulf Coast beaches. Since Tallahassee is only 30 miles (48 km) from the Georgia border, it is known for its Southern charm and friendly people.
Northern Florida: This is home to the major cities of Gainesville and Jacksonville. It is known for its culturally Southern atmosphere and historic landmarks.
Central Florida: This is home to Disney World, SeaWorld and the Kennedy Space Center. Aside from the major tourist attractions, there are dozens of quaint small towns dotted with lakes in the region worth considering.
Southern Florida: This is the largest metropolitan area of the state and is home to the Everglades, Miami, West Palm Beach, and Key West.
Southwest Florida: This is home to Tampa, St. Petersburg, Naples, Sarasota and Ft. Myers. It is known for its museums, arts and theater, as well as its beautiful beaches.;
, If you're moving from anywhere outside the Southeast, then say goodbye to snowstorms and cold spells; be ready to experience long days of hot, humid, muggy conditions throughout the summer. Cities along the coast are blessed with a slightly cooling ocean breeze, but inland communities (especially in Central Florida) often face stifling, stagnant heat. Summer storms, brief and often heavy, occur with such regularity you can almost set your watch to them. The rest of the year is typically dry and mild in most of the state, with the occasional cold spell during the winter., Homes that have been sitting vacant for months, possibly years without electricity (such as foreclosures), are especially vulnerable to these issues.Unless you've added the repair bills to your budget, try to avoid buying houses with these problems., Apartments and condominiums will usually take care of this for you, but you are on your own in a house. Begin by buying new or having existing hurricane shutters inspected, reinforce your roof and install hurricane glass. Get used to regularly stocking and re-stocking such supplies as non-perishable food, water (change every few months), battery radios, etc. Find out if your home is in a flood zone as soon as possible, preferably before settling the house., If your skin is very sensitive to the sun, you'll need to take extra care of it using lotions, creams, or other products as the Florida sun is very strong. The humidity also makes Florida very comfortable for mosquitoes, so if you're sensitive to bug bites, find and use a suitable spray or lotion that will keep them away., This is especially important if you plan to move to South Florida, with its population of Latino residents and influence of Latin American culture increasing. You'll feel more at home being able to use Spanish as well as English––there will be plenty of opportunities to learn Spanish when you're living there., With a high volume of tourists and senior citizens on the road, it can be easy to get frustrated behind the wheel, confronted by slow drivers or motorists who appear to be lost. Stay calm, follow the signs and learn to be content with it. Florida is a big state with plenty to see, and because of its flat geographical makeup, it's a great place to explore by car., Taking care of the legal incidentals of moving is a crucial step. See the State of Florida portal for more information on residency (http://www.stateofflorida.com/Portal/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabid=38). In particular, focus on your driver's license, insurance coverage, change of address, business needs if you run a business, etc., Great beaches, fascinating wildlife, big cities, tight-knit towns, excellent food and beautiful weather are just a few of the things to be experienced in Florida.

Spend a day at the beach. Florida has one of the longest contiguous coastlines of any state, with plenty to offer from sunbathing on the warm white sands to an array of water sports.
Check out the Kennedy Space Center. About an hour from Orlando, the complex features a sprawling visitor center, rocket launch pad tours, and exotic wildlife viewing opportunities.
Have fun at the theme parks of Central Florida. A little online research will reveal there's much more to experience than just Disney World!
Take an air-boat ride through the Everglades. An unforgettable day trip, make sure to pick a day with comfortable weather (it can get very humid on the marshes).
Visit the Florida Keys. Key West is the most famous of these many beautiful islands, and you can pose for a picture at the marker that states you're a mere 90 miles (140 km) to Cuba.

Purchase and print out the park tickets online before you get to the park or try to get there early before it opens, and get the tickets and enter the park.


To get there, if you live near or by the San Diego end of Interstate 8, all you have to do is to bear left towards Mission Bay, not bear right to enter Interstate 8. SeaWorld San Diego is located in Mission Bay. So, all you have to do is to find the exit of Interstate 8 to enter the park's parking lot. If you live in Downtown San Diego, go on Interstate 5 north, and take Exit 21: SeaWorld Drive.;
, The Skytower ride will cost $3.00 but the price is well worth it in the end for the spectacular views you'll get. The SkyTower is also a slow scenic ride revolving around a very tall pedestal, where you will slowly soar up into the air to see the whole aerial view of SeaWorld San Diego and the city of San Diego, Airport and San Diego's Coronado Bay Bridge.

, If you don't mind roller coasters, this is one of the ultimate roller coasters within the SeaWorld system.

, Try to get there before 12:00 PM as this is a very popular ride. It is going to be scary as this log flume ride has some dark spots as well as the super-long drop at the end and some thrill tracks. No advanced thrill tracks like loops, but the tracks that make you turn sideways. And there is also an ride-elevator that will take your flume from one drop to the next.

, While some are harder to play than others, there are some that are fun.Try to play all or most of them.

, Make sure you ride it before you go to Journey to Atlantis ride, to ensure you aren't completely soaked by the time you walk onto Journey to Atlantis later(which will drench you even more). The Shipwreck Rapids is a ride that you can get very wet and soaked, so make sure you bring ponchos (the only way to keep you less wet). You will ride in a raft, and go on to a rapid ride and see waterfalls, sunken or ships, and go through a waterfall, which makes your hair all soaked and wet. And this is a starter's ride before you even go the scary Journey to Atlantis ride.



Do not ride Shipwreck Rapids if you do not want to get very wet and soaked. Ride it with this reminder, if you'd like to try it out.

, Although Journey to Atlantis is bigger and wetter, most people flock here when wanting a watery thrill. However, Do not ride Journey to Atlantis is you are scared of drops, and falling, as it is a extreme log flume ride.

, The main thing at SeaWorld is shows. Shamu's shows feature SeaWorld's icon: a killer whale. Be sure to watch a showing of One Ocean over at the Shamu tank, as well as a showing of Dolphin Days at the dolphin tank(Dolphin Stadium), the Sea Lion's Live featurette at the Sea Lion and Otter Stadium or the Pets Rule show at Pet's Stadium. But be careful at Shamu Stadium as sitting in the Soak Zone will get you not humorously soaked - but soppily drenched (as if you had come out of the shower, but they do give you some warning with their ""Soak Zone"" signs). If you don't want to get soaked, then don't go near or sit any of the bleachers that have the words ""Soak Zone"" near them, or you can risk getting yourself soaking wet.


There is also an underground ""Soak Zone""-free area that you can get an up-close look at Shamu(and a small portion of the rest of the Shamu Show), if you are near Shamu Stadium, but this area is rather quaint and can't house very many people at once without a loss of quality of seeing these creatures
Pick which shows you are interested in, and make reservations to go to there. And also, before any show that you are interested in, make sure you see dolphins, and bat rays. You can touch the bat rays but make sure to wash your hands after interacting with or touching them.
The wet twist at One Ocean (Shamu show) will not happen in cold weather because it would be not very fun for those visitors who have flocked there.

, Besides a penguin habitat and a shark habitat you can see through glass, there are plenty of experiences you can take to see some of SeaWorld's animals.

, You can see polar bears, and some other exotic creatures on this ride.

,,, There are some areas with flamingoes, bat rays and a wealth of other creatures.

, It is the home of 3 rides: Oscar's Rocking Eel, Elmo's Flying Fish, and Abby's Sea Star Spin, along with several other climbing areas, twisting slides, tunnel crawls and play spaces for even smaller children.

, These are both buffet styled events, and therefore will tend to be busy, so be sure to get there rather early or when these animals are not planning to be participating in their shows. The shows are training sessions for these animals, so don't expect large waves while you eat.

, There are many other restaurants that you shouldn't need table reservations for, but for an example, if you want to eat close to the Shipwreck Rapids ride, eat at Shipwreck Reef Cafe.

Get a good car.,
Make a comfortable ""bed."",
Keep eating healthy.,
Make sure to shower!,
Find parking.,
Try to make money.,
Know where the bathrooms are.,
Take steps to better your life.,
Dress Well.,
Get a Mailbox.,
Don't Tell people you are Homeless.,
Make Friends.",How to Live in Your Car in Santa Monica," It's best to have a large vehicle like a van or an RV. But if you are forced to live in a small car, you can make it work. Make sure to buy a car cover so no one can see you sleeping in your car at night.;
, Get a sleeping bag and recline the passenger seat. If your passenger seat goes all the way back, this is actually a pretty comfortable way to sleep.

, The McDonald's Dollar Menu is great, but you can't eat burgers forever. There are several other options. The homeless shelter (O.P.C.C) on Olympic serves meals regularly. Another option is to just buy a loaf of bread and a can of beans from Ralph's on Broadway and Lincoln. Packages of uncooked hot dogs will provide a lot of food. Make sure you are eating both carbs and protein, and take vitamins if you can.

, The O.P.C.C shelter has showers. If you sign up for classes at the Santa Monica College, you can take their shuttle bus across town and use the showers in their locker rooms. This is much easier and more private.

, It's very difficult to find a place to park in Santa Monica, and if you park in the wrong place you will get a $60 ticket within 5 minutes. The parking regulations are very strictly enforced. However, there are certain spots you should be able to park overnight and not have a problem. 10th and Arizona, as well as 11th and Arizona, are good spots. Venice can work since there are a lot of other car-dwellers there, but it is a very dangerous place. The best thing to do is just drive around until you find a place that works, and if you see a tow truck parked nearby the next morning, leave!

, Many people perform on 3rd Street Promenade, which can be a lot of fun and a great way to support yourself. If you have any talent at all or can even do something out of the ordinary (or you just have a funny outfit) you're sure to at least make a few dollars every time you go out. The license to perform is $35 and can be purchased from City Hall.

, The Promenade has several public bathrooms, but you will have to go searching for them or ask one of the locals - they are pretty hard to find.

, If you can afford classes, this is a great way to invest in your future and add a sense of purpose to your life. With no structure, every day begins to look the same, and you start to wonder why you're even here on this earth. Another idea is to spend time in the Library, reading books, watching movies, and getting out of the sun for a few hours.

, How you look plays a big role in how others treat you. If you can bathe and pay for laundry, most people probably won't be able to tell you are homeless. If you keep your hair short and clean, people will assume you are well-off. On the other hand, if you grow it out, people will assume that you can't afford a haircut and other homeless people will start messing with you. It is possible to be homeless without anyone knowing, and to keep applying to jobs or pursuing your dreams.

, There are several places to rent mailboxes in Santa Monica. It is best to get one that doesn't say P.O. box in front of it. For instance, if your address is 7th Street., Santa Monica, #28, people will assume that #28 means Apartment #28 instead of a mailbox number. Many companies require your home address(insurance, bank, etc.) and this will pass.

, This is just a good policy to keep. If people know you are homeless, is is easier for them to look down on you, take advantage of your weakness, or pity you - none of which you want. When people ask where you live, say the street name where you park or where you have your mailbox. If you are walking with someone, say goodbye to them before you get to the street where your car is parked. If anyone wants to come see your place, tell them it's messy right now (It probably is!). Don't lie, but you don't have to tell everything to everyone.

, Having a support network is important, especially in such a demoralizing situation. Some of the other homeless people are downright crazy and should be avoided, but other ones are completely normal, articulate, and intelligent. You just have to talk to them to find out which is which.

AC Transit TransBay service schedule or map, is relevant for residents of the northern half of the East Bay, including Berkeley, Oakland, and Emeryville.AmTrak Capitol Corridor serves the southern half of the East Bay.",How to Ride BART from the East Bay to San Francisco," Some areas in the East Bay offer free shuttle service to BART stations.;
, The time taken from Embarcadero (the first downtown station if arriving from the East Bay) to Civic Center/UN Plaza (the last downtown station) on BART is 7 minutes. The list below provides guidance on the frequency of service from important BART stations (on working weekdays), as well as the time taken to get from there to Embarcadero via BART.:



West Oakland Station: All BART trains to San Francisco pass through this station. During working hours, service frequency through this station is 16 times an hour, or once every 3 minutes and 45 seconds. The time taken from here to Embarcadero is 7 minutes, much of it spent in the TransBay Tube. During the morning and evening rush hour (around 7 to 8 AM and 5 to 6 PM) the frequency goes as high as 24 trains an hour, or one train every 2.5 minutes.

12th Street/Oakland City Center, 19th Street Oakland, and MacArthur stations: BART trains from the Richmond line (that goes through Berkeley) and the Pittsburg/Bay Point line all pass through these stations. With the exception of reduced late night and weekend service, service frequency in the direction of San Francisco through these stations is 8 times an hour, or once every 7.5 minutes. During the morning and evening rush hour, frequency can be as high as 16 times an hour, or once every 3 minutes and 45 seconds. The time taken to Embarcadero from these stations is 10 minutes, 13 minutes, and 17 minutes respectively.

Stations on the Richmond line (Ashby, downtown Berkeley, North Berkeley, El Cerrito Plaza, El Cerrito Del Norte, and Richmond): The time taken to Embarcadero depends on the starting station, ranging from 20 minutes (if you start at Ashby) to 35 minutes (if you start at Richmond). Frequency of direct service is once every 15 minutes. However, if you include service with scheduled transfer (take the Fremont or Warm Springs line and transfer at MacArthur) the frequency is once every 7.5 minutes. The service with scheduled transfer takes 1-2 minutes longer than the regular service.

Stations on the Pittsburg/Bay Point Line: The time taken to Embarcadero depends on the starting station, ranging from 21 minutes (if you start at Rockridge) to 55 minutes (if you start at the Pittsburg/Bay Point end of line). Outside of rush hours in the morning and evening, frequency is once every 15 minutes. There is additional morning and evening rush hour service for parts on this line. In particular, stations Pleasant Hill onward see a peak frequency of once every 5 minutes during the morning and evening rush hour.

Lake Merritt, Fruitvale, Coliseum, and Bay Fair stations: These stations, southeast of the West Oakland station, are served by BART trains from Fremont or Warm Springs as well as Dublin/Pleasanton. Frequency is once every 7.5 minutes. Time taken to Embarcadero ranges from 12 minutes (Lake Merritt) to 27 minutes (Bay Fair).

Castro Valley, West Dublin/Pleasanton, and Dublin/Pleasanton Stations: These stations are served only by the Dublin/Pleasanton-Daly City line. Frequency is once every 15 minutes. Time taken to Embarcadero ranges from 31 minutes (Castro Valley) to 44 minutes (Dublin/Pleasanton end of line).

Hayward, South Hayward, Union City, Fremont, and Warm Springs Stations: These stations are served by the Warm Springs-Daly City line. Frequency is once every 15 minutes. Time taken to Embarcadero ranges from 32 minutes (Hayward) to 46 minutes (Fremont) and 52 minutes (Warm Springs). On Saturdays, the line is truncated to a Fremont-Daly City line, and does not go all the way to Warm Springs.

, Check our tips on riding BART and our guide on avoiding crowds in mass transit, or just try riding a few times to experience for yourself! Crowdedness varies heavily by time of day, line, and even by cars within the same train. Some general tips on crowdedness are included below; note that the details can change over time as ridership patterns change.



Pittsburg/Bay Point -> San Francisco International Airport line: This line generally runs ten-car trains during the day, using shorter trains only very early in the morning or late at night.

This line is the most crowded of the lines during the morning rush hour, because it combines all traffic from stations exclusively serving the Pittsburg/Bay Point line, plus some people who transfer to this line from the Richmond-Fremont or Richmond-Warm Springs line at MacArthur. That being said, it reaches that level of crowding only from MacArthur onward, so if you are getting on at a station before MacArthur, this may not be an issue.
On the other hand, during non-rush-hours, this line is one of the least crowded since it generally runs full ten-car trains (the maximum permissible length) whereas other lines run shorter trains outside of rush hour.
A good rule of thumb is that this is a good line to be on if you are boarding after 10 AM, but bad to be on during rush hour.



Richmond -> Millbrae line: This line runs 8-10-car trains during rush hours but shorter trains at other times of the day.

If you are boarding at a station exclusively serving the Richmond line (Ashby or further north), this is the superior option during rush hour. An inferior option is to take the Richmond -> Warm Springs line and transfer at MacArthur to the Airport line. But as noted, the latter line gets crowded at MacArthur because of the large number of people transferring.
The line is also the superior option during the morning rush hour if boarding at the 12th Street, 19th Street, or MacArthur stations.
After 10 AM, the distinction between this line and (taking or transferring to) the Airport becomes more of a tossup.


Warm Springs -> Daly City line

Dublin/Pleasanton -> Daly City line: If boarding at West Oakland, this line is the least crowded during rush hour.

Additional morning rush hour lines: There are additional morning rush hour lines that are truncated versions of the Pittsburg/Bay-Point-San Francisco International Airport line. These additional lines have various combinations of starting and ending stations. The East Bay stations other than Pittsburg/Bay Point are North Concord (the penultimate station on the line) and Pleasant Hill/Contra Costa County (separated from North Concord by Concord Station). The two possible ending stations on the other side, other than San Francisco International Airport are Montgomery and Daly City. While returning, the trains from Montgomery to Pleasant Hill run express between MacArthur and Pleasant Hill. The additional service runs roughly between 6 AM and 9 AM, reaching peak frequency between 7 AM and 8 AM, when the combined frequency reaches 5 minutes.

Additional evening rush hour lines: There are additional evening rush hour lines that are truncated versions of the Pittsburg/Bay-Point-San Francisco International Airport line. These additional lines have various combinations of starting and ending stations. The East Bay end stations other than Pittsburg/Bay Point are North Concord (the penultimate station on the line) and Pleasant Hill/Contra Costa County (separated from North Concord by Concord Station). The two possible ending stations on the other side, other than San Francisco International Airport are 24th Street/Mission and Daly City. The additional service runs from approximately 3:30 to 6:30 PM, reaching a peak combined frequency of once every 5 minutes between 5 PM and 6 PM.

, You have a few options:


Leave your bike in bike parking or bike racks at or near the station near your residence. Budget an extra minute for securing and retrieving your bike.
Carry the bike on the train with you. This option may not be available if you intend to commute during rush hour.
If you depart at MacArthur station, you may also be able to avail of the bike shuttle that carries bikes between MacArthur and downtown San Francisco.

, The last departures happen around midnight and the last arrivals happen between 1 AM and 1:30 AM. BART reopens at 4 AM on weekdays, 6 AM on Saturday, and 8 AM on Sunday. If traveling late at night (or early in the morning on weekends), you will need to use alternate transit options.

Reduced service on weekdays in the evening: The Daly City-Fremont line's last departure in the evening is at 6:58 PM from Daly City (7:15 PM from Embarcadero). The Millbrae-Richmond line's last departure in the evening is at 9:01 PM from Millbrae (9:33 PM from Embarcadero). Beyond these times, there is no direct service to Fremont and Richmond respectively: Fremont passengers need to transfer from the Dublin-Pleasanton line at Bay Fair whereas Richmond passengers need to transfer from the Pittsburg-Bay Point line at MacArthur. Effectively, the service frequency halves on the Richmond and Fremont lines due to the trains being stopped. Service frequency on the other two lines also reduces from 15 minutes to 20 minutes. Keep this in mind if you expect to frequently be commuting back home late at night.

Reduced Saturday service: On Saturdays, the frequency for each line is about 20 minutes instead of 15 minutes, so the effective service frequency at each station goes up in the same proportion (5 minutes instead of 3.75 minutes at West Oakland, 10 minutes instead of 7.5 minutes at the stations that share two lines, and 20 minutes at the stations that are on a single line, though 10 minutes effectively at Richmond due to the timed transfer).

Reduced Sunday service: On Sunday, the Fremont-Daly City and Richmond-Millbrae lines don't run at all. So there are only two lines connecting San Francisco with the East Bay, each running at a frequency of 20 minutes. The effective frequency at West Oakland station is 10 minutes and that at all other stations is 20 minutes.

Additional weekend closures for maintenance (as part of the Better BART Program): BART is working on replacing and improving its aging trackway. The trackway and signaling system upgrades require weekend closures on some parts of the line. These closures are generally announced more than a week in advance and you'll hear about them at any BART station while waiting for your train. You can also sign up for email alerts.During the time service is closed, the closure is also listed under service advisories., Not all BART stations have parking, but those that do offer convenient options for day-long parking. In the East Bay, the only stations that don't have parking are the downtown Berkeley station and the two downtown Oakland stations (12th Street/Oakland City Center and 19th Street). Also keep in mind that parking at some stations can fill up as early as 6:30 AM. You can also check other services to learn of availability of street parking near BART stations., HVD tickets allow you to get $48 of value for $45, or $64 of value for $60, i.e., a 6.25% discount.There are no unlimited monthly or daily passes, and HVDs are your best option as a regular commuter between the East Bay and San Francisco.
For your monthly expenses, use the BART fare calculatorto compute the cost of a one-way trip from the starting to ending station. Multiply by two to get your daily cost. Then multiply by the number of days you intend to commute in a month to get a monthly cost estimate. If using HVD, apply the 6.25% discount to your estimate.
Remember to add in costs for bike lockers, parking, or transit to the station if using the respective options.
Costs can range quite significantly. Commuting from West Oakland to Embarcadero costs $3.20 one-way, or $6.40 daily, which translates to about $125-150 monthly. Commuting from Pittsburg/Bay Point to 24th Street/Mission costs $6.65 one-way, or $13.30 daily, which translates to about $260-330 monthly.BART offers discounts (to the tune of about 60%) for youth, senior citizens, and RTC Clipper Cards. Also, children aged 4 or less can ride BART for free. Make sure you investigate and avail of discount options available to you.
Check if your employer offers commuter tax benefits, Although it does not go to San Francisco, it offers a bus connection at Emeryville.On-demand transportation services such as Uber and Lyft (note, however, that these can be expensive to use for transbay travel; however, they might be ideal to use in conjunction with AC Transit).
Muni service within San Francisco (useful if BART or AC Transit gets you as far as Embarcadero)."

Begin with the obvious and easiest, a general Internet search.,
Check out cheap travel websites (for example, Expedia or Priceline, to name just two).,
Conduct a more specific Internet search by researching Napa Valley.,
Be even more specific in your search by seeking the URL's for local newspapers in the Napa Valley region.,
Consult more traditional resources such as travel books.,
Broaden your search to surrounding areas.,
Know what kind of lodging you feel comfortable with.,
Consider traveling in the off-season.,
Promote your cause!,
Don't give up!",How to Find Cheap Hotels in Napa Valley," Pick any search engine and plug in what first comes to mind, such as ""cheap hotels Napa Valley,"" see what comes up, and follow the most appropriate links. This general search might not provide too much information, since Napa Valley is known for being expensive. Nonetheless, starting out in a general way and then becoming more specific and creative as you continue your hunt will probably lead to the best results. Whatever you do, don't get discouraged by the initial search!;
, If you are traveling by air, look into the package deals these sites offer for both air travel and lodging by clicking on ""flight and hotel."" If you are not traveling by air, click on ""hotel."" These kinds of websites often offer deep discounts on hotels looking to fill rooms. You might even find yourself able to afford better lodging than you expected.

, This way, you can get a better understanding of the area--from lodging possibilities to a map of surrounding areas. The more knowledge about the area you are armed with, the greater your chances of success in your search.

, If you go to the classified section of each publication, you may find a listing for a short-term sublet, which might provide a great alternative. Many local residents seek refuge from the tourist season. By subletting, you may be helping out a budget-conscious Napa Valley native.

, Even in the age of the Internet, books can be valuable resources, not to be overlooked. To do so ""on the cheap,"" it might be best just to begin with the Internet, peruse book-selling websites for guides on traveling cheaply, and then go to your local bookstore, grab the book and a seat, soak in and take notes on the information, and put the book back on the shelf.

, Lodging is often less expensive when it is located on the outskirts. If you are willing to travel a bit further from your hotel to your desired destination for the day, this is a great solution.

, Are you interested in four-star accommodations for half the price or are you content with a hostel? Adjust your search accordingly.

, This is when hotel proprietors are on the hunt for business.

, Let friends, coworkers, family, and acquaintance know about your quest. Tips can come from all sorts of places. You never know who might have a recommendation or experience with Napa-on-a-budget.

, Persistence often pays off. Possibilities exist even in one of the most sought-after tourist destinations. You just have to find them.

Discover other areas of Yosemite, since the valley is not the only place in the National Park, although maybe the most popular.",How to Plan a Trip to Yosemite Valley," This depends on what you want to see or do in Yosemite. Roads to the valley (but not to other areas of the park) are open all year.


Spring: April to early June is the best time to see the waterfalls. The weather can vary during this time. Crowds are light, except on May weekends.
Summer: While most people visit during the summer months, the crowds and heat arguably make it the worst time to visit. Since the water in the waterfalls comes from snowmelt, the water levels may be very low in late summer; the peak runoff is during May-June. On the plus side, all park roads leading to attractions outside of the Valley should be open during the summer.
Fall. In early Fall, the weather can include pleasant warm days and chilly nights. That said, some early winter storms can pop up and chains may be required. It should also be noted that Yosemite isn’t a good place to see fall foliage, since most of the trees there are evergreen. The waterfalls are often dry by early fall.
Winter: During December to March, there will often be snow. Tire chains will probably be needed.;
, It is about a four-hour drive from San Francisco and about a six-hour drive from Los Angeles. A Vehicle Pass is $20 and works for seven days; an Individual Pass, for people on foot, bus, bicycle, or horse, is $10. The Yosemite Pass is $40 and lasts for one year.

the Big Oak Flat Entrance in the northwest of the park on Hwy 120

the Arch Rock entrance in the west of the park on Hwy 140
the South entrance on Hwy 41

Drive north along highway 280, and stop to see the view.,
  Visit Point Reyes National Seashore.",How to Explore the San Andreas Fault Near the San Francisco Bay," This information will help you understand what you are seeing.

The San Andreas is a transform fault, meaning that it is the boundary between tectonic plates. It is the boundary between the Pacific Plate (to the west) and the North American plate (to the east). It runs for 810 miles, mostly north-south along the coast of California.
Land to the west of the fault is moving roughly north to northwest; land to the east is moving roughly south-southeast.
The fault is a strike-slip fault, meaning that the movement on either side is mostly horizontal and roughly parallel to the fault, as shown in figure C in the diagram.;
, Near Palo Alto, California, visit Sanborn County Park and explore the earthquake trail there. The San Andreas Rift Valley, one of the places you can hike through, is along the fault.

, Watch for the blue Vista Point signs and take the one just north of Edgewood Road. You will drive up into the hills and get a great view of (south to north) the Upper Crystal Springs Reservoir, the Lower Crystal Springs Reservoir, and the  San Andreas Lake. If you look at these bodies of water on a map or from the viewpoint, you'll see that they all line up. That's because they all lay along the fault.

There are hiking trails down along the Crystal Springs Reservoir, as well.

, You may have already explored this beautiful landscape, a short distance north of the Golden Gate. But did you know that the entire Point Reyes peninsula shifted north some 20 feet during the 1906 earthquake? To see the fault, look for water all in a straight line, separating the peninsula from the mainland, where Highway 1 runs along Tomales Bay.

Research passage on a freighter.",How to Travel from UK to the US by Boat," Travel across the Atlantic by boat is likely to cost around $1,000, but it can cost upwards of $4,000 per person, depending upon your cabin choice. Traveling between New York and major English cities is cheaper by plane.;
, This cruise company makes trips between Southampton and New York harbors on the Queen Mary II. If you want to book a boat trip between the UK and the US in the summer, this will be your best option.


Cruises are not available between January and March through cunard.com. If there is availability, booking last minute cruises will yield the cheapest stateroom prices.
Book your cabin according to your budget. Inside staterooms without windows cost between $650 and $900 per person. Suites can cost up to $4,000 per person per 7 night voyage.

, Every year, cruise lines relocate from Europe to the Caribbean. You can find a seat on 1 of these cruises. Visit a website like cruises.com and look specifically for positioning cruises leaving from London or Southampton.


Positioning cruises offer some discounts on fares, since they do not stop at ports. Most travel agents and online travel websites will not list these cruises. You should look online or call the cruise ships directly to inquire about availability.
Look for cruises that are approximately 7 days long, or they may include travel to the Caribbean.

, Freighters can carry up to 12 passengers without hiring a doctor. This means that you can occasionally find a ticket that costs approximately $50 to $100 per night for a cabin, food and access to facilities.


Freighter tickets are not like cruise ship tickets. They do not provide on-board entertainment. Occasionally, passengers are offered to attend meals and cocktail events with the captain and ship employees.
Visit A La Carte Freighter Travel, at freighter-travel.com, to look for freighter options. Passage can extend from 9 to 130 days, and you will pay per night.
Freighters make delivery stops, since their main duty is to deliver cargo. These stops can take 12 hours to a few days. You must be flexible with your schedule in order to travel this way.
Make sure to specify which amenities will be provided on the ship. Some freighters do not allow you to exit the boat in port, but they may not provide meals in port for these shorter trips.

Drive back to Fairbanks.,
Congratulations!",How to Travel the Dalton Highway2," There are several sights and sounds in Fairbanks to enjoy.

, Most car rental companies don't allow their vehicles onto the Dalton Highway, so find an outfitter with vehicles to use. Alternatively, book a bus trip.

, The actual highway doesn't start right out of town. You need to take the Elliot Highway (also known as AK 2) north approximately eighty miles to reach the junction for the Dalton. Turn onto the road and start the adventure.

, The road is a state highway, so standard road laws still apply. The speed limit is 50 mph (84 km/h) along the entire length of the road. Drive with headlights on at all times. Trucks have the right-of-way along the whole road, so pull over when one approaches. Watch for ice, slush, and potholes, as all are common along the road. Only certain parts of the road are paved, so drive accordingly.

, You will drive through some of the most untouched, beautiful wilderness in the country, including wildflowers, boreal forest, ice-clad mountains, and sprawling arctic tundra. Wildlife abound, and hiking and camping opportunities await, so it makes sense to pull over occasionally for photos and fresh air.

, About 260 miles from Fairbanks, you'll arrive in Coldfoot, the main truck stop along the Dalton, at the foot of the Brooks Range mountains and the best stop to refill on supplies and gas. Visit the Arctic Interagency Visitor Center (milepost 175) to learn some more about the history of the area and of the Arctic. Staying the night is also a good idea. Be sure you are completely ready before leaving, as a long haul without services is ahead of you (see warnings below).

, Along the way, you'll cross the Continental Divide along Atigun Pass. The ""Divide"", is an imaginary line of high points which separates the flow of water into two great basins, mostly East-West. It follows the crest of the Brooks Range from the Seward Peninsula, then bends south into the Yukon and follows the Rocky Mountains and Sierra Madre Mountains south into South America. This divide separates the Pacific watershed from others. Here, rivers to the south head to the Pacific Ocean via the Yukon River and Bering Sea. North of here, rivers drain into the Arctic Ocean.

, Deadhorse is the industrial camp supporting the Prudhoe Bay oilfields. You'll find some shops, museums and lodging options. Feel free to browse around. You'll almost certainly need to stay the night here.

, While access to the ocean is restricted for security reasons, the Arctic Caribou Inn offers guided tours. Look in the links below for the BLM Guide for a toll-free number.

, This is the same as before, just in reverse. Remember the services shortage (again, see warnings below).

, You've just done an adventure few people do!

Plan your trip.,
Purchase tickets for your journey.,
Board each train in your journey.,
Connect to different transit services as necessary.",How to Travel Across the U.S. by Train," Because of various issues like ticket availability, price fluctuations, and limited timetables, you will have a much easier time traveling across the U.S. if you plan your trip well in advance.


The first step is choosing the time of year to travel. Peak travel times in the U.S. are in the summer, and more broadly between April and September. Ticket prices will climb during this period; availability will decline; and cabins will be more crowded. The best times of year for getting inexpensive tickets but still enjoying pleasant weather and scenery are autumn and spring.
The next step is choosing your exact train schedule using timetables. Amtrak offers timetables for all of their routes at each station; they can also be downloaded online. Most Amtrak routes run either 1 or 2 trains daily.
There are several online resources where you can read which routes are more scenic as well as other Amtrak travel tips. Amtrak's own ""Whistle Stop"" web page offers travel tips submitted by customers.;
, After planning a route, you should purchase your tickets as far in advance as possible. Tickets can be purchased in person at each Amtrak station. They can also be ordered online at amtrak.com, or over the phone by calling 1-800-USA-RAIL. This phone service is only available to American and Canadian customers.


Amtrak prices its tickets incrementally. As each train fills up, the remaining seats are raised in price. This makes it advantageous to book your trip well in advance, especially if you intend to travel during the summer or around a holiday.
Discounts are available on Amtrak tickets through membership in certain organizations, such as the American Automobile Association (AAA). Discounts are also available to senior citizens and active military personnel.

, Boarding and traveling on an Amtrak train is a straightforward process.


Begin by arriving at your station early. The Amtrak website can advise you how long before your scheduled departure you should arrive at each station. Have your ticket ready.
Your ticket will be checked as you enter the train. Amtrak tickets do not usually have a specified seat number, so you can choose any available seat. Once seated, remain there until the attendant can place a seat check above your seat. This seat check indicates that your seat is occupied and lets the attendants know when your stop is near.

, Traveling on Amtrak can get you to many major U.S. cities, but traveling within cities or in the regional area must be accomplished using a different service. Before leaving, study the public transit services in your destination cities to determine how to transfer from an Amtrak train to a regional train or bus.

People buy/sell cars for as little as $500.;
, The favorite time of year to visit Montana is July and August. Many people travel Montana by Amtrak, get off the train at East Glacier, stay at the historic hotel (reserve a room in advance) or Essex, ride in the antique site-seeing tour buses to view Glacier Park, get back on the train and ride into Whitefish.

Notice the level of the massive lake compared to the level of the campground in the cottonwood trees below. Continue past the lake to a bridge which is also a spillway. The lake levels in recent years have been down so the water is a mile away from the spillway.

, If you visit the Fort Peck interpretive center, the colossal hill is the dam. Stay at the lovely campground full of cottonwood trees next to the Power houses and next to the interpretive center or stay at the historic hotel on the hill. For boat rides either meet the locals or ask at the marina, which is up the hill and on the north side of the big lake.

Determine peak season and off-season for your Philadelphia travel.,
Consider seasonal weather.,
Time your trip to Philadelphia according to the attractions that you want to see.,
Include an increased amount of time for going to Philadelphia by car.",How to Time Your Trip to Philadelphia," During the peak season, which for Philadelphia is in the summer, hotel fares and other elements of travel may be more expensive. Some bargain-minded vacationers like to take trips on the off-season, for example, in late fall or mid-winter, to save money.;
, Other vacationers who plan their trips according to the elements and outdoor climate often choose summer for a trip to Philadelphia or any other similar urban destination. Summer can be a more comfortable and convenient time to visit the city and see all that it has to offer.

, Another big tip for scheduling a Philadelphia vacation or tour is to be mindful of which main attractions are open at the times and dates that you are considering.


Look at the schedule for the Philadelphia Art Museum. The art museum is a major draw to the city, and knowing about when exhibitions are scheduled can help to plan a trip.
Learn about schedules for historic Philadelphia downtown locations. Some of the attractions around historic Rittenhouse square and spots like the Liberty Bell offer schedules that readers can use to help plan a trip.
Look at schedules for seasonal sporting events. Those who want to take in a professional American football or baseball game at the modern Lincoln Field/Citizen's Bank Stadium sports center can check on dates and times for games. Alternately, those who are not interested in these sports can plan to visit Philadelphia when crowds are not flocking to the downtown location, in order to avoid some extreme traffic.

, One of the characteristics of the city of Philadelphia is its often congested highways. A single main freeway, the Schuykill Expressway, brings visitors in from the west, and it's a good idea to plan to drive during off-peak hours to avoid crawling lines of traffic. The same issue applies to the main artery, the 95 freeway, for an approach from the south.

Choose one thing to splurge on.",How to Spend the Weekend in Baltimore," It's helpful to have a general overview of the city before you arrive, as well as an understanding of Baltimore's visitor offerings, discounts, events, and neighborhoods to check out. If you opt for a tourist guidebook, bring it with you for quick reference.;
, You may only be visiting for the weekend, but even a two or three day getaway can be greatly affected by the weather. Here is an overview of the best times to pay a visit to Baltimore:


Winter: The harbor looks beautiful under a fresh blanket of snow, but the harsh winds, frigid temperatures, and unpredictable winter storms are turnoffs to consider. If you'll be visiting anytime from November through March, be prepared for the cold weather, but also enjoy the numerous indoor public events offered.
Spring: One of the best times to visit Baltimore, springtime in Charm City offers mild or pleasantly cool days, budding trees and plant life, abundant outdoor activities and relatively thin crowds.

Summer: The air is sticky, the crowds are thick, and you'd be hard pressed to find many bargains. And you can't rule out the brief, but frequent, summer thunderstorm. However, harbor cruises and boat rides are a great relief to the humid days, and local produce markets are thriving with fresh merchandise.
Fall: Autumn is another great time to visit Baltimore; with cooler days, thinning crowds and the holidays approaching, the city seems to take on a charming vibe.

, While there are numerous hotels in Baltimore, especially downtown, less expensive options include homey bed-and-breakfasts and small but comfortable rental apartments in the city's most historic neighborhoods. If booking a hotel, consider the following tips to lessen the cost of your stay when making reservations:


Don't pay the rack rate. The rack rate is the highest fee a hotel charges for a room, and you'll most likely end up paying it unless you inquire about any discounts, such as if kids stay free or if your room comes with kitchen capabilities.
Get more for your money. Even if you are just staying for the weekend, ask the clerk for a corner room, which are typically larger and feature more windows, and if the hotel was recently renovated, ask for one of the newly redone guestrooms.

, Places to visit at the Inner Harbor in downtown include the renown Maryland Science Center, Maritime Museum of Baltimore, Port Discovery Children's Museum and the Baltimore World Trade Center observation deck.

, Visit Federal Hill across the harbor for amazing city views, or browse the shops and street life of the historic Fells' Point neighborhood.

, Locally-inspired fare is the norm at almost all but the chain restaurants, which includes seafood and American-style offerings. Many of the restaurants are located on the water and offer breathtaking harbor views.

, Take in the local scene there and find secret offerings or cheaper shopping then what you'd find at the harbor.

, Whether it be a romantic dinner cruise on the bay, an expensive must-have souvenir or a hotel suite with a remarkable view, treat yourselves during your visit to Baltimore with something special.

Be laid back.,
Learn Spanish.,
Leave your stereotypes behind.,
Get a car.,
Bring lotion.,
Appreciate your new home.",How to Move to New Mexico," If you're coming from a fast-paced city like New York or Los Angeles, you're in for a culture shock. For the most part, the people of New Mexico are laid back. There's no rush. This might become most obvious to you when driving--the person in front of you might be waiting to make a left turn, get the left arrow, but not see it until it turns red again and then you have to wait for another round. Don't honk, don't yell, don't slam your palm on the steering wheel. It's not going to change the way people go about their business; it'll only make you seem uptight and obnoxious.;
, Knowing how to speak Spanish is not essential, but it'll certainly make life a little easier for you because there are plenty of people in New Mexico who don't speak English. Even the people who do speak English use Spanish phrases, and might speak to you in Spanish even if you don't look it. Remember that many people are descendants from Spain and may not look obviously Hispanic to you, especially if you're moving from an area where most of the Hispanic people are dark-skinned.

, Even in diverse cities like New York, people still tend to align themselves along cultural lines. In New Mexico, this is not the case. Individuals mingle regardless of race or cultural background. The main ethnicities are white (either descending from Spain, or from another part of the US; there are also many Germans), Mexican, and American Indian (and yes, the term of choice there is Indian, not Native American). It's not uncommon to see mixed race couples. What might be less common is a same-sex couple, or a pairing between a cowboy/rancher and a city person, but overall, New Mexico is a welcoming place with a live-and-let-live attitude that's rare in other parts of the country.

, New Mexico is mostly desert. Public transportation isn't something you'll want to depend on, unless, perhaps, you live in Albuquerque. Fortunately, the cost of registering a car in New Mexico is relatively low, and there are no inspection requirements. You'll observe this when you see rusty pickups with headlights hanging off. And you might feel left out if you don't drive a truck. A big truck.

, New Mexico is notoriously dry. Your skin will feel it, as well as your lips. Get lotion that will also protect you from the sun, or else your skin will eventually turn to leather. It can also get very, very windy in New Mexico, so protect your skin.

, At first, it may take getting used to, especially if you're coming from a green or bustling place, but New Mexico is an amazingly peaceful and striking area. Visit ancient cliff dwellings, extensive caves, and white sand dunes. Explore the local history - the churches, Billy the Kid, Geronimo, and Smokey the Bear. Eat some prickly pear and yucca, or maybe even some prairie chicken (rattlesnake)!

Stay in contact with friends and family back home.",How to Solo Travel Across the United States," You should determine how much money you plan to spend on your trip. As a solo traveller, you want to be sure you have enough money during your travels as well as emergency money set aside in the event you need it. You may break down your budget by day, or week by week, depending on how long you are planning to travel. Take stock of your savings and determine how much you can afford to spend on the trip.For example, you may plan to spend $50 a day including accommodations, food, and entertainment. This may be ideal if you are planning to travel for at least a month to two months and do not want to spend over $5,000 total.
With this budget, you may plan to spend around $1,000 total on accommodations, $1,500 on food costs, $500 on gas and public transportation, $500 on entertainment, and keep $500 for an emergency fund.
Doing things like cooking for yourself and eating out sporadically can help you stay within your budget. You can also opt for the cheapest accommodations you can find to save money.;
, Do your research into different roads you can drive on that will take you through different cities or areas in the U.S. You may have a specific area you want to spend some time in, such as the Bible Belt or the Pacific Northwest. You may then factor these areas into your route. Spend some time deciding where you want to travel to so you have a rough idea of your destinations.If you are driving in a car solo, remember that two-digit highways go directly through cities and three-digit roads go around them. Odd-numbered highways run north to south while even-numbered highways run east to west.
You can also try following “I” roads, such as I95, to get to certain destinations more quickly. You may try including roads off of “I” roads for more scenic views from the road as well.

, Perhaps the biggest decision you will have to make about your trip, besides where to go, is how you are going to get around. You may decide to drive across the United States in your car or in a rental car. Or you may opt for flying into the U.S. and then taking buses and other public transportation around the country. Think about which mode of transportation would be the most comfortable and convenient for you.Keep in mind it will take about two months to drive across the U.S. and perhaps longer if you are taking buses or public transportation. You may decide to go with the transportation option that fits your window of time so you can spend a good amount of time seeing the sights.
You may also decide to travel by train through the United States. You could look up different train routes through parts of the U.S. as well as rates for travelling by rail online to determine if this is a good option for you.
As a solo traveller, you may want to consider other options before resorting to hitchhiking across the U.S as it can be risky. If you have hitchhiked solo before and are comfortable doing this, you may go with this option as a way to save money and to meet new people.

, You should think about whether you plan to stay in hotels or hostels when you are travelling. Hostels and couchsurfing, where you stay on people’s couches for little to no money, may be ideal if you are trying to save money or are on a tight budget for the trip. Or you may opt for a rental service where you book a room in someone’s home or have the whole place to yourself. Figure out your accommodations beforehand so you know where you are going to rest your head during your trip.If you really want to save money on accommodations, you may decide to camp during your trip. Depending on where you camp, you may need to pay a tent fee.
Another option is to sleep in your car if you are driving across the United States. However, it’s always a good idea to have a back up accommodation in the event of a storm or bad weather.

, Once you have determined most of the planning for the trip, sit down and draw up a day by day itinerary. Map out your planned route and note your accommodations for each night of the trip. Try to be detailed about your route so you have a guide you can follow once you start on your trip.


For example, you may write, “Day 1: Depart from home with full tank of gas, head to New York City. Stay the night at a hostel.”
As a safety precaution, you may decide to share your itinerary with family members or friends so they know what you are planning to do and where you are planning to be day by day. This may be useful in the event they are trying to locate you while you are travelling or in the event of an emergency.

, As part of your preparation for the trip, you should make a packing list. If you are planning to drive your own car across the U.S., you may make the packing list with your car in mind. Consider how much stuff you can fit in your car and how much stuff you need to bring with you. Often, packing light with only the bare essentials can make travelling solo much easier.For example, if you plan to stay in hostels or hotels, you should pack a light backpack with all of your essentials, including clothing, toiletries, phone charger, identification, laptop computer and your wallet. You may also pack a smaller backpack that you can use to carry your stuff while you are out, leaving your backpack locked up in the hostel or hotel.
Make sure you bring cookware and sleeping gear if you plan to camp or stay in your car overnight. You may pack a sleeping bag, a tent, and camping cookware so you can prepare meals on the road.

, To ensure you can stay in communication with loved ones back home, consider buying a cheap SIM card for your phone so you can use it in the United States. Many SIM cards in the US are pretty affordable. Its also a good idea to have a cellphone when you are travelling alone in case of emergency.You can also use the SIM card to contact loved ones at home by getting international data on the phone. This way, loved ones can call you through Skype or FaceTime at a very affordable rate.

, You should also make photocopies of your identification, such as your passport and your proof of citizenship card, and bring them with you in your backpack. You may stash copies in different pockets of your bag and in a travel coat so you have them in the event you lose your identification or it is stolen.You should also keep your passport and other identification in a safe place when you travel, such as a money belt or a bag with a secret pocket that you keep on you at all times.

, Will you use a credit card or a debit card during your solo trip? Will you use cash as well as cards? If you have an international credit card, you may decide to use it to pay for things like accommodations and entertainment. You may then set aside cash for food, as you may end up eating in spots that only take cash. Or you may rely on a U.S. debit card to pay for things on the trip.You may consider getting a travel credit card, which will give you points for every dollar you spend and make it easier to pay by credit card as you travel.

, If you aren’t sure what to do or what to see in an area, look for the local welcome center. They are often located in the downtown core of the city or on the main city street. You can ask the representative at the center about free fun things to do in the area and pick up a city map.This may be a good option if you do not have a clear plan for that day and are looking for something to do in a town or city.
While you’re at the welcome center, you should inquire about buying a city pass. Most major U.S. cities will have city passes where you can access public transit and museums for a low price.

, One way to get a good sense of an area is to take a guided tour. You may be able to find free or very cheap guided tours for cities you are in by searching online or by asking a representative at the welcome center. Guided tours are great for learning more about the city and for walking around in interesting areas of the city.You may find a tour that is short, around two hours, or go for a longer tour, which can be around four hours. Factor in your budget and make sure you do not spend too much on the tour, as walking around a city on your own is always a free option.

, Another great thing to do when you are travelling through the U.S. is to explore the national state parks in each state. You may opt for buying a National Park Pass, which gives you access to over 59 state parks for for $80. Or you may choose a few state parks as part of your trip itinerary and go on a hike or walk through the park.Keep in mind it is risky to hike solo. You may try talking to people at your hostel or hotel to see if you can get a group together to go hiking through a state park.

, Americans are known to be friendly people. You may find strangers on the street saying, “Hello” or “How are you?” Embrace the friendliness of the people and chat up locals at a bar or in a public park. Get to know the locals and ask them about their favorite things to do in the area as well as their favorite spots for eating and having fun.As a solo traveller, you may feel shy or uncomfortable with chatting someone up. One option is to talk to people staying at the same hostel or hotel as you as a way to get to know someone else. You can also talk to your hosts at the hostel or at the home stay and ask them for advice on what to see.

, As a solo traveller, you should take steps to travel safely on your own. One option is to find a temporary travel buddy at your hostel or your hotel and agree to travel through an area together. Once you are both done with your stay, you may part ways or agree to try to meet up again on another leg of your trip. This is a good way to travel with a friend for a short period of time.Chat up people in your hostel and find a temporary travel friend by asking, “Anyone going on a guided tour of the city today?” or “What you up to today? Want to explore together?”

, Another precaution you can take is avoiding late night walks outside alone. Though you may think you are safe in a city or town on your own, walking around alone at night can put you at risk. Try to walk with a group or another person late at night, even if it’s just to your car or to your hostel.You should also be alert and aware of your surroundings during the day. Do not leave your belongings unattended and keep your bag close to you at all times. Stay sharp and avoid any areas that seem risky or deserted, especially as a solo traveller.

, Try to stay in constant contact with loved ones back home so they know where you are and what you are doing. You may have a daily email check in with your parents where you let them know you arrived safely and fill them in on your plans for the day. Or you may call your best friend back home a few times a week so let them know you are safe and sound.You may also get in the habit of letting someone know where you are heading if you are going there alone. For example, you may let the front desk at the hostel know you are going to explore a certain area of the city that day. Or you may text a friend and let them know you are going to check out an area on your own so they know where you are.

, If you can spare a couple of weeks, turn off your phone and pack up your stuff. Go explore the wilderness. Camp out somewhere, and convince yourself aluminum is bad. Try bringing along instruments to play in the dead of night. Stop brushing your hair. Alaska is the perfect place to experiment with this.

, Convince yourself aluminum is bad. Skip excessive hygiene, start wearing your jeans cut at the knee and recycle or resew the remaining denim.

, Everyone in Alaska loves anyone up here beating a conga. Is it Alaskan? No. Does it remind of us a remote tropical island? Yes, and that is sort of refreshing.

, Alaska has superior furriers. Save it for a special occasion, or wear it in the middle of summer with a pair of shorts.

, Plug in your iPod, and just wander around the state thinking, fantasizing and planning. Just don't stray to far.

, Snow usually peaks in December/January.

, Girdwood is fantastic if you dig Alyeska (google it!) and it's a great place to camp. They host the July 4th Forest Fair. Seward is usually a quiet fishing town nestled at the base of Mount Marathon, but it's one heck of a party place around July Fourth. Also super crowded during that time. Fairbanks is just like Anchorage, with a relative amount of different offered leisure. Give it a shot.

, Alaska is an acceptable place to drink ""during the day""- because are days start really early and end really late (during summer).

, According to Alaskan law, your plant can't be too large (google that also). You cannot buy, sell, or smoke it, because that goes against National law. Basically, it's a houseplant for decorative purposes only.

, Buy a pair of binoculars, spot for whales, or bird watch. Don't go crazy with the ""spying"".

, Nothing beats jumping into a lake/ocean or spot of cold Alaskan water. Washing off under a waterfall is completely acceptable.

, Open any windows in your residence, and crank it.

, Go crazy.

, If it's summer, look around for hot dog stands. Learn the best. If it's winter, grill your own wieners indoors, or outside. Who says you can't use your grill in the winter?

, Buy all that tourist-y stuff, snap photos. Nothing feels more satisfying.

, Priceless.

, Nothing beats using a flashing morocco to warn oncoming traffic and pedestrians that you are there!

, Please don't try biking on icy streets.

, It gives you an entirely new outlook. Very inspiring to take a nature hike.

Look for airfare.,
Consider booking through a travel agent or Central Reservations.",How to Plan a Ski Vacation to Jackson Hole," Keep in mind a few things while doing this: discounts will occur for 3 days skiing and more; avoid President's Week and Christmas week if possible if you are flying, the airfare gets pretty limited; plan an extra day to do a non-skiing activity-snowmobile trips to Yellowstone or the surrounding areas, dog sled excursions and snowshoe tours.;
, If you'd like to travel over a weekend, typically Thursday-Monday is the most affordable for a 4 night/3 day ski package. The airport code for Jackson Hole is JAC. Nearby airports are Idaho Falls (IDA) about 2 hours away, and Salt Lake City about 5 hours away. In the winter though, the drive from either of those airports can be very negatively affected by weather...so JAC is the best way to go.

, Jackson Hole Central Reservations has private airfare that is often the most affordable that can be found, and also has exclusively discounted lift tickets.

Movement Electronic Music Festival - Memorial Day Weekend - Detroit
Detroit Belle Isle Grand Prix - Late May/early June - Belle Isle
Detroit Riverdays & Ford Fireworks - Late June - Detroit Riverfront
Woodward Dream Cruise - 3rd Saturday in August - Ferndale to Pontiac
Arts, Beats & Eats - Labor Day Weekend - Royal Oak
Dally in the Alley - Saturday after Labor Day - Midtown Detroit;
, While you're in town, be sure to check out beautiful Comerica Park and catch the Boys of Summer in action.  Their schedule can be found on the Tigers website.

, Maybe you're more into the World's game than you are into America's pastime.  If that's the case, you can check out Detroit City FC at Cass Tech High School.  With an environment like no other, you can enjoy the game from the ""family friendly"" side of the stands or get the full DCFC experience by joining the Northern Guard Supporters on the opposite side of the pitch.  You can find Le Rouge's schedule on their website and be sure to head down to Harry's Bar before the match for pregame festivities.

, If you can't find any events you'd particularly like to visit, there are plenty of other options for you to enjoy during your stay.  Just be sure to plan enough time for everything you would like to see and do while you're here.

, The Detroit area is serviced by Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport (DTW).  Most major airlines fly in/out of DTW including Delta, Southwest, United, American Airlines, and more.  Unfortunately, the airport is located somewhat far from Detroit proper.  The cab fee between DTW and the city can be a bit expensive, so it may be in your best interest to rent a car, especially for a lengthier trip.

, The Detroit area is also easily accessible by either bus or train.  Both Amtrak and Greyhound have stops throughout the Detroit area in Ann Arbor, Dearborn, Royal Oak, Troy, Pontiac, and Downtown as well.  The area is also serviced by MegaBus with stations in Detroit and Ann Arbor and via Rail Canada with a station across the river in Windsor.  Many of the major Bus/Train routes will route you through Chicago on the way to Detroit, so this may be an inconvenience for people travelling from nearer areas.

, For those people within reasonable driving distance, travelling via car may be the best option for you.  Detroit has three major interstates that run straight through the Downtown area and to the adjacent suburbs – I-75 from the North and South, I-94 from the East and West, and I-96 from the West.  As with most major cities, Detroit does become snarled with rush hour traffic on the freeways and surface streets before and after the workday, so plan accordingly and leave yourself plenty of time to get from point A to B. 


Also important to note is that summer is construction season in Michigan.  You can check the Michigan Department of Transportation’s website for an update on scheduled construction and closures to assist in your travels.

, Whether it’s your first trip to Detroit, or your 100th, the Detroit Bus Company offers tours of the city to people of ages and interest groups.  Whether you’re looking for a general tour of the city or something geared towards your interests, chances are they have a tour for you.  Throughout the summer, the DBC offers historical tours hitting some of the major (and not so major) landmarks, tours that view some of Detroit’s many street art works, and even tours of historic bars and prohibition hot spots.  On many of these tours, you are allowed to bring your own beer, but make sure to check the website ahead of time.  Don’t forget to tip your tour guide and driver if you feel so inclined after the trip!

, One of Detroit’s best gems is also one of Michigan’s largest family attractions.  The Detroit Zoo, located just north of Detroit in Royal Oak, is home to some really incredible exhibits featuring Lions, Tigers, and you guessed it – bears as well!  The Zoo is home to North America’s largest Polar Bear exhibit, The Arctic Ring of Life.  It also houses newly opened wolf and beaver exhibits, a walk through kangaroo exhibit, and a new penguinarium will soon be opened to the public.  The Zoo is fun for the whole family, so be sure to check it out!

, The Detroit Institute of Arts, or simply the DIA for short, is home to one of the largest art collections in the United States.  Located in the heart of the city in Midtown Detroit, the collection is home to works from many of your favorite artists and sculptors.  The museum is also home to an extensive collection of historical artifacts from cultures around the world.  Possibly its biggest claim to fame is the Diego Rivera Detroit Industry Murals located in the museum’s Rivera Court.  The murals were recently given National Historic Landmark status and are truly a site to see.  Be sure to check the DIA’s website for information on special exhibitions going on throughout the summer.  Bonus – After you’re done at the DIA take a stroll just a couple blocks away to the nearby Detroit Historical Museum, the newly re-opened Michigan Science Center, and The Scarab Club of Detroit.

, If you’re looking to try to win some money (or maybe just donate some of it to the city) there are four major casinos in the area.  Greektown Casino is located just a few blocks from Comerica Park, Ford Field, and Campus Martius Park downtown.  This casino offers a hotel and plenty of various restaurants and bars in the near vicinity.  Motor City Casino and MGM Grand Detroit are both located just outside of the downtown area.  Both of these casinos offer a hotel as well as on-site restaurants and bars.  Finally, Caesar’s Windsor, located across the river in Windsor, ON also offers a hotel and restaurants as well as various concerts and comedy acts throughout the year.

, Hitsville, U.S.A. or the Motown Historical Museum was once home to the recording studio of acts such as Diana Ross and the Supremes, Stevie Wonder, and the Jackson 5.  Here you can take in a part of musical history and step into the studio where these Motown artists got their start.  The museum is located just a few short minutes from Downtown and is conveniently located just off the Lodge freeway.

, If you’d like to see some of the famous architecture of the city as well as learn about the history of many of the historic buildings downtown, a Pure Detroit Walking Tour may be right for you!  These tours generally occur every Saturday throughout the summer and tour such buildings such as the Fisher Building in the New Center area and the Guardian Building located downtown, as well as the Woodward Historic District and the various skyscrapers located downtown.  These tours generally last less than an hour and are free to the public.  Check out Pure Detroit’s Facebook page for more information.

, Recently becoming a state park, Belle Isle Park is truly a Detroit gem.  The park is located on Belle Isle, a small island on the Detroit River just a few short minutes from downtown.  The park has plenty of picnic, fishing, and hiking areas as well as various monuments and historic buildings.  Also located in the park are the Belle Isle Nature Zoo, the Belle Isle Aquarium, the Anna Scripps Whitcomb Conservatory, the Dossin Great Lakes Museum, and even Detroit’s only public beach!  With plenty to do on the island, be sure to plan for a full day of fun!

, Detroit really has something for everyone.  If you’re looking for more things to do, consider checking out these other places


Eastern Market – Detroit’s farmer’s market and state historic site.  Pick up some fresh fruits and veggies, eat at one of the many restaurants in the vicinity, and check out the building murals.  Open throughout the week, but the biggest market is generally on Saturdays during the summer.
Detroit Riverwalk – Take a walk along the Detroit River and check out the view while you’re at it!  There are various parks and entertainment along the river from Joe Louis Arena and to the Renaissance Center and beyond.  Take out a book from one of the community library stands and relax in a comfy chair or join in a pickup game of volleyball on one of the Riverwalk’s courts.
Historic Fort Wayne – Located along the river in Southwest Detroit, Historic Fort Wayne offers war re-enactments, vintage baseball games, and flea markets throughout the year.  The fort is a Michigan historic site and holds various events throughout the year.
The Henry Ford and Greenfield Village – Located in Dearborn, The Henry Ford and Greenfield Village offer a trip back in time for children and adults alike.  You can check out the large collection of vehicles, aircraft, and pop culture in the Henry Ford museum and step back to the 17th century to witness American history come alive in Greenfield Village’s many historical buildings.  Bonus – Hop on a bus at the museum and take a trip to tour the Ford River Rouge factory, home of the assembly line and the Ford Model A.

, There’s an old saying in Michigan that, “If you don’t like the weather, wait ten minutes.”  This can be especially true during the summer.  The weather can range from mild to hot and muggy and pop-up thunderstorms are certainly a possibility.  Check the weather before leaving on your trip and be sure you’re prepared for all possibilities.

, When travelling throughout downtown Detroit, parking is generally available in most areas.  Most of the lots will require you to pay and many do not accept credit card as a form of payment.  It’s best to have some cash on hand for this purpose.

, Detroit is notorious for its poor public transit system.  However, there are some forms available.  The Detroit People Mover serves the Downtown area with stops ranging from Greektown to Cobo Hall.  Many of the major attractions downtown are within a few blocks of a People Mover station and the rate is much cheaper than a cab at $.75 one way.  Outside of the Downtown area, the SMART bus system runs through much of the suburban Detroit area.  While the SMART Bus system isn’t as well developed as the bus systems in other major cities, it is available for your use.

, The town of Windsor, ON is only a few minutes away over the Ambassador Bridge or through the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel.  If you'd like to visit Windsor, be sure to bring your passport.

Pull on the yellow cord along the top of the windows (or press the button on the poles) before your stop.",How to Take the 747 Express Bus in Montreal1," You will see a bus symbol. The 747 picks people up towards the end of the pick up area, on the roadway that passes alongside the doors (not the further roadway, where many other buses stop). You will see a sign, and there will probably be a line of people waiting.;
, This bus does not accept bills, but it does accept coins. If you don't have coins, there is a machine that is just inside the door which will accept bills. The cost is $10 (Canadian). When you use the machine, you will get a card to use when you board the bus.

, Insert the coins into the coin slot or scan the card you got from the machine. Keep the card; it's good on the bus and metro network for the next 24 hours.

, They are toward the front of the bus, near the driver. Look at the map and determine which stop is closest to your destination. You can also find the route map online before your trip (http://stm.info/English/bus/planibus/747.pdf).

, This will tell the driver you need to get off.

",How to Take the 747 Express Bus in Montreal2,", This shuttle doesn't loop in downtown, so you can't just go to the stop where you were dropped off.


If you are getting on the 747 from the Berri-UQAM metro station, follow the signs to the 747 bus and bus terminal (gare d'autocars). Once at the bus terminal, look for door 15. The bus waits right outside this door. If you do not have exact change, this station has machines that will accept bills and give you a card to use.

Find your closest metro station, marked by a characteristic blue sign with a white arrow in a circle pointed downward.,
Know roughly where you're going and what metro station you want to go to.,
Enter the station.,
Buy a ticket either from a vending machine or from the booth by the turnstiles.,
Know where you're going.,
Consider that you may have to transfer.,
Find the sign with the right colour and the right direction.",How to Use the Metro in Montreal," Most of the stations downtown are connected via the underground tunnels, so look for a sign on the side of office buildings or entrances to malls. The lines themselves run under de Maisonneuve (green line) and Viger/Saint-Jacques (orange line), with the green line continuing east and west, and the orange line curving north on either side of downtown.;
, If you don't know the exact station, there are maps of Montreal in every station, at many bus stops, and on the streets around town. The metro map is in every car, and you can get a pocket-sized one from the booth operator.

, Unlike in New York, every entrance is good to board for either direction of travel -- in fact, every station except Longueuil is designed to allow you to change directions (if you go too far, for example) without having to leave the turnstiles.

, The Laurier street entrance to the Laurier metro is not manned, but does have a ticket machine. Keep the ticket with you -- it's your proof of purchase and your transfer to the bus system.

, The ""direction"" of the trains is listed by the last station on the line, so look at the map, find your present station and your destination station, and then note the end-station that you have to travel toward. So if you're at Berri-UQAM and you wanted to go to Pie-IX, you would take the green line, direction Honoré-Beaugrand.

, Note what station you will have to transfer at, and which direction you'll have to go when you're there (again, if you forget, there are maps in the trains.)

, Walk downstairs, wait for the train, and get on! During rush-hour, some trains on the Orange line stop at Henri-Bourassa instead of continuing to Montmorency, but other than that, there are no express trains that skip certain stops, nor trains with different destinations using the same track. The name of the next station is announced in French as the train leaves, and again when it arrives.

Secure documents you are missing.,
Travel to a Canadian Port of Entry.",How to Travel to Canada with a Felony Charge1," Before leaving for your trip, assess whether or not you meet the criteria for being deemed rehabilitated. If you don’t, you risk being denied entry into Canada. To be deemed rehabilitated, you must satisfy the following:


you have had only one conviction in total or committed one crime
at least 10 years have passed since you completed your sentence; 5 years for summary (or minor) offenses
the crime you committed is not considered a “serious” crime in Canada (i.e., the maximum prison sentence if convicted in Canada would have been less than 10 years)
the crime did not entail use of a weapon, physical harm to a person, or involve serious property damage.Note that simply because your criminal records were sealed or expunged, you may still be prevented from entering Canada. The same applies to being pardoned. Getting a certificate of innocence may carry more weight.;
, Canada weighs a conviction in the United States and other foreign countries against their own legal statutes. Although a conviction may qualify as only a misdemeanor in the United States, what matters is how much time you would serve if the crime were committed in Canada.


You can find information about Canadian laws and punishments by visiting your library, contacting a Canadian consulate office, or looking up crimes at the Canadian Legal Institute Information website.

, You must present documentation about your conviction to a Canadian official at the port of entry. If you don't already have these documents, locate them:


a passport, or a birth certificate plus photo identification
a copy of court documents for each conviction, plus proof that all sentences were completed
a recent criminal record check
a recent police certificate from the country you were convicted in, and from any country where you lived for at least six months during the past 10 years. , You should give yourself several months to find any necessary documents you are missing.

A recent police certificate may be obtained by contacting the FBI. Write to “FBI, Criminal Justice Information Services Division—Summary Request, 1000 Custer Hollow Road, Clarksburg, WV 26306.”, An immigration officer will assess you at the point of entry. If you are denied, then you will not be allowed to enter Canada.


There is no guarantee you will be deemed rehabilitated and allowed to enter Canada, even if enough time has passed since you served your sentence. If you do not want to risk being turned away, then you should apply for individual rehabilitation at least 6 months before your planned trip.
At a bare minimum, if you plan to just go to the border or fly into Canada, you should have a legal opinion prepared by an attorney stating that your criminal convictions should qualify you as ""deemed rehabilitated."" Even if you have this document, however, you will not necessarily be admitted.

a criminal clearance from all countries (including Canada) where you have lived for at least six consecutive months for the last 10 years
if from the United States, a criminal clearance from every state in which you have lived for 6 consecutive months since turning 18, as well as a federal clearance from the FBI
documentation on sentence, parole, or pardon, which clearly show when the sentence was completed; as well as judge’s comments, probation/parole reports, and letters of recommendation
if a juvenile offender, a letter showing that your country has special measures for juvenile offenders.You should get this from the Court you were convicted in.
Be honest. If you lie on your application and conflicting information turns up, you might never be allowed entry.

The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration makes the decision for more serious offenses.
Among the factors considered are your number of offenses, as well as the circumstances and seriousness of each offense; and your behavior since committing the offense.

Camp in the national park.",How to Visit Canadian National Parks," Start be deciding where in Canada you’d like to explore, such as a specific province or area. There are 13 provinces in Canada and each province has several national parks. Choosing a national park based on area may help you determine if you’d like to visit the west side of Canada, for example, or the east side of Canada. Or you may look for a park close to the Rocky mountains so you can see the Rockies and enjoy some time in the park.


Another option is to choose a park that is close to a town or city that you would also like to visit, such as Banff National Park, which encompasses the town of Banff. Or Quarry Island in Quebec, which is in the Mingan Archipelago National Park Reserve in Quebec.
You can find a full list of Canadian national parks on the Parks Canada website.;
, Pick at least one park you want to visit or perhaps two or more if you have more time on your trip. There is often a lot to see and explore in one national park so you may only have the time to explore one. If you are doing a roadtrip, for example, you may have time to fit in visits to more than one national park.You may select a park that has a renowned site, such as a lake, hot springs, or rock formations. Or you may go for a park that has a stunning attraction, such as the ski hills in Mount Revelstoke National Park or the Columbia Icefields in Jasper National Park.
You may choose two national parks that are within the same province or area, such as Banff National Park and Jasper National Park, which are both in the province of Alberta. They are also driving distance from each other, which makes it easier for you to access both within in a day trip or for an overnight trip.

, Think about what type of weather you would prefer for your visit. If you’re going to the national park to hike or bike, for example, you may opt for a warmer time of the year, such as the spring or summer months. If you’d like to do winter sports in the national park, the winter months may be more ideal.Many people who like to hike choose September or October to visit national parks in Canada, as they are often less crowded, the weather is more temperate, and the scenery is beautiful with the changing of the leaves.Keep in mind that in the winter months, some parks may be inaccessible or closed due to extreme weather conditions, such as avalanches or snowstorms.
Before you finalize your travel dates, look at the predicted weather forecast in the national park for that time period. Check the forecast closer to your chosen travel dates to ensure the park is still open and that the weather will be a good fit for the activities you want to do in the park.

, To help you narrow down which Canadian national park you would like to go to, think about your priorities as a traveler. Ask yourself, What would I like to do on my trip? What would I like to get out of my visit?


Perhaps you want to do a lot of winter sports on your visit. You may then opt for a national park with a renowned ski hill or a lake that you can skate on. Or maybe you'd prefer to do backcountry hiking. You may then look for a national park that offers great views and good trails for hiking in the backcountry.

, Perhaps the easiest way to explore a Canadian national park is to drive to it. Having a car in the park can be a good way to get to a hiking trail or a ski hill. Many Canadian national parks will have paved roads running through the entire park as well as parking lots by many major attractions or trails. Driving to the national park will also give you the chance to plan a fun road trip, with stops in cities or towns along the way. You may choose an existing route for your road trip or create your own route.For example, a popular road trip is to drive from Calgary to Banff and Lake Louise in Banff National Park, with stops at hot springs, the town of Banff, a beautiful hiking trail to a canyon, and the famous emerald waters of Lake Louise.
If you are travelling from out of the country, you may fly into a city or town in Canada and rent a car with the intent of driving to the national park.

, Another option if you don’t want to rent a car or do not have access to a car is to take a bus to the national park. Many national parks in Canada can be accessed by a bus from a city or town near the park. You can also take a bus to the national park from the airport, depending on where you are flying into in Canada.You can also get to cities in a national park by the Greyhound bus, such as the town of Jasper in Jasper National Park, or cities close to a national park, such as Calgary, Alberta, which is an hour away from Banff National Park.

, If you want a more scenic view from your window, taking the train to the national park may be for you. Many Canadian national parks are accessible by train through VIA Rail Canada. Search online for more information on trains you can take to certain national parks, depending on where you are starting from in Canada.There is also a train service called the Rocky Mountaineer that has routes all over Western Canada. They offer different routes to several national parks with stops in several major Canadian cities., Think about who you are going to be travelling with on your visit to the Canadian national park. Perhaps you are traveling with good friends or a partner. Maybe you are bringing the whole family with you. Or maybe you are doing a solo trip.


Determining who your travel companions are may help you to get a sense of the cheapest and most efficient way to travel to the park. You may be able to save money on gas, for example, if you are splitting the cost with three other people in a car. Perhaps it is cheaper for your family to take the train or the bus rather than drive.

, Once you have determined the park or parks you are visiting as well as your mode of transportation, make a budget for the trip. Calculate how much transportation and accommodations, if any, are going to cost. Then consider daily expenses like food and activities. You may budget a certain amount of money a day so you do not go over your budget.


You can also create a travel timeline so you know where you will be and what you will be doing day by day. You may block out time for hikes, winter sports, and note where you will eat your meals on a daily basis while you visit the park.

, To get the full experience at a national park in Canada, make sure you buy a park pass. You can buy a park pass for several parks in Canada or all parks in Canada in advance online. You can also purchase a park pass at the gates to the national park if you are driving to the park. Having a park pass will ensure you have paid the entry fee and will give you access to the entire park. There are day passes as well as passes for longer stays available.Sometimes Parks Canada offers a special deal on park passes, such as the offer of a free park pass in 2017 to celebrate their 150th anniversary. Check online at Parks Canada to see if there are any deals or specials on park passes for when you plan to travel.

, If you’d like to get a more informative experience at the national park, you may sign up for a park tour. There are often tours offered at attractions in the national park on an hourly or daily basis. You can also sign up for a tour package where you do an activity with a guide, such as hiking, kayaking, or snowshoeing. Having a guide may be a good option if you are travelling as a family and want to ensure you are all safe while doing an activity together.Having a park guide may also be a good idea if you are planning to do any backcountry exploring in the national park or go on more challenging hiking trails.
You can search for park tours online through the website for the national park or by calling Parks Canada for more information.

, Perhaps the easiest and cheapest option in a national park is going for a hike on a trail. You may choose a popular hiking trail in the national park or try a more challenging trail. Look for a family friend hiking trail if you are travelling as a family and make sure you are prepared for the hike. Packing the appropriate gear for the hike will ensure you are all safe on the trail.Always check the weather forecast and the trail conditions before you head out on a hike. Look for any weather advisories in the area and let someone at home or someone not with you on the hike that you are going out. This will ensure someone knows where you are in case of emergency.

, Many national parks contain one or more lakes with stunning views and waters ideal for canoeing. You can rent canoes on site or bring your own canoe to use on the lake. Make sure you wear life jackets when you are in the canoe.You can also try kayaking in any rivers or streams in the national park. You may have to search for good kayaking spots in the national park, depending on which one you go to, online or in person through a Parks Canada representative.

, Winter sports like skiing, snowboarding, and snowshoeing are all fun activities you can try in the national park. If you intend to do winter sports, visit Canadian national parks in winter and go to parks that tend to get a lot of snow. You may be able to rent winter sports gear in the park or bring your own gear.Make sure you do winter sports with at least one other person or a group of people.
You may need to pay a fee to do winter sports on ski hills in the national park.

, Camping in the national park can be a fun way to have an extended visit to the area and really soak in the natural setting. You will need to bring your own camping gear to camp in the national park and ensure you have a valid park pass for the duration of your stay.You can reserve a camping spot in the national park ahead of time online on the Parks Canada website. This may be a good idea in high season, such as summer or late spring.
You may need to pay a camping fee to reserve the spot, depending on the area you are camping on.

For some types of fraud, you may want to report to the embassy or consulate in the country where the fraud is taking place, rather than the embassy or consulate nearest you.
While you can file your report at any of Canada's immigration offices abroad, you can save time by directing your report to the embassy or consulate that likely has contact with the individuals involved.;
, Before you submit your report to Canadian officials, gather any documents or evidence you have and write a comprehensive outline of all the factual details you know so you don't leave anything out.The more information you have, the more likely it is that embassy or consulate officials will be able to investigate and uncover the fraudulent activity.
However, don't worry if you don't have much information, and don't put yourself in danger attempting to acquire more information for the sake of a report.

, Once you've got your information together, contact the Canadian embassy or consulate where you've decided to file your report and talk to an official about what you know.These reports are always confidential, and you may be able to remain anonymous if you want to do so, for example because you fear for your safety.
Although Canadian officials don't invoke penalties for reporting false information, do your best to make sure that the information you provide is complete and accurate to the best of your knowledge.
Include as many details as you can, and don't leave anything out. Something you think is unimportant could turn out to be the fact that breaks the case for the investigators.
If possible, get an identification or case number for your report so if you need to follow up with additional information later you can do so without repeating the same information over and over again.

, Authorities typically won't give you information regarding any investigation that follows from your report, but if you learn any new facts you should contact the same embassy or consulate where you filed your original report.If you were provided with a case number, you can give it to the official with whom you speak so your new information will be connected with your original report.
Even if you don't have a number to identify your case, you still should provide additional information as you come across it. Just be sure to give the official enough information to connect the two reports so they aren't treated as separate.

, Keep in mind that you can use a round-trip FrontRunner ticket for any TRAX or bus transit as well.

Organize the information you have.,
Determine if you can file a report online.,
Call the appropriate phone number.,
Tell the agent what you know.,
Update your report as necessary.",How to Report Immigration Fraud in Canada2," Before you report immigration fraud, take a moment to write down all the facts you know, including details of any incidents you've observed in chronological order.Since you may be filing your report over the phone, writing down the factual details you have can help you ensure the accuracy of what you're telling the agent.
The most valuable information includes identifying information about the person you suspect of immigration fraud, such as their name, address, and date of birth or approximate age.
Keep in mind that the more information you have about the person, the more likely immigration agents will be able to find and investigate the situation. Without much to go on, the person won't be identified and the fraud will likely continue.
If you observed any specific incidents, write down as many details of those incidents as you can recall, including the date, time and location where the incident happened.

, For some types of fraud, such as abuse or misuse of Canada's temporary foreign worker program, you can file a report online at the Service Canada website.Online reporting can be easier because you have time to compose your message and double-check your facts before you submit your report.
If you file a report online, any identifying information you provide will be kept confidential and not released unless you provide specific consent for authorities to do so.
However, you don't need to provide any identifying information at all and can remain anonymous.

, For most types of citizenship fraud, you can file your report by calling the Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) Call Centre and speak to an agent.The IRCC Call Centre number is 1-888-242-2100. Automated service is available 24 hours a day seven days a week.
However, if you want to speak to an agent and report immigration fraud, you should call Monday through Friday between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m. (your local time), excluding statutory holidays.
Citizenship fraud relates primarily to people who pretend to live in Canada to become a citizen, or who hid information about their case so they could gain citizenship.
For other types of immigration fraud, another number may be more helpful to get your report to the right agency that can do something about it.
For example, if you know of immigrants who are not paying taxes, you can call 1-866-809-6841 to report that type of fraud. If you know immigrants who are trying to hide assets offshore, you can report that activity by calling 1-855-345-9042.

, Provide all factual details you know about the fraud, including names and locations or any other information that may help identify the individuals involved in the fraudulent activities.Provide as many specific details as you know, but don't worry if there's something you don't know – even if it seems important.
Depending on the content of your report, the agent may have questions for you. Answer them as best you can, but feel free to say you don't know if they ask something about which you don't have information.
You typically can remain anonymous, but it may be important to your report to identify yourself or your relationship to the person you're reporting – especially if you want the agency to keep your identify confidential.

, While you typically won't be able to find out what happens as a result of your report, if you learn any new information you should call the same number you used to file your original report and tell an agent about it.If you were given a report number when you made your initial report, you should give that number to the agent who answers so that your new information can be connected to your initial report and everything is all in one place.
Take care not to go out of your way or put yourself in danger to learn new information. The agency will investigate based on the information you provided.
If you gave contact information, an agent involved in the investigation also may contact you with questions.

"
"
Assess the level of the situation.,
Gather information about the activity you've observed.,
Consider contacting your member of parliament (MP).,
Call the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA).,
Follow up on your report.",How to Report Immigration Fraud in Canada3," Who you call to report suspicious border activity depends on the level of danger involved. If you suspect that someone's life is in danger, or if you know a victim of human trafficking, you should contact your local police immediately.Don't take the law into your own hands or become involved in illegal activity yourself, whether to get more information or to protect possible victims.
If you're concerned for your own safety and want to submit a report anonymously, call Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-TIPS.

, While you want to take care not to put yourself or anyone nearby in any danger, the more factual details you have about the activity, the more likely it will be stopped.You may want to create an outline with the dates, times, and locations of activity you've observed.
If you're observing continuing activity, take notes of your observations as the incident is happening. You may be able to record more information in the moment than you would be able to remember later.
Documents and photographs also may be helpful if you can acquire them safely.

, Particularly if you've observed ongoing activity on several occasions, your MP may be able to investigate and help you report the situation to Border Services.Call your MP's office and tell the staff member that answers that you want to schedule an appointment.
After you've scheduled your appointment, you may want to look into your MP's background and positions, if you aren't already familiar with them. Learning about your MP's stance on immigration can help you understand how to approach them.
Bring all the information you have about the immigration fraud you're observing with you to the appointment.
Explain to the MP that you're not asking them to investigate the matter. You only want them to help you report and bring the issue to the attention of someone in Border Services who will do something to stop the fraud from continuing to happen.

, The CBSA is responsible for investigating immigration matters that relate specifically to smuggling and illegal border crossings. The agency has a hotline you can call at any time 24 hours a day, seven days a week.Call 1-888-502-9060 to file your report with the CBSA Border Watch. Press ""1"" when prompted to speak to an agent, and tell the agent what you want to report.
Include as much specific information as you have, including names, addresses, ages, and physical descriptions of those engaging in fraudulent activities.
At a minimum, the CBSA needs the persons complete name, age or date of birth, and a description of the fraud the person has committed.
Ask the agent for a log or case number so that if you have to call again, you can give that number to the agent who answers.

, While the CBSA will begin investigating your report as soon as possible, the time it takes to complete an investigation varies, and they will not give you any information regarding an ongoing investigation or its results.Your identity will be kept confidential. While the CBSA may share information with other law enforcement agencies, your identify will not be revealed and you likely will not be contacted again as a result of your report.
For that reason, if you learn new information it's up to you to call the CBSA number again and let the agent know what you've learned.
Keep in mind that the CBSA prioritizes certain types of issues, such as terrorism and human smuggling, over others.
The CBSA takes every tip seriously and will investigate it as soon as possible as far as they can given what you've told them.
Even though you can't expect to learn anything regarding the progress of the investigation, additional information can move the investigation forward.

Located in Toronto's arty design neighbourhood, where galleries, fashion boutiques and interior design shops abound.;
, Always packed. Eat the steamed grouper with ginger and the hot-and-sour soup.

, Ematei - A slightly off-the-radar address doesn’t keep bargain hunters from finding this unpretentious spot where three-course dinners (beef teriyaki with soup, salad and rice, for example) can be had for as little as $22. Divider walls framed in strips of dark wood nod to rice paper tradition; steel chairs and multiple bits of kitsch on the walls conjure more Bill Murray’s Tokyo.

, Scaramouche - After more than 25 years, the restaurant is still seducing diners with its luxurious food and understated but powerfully romantic setting. Book early for one of the coveted window seats offering sparkling views of the skyline. The menu luxuriates in delicacies: foie gras, truffle, lobster, veal — often combining many elements into a grand whole.

, Bovine Sex Club (542 Queen St. W.) - A portal to the dark side, for a lot of good reasons. And the dark side in Toronto is dark, like an LA, aluminum-foil-on-the-windows kind of dark. Rock, punk and other happening sounds blare at ear-bleeding decibel levels, while TV screens show a wide range of films. Everything a seedy Queen West bar should be and more, the 15-year-old Bovine has valiantly resisted the war on sleaze that’s been sweeping the rest of the neighbourhood. Bolted to the ceiling is a collage of weird and wonderful knick-knacks, the pièce de résistance of the strange, even menacing décor: gold-painted cherub dolls grin creepily, hanging out among old tires and bicycle wheels.

, Ted’s Collision (537 College St.) The best bar left on College, a house of refuge amid the dross. Ted’s Collision is a great place to drink, but staff, we have a tip for you: We are smart enough to carry on conversations, and we like the company, so lower the music. It’s too loud and you’re driving people away.

, Sweaty Betty’s (13 Ossington St.) A little hole-in-the-wall that serves imported absinthe, sake martinis, and Cheez Whiz on toast. Get falling-down drunk and then wander over to a Vietnamese “karaoke bar” and puke on one of their couches. That goes over really well. They love that.

, How about the name? Hippies founded it in the 60s (OK, maybe a bit later but the myth shall live on). It’s family run. The jewelry is one-of-a-kind. Their cat loves to be petted. This is a bit more than just a shop: it’s the closest thing we will ever get to that better time. And go for a wander around Kensington, there are a lot of other great vintage shops in there like Flashback and Dancing Days.

,, A neighbourhood used as the backdrop of several Hollywood films. Check out some local art and have a pint at the Mill Street Brew Pub or a latte at Balzac's Coffee shop.

, (231 Queens Quay West Toronto) - The Power Plant has three major exhibition galleries and smaller, adjacent indoor and outdoor sites which lend themselves to virtually any presentation circumstance. The interior of The Power Plant is comprised of three major gallery spaces.

, - Cosmopolitan Toronto Hotel - A serviced apartment, with kitchens and everything. You'll feel right at home. Another cool thing was the quietness of the hotel. It's tucked in a small street by Yonge and Bay. So, even though you know you are a block away from everything, it's quiet.

, - Kensington Market - Crammed with everything from a cheese store with every imaginable variety (and a few others) to handmade crafts straight out of Nepal to vintage clothing to authentic Jamaican fish vendors, Kensington showcases Toronto's many diverse cultures.

, - The Toronto International Film Festival is the biggest film festival in North America and second to Cannes worldwide. Head to restaurants like Bistro 990, Pangaea Restaurant, Sotto Sotto and the Four Seasons Hotel and see an overwhelming number of stars.

, This downtown location is one of three large Chinese communities in Toronto. Dundas Street West from University Avenue to Spadina Avenue and north to College Street are the boundaries of Chinatown. As the Chinese community has grown, it has extended along Dundas Street and north along Spadina Avenue. Here you'll see a fascinating mixture of old and new. Hole-in-the-wall restaurants share the sidewalks with glitzy shopping centers built with Hong Kong money.

, - CN Tower - As you approach the city, whether by plane, train, or automobile, the first thing you notice is this slender structure. Glass-walled elevators glide up the 553m (1,815-ft.) tower, the second tallest freestanding structure in the world. The elevators stop first at the 346m-high (1,136-ft.) Look Out level. (It takes just 58 seconds, so prepare for popping ears.)

, No food review would be complete without mentioning Little Italy. With the highest Italian population outside of Italy the possibilities are endless, although you might want to start at The Sicilian Café for unparalleled gelatos and tiramisu.

, To avoid the frustrations of driving in congested traffic and paying high parking costs, take advantage of Vancouver's public transit system which includes the elevated SkyTrain System and the Seabus. This is an inexpensive way to get around and you will get to see a panorama of Vancouver and its array of suburbs.


Before boarding the Skytrain you must purchase a fare ticket called a Compass Card. They are a disposable card with an NFC chip that allows riders to ""tap in and out"" of fare paid zones in Skytrain stations. Compass ticket vending machines are located at the entrance of every Skytrain, as well as at the Tsawwassan Bay ferry terminal.
Public transit is divided into 3 zones, and if you travel through 2 or more of these zones, the fare increases. All bus routes are considered a 1 zone fare.
Single fare tickets range from 1 Zone- $1.75, 2 Zone- $2.75 and 3 Zone- $3.75 CAD and are valid for 90 minutes from time of purchase.
If using the Skytrain to sightsee, consider purchasing an all day pass. They are generally a better deal as they cost $9.75 CAD and are valid all day.

, Plan an overnight trip from Vancouver to Victoria. Take a break from Vancouver's bustling metropolis and relax in Canada's Prettiest City. Victoria is home to many beautiful parks including the famous Butchart Gardens and BC's historic Parliament Buildings, home of the Provencal legislative assembly.

The LLC's name should be unique and not easily confused with any existing company name. Be aware that certain terms, such as ""bank,"" ""credit union,"" ""mortgage,"" or ""trust"" are restricted terms, and will not be allowed for use in your LLC's name.You should check with the Tennessee Secretary of State business name database to find out if your LLC name is available.
It's a good idea to file an Application for Reservation of Limited Liability Company Name (Form ss-4228) with the Tennessee Secretary of State. The reservation is good for four months from the filing date, and there is a $20 fee for the reservation.
Check to see if the business's name can be made into a URL so that you can make a website for your LLC. If the URL is already being used by another company, consider making an alteration in your company's name.;
, The registered agent for your LLC is an individual or a business that agrees to be the LLC's legal representative in the state of Tennessee. If you desire your business operations to be anonymous, or if you live in another state, hiring a representative to be your registered agent is necessary.You may serve as the registered agent for your own LLC.
The registered agent must have a physical street address in Tennessee, and be licensed to operate business in the state.
The registered agent agrees to accept papers on the LLC's behalf if it's ever sued.

, You can either organize an LLC by yourself, or you can hire a lawyer or a legal firm to do this for you. There are benefits to both approaches. Making your own business arrangements is less expensive, but more time-consuming. If you don't file the proper paperwork, you may end up paying more in the long run. Hiring a legal firm ensures that all paperwork is properly arranged. However, they are likely to use standardized documents that don't fit with your specific business needs.Legal support comes in a range of pay grades, with less expensive options being more standardized. More experienced firms may cost more, but allow for greater individualization within the paperwork.
Expect to pay $500–$2,000 for legal fees associated with setting up an LLC.

, You'll need to decide whether your LLC would be best managed by its members, or by appointed managers who may or may not be members in the LLC. Most smaller businesses tend to be member-managed, and single-owner LLCs are almost always member-managed as well. Larger LLCs may opt for appointed managers, whose function is purely administrative. Manager-managed LLCs are more complex, as managers must follow voting rules and other procedural formats.If your LLC is opting for appointed managers, consider how many managers would be optimal. One manager is likely sufficient for a smaller business, while larger LLCs may benefit from a larger team.
Appointing an odd number of managers helps decrease the likeliness of a voting tie.
You can change your structure at any time, but you'll need to establish an initial management structure prior to filing the articles of organization.

, These documents include the LLC's legal name and address, the name and street address of the registered agent, and whether the LLC will be member-managed or managed by a representative-managed. If the LLC is not intended to be an ongoing agreement, the length of time you anticipate the LLC existing should be specified in the articles of incorporation.The articles may be filed online or by mail. There is a $50 fee per LLC member.
The minimum filing fee is $300; the maximum filing fee is $3000.
Expect processing time of three to five business days. There is no expedited service available for the articles of incorporation.

, It isn't required to create an operating agreement to form an LLC in the state of Tennessee, but it's recommended if you have more than one member. The operating agreement states the obligations and responsibilities of all LLC members in regards to the LLC. It structures the company's financial and functional decisions.There's no need to file the operating agreement with the articles of incorporation.
Because of the complex nature of some operating agreements, you may wish to consider hiring a lawyer to help you with this process.

, The FEIN, or the Federal Employee Identification Number, is a unique identification number for tax purposes, like a social security number.If your LLC has more than one member, you must obtain an IRS Employer Identification Number (EIN). Even if your LLC it has no employees, you will require this tax number. If your LLC has only one member, you must obtain an FEIN for it only if it will have employees or if you choose to pay taxes as a corporation instead of a sole proprietorship.Complete an online FEIN application on the IRS website to get your FEIN number.
There is no filing fee for an FEIN.

, All Tennessee companies are required to file with the Tennessee Department of Revenue. Most LLCs are required to pay business tax and sales tax. You'll need to register for state taxes if you have employees or if you're selling a product within the state of Tennessee that will require sales tax.You can file your registration with the Tennessee Department of Revenue either online or by mail.
Particular counties or cities within the state of Tennessee may require additional taxes.

, The annual report of an LLC should be submitted no later than April 15. The report is meant to keep information updated with the state, including the LLC's name, physical address, and details of the services provided. An authorized member, officer, or partner may file, and original signatures are not required.There is a $300 minimum fee fore your annual report. The fee is $50 per member with a maximum of $3,000, plus an optional $8.25 fee for filing online.
Send your annual report to the Tennessee Secretary of State, or use the online filing method.

, The state of Tennessee requires all businesses located within the state to pay annual taxes on the value of the LLC. The minimum franchise tax payment is $100. The excise tax is basically an income tax rate of 6.5% on the LLC's federal tax earnings.Franchise and excise Taxes are due on April 15 of every year. All franchise and excise taxes must be paid electronically.
You may register electronically at the Department of Revenue’s Online Tax Registration page. There is a seven to 10 business day turnaround time for this registration.

, Depending on the particular nature of the LLC and where it's located, there may be additional licensing and permit requirements for your LLC. For example, you may be required to apply for permits through the health department (for restaurants, food service, grocery, etc.) You may have to get a permit for signage, or construction permits to set up your LLC business location.Contact your city or county government for more information regarding local business licenses and permits.
Allow time for permits to be issued. Allowing commercial transactions to take place without the coverage of a permit may result in fees.

, If your LLC will have five employees or more, you are required to offer worker's compensation insurance for your employees. If your LLC provides services in the construction business or trades, no matter how many employees, you must provide worker's compensation.If you are an employer in the coal-mining industry, you must have worker's comp if you have one employee.
If you have trouble finding the required insurance coverage for your employees, contact the National Council on Compensation Insurance (NCCI) at 800-622-4123.

Be aware of upfront fees when visiting Zion National Park.,
Get information about sights and activities at Zion National Park.,
Decide what you most want to see and do at the park.,
Decide the best time for you to visit.,
Make any necessary reservations.,
Choose the means of travel that works best for you.,
Pack and dress right for the trip.",How to Enjoy Zion National Park," Each person or group who enters Zion National Park has to purchase a recreational use pass; rates vary according to the type of vehicle you travel through the park in. Passes are good for a week, although annual and lifetime senior passes (age 62 and over) are also available. If you can time your visit to the third week in September, you can enter the park for free, as fees are waived then in recognition of Public Lands Day; there may be other days from year to year when Zion's pass fees are waived. Other charges, as described below, are not exempted when the pass fees are waived, however.


You'll also need a backcountry permit to camp overnight and to hike through certain areas of the park, such as Kolob Creek, the Left Fork of North Creek and any canyon requiring special equipment to navigate.
If your vehicle is wider than 7 feet, 10 inches (2.4 meters) and taller than 11 feet, 4 inches (3.5 meters), you'll have to pay a $15 fee for an escort to guide your vehicle through the Zion-Mt. Carmel tunnel. This fee gets you 2 trips through the tunnel within a 7-day period. (You can avoid this fee by entering and exiting via the park's south entrance near Springdale.)
Pass and use fees are part of the Federal Recreation Lands Enhancement Act. Zion keeps 80 percent of the fees it collects to maintain and update its facilities, while the other 20 percent goes to an account covering parks that don't charge fees.;
, The U.S. National Park Service Web site has pages devoted to each of its national parks, including Zion. The Zion National Park home page is http://www.nps.gov/zion/index.htm; you can obtain PDF brochures about various facets of the park at http://www.nps.gov/zion/planyourvisit/brochures.htm.

, Zion National Park offers a number of natural wonders, a selection of wildlife and trails of varying length to view it all.


Zion's main canyon, Zion Canyon (or Zion Narrows), is a slot canyon with 3000-foot-tall (914-meter-tall) walls carved by the Virgin River. You can drive or take a shuttle from the Zion Canyon Visitor Center or hike the 16-mile-long (25.6-kilometer-long) Zion Narrows Trail. Adjacent to this canyon is Orderville Canyon, with a prominent series of waterfalls. Experienced climbers can climb their way into Orderville from the top or tackle the 2,000-foot (609-meter) cliff walls found elsewhere in the park.
Other trails besides Zion Narrows Trail include Angels Landing, Weeping Rock Trail and Riverside Walk. The Pa'rus Trail is a paved trail designed for both bicyclists and visitors who wish to walk with their pets; it passes near Zion Canyon. Guide horseback trips are also available between the months of March and October.
Zion National Park is home to a variety of wildlife, including 207 bird species and a number of wildflowers. Park rangers lead shuttle tours and guided hikes and give talks at Watchman Campground and Zion Lodge about the natural and human history of the park.

, Zion National Park is open year-round, although some parts of the park, such as the Backcountry Desk and the Human History Museum are closed for part of the year. The Zion Canyon and Kolob Canyon Visitor Centers are closed Christmas Day, and the Zion Canyon Shuttle operates only from late March through late October.


You can view a schedule of events at http://www.nps.gov/zion/planyourvisit/events.htm.


, While not required, reservations are recommended if you wish to stay at Zion Lodge, take a guided tour on horseback or obtain a backcountry permit.

, Most people visit Zion National Park by car, motorcycle or recreational vehicle, taking either Interstate 15 to reach the west entrance or U.S. Highway 89 to approach from the east. Either connects with State Highway 9, which traverses the park as the Zion-Mt. Carmel Highway. If you choose to fly in, you'll need to land at either the airport in St. George, 46 miles (74 kilometers) away or Las Vegas International Airport, 150 miles (240 kilometers) away and rent a vehicle.

, Zion National Park offers a wide range of weather conditions. Spring offers a number of stormy, wet days, while summer temperatures can reach 95 to 110 degrees Fahrenheit (35 to 43 degrees Celsius) during the day. Fall and winter are fairly mild, with light snow in the lower elevations and heavier snow in the upper elevations. Winter temperatures may get as low as 60 degrees (16 degrees Celsius), requiring you to pack a variety of clothes and dress in layers.

The amount of time you spend will be determined by your budget and what other activities you've planned for your trip.;
, The U.S. National Park Service Web site has pages devoted to all its national parks, including Glacier. The Glacier National Park home page is http://www.nps.gov/glac/index.htm; you can obtain PDF brochures about various aspects of the park at http://www.nps.gov/glac/planyourvisit/brochures.htm.


If you need more information about the park and its activities once you arrive, you can visit one of the bookstores run by the Glacier Natural History Association for their selection of books and maps. The bookstores are at the Apgar, St. Mary and Logan Pass Visitor Centers, as well as the Many Glacier Ranger Station.

, As noted earlier, Glacier National Park offers a mixture of sightseeing, outdoor and history-related activities. The National Park Service has stationed webcams at several locations around the park, allowing you to view several areas you may wish to see in person when you visit. The webcam images can be viewed at http://www.nps.gov/glac/photosmultimedia/webcams.htm.


Glacier National Park has over 200 lakes and rivers, several of which feature boat rentals and tours. Its two largest lakes are located adjacent to the park's main road, Going-to-the-Sun Road, which also crosses the Continental Divide and features a number of scenic stops along its 50-mile-long (80-kilometer-long) route.
The Logan Pass Visitor Center offers an exhibit on mountain ecology, which can be seen along the park's 700-plus miles (1120-plus kilometers) of hiking trails, many of which can be used for cross-country skiing or snowshoeing in the winter. One trail, the Trail of the Cedars, is equipped for wheelchair access. Current trail information is available onsite from the Many Glacier Ranger Station and in advance by mail. Guided backpacking and day trips are available, as are guided horseback trips at Many Glacier, West Glacier and Lake McDonald.
Glacier National Park was originally home to the Blackfoot and Kootenai Indians. Members of those tribes, along with the Salish, present campfire talks about their tribal history, and the East Glacier and St. Mary Lodge each serve as starting point for tours by van of Blackfoot culture.

, Glacier National Park is open year-round, but the main tourist season is from around Memorial Day through Labor Day weekend. After that time, facilities begin shutting down for the winter, although the St. Mary Visitor Center stays open until mid-October and the Apgar Visitor Center remains open until mid-December. Lake McDonald Lodge remains open year-round, with the road between it and park headquarters maintained throughout the winter.


You can view a schedule of events at http://www.nps.gov/glac/planyourvisit/events.htm.


, Lodging for Glacier National Park starts filling early in the year, with reservations starting as early as September of the previous year. You can book ahead more than a year in advance if you wish, or you can check to see what's available just before your trip, although doing so may mean staying in several different lodges over the course of your trip.

, While many people drive to Glacier National Park, you can also visit by airplane or train if you wish. You can fly to either Kalispell, 30 miles (48 kilometers) away, or Missoula, 150 miles (240 kilometers) away, rent a car at the airport and go to the park's west entrance, or to Great Falls, and take a rental car to one the park's east entrances, a distance of up to 165 miles (264 kilometers). You can travel by Amtrak train to either East Glacier or West Glacier and use the shuttle service to get to the park. (A shuttle is also available from the Kalispell Airport.)

, Glacier National Park's varied landscape also means a variety of weather conditions. Valleys can reach temperatures of 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 degrees Celsius) in the summer, with mountainous areas up to 15 degrees (8 Celsius degrees) cooler above the treeline. Nighttime temperatures can plummet to 20 degrees, however, and snow can fall even in summer months. The east side of the park is noted for strong winds. You'll want to bring clothes for a variety of weather conditions and dress in layers while you're there.

Look for suitable accommodations.,
Be aware that the facilities are located at the top of the mountain rather than at the base.,
Select your skiing area.",How to Enjoy a Weekend Skiing at Snowshoe Mountain West Virginia," There are places for rent around the area, including houses.;
, This makes using the resort supplied maps a bit confusing, since the trail maps and the resort maps are depicted from different perspectives. Further complicating matters is that the resort features slopes on three different faces of the mountain including two faces that are directly opposite each other. That is just difficult to express on the map.

, As mentioned, Snowshoe is really three different skiing areas. The main section has the bulk of the runs. It has a few long blue and black runs but the majority of the area is either green or short black/blue runs that empty into greens at the bottom of the hill.


The Widow Maker run - this is at the far extreme left of the resort. Its remote location keeps the lift lines very reasonable all day.
The Western Territory - this is located across the street from the main area. This is the place for the most technically challenging skiing that the resort has to offer. It only features two 1.5 mile (2.4 km) runs, both black (with one containing a double black section at the bottom). Get there early to avoid the crowds.
The last area is called Silver Creek - this is accessible via a short, free shuttle bus ride away. This is the section of the resort that features night skiing, the main terrain park and snow tubing. Tucked away in the back are two very nice black runs. One of which can prove to be a favorite run for beginners and those who are uncertain on their feet, since it isn't too steep. It is especially good when it has some nice soft powder. The lines here do not tend to be long.

This is an official government document that grants you permission to be in Canada. There are quite a few different visa classifications, which you must review online via Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC).When searching for the right visa for you, you will need to assess your own career skills, qualifications, experience, and employment history and match those with the proper visa.;
, The most popular visa program used by immigrants is the Temporary Foreign Worker Program. This employer-sponsored visa is used by Canadian employers who need to fill open positions at their companies after being unable to secure these employees locally.


This program will get you a temporary visa and you must be hired for a Canadian job before you are able to get it. Visit the CIC website to explore the resources currently available.
This type of visa will expire after 4 years unless your employer renews it. If you change jobs during that 4 year period, your new employer will have to go through the CIC and be accepted as an official sponsor for you., If you land a job in Canada through the Temporary Foreign Worker Program, you should immediately arrange a start date with your new employer so that you can then plan your move around that date.


You will need to give yourself plenty of time to settle your affairs at home, get moved, and get situated in Canada upon arrival.
Find out from your new employer if you will need a Labor Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) for your new position. Your employer is responsible for taking care of that for you, but it’s good to know beforehand whether or not it’s required., Once you’ve decided on a visa program, apply for it immediately so that you can get the application process started. In most cases, the process takes anywhere from 2 to 15 days.However, if you are denied the visa and are forced to apply for a different one in another classification, this extends to process.

, Canadian employers will want to see your most current resume before they consider hiring you, which is a standard practice. If you already know what kinds of jobs you’ll be applying for, gear your updated resume toward that field.


If you’re exploring the job market via the Temporary Foreign Worker Program, gear your resume toward the postings that interest you.
Include information about when you are able to start working in Canada on your resume.

, Doing this will make it easier for you to find a job in your particular profession or trade in Canada. Typical trade qualifications are available in fields such as engineering, construction, metalwork, electrical and catering (to name a few).


Contact the Canadian Information Center for International Credentials (CICIC) for more information and to get the ball rolling.

, Most people prefer to find employment in Canada before moving there, but this is not required. However, in either instance you should get a feel for what sorts of jobs are available in your field by doing online research. Working Abroad is an organization that can help you with this.


Working Abroad posts current available job listings on their website, which makes it very simple for you to apply for jobs directly.
They also hold expos and exhibitions where you can meet employers in person and apply for jobs. Contact Working Abroad for more information., Some job categories require a work permit in Canada, and some don’t. CIC provides a listing of job categories that don’t require a work permit on their website, along with many other helpful tools to get your employment situation organized.If your particular job category requires a work permit, go ahead and apply for it. You can do this through CIC’s website.If you don’t see your particular field listed on their website, chances are you will need a work permit.

, Once you’re ready to start planning your move to Canada, create a budget for yourself to ensure you will have the amount of money you need to work and live there. Start investigating housing options and costs, research the cost of living in Canada, and whatever other relevant information particular to you. This budget will provide a financial roadmap for navigating your move to Canada.

, If you want to buy a home in Canada, that will take time. You will need to be in the country to search for homes. Most new Canadian immigrants either arrange temporary housing prior to arrival, or they search for and rent property/an apartment prior to arrival.Check out the area you want to live in to get started. If you’ve found a job already, then look for places to live close to that.
Other things to consider when looking for places remotely are what you can feasibly afford and what matches your preferred lifestyle.
CIC is a good resource for assistance with this, as well as other online resources that will allow you to view places and make living arrangements online.

, Once you’re settled in Canada for a time, you may or may not want to actually purchase a home there. If you do, you must establish a good credit history in Canada first.Once you’ve done that, start looking!

, Are you moving to Canada for an extended period? If so, you’ll probably want your belongings, pets, and possibly even your car shipped to Canada. When you move, you likely won’t be moving right into your permanent Canadian residence, so storing and shipping your belongings later is probably the best option.


Visit CIC’s website for more information about Canada’s international shipping guidelines, restrictions and requirements.

, In anticipation of passport processing times, apply for your passport as soon as possible. Passport applications can be completed online and printed, or you can obtain one from a United States post office that has passport acceptance services.


If you already have a passport but it will expire while you are working in Canada, go ahead and update it before you leave to avoid any future headaches. Many people move to Canada with a 4 year visa, so keep that in mind when reviewing yours.
If you need to expedite your passport, you can request and pay for a faster application processing service.
If you have family moving with you to Canada, make sure to get their passports and documents arranged, too.

, You can do this several months before you move to Canada. In fact, doing so is recommended, so you can start building a good credit rating there. To get started, contact the local bank to your future province in Canada.These banks can even have new debit cards waiting for you when you arrive in Canada and they can help you with transferring your funds from your current country to your new Canadian bank account.

, Before moving from your home country, don’t forget to close down all of your open accounts, including your internet provider services, electricity and other utilities, and whatever else you may have open.


Don’t forget to cancel your current subscriptions and arrange to have your mail forwarded to your new address before you leave.

, Start making your travel arrangements as soon as you are able to. If you plan to fly, there are airlines that offer discounted one-way air fare for people moving to Canada, so look into that possibility. The decision will be made based on what type of visa you’ve secured.If you’re driving, start planning your route, research which check point you will go through when crossing the border, and begin making preparations to get through border patrol smoothly. You can obtain this information through CIC’s website.

, This is required in order for you to receive an income in Canada, so do this as soon as you possibly can upon arriving.This number also enables you to receive government programs and benefits, including taxes. Find a Service Canada office or check out their website to apply for your SIN.If you’ve lived and/or worked in Canada before, you already have a SIN. This number will not change.
Generally, only one SIN is issued and it’s assigned to you for life, much like a Social Security Number is in America.

, Canada offers both public and private healthcare options.Each Canadian province has its own health department, but there is also a national service available there called Medicare (not to be confused with Medicare services of America).


Get more information from your particular provincial and territorial ministry of health website.
These websites can also help you determine your healthcare eligibility and provide important contact information.

, Your home country driver’s license will be valid in Canada for a few months after you arrive, but you should arrange to get your Canadian driver’s license as soon as possible. These licenses are issued through provincial and territorial departments and are valid in all provinces of Canada.If you do plan to use your home country driver’s license when you arrive in Canada, obtain an International Driver’s Permit (IDP) before you move.
An IDP will translate your current license into French and English (Canada’s two main languages).

, Canadian law states that all children under the age of 15 must be enrolled in school, so if you have children, enroll them at their new school as soon as possible. You can visit CIC’s website for a listing of schools nearest your new Canadian address.

, In anticipation of passport processing times, apply for your passport several months before your trip. Passport applications can be completed online and printed, or you can obtain one from a United States post office that has passport acceptance services.If you need to expedite your passport, you can request and pay for a faster application processing service.
You can only complete your passport application online and then print it out for submission. You currently cannot apply for a passport online.

, Children aged 15 years or younger can cross by presenting proof of citizenship, such as a U.S. birth certificate, without a photo ID. The same goes for children aged 16-18 years old who are traveling with an organized school or other youth group (including religious youth groups).Valid proofs of citizenship for minors are a U.S. birth certificate (original, photocopy, or certified copy), a U.S. consular report of birth abroad, and a Certificate of U.S. Naturalization.
Children (under 18) traveling without both parents should carry a parental consent letter. Ideally, this letter should be notarized.

, Dogs and cats that are older than three months will need signed and dated rabies vaccination certificates from a veterinarian. These certificates are usually valid for 1-3 years after obtaining them.


Service dogs are exempt from these rules as long as they are accompanied by their owners.
The rules about crossing with pets other than cats and dogs vary. Contact CFIA for details prior to your trip., The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) can deny you entry if they have a reason to doubt your ability to support yourself or your dependents while you are in Canada.You can reduce these financial doubts by carrying specific documents with you when crossing the border:


Proof of finances (i.e. bank statements);
Income tax records (past and present);
Evidence of current employment (i.e. pay stubs, an employment ID, notarized letter from your employer);

, You may be asked to provide evidence that you have responsibilities that will guarantee your return to your home country. Examples of these responsibilities are having a permanent job, home, financial assets or family in your home country. Documents that will serve this purpose are:


Proof of current residence, including recent proof of rent payments, copies of your mortgage and utility bills;
Proof of your planned departure from Canada (i.e. an airline or other travel ticket that states the time and date you plan to leave);
Information about where you plan to go while in Canada, including but not limited to the address, telephone number, and which Canadian citizen you are visiting (if applicable).

, Civil traffic violations (such as speeding tickets) and other minor infractions (such as parking violations or littering fines) are exempted.


DUI and DWI offenses that may be considered misdemeanors in the Unites States are considered serious offenses in Canada and you can be denied entry for them.
If you’ve been convicted of a felony in the past, you will be prevented entry into Canada unless you've received a pardon, been accepted for rehabilitation and deemed rehabilitated.Individuals with a past criminal conviction are allowed to cross the border as long as conviction has been expunged, but make sure you have paperwork or a letter from an attorney on hand to prove it.

, This will be determined on-site simply by observing how you look when you cross the border. If you are observed to be in a condition that is likely to endanger public health and safety, or if it will cause you to over-utilize Canada’s health or social services, you will be considered inadmissible on health grounds., There is no limit to how much money you can bring into or take out of Canada. However, if you are carrying more than $10,000 USD (or the equivalent in foreign currency), you will need to declare that to the border officer upon crossing.


The penalties for non-compliance can be severe and very expensive.
Travelers' checks and money orders that exceed that limit must also be declared., Canada’s firearm laws are very different than those of the Unites States. If you must bring them, declare and provide documentation for them to the border officer. Failure to declare them will result in seizure of the firearms and possibly even criminal charges.If you are carrying a weapon that is illegal in Canada, it will be seized at the border. Most weapons, including tasers, will not be allowed to enter Canada.
Expect additional delays and inspections if you bring firearms.

, By law, these items must be declared before you cross the border. This includes products that are made from plant or animal matter., The CBSA collects duty and taxes on imported goods. These fees can vary wildly from product to product, so the best course of action is to consult the Canada Border Service Agency’s website for information. They also provide a Duty and Taxes Estimator that you can use so that you will know what to expect when you get to the border.


Small children and infants are entitled to a personal exemption as long as a parent or guardian can make a declaration to the CBSA for a child. The goods you are declaring must be for the child's use.
Have your purchases and your receipts readily available when you attempt to cross the border and expect to be asked questions about them.

However, you can't just pack up your belongings, scale the Niagara, plop down, and start counting the days (unfortunately, the government frowns on that). After your tourist visa is up (6 months), you'll need to have some sort of work/school permit (or be married to a Canadian) to stay on that side of the Commonwealth.


Apply for whatever you qualify for while you're still in your home country. Often the processing takes practically forever. The sooner you start, the better. You will receive 1/2 credit for every day you live in Canada prior to becoming a permanent resident, for the record.;
, After all the paperwork is completed, move to Canada! If all your ducks are in a row, this won't be an issue. You can now worry about the finer things, like getting a moving van and signing a lease. Be prepared to show all types of ID and proof of your current legal residency status -- otherwise everything you're doing is illegal.

, That's what the Permanent Resident Card is informally known as. If you're on a student visa or a working visa or some other type that allows you in Canada for a specific amount of time, you'll need to upgrade. Your Maple Leaf Card will let you stay in Canada for an indefinite amount of time.


There's obviously necessary paperwork to fill out, fees to pay, and time to wait when it comes to this. It's also a mandatory step -- you cannot go from staying in Canada on a temporary visa to becoming a citizen. Visit Canada's citizenship and immigration website for official information.

, Once you're a permanent resident, you need to be able to prove that you've been in Canada for 1,460 days out of the past 6 years (that's 4 years). It does not have to be 1,460 consecutive days. So long as you're there for 4 out of the past 6 years, you're good to go. And yes, they will look at your passport, deciphering it until the moose come home.


As stated previously, you'll receive 1/2 a day's credit for every day spent in Canada prior to becoming a permanent resident. All the more reason to get on establishing your residency!
This 4 year rule does not apply to those under the age of 18., This is a requirement to becoming a Canadian citizen, as most of the residents in Canada speak at least one these languages fluently. When the time for the citizenship test rolls around, you will be given an oral exam. If you don't pass, you won't become a citizen. Don't worry about specific knowledge -- they're mainly concerned with everyday conversations and the abliity to express yourself.If English or French isn't your native tongue (or close to it), Canada's immigration website has a list of documents it will accept as proof that you meet the language requirement.These will be required as part of your citizenship application.

, If Canada has ordered you to leave their country, that's a good sign that you won't get citizenship status. What's more, your criminal record may not allow you to become a citizen. If you have been to prison or if you are on probation in the 3 years prior to when you want to become a citizen, you are not eligible.However, once your record is clean, you will be able to reapply for citizenship.


You cannot be deemed a ""security risk"" or otherwise criminally prohibited.You cannot be currently getting investigated or convicted of a criminal offense.Basically, stay away from mishaps with the law and you'll be fine.

, After all, why wouldn't you? Part of the test to become a citizen is demonstrating how well you know Canada. When you apply, they'll send you a booklet (more on that in a bit), but you can get the ball rolling yourself. Everything you need to know is on the Internet.


Apart from Wayne Gretsky, Justin Bieber, Jim Carrey, maple syrup, beavers, hockey, (of course if Canada was gone/there'd be no more) Celine Dion, beer, mounties, and bacon, we've also Canada to thank for Trivial Pursuit, the TV, the telephone, the zipper, basketball, and the electron microscope. We should all practically revere Canada -- did we mention the free healthcare and not-shut-down government?
All stereotypes aside, you really do have to know Canadian history. This includes their values, institutions, and symbols.To get more specific, visit their website -- there's a pretty complete list of what you'll need to cover, from the economy, to their regions, to how they govern themselves (the Queen is really, really far away)., As soon as the application is downloaded, begin filling it out. Make sure you read the instructions that come with the application so you are sure you fill it out correctly the first time.


Included in the application packet is a document checklist. Be sure you have everything you need and in the right format. Fair warning: it's an extensive checklist. If you do not fill out everything correctly and include everything you need, it will get sent back to you.You will get very frustrated if this happens and it's very easy to avoid -- so read everything thoroughly.

, In general, the citizenship office is not looking for originals. If you send originals, you will not have them when you need them for the actual interview.Grab that document checklist and make sure you have everything. And in case something goes wrong, make photocopies of your photocopies.


You'll need photocopies of transcripts, school records, travel records, your Maple Leaf Card, your ID card, and proof of language evidence, in case you were curious.

, These fees will be listed in the instruction manual. The application fees are non-refundable and the fees have to be paid each time you apply for Canadian citizenship at the same time you send in your application. As of 2013, the total fees for one adult were $200 CAD -- and it must be paid in Canadian currency.It is preferred that you complete this online (with your application). However, you can also pay the fees at a financial institution in Canada. If you choose the in-person method, you will need to fill out a payment receipt form (IMM 5401). The cashier will handle the brunt of this. The half you receive back should be filled out and attached to your application.

, Make sure you have two photographs taken that meet these requirements. Sign your name at the bottom of each photograph and attach these with a paperclip to your citizenship application.

, Do one more once-over; do you have everything you need? If so, you can mail it to the address given in the application instruction manual. The address is:


Case Processing Centre – Sydney
Grant Adults
P.O. Box 7000
SYDNEY, NS
B1P 6V6

If you're mailing it by courier, the address is:
Case Processing Centre, Sydney
Grant Adults
49 Dorchester Street
Sydney, Nova Scotia
B1P 5Z2

, This booklet will be sent to you once your application is received by the proper authorities. However, there's also a PDF online and an audio version as read by famous Canadians.They've thought of everything.


On the citizenship test, there will be questions about Canada's political system, geography and history, and you will have to pass this test in order to be a Canadian citizen. This booklet covers all of that.

The audio version comes in English and French, and, unfortunately, isn't read by Howie Mandel, Leonhard Cohen, or Avril Lavigne.



, As with most things, this takes time. The CPC sends your application to the CIC nearest you to ensure the speediest delivery. You may be asked to come into the office to review your documents -- this is entirely routine. Bring your original documents with you.


From the point they receive your application and you become a citizen, it currently is estimated to take 25 months. If your application is incomplete or there are other problems, it is estimated to take 35 months.If you don't receive word back automatically, don't fret. Good things come to those who wait.

, After your application begins processing, you'll receive a ""Notice to Appear"" for your interview. Appear at the appropriate time and place that your Notice to Appear states, take your citizenship test and complete your citizenship interview. Your interview will basically be the same as the test questions, just asked orally.


If you don't speak English or French as your native tongue, this will also serve as your language assessment. A judge will determine whether or not your skills are up to par.

, This, too, will be notified to you by mail. It will also state where and when to be at the designated place (the location is determined by your place of residence). Receiving this notice means you have passed your written citizenship test and interview. Woohoo, eh?


You will receive your Certificate of Canadian Citizenship at the ceremony. So don't miss it! After all the hoops you've jumped through, this is it! All you have to do is appear, take your oath, and you're in for good. Time to eat some poutine!

, You either now have dual citizenship or are looking to renounce your original citizenship. If you're American transitioning to certifiable Canadian, that fee is $450, amongst other things like piles of paperwork.Along with fees, there are other things to consider:


If you do have dual citizenship, there are benefits and disadvantages. Make sure you're up to snuff on the legal requirements -- you don't want to viewed as a tax or military draft evader.The requirements vary by country, so do your research.
If you do renounce your original citizenship, it's not something you can get back easily. This is not something to jump to -- make sure your 110% positive this is the track you want to take.

Don't rule out flying into an airport within the United States.","How to Get to Montreal, Canada1"," Pierre-Elliott Trudeau International Airport, located just southwest of the city, is the largest commercial airport in the area and the main thoroughfare for air travelers. Many established airlines fly here, such as Air Canada or United, but you may find better deals on smaller low-cost airlines.;

Go mini-golfing.,
Visit the Isle of Wight.,
If you enjoy fishing, book a charter trip.,
Visit the historic Berlin neighborhood, filming location for the movie Runaway Bride.,
Spend a day at the beach!","How to Enjoy a Vacation in Ocean City, Maryland"," Make reservations well in advance if possible, as the centrally located hotels are often sold out at peak times of the year (holidays, summertime, etc.) Hotels are much more expensive on the Island itself, so try searching for hotels around the Berlin or West Ocean City neighborhoods, as they are much more affordable but still close to the action.


Alternatively, consider booking a condo or timeshare for your vacation. There are hundreds of condominiums along the Island that often rent units by the night or week, and almost all of them are much larger and cost the same or less than a hotel room.





;
, Consider purchasing a pass for the day. You will find a much less crowded beach here than on the Island, and there are more water activities permitted, including surfing, skim-boarding, cookouts, and kayaking. You also will want to spot the Wild Horses (Ponies) and Sikka Elk (deer) that are native to the area. Assateague Island National Park also boasts walking and biking trails, nature walks, museums, beached shipwrecks, organized Ranger activities, camping sites, fishing and crabbing areas, and an off-road section which are great for recreational activities.


Keep in mind that Assateague isn't residentially populated. There are no restaurants, hotels, or the like on the island. There is a store where fast food is available for purchase, but this may be far away from where you are swimming. Packing your own picnic lunch is recommended.







, The boardwalk is approximately 2.5 miles (4.0 km) long, ending at 27th street, and is an excellent place to sight-see and jog by the ocean. There are many shops and restaurants, so bring extra cash to spend. Playgrounds and amusement parks along the beach for kids and families are located here as well. Consider getting dinner at Thrasher's Fries, or even purchase an Old Time Photos album as a memento of your trip.

, Ocean City has dozens of relatively inexpensive mini-golf courses, some with accompanying restaurants and gift shops as well. Ask a local or consult your hotel concierge for directions to the most popular courses.

, You'll find great crabbing and scenery to view, with a nature park.

, Book your tour well in advance, as reservations fill up early in the year. You can also visit the fishing pier for great elevated views and of course, to fish. The fishing pier is located along the inlet.

, There are many small antique shops, cafes, etc. to browse around in as well.

, This may seem obvious, but with so much else to see, you just might forget. Lifeguards are on duty Memorial Day through the end of September, from 10:00 AM to 5:30 PM. It is best to swim during these times, since the beach is guarded, and surfers won't be around.

Move to Alaska.,
Take a second qualifying step.,
Take the second step early.,
Claim Alaskan residency if in the military.,
Preserve the documents that prove you plan to remain in Alaska indefinitely.,
Sever connections to a prior domicile.,
Use your Alaskan residence as your permanent address.,
Do not take any steps “inconsistent” with maintaining residency in Alaska indefinitely.,
Follow rules for allowable absences.,
Seek assistance.,
Continue to live in Alaska for at least 1 year.,
Visit the website.,
Get a hard copy.,
File your application.,
Sign the application.",How to Become an Alaska Resident," To become a resident, you need to be physically present in the state, and you must intend to stay in Alaska indefinitely.;
, Mere physical presence is not enough to establish residency. You also need to take an additional action that shows you intend to make Alaska your permanent home. This second step can include:


signing a contract to move household goods to Alaska. (Employer paid moving contracts do not qualify.)
being employed in Alaska, as proved by employment records.
owning a principal place of residence in Alaska, proved by a home purchase contract or rent receipts. (Employer provided housing does not qualify.)
registering to vote in Alaska.
registering a motor vehicle in Alaska. , If you want to qualify for a PFD, then you must take your second step before January 1 of the year you hope to qualify.


You may register to vote by contacting the Alaska Division of Elections. If registering from within Alaska, you will need to provide a driver’s license, a birth certificate, or some other form of personal identification, such as a passport. If you are registering outside the state, then you will need some document that shows your residency, such as proof of employment in Alaska.
To get an identification card, you will need to take the following documents to the DMV: proof of legal name and date of birth (such as a birth certificate); a secondary document that verifies your first (such as an IRS or state tax form); proof of your principal residence, such as a utility bill or rental documents; a Social Security number; and documents related to a name change (if applicable). Alaska encourages all residents to get an identification card even if they have a driver’s license. ID cards cost $15.

, Service members must formally claim Alaska as their residency with the military, and the paperwork must be processed by December 31 of the year before your qualifying year.


For example, if you want to qualify as a resident for 2016, your paperwork must go through by December 31, 2015.
Service members must also take a second qualifying step before July 1 of their qualifying year. The same steps apply to the military as to the general public: register a vehicle, register to vote, obtain a state driver’s license, or purchase or rent an Alaskan home.
The spouse of a service member must take the second qualifying step before January 1 of the qualifying year.

, You may be required to prove residency, especially if you seek to participate in the Permanent Fund Dividend, which distributes oil revenues to Alaskan residents.


Keep multiple copies of documents in a safe place. A safe deposit box is a great way to preserve records.
If you lose your driver’s license, replace it immediately.

, To be an Alaskan resident, you cannot maintain customary ties to another state. Accordingly, you should not:


Register to vote in another state, even as part of registration drives.
Keep a driver’s license from another state.
Pay income taxes as a resident in another state.

, You may maintain a second home in another state, but be sure not to use that address on any official government forms, such as tax returns.

, Inconsistent steps are those steps establishing customary ties with a state other than Alaska.


If you register a vehicle in another state or register to vote in another state, you are signaling that you do not consider Alaska to be your permanent home.

, All residents may be absent for 180 days for whatever reason.Students and members of the military may be physically out of state for extended periods of time. Alaska allows you to maintain your residence provided you follow rules for allowable absences.


Report absences. You must report all absences over 90 days. Failure to report is considered fraud.
Military personnel may be excused for days in excess of 180 if they are serving on active duty or their spouse is.
Students may qualify for a 120 days in addition to the time claimed for being a student in good standing. The student must be attending school full-time. A narrow exception exists if you are in your final year; you may have one semester below full-time provided you are on track to graduate.
Students and military personnel must spend at least 72 consecutive hours in Alaska every two years. You must have proof of your presence, such as boarding passes with your name on it or sales receipts showing that you made purchases in Alaska over a 72-hour period., If you have questions about maintaining your residency, contact the Dividend Information ofices.

,


You must reside in Alaska for 12 months before you can be considered a legal resident for purposes of the Permanent Fund Dividend.

, You may apply for the Permanent Division Fund at their website. An online application is available January 1.


Each person must fill out an application., If you prefer to fill out a printed application, you may get a copy from any of the distribution centers around the state.

, The deadline is March 31. Be sure to gather proof of filing.If you file online, print off the ""Congratulations!"" page. This contains your PFD confirmation number.
If you mail it, a delivery or proof of mail receipt will suffice.

Ask the recipient how soon they’ll need it.,
Choose a service.,
Complete the transaction.",How to Send Money to Mexico1," If you send cash, you’ll have to find a physical Western Union or Moneygram location. If you’re in a town of even modest size, this shouldn’t be a problem. There are literally thousands of locations for each across the US and in Mexico. However, Western Union’s fees are two dollars lower than Moneygram’s ($8.00 compared to $10.00)., You can send money using credit or debit cards through numerous services. Even many online money transfer companies have cash pickup locations in Mexico. Western Union, Moneygram, Ria, Remitly, and Sharemoney all have cash pickup locations in Mexico, so price is the deciding factor. Remitly, Ria, and Sharemoney all have fees of about $4.00 to send $1000 with a debit card. The fees to send the money with a credit card are substantially higher--$33.00 with Sharemoney and $35.00 with Ria. Remitly doesn’t take credit cards. Western Union and Moneygram, on the other hand charge a $15.00 fee for both credit and debit.

, Sending money via a bank withdrawal is always the cheapest way to send money—companies rarely charge more than $4.00, and most charge a little less.Take note, however: although bank to bank transfers are the cheapest way to transfer money, they also take longer than others.

, Some types of transfers will take longer than other types of transfers. Make sure the person you’re sending the money to doesn’t need it sooner than your chosen method of transfer will allow.All of the money transfer services offer quick transfers if your payment is made with a debit or credit card. If you use a bank account, the transfer will take between three and four business days.

, Choose a service based on the fees and its convenience and proximity to yourself and the recipient.


If you’re unfamiliar with the location where the money will be sent, make sure to ask the recipient if the surrounding area is safe. Just because it’s close by doesn’t mean it’s the best.
Moneygram, Western Union, and Ria all offer a home delivery service. Naturally, it takes longer to have the cash delivered than it does to pick up, but a credit, cash, or debit transfer will still usually arrive the same day., In order to complete the transaction, you’ll need to have the recipient’s first and last name as it appears on their driver’s license or ID, their email or telephone number, and their address. Be sure to take down the transaction number. You’ll need to give it to the recipient so they can complete the pickup.In order to pick the money up, the recipient must show their ID and know the transaction number for the transfer.
You will also be required to set up an account with the transfer company if you send money online. If you plan on sending money with your bank account, you will have to enter your account information and verify the account.

Complete the transfer.",How to Send Money to Mexico2," If you choose to have money deposited directly into the recipient’s bank account, you may send the remittance online or in person. In order to do so, you’ll need your credit card, debit card, or the name and address of your bank, along with your bank account number and routing number.If you wish, you can also go to a physical Western Union or Moneygram location, pay cash, and have it deposited into the recipient’s account.

, Any international monetary transfer requires certain information from the recipient. In order to send money via a bank to bank transfer, you’ll need the recipient’s account information, including their full name, account number, routing number, and the name and address of their bank., Pick a service to use based on location, speed, and price. Deposits into a bank account always take longer than cash pickups, but making the deposit using a debit or credit card is quicker than doing a bank-to-bank transfer (one business day vs. five business days).If you’re sending more than $500, Western Union’s transfers into bank accounts are free. If you are sending less than that, the charge is anywhere from $1.00-$7.00, depending on the amount and form of payment. Remitly never charges for a transfer from your bank account into the recipient’s bank account (no matter the amount), but charges a flat fee of $3.99 for using a debit card. All of the other services charge anywhere from $3.00-$104 depending on the amount sent and the method of payment, with Ria’s fees for credit card payments being the highest.

, Once you’ve picked a service, register for an online account. If you are doing a bank-to-bank transfer, you’ll need to verify your account. The verification process usually involves the company making a small deposit into your account and you confirming the amounts of the deposits. Once you've verified your account, all you need to do is give final approval to the transfer.

Consider the many places that are part of Riviera Maya.,
Choose a hotel.,
Plan to visit Rio Secreto.You can take a guided tour into an underground river with beautiful stalactites and stalagmites.,
Swim with dolphins at Delphinus: Besides the dolphin swim experience you also learn a lot about these animals.,
Xcaret: This eco park (pronounced esh-carette) is near Playa del Carmen (about 30 minutes).You can find some archeological sites, a Mayan village, regional wildlife breeding farms, butterfly pavilion and jaguars and other animals.","How to Enjoy Riviera Maya, Mexico"," Some of them are: Akumal, Playa del Carmen, Tulum, Coba, Contoy Island, Holbox, Puerto Morelos, Sian Ka'an, Cozumel. You arrive at first at Cancún International Airport, approximately 31 miles (50 km) north of Playa del Carmen. Riviera Maya has a lot of all-inclusive resorts and boutique hotels as well.;
, Some hotels are better for couples, without loud music and parties at night, just the beautiful ocean sound at night.

, It's completely safe, you put on a wet suit and hard hat to explore the cave system. You might be underground for about an hour and a half.

, The best part is when dolphins glide you through the water, and the part of the program where you can freely swim with dolphins and pet them.

, There are also inlet with clear waters for snorkeling. But one of the attractions is the underground river (don't worry if you're claustrophobic, it's a big space); but you can also try the open river. The ticket price to the park is a little expensive (but worth it). You can eat at the different restaurants around the park; in the evening starts ""Xcaret Mexico Espectacular"" a Mexican night show, involving Mexico's history, culture and traditional dancing.

Take a free tour of the city.,
Take a surfing or paddle board lesson.,
Walk the Cuale Island.,
Visit Boca de Tomatlan.,
Shop in Pitillal.,
Eat street food.,
Explore.","How to Explore Puerto Vallarta, Mexico"," Puerto Vallarta offers free tours of the main tourist strip from the Malécon and south to the Romantic Zone and Los Muertos Pier. Tours are offered at 9:00 AM on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays. The meeting place is in front of the town's church, Our Lady of Guadalupe, at the visitors' center.


Free Malecón Sculpture tour: The Malecón is the city's boardwalk and serves as a public gallery to dozens of sculptures lining the coast. Every Tuesday a free tour is given of the sculptures to educate visitors on the meanings of each one to the city. The tour begins on the north side of the Malecon in front of the Rosita Hotel, Puerto Vallarta's oldest hotel. Tuesdays at 9:30 AM.;
, Los Muertos Beach is the most popular beach section of Puerto Vallarta offering activites such as surfing, parasailing, jetski, and flyboarding. Most activities do not need reservations, you will find providers setup on the beach ready to give you an adventure of a lifetime on the water.

, The Cuale River serves as an open market but also peaceful rest spot under the shade trees and swinging bridges over the rivers flowing on both sides of the island.


If you buy from vendors on the island, you are expected to haggle for a good deal, otherwise you will be paying top dollar.

, This is the last beach accessible by car in the bay area. It's a great place to get away from the tourist beach, have a great seafood meal with your toes in the sand, and hike along the trails. Some cabin rentals are also available in the area for a night of something new.


This is located about 30 minutes south of Puerto Vallarta's downtown. You can take a taxi or an economical trip south on the orange buses that leave from the Romantic Zone every 15 minutes.

, This is still part of Puerto Vallarta but has its own downtown that has maintained its Mexican roots and less visited by tourists. This is where the locals shop for much lower prices and many vendors selling in downtown Puerto Vallarta are buying their wares here. The area has a lively square with entertainment and great food. This is the closest real authentic Mexican town to Puerto Vallarta.


This is not the tourist zone, you are less likely to meet an English speaker in every shop and restaurant, but that is part of the adventure.

, Don't be scared, street food is a tradition and should be experienced while vacationing anywhere in Mexico. You will find the street food inside the tourist zones may be much cleaner and safer than other areas because they are sensitive to the foreign perception of street food. There are also Street Food Tours that are fun.


Look for the street food stands with a lot of people. See that the person making your food isn't also taking the money.

, Puerto Vallarta is a very safe resort town in Mexico and has been named home of the friendliest people in the world. Using common sense like not walking alone at night and not walking dark unlit roads or carrying large amounts of cash should be practices, just like it should be in every other city in the world. But get out and explore and learn something new about the Mexican culture, there is more than just the sun and beach in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico.

Go to the Amtrak website and view the system map.,
Determine which station is closest to you.,

Plan in advance for lodgings at a hotel/motel or hostel.,
Take a camera.,
Carry on an insulated (soft) lunch box.",How to Circumnavigate the United States in 15 Days on a U.S.A. Rail Pass," This is located at: http://www.amtrak.com Amtrak.


Amtrak travels through almost every state in the continental United States (of America).;
, This will enable you to work out the route from your own area. Consult the available schedules to determine which days your desired train runs.

, Five different trains will be needed to circle the USA:


Clockwise, from top to bottom; and counter-clockwise, from bottom to top):

Sunset Limited -- (currently) New Orleans, LA to Los Angeles, CA.
Coastal Starlight -- Los Angeles, CA to Seattle, WA.
Empire Builder -- Seattle, WA to Chicago, IL.
Capitol Limited -- Chicago, IL to Washington,D.C.
Crescent -- Washington,D.C. to New Orleans, LA.


Alternatively, you could choose to cross the USA, instead of circumnavigating.
Currently, (due to damage from Hurricane Katrina) the ""Sunset Limited"" only travels from New Orleans to Los Angeles. The ""Sunset Limited"" previously traveled from Orlando, Fl to Los Angeles, Ca.

, Your range may be extended if you pay to ride the train to a station or two down the line.


For example: You need to board the ""Sunset Limited"" in Houston, Tx, which is scheduled to depart at 9:50 p.m. Instead of starting the rail pass in Houston, you pay $31 extra to ride the train to San Antonio. Your Rail Pass (which you purchased in Houston) does not go into effect until the next day (at San Antonio), giving you 22 extra hours to complete your trip.
Before doing so, make certain that such a change would truly be profitable to your schedule.

, Each destination listed on the clockwise pattern will require an overnight stay. Careful planning will allow the traveler to spend extra nights at some of the locations.


Planning and your initial boarding point will determine the time available for an area.

The Amtrak ""USA Rail Pass"" will allow you 15 days with up to eight legs.
A ""leg"" is uninterrupted travel only on one train.
An example of two separate legs: A traveler on the Sunset Limited leaves from New Orleans and is stopping in Houston to visit with friends for 2 or 3 days. The traveler gets back on the train to continue to Los Angeles.



,


Many hostels have rates as low as $15 per night, if you don't mind sharing a room. Many hostels also offer shuttle service.

, The trains often travel in areas where no roads go, so you'll get to see some amazing scenery.

, Amtrak allows you to bring on your own food and sodas (no alcohol). While ice is limited, having your own sodas and snacks will save you money. Carry foods that are non-perishable or heat tolerant, such as crackers, cheese, and peanut butter.


Eating in the dining car is an excellent way to meet new people and make friends. Also, having at least one hot meal a day will make it easier to endure the inexpensive food that you brought along. Note: Eating in the dining car is not cheap; one person can easily spend $30 - $50 a day. However, the food is excellent.

Remember that White Sands is in the middle of a desert, so you should take the same precautions as you would if you were going to the beach.,
Visit the information/education center to learn how White Sands was formed.,
Visit the gift shop.,
Pay at the ticket booth.,
Check out the boardwalk, but be careful for static electricity.,
Drive around to explore the area, and make sure not to park on the road; if you do, staff will ask you to move.,
Slide down the dunes with your sled(s).,
Take pictures and video footage with a camcorder.,
Walk away from the road and into the sand for a few minutes to put some distance between you and the main road.,
Stay for the sunset stroll.,
Stick around the area because your ticket will allow you to reenter without additional charges for up to 7 days.",How to Enjoy White Sands National Monument (US),"


Put on sunscreen, remaining conscious of the fact that the white sand also reflects solar rays upward. Don't forget the underside of the chin, the underside of your nose (even the septum and edges of the inside of your nostrils--a sunburn there is painful!), and the underside and back of the ears and earlobe. If you have sensitive eyes, bring sunglasses and a hat as well.
Wear an old pair of shoes, or at least bring an extra pair with you. They will definitely get loaded with sand, which is much finer than the sand on beaches. If you don't want too much sand in the car, bring another pair of shoes and put plastic or sheets on the upholstery (but you'll still need to vacuum the interior after your visit, no matter what you do). On the dunes themselves, it is fairly safe to go barefoot, but there is a small risk stepping on litter or a tarantula. The sand itself, though, is easy on bare feet, unless it's in the winter, in which case it can be very cold. It doesn't heat up too much in the summer due to its highly reflective qualities, but it might be uncomfortable for some.;
, You can ask the employees for an abridged explanation or you can walk through the adjoining room to get a more detailed understanding. Maps, books, and other useful items can be found here as well.

, Here, you can:


Purchase unique souvenirs for friends and family (e.g. prickly pear candy, stone night lights, White Sands post cards and magnets, t-shirts, authentic Native American jewelry and pottery, etc.).
Buy a plastic sled for downhill sledding on sand dunes. Don't forget the wax! If you buy a sled you can return it and receive a portion of your initial payment. Sometimes used ones are available, but the new, slick ones are faster.
Use the bathroom. These bathrooms are much nicer than the ones you'll find on the sands.

, Each adult pays a fee but children get in for free. Tickets are valid for 7 days. As you begin driving through, you'll see the landscape gradually change. It'll take about 15 minutes before you reach pure white sand. Be sure to get enough information brochures from the booth for everyone interested.

, Running your hand along the railing will generate static electricity that can cause mild discomfort if you touch a metal object (such as the screws in the railing). This can be a lot of fun, though, if you chase someone up and down the boardwalk and zap them with your finger!

, Look for pull-off areas.

, Simply wax your board (with canning or candle wax) and slide down, making sure to avoid sliding into the road! The steepest slopes are by the picnic area.

, Because of the brightness level outside, you'll have to adjust your lenses accordingly. Note in the picture to the right how the white sand washes out into the white background.

, Stand still and notice the quietness around you. Also, look down and try to spot traces of animal life, such as bird tracks or scattering ants.

, White Sands looks very pretty at that time, and there's a guided walk, usually at 4pm. Consult the visitor center for when and where the walk starts. Also, the park is open until midnight on full moon nights. Take advantage of this as it gives a very different perspective.

, If you're interested in other attractions in New Mexico, the information center and gift shop areas have a large map outside that outlines various activities in the surrounding area.


In nearby Alamogordo, you can visit the Museum of Space History and IMAX theater or the Alameda Park Zoo. From Alamogordo, you can make a 25 minute, 4,000 foot (1,219.2 m) climb into the mountain village of Cloudcroft; seeing the landscape change from desert to sub-alpine forest within a short drive is breathtaking.
You can check out pistachio farms and wineries around Tularosa, and less than an hour away is the Three Rivers Petroglyph Site.

Plan Your Visit.",How to Visit the Covered Bridges of Vermont," Vermont is directly south of the Canadian border, east of New York State (look for Lake Champlain), west of New Hampshire, and north of Massachusetts. http://www.mapquest.com/mq/3-i1zG;
, Covered bridges were roofed and enclosed to protect the wooden structural elements from the weather, which in Vermont can be quite harsh. Structures such as these were an commonsense approach to make sure the bridge lasted a long time. As with the rest of the country, covered bridges have gradually been replaced as the result of expanding highway systems, intensive commercial development, and often physical neglect. Still, Vermont has the greatest concentration of covered bridges in the USA, and in the recent past has become dedicated to their preservation. Vermont law now protects all covered bridges and none can be torn down without the permission of the Governor and the Board of Historic Sites.What once was regarded as a symbol of lack of progress is now often the pride and centerpiece of Vermont towns.

, Not every Vermont city or town has a covered bridge. Some, however, have many. Check out such sites as:


http://www.virtualvermont.com/coveredbridges/
http://www.coveredbridgesite.com/vt/vt_home.html

, You can make the bridge or bridges your choose your destination. However, touring covered bridges easily folds into bicycle tours, photography safaris, and stops on the way to other Vermont attractions.

, Clothing should be quick-drying like polypropylene, silk or wool. A splash jacket, sun hat with a strap and a rain jacket should also be brought.


The weather can be cold or hot or a mixture of both in one day. Layers allow to shed or pile clothes when the weather changes. Extra clothing should be stored in a bag for the trip home.

,,,, While these guided trips do not require a 1 year advance reservation, rafting trips do fill, and the earlier a reservation is made, the better chances one can get the trip wanted. Interested parties should get in touch with the private companies that offer the trips to set up a reservation.

, Professionally guided rafting trips tend to require 1 year, if not 2, to reserve a commercial rafting trip. Noncommercial rafting trips are through a lottery or are first-come first serve, and an individual can wait at least 1 year on a noncommercial permit.

, Noncommercial Grand Canyon rafting trips require the boatman and trip leader to be experienced in whitewater safety, river equipment repair, whitewater navigation techniques, general first aid, and have first-hand involvement with whitewater river trips at the Grand Canyon or with comparable rivers. The boatman and trip leader must also be 18 years or older.

, There is 1 noncommercial permit that a rafter traveling the Diamond Creek 2 to 5 day trip must obtain, and the Hualapai Tribe also charges a fee. The permit through Hualapai land must be obtained in advance of the trip.

, It is recommended to also have a major first aid kit. Noncommercial trips must also have a signal mirror and 2 international orange colored panels that are 3 feet (0.91 m) by 8 feet (2.44 m) and can be placed in an X to be viewed by aircraft.

The school must be approved by the Arizona Department of Real Estate, and online schools do not qualify.Even if you already have a license from another state, you must take this course. Arizona is a non-reciprocal state.
The Arizona Department of Real Estate maintains a listing of approved schools at http://services.azre.gov/publicdatabase/SearchSchools.aspx. You may search for schools by name, location, school number, or course.
Many of the schools also offer the contract writing course as well, so you can save yourself some time by enrolling in one that does.
The cost of the course varies, but is usually between $400-$500., The length of the courses ranges from as little as nine days (nine ten hour sessions) to as long as eight weeks (90 hours spread out over 8 weeks), with one extra day for the contract writing course. The school will have its own final examination it administers in order for you to receive your certificate of completion.Make sure you get your certificates of completion. Without them, you can’t sit for the state licensing exam.
The certificates of completion must be signed by the instructor. Without the signature, the certificate is invalid.

, All exams are administered by PearsonVue. In order to register for the exam, you’ll need to go to http://www.pearsonvue.com/az/realestate/, create an account, pay the fee and schedule a date.Creating an account is easy.

If you would like to purchase one separately, PearsonVue, the company that administers the official exam, sells practice tests for less than $20, and content outlines are free.A passing grade for the exam is 75 on each section. So you need to score 75% correct on the national section and 75% correct on the state section. Those who failed will need to retake the test. If you fail on either section, you only have to retake the portion you failed. However, you have to repay the full exam fee.

, Arrive at the testing center at least thirty minutes before the exam starts. Do not bring cell phones, wallets or handbags into the testing center. While you are allowed to bring a calculator, it may not have an alphabetic keypad. The testing center will provide you with any other necessary materials, such as pencils and scratch paper, before the test begins.You’re going to need two forms of current ID with signatures.

Proceed if there is no response.,
Determine the next step.,
Finish it.",How to File an Uncontested Divorce in Arizona," In an uncontested divorce, both parties agree to the terms of their divorce. In such cases, many people feel comfortable proceeding without the assistance of counsel. Arizona is a no-fault state for non-covenant marriages. In Arizona, state law requires a 60-day waiting period from the date of service prior to obtaining a final decree despite the circumstances of the parties.


There are two types of uncontested divorces, a default and consent. Both processes begin the same. In fact, every divorce begins with an initial filing; the documents required to be filed with the Court to begin the dissolution process. The initial filing includes a petition and summons, among other required documents. The petition is you telling the Court what you seek in the divorce, including the division of property and debt, spousal maintenance and custody, parenting time and child support--if children are involved. The person who initiates the process is the Petitioner and that person will always remain the Petitioner throughout the case, as well as post decree, if modification or enforcement is required.;
, Service can be accomplished in a variety of ways in Arizona and Service is most commonly performed by a licensed process server. However, you may also have the Respondent sign an Acceptance of Service if he or she is willing, which requires a notarized signature. Service by certified mail is also accepted by the Court as long as the Respondent signs the certified return receipt and it is filed with an affidavit. Additionally, there are alternatives for service, if required, that include publication, which is used as a last resort if the Respondent cannot be located. Once service is complete, a 60-day waiting period begins.

, A default decree is obtained when the Respondent does not respond within the time allowed, which is set forth and explained in the summons that was served on the Respondent with the petition. If the Respondent fails to respond within the required time, the next step is for the Petitioner to file an Application and Affidavit of Default. The application notifies the court that the Respondent has not responded to the petition in the time allowed and that the Petitioner wishes to pursue the entry of a default. The application is filed with the Court and a copy is required to be mailed to the Respondent promptly. From the date of filing, the Respondent is allowed an additional 10 business days to respond. If the Respondent still does not respond within this time period, an entry of default will be entered.

, The next step depends on the circumstances in your case. If your case does not involve children or spousal maintenance (alimony), you have the option to schedule a default hearing or file a Motion and Affidavit for a Default Decree Without a Hearing. If your case involves children or spousal maintenance, a hearing is required. Both processes require you to submit a default decree.

, A consent decree may be obtained when the parties agree to the terms of their final decree. To do this, both parties must pay their filing fees (or have them waived or deferred by the Court.) There are additional requirements when children or spousal maintenance is involved. The parties are required to sign the decree and have their signatures notarized. The consent decree is then submitted to the judge assigned to the case. The judge will sign the decree, schedule a hearing, or send the decree back to the parties if corrections are required. Once signed by the judge, the decree is filed with the Court and copies provided to the parties.

Nonpayment of rent
Breach of a lease (such as unauthorized pets or failure to comply with apartment complex rules)
Breach of a lease – health and safety (the breach has to do with health or safety issues, such as not discarding garbage, or intentionally damaging property)Irreparable breach (such as gang-related activities, firing a gun on the premises, or assaulting someone)
Tenant remains on the property after the lease period has ended, and the tenancy hasn't been renewed. (Even though possession of the property should technically go back to you, don't take it upon yourself to force the tenant out. Follow the eviction procedures listed below.);
, Although eviction hearings are scheduled fairly quickly, the process is an expenditure of time and money that you’d like to avoid, if at all possible. Try talking with your tenant. Let him or her know that you want to settle the dispute out of court, but that you will file for eviction if necessary. Making the tenant aware of exactly where you stand might prompt him or her to comply with the lease terms rather than risk being dispossessed.

, If your attempts at a settlement fail, then you must provide the tenant with written notice of the breach, including the amount of time he or she has to correct it, and the consequences of not complying.


You can’t file an eviction complaint until the notice period has ended.
The notice requirements vary, depending on the type of breach. For example, in Pima County, a tenant who has not paid rent must be given a five day notice and an opportunity to pay the rent in full. The lawsuit can be filed on the sixth day. Alternately, if the tenant commits a material and irreparable breach (such as gang activity), then the landlord can give immediate termination.You should be able to find this information on the county court’s website or at the county court clerk’s office., You can serve the notice to the tenant by hand-delivery or by certified mail.


Hand-delivery is best because the time period for the tenant to correct the breach runs from the date of delivery. Try to have someone with you if you hand-deliver the notice. It's good to have a witness in case the tenant denies ever receiving it.
If you serve the notice by mail, you have to add five days to the time period before the court will permit you to file the eviction complaint.

, If you accept partial payment, you can only proceed with an eviction if the tenant agrees, in writing, to the terms and conditions of any partial payment agreement you reach with him or her. , You can get eviction forms from the county court clerk’s office or online. You’re going to need an Eviction Action summons, complaint, Residential Eviction Information Sheet, and a copy of the notice you hand-delivered or mailed to the tenant. , Remember, as mentioned above, the courts are very protective of a tenant’s rights. So if your paperwork is defective and/or the proper notices weren't given, your case will be dismissed, and you’ll have to refile. , If you’re looking to have the tenant pay overdue rent, late fees, court costs, or attorney fees, be sure to include that when completing the complaint form. If you don’t, you’ll waive your right to address those issues in the eviction hearing., There are court costs involved in filing for eviction. Contact the court clerk, or check online, so that you know what you’ll be expected to pay. Also find out what payment methods the court clerk accepts.

, Make sure you have all the paperwork listed in Step 1 above before going to the clerk’s office to file for the eviction. If you have a written lease, bring a copy, in case the clerk requests it. Court clerks are usually very busy, so don’t expect them to give you advice or check every detail in your forms. When you file your papers, the clerk will create a case and provide you with a court date within 3 to 6 business days., After the clerk has assigned a case number and court date and time, you must serve the tenant with the summons and complaint documents. These must be served by a constable or process server. The clerk’s office can give you information on how to do this., If the tenant pays the rent due, or moves out, or you settle the dispute at least one day before the hearing date, you must file a dismissal with the court and give the tenant a copy. The court will then close the case. The dismissal form is available at the clerk’s office and/or online., Make sure any witnesses you have are available for the hearing. Plan on bringing anyone who has knowledge that can help you prove your case, such as someone who witnessed the tenant damage or destroy property, or the person who accompanied you when you hand-delivered the notice of breach to the tenant. Review their testimony with them to make sure all their facts are accurate.

, If one or more of your witnesses is unavailable for the court date, or if you have another valid reason why the hearing needs to be postponed, you should alert the court clerk as soon as possible. In typical landlord-tenant court (sometimes called “justice court”) the court may order an adjournment up to three court days. The court may also adjourn the case on its own, if there are too many cases to handle., This includes proof of notices, the lease, receipts for monetary damages, etc. You don’t want your case to be dismissed because you left a crucial piece of evidence home., Sometimes landlord-tenant court can be organized chaos. Most people don’t know where to go or what to expect. Try to arrive early, so you can find out where your case is on the court’s list (also called a ""docket""). If your case is contested, meaning you haven’t been able to resolve it, the odds are you’ll be waiting for a while. After the judge hears your case, he or she will determine if a judgment for eviction should be granted., This is the form that is needed to actually remove the tenant from the property. At the hearing, the judge will order a date when you may file the writ, but it can’t be issued until at least five calendar days after the judgment is signed. The court clerk can provide you with the form for the writ, and it may also be available online.Once you've filled it out, bring it back to the clerk so it can be filed.


The constable will serve (deliver) the writ on the tenant. Once the writ is served, if the tenant doesn't move out, it's the constable's job to physically remove the tenant from the property.
You'll be able to shut off the utilities when the writ is served, and you'll also be able to sell the tenant's personal property if he or she doesn't claim it within 21 days after the writ is delivered., If you receive a money judgment at the hearing, the court offers forms and instructions on how to collect, but it won’t assist in the actual collection process. , After you collect the money judgment, you must file a Satisfaction of Judgment with the court. Again, forms should be available from the court clerk or online."

(Check out How to Get a Good Seat on an Airplane.) Those wanting to spend more time in the park and less on the road may wish to consider commuter flights from Phoenix to Flagstaff, Arizona (FLG) or Page, Arizona (PGA). If you will drive to the area, estimated drive times to the South Rim from major Western cities are as follows:


Phoenix, Arizona: 4.5 hours

Las Vegas, Nevada: 5 hours
Albuquerque, New Mexico: 7 hours
Los Angeles, California: 8 hours
Salt Lake City, Utah: 8 hours
Denver, Colorado: 13 hours;
,


If it is your first visit to Grand Canyon National Park and/or you are traveling with children, you’ll most likely want to visit the South Rim for its relative abundance of hotels, services and activities. Grand Canyon South Rim is open year-round, making it the best choice for a wintertime visit. Note that you'll be at a high altitude, so you might want to read How to Prevent Altitude Sickness, just in case.
Plan to experience sunrise, sunset, or both if possible. They are spectacular. If you plan to spend the night make your room reservations before you leave home. Rooms are limited. Camping is available but also limited.
Plan to do some hiking down one of the trails into the canyon to fully appreciate the scale of the Canyon. It will take twice the time to hike out of the canyon that it will to hike down. A half hour walk down will take at least an hour back. An hour down can easily become a 4 hour ordeal with time used to enjoy the view. Dehydration is a common problem. Bring water with you even for short hikes. Share your water with those you see are suffering. You will become an instant hero.
Grand Canyon North Rim, which is only open from mid-May through mid-October, is better suited to couples, hikers and those seeking a quieter, more low-key Grand Canyon experience. Visitor services at the North Rim are fewer in number and smaller in scale.
If you have limited time for a Grand Canyon experience; if you want to experience going to the bottom of the Grand Canyon; or if your physician has advised you to avoid high altitudes, consider Grand Canyon West on the Hualapai Indian Reservation. Grand Canyon West is open year-round.

, Summer is the warmest, driest and busiest time of year at the Grand Canyon, particularly the South Rim. Late spring and early fall offer the best weather; late fall is slightly less crowded. Winter brings cooler temperatures and the possibility of snow, making it the quietest time of year in the park. Want to save money? Plan your visit for the winter months (November through February), when many Grand Canyon hotels offer sizable discounts.

, There are 6 hotels inside the park at the South Rim, and one at the North Rim. Alternate lodging locations for Grand Canyon South Rim are: Tusayan (10 minutes away), Williams (1 hour away), Flagstaff (1.5 hours away) or Page/Lake Powell (2.5 hours away). For the North Rim, alternate lodging is available in Jacob Lake (1 hour away), Kanab, Utah (2 hours away), or Page/Lake Powell (2.5 hours away). There is no lodging within Grand Canyon West at the present time. The nearest lodging to Grand Canyon West is in Peach Springs, Arizona or Kingman, Arizona (1.5 hours away).

, Activities like Grand Canyon mule rides, Grand Canyon air tours, Colorado River rafting trips, hiking, train tours, 4x4 safari-jeep tours or ranger-guided activities can make your Grand Canyon vacation more memorable. Many tours and activities are not strenuous and appropriate for most ages (exceptions are mule rides, inner canyon hiking and white water rafting).


The new Grand Canyon Skywalk is not a part of Grand Canyon National Park. It is located at Grand Canyon West, on Hualapai Indian Tribal Lands. The main access road into the complex is unpaved for a distance of about 15 miles (24 km). Though recently graded, it is still very bumpy and deeply rutted in some areas. Those driving rental cars are strongly discouraged from taking vehicles down this road. Doing so could void your insurance policy. See How to Know Which Insurance to Take on a Rental Car.

, If your total vacation is longer than 3 days, you probably won’t want to spend the entire time at the Grand Canyon. Other areas you might consider visiting include, but are not limited to: Hoover Dam, Sedona, Lake Powell, Monument Valley, Paria Canyon, Zion, and Bryce Canyon.

, Arrange all the elements of your vacation in advance, airline tickets, rental car, hotels, tours, Las Vegas shows, dinner reservations (necessary at some places), all of it. Grand Canyon lodging tends to be booked 6 months to a year in advance during peak travel season (which is essentially from Spring Break through Thanksgiving). Demand is only slightly lower for campgrounds. Booking your hotel or campsite is the most important component of your Grand Canyon vacation planning process and will be the “linchpin” around which the rest of your plans will revolve.


Booking by phone? Choose one with a ""redial"" button. Grand Canyon reservations centers tend to experience very high call volume during peak travel months. Don't be taken aback if you get a busy signal; keep trying.
Cancellations do happen. If unable to reserve a seat on a mule ride or other activity, keep checking back, or ask about waiting lists when you arrive. At the same time, consider alternative activities.

, Print your various confirmations and keep them in a notebook, envelope, or whatever works for you. Take this paperwork with you on vacation so you can refer to it quickly if needed. You can later use some of it for trips down memory lane: How to Start a Scrapbook.

, About a week before your vacation, call your airline, rental car agency, hotel, tour company and make sure all is in order for your visit.

Alert the judge that you have reached agreement.",How to Navigate a Family Law Settlement Conference in Arizona," The judge will schedule your conference during a hearing, usually by having someone call the Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) office. You should receive a notice from the office which will include the date and the location of where your family law settlement conference will be held.Settlement conferences typically last two to three hours, so plan accordingly.;
, The purpose of the settlement conference is to resolve as many issues as possible so that a trial is unnecessary. You should spend some time identifying the issues you and your spouse disagree on. Consider the following:


Child custody. There are two types of child custody: legal decision-making and parenting time. If you have legal decision-making authority, you can make decisions about your child’s educational and medical needs. Parenting time is the amount of time the child spends with each parent.Child support. One parent may be required to pay the other child support, which is meant to defray the costs of raising the child.You can come to an agreement on child support. However, the judge always retains the power to set the amount based on state law.
Alimony (called “spousal maintenance”). Spousal maintenance is a sum of money one spouse pays to the other after divorce. In Arizona, most alimony is for rehabilitative purposes, such as paying for the spouse to get more education. You can also get alimony to reimburse you for time and effort you contributed to your spouse’s education or career.Division of property. You must divide the property and debts you incurred as a couple. Arizona does not require a 50/50 split. However, the division must be fair., You need to tell the judge pro tempore about any negotiations that you have had with your spouse and the results of those negotiations.Take some time to sit down and write out what you have discussed with your spouse. For example:


Have you talked about who will get the home?
Have you discussed dividing assets, such as bank accounts, retirement accounts, etc.?
Have you and your spouse discussed spousal maintenance?
Have you discussed who will have physical custody of the children? Have you discussed who will make legal decisions for the children?

, Go through all of the issues in dispute and decide what your ideal resolution would be. Also determine your priorities. For example, your top priority might be getting the children to live with you during the week. Getting the car or spousal maintenance might be lower priorities.


You should also identify what you might be willing to give up. For example, you might be fine with your children spending the weekend with their other parent.

, The family law settlement conference is voluntary. Although the attorney running it is called a “judge pro tempore,” this person has no power to force you to accept any agreement.However, you need to analyze the strength of your case to see if your demands are unreasonable.


For example, you might want spousal maintenance. However, you could make almost as much money as your spouse and not have any other legal reason for deserving it. You should know this before going into the settlement conference.
The best way to analyze your case is to meet with a qualified attorney who is familiar with Arizona divorce and family law.

, You are allowed to have an attorney with you at the settlement conference, and you should probably have one.If you don’t have a divorce lawyer, then you can get a referral to one by contacting your local or state bar association.Once you get a referral, you should call up the attorney and ask to schedule a consultation. Also check how much the attorney charges.
At the consultation, you should discuss the upcoming settlement conference and how to prepare. Ask the attorney what you need to do in order to get the most out of the settlement conference.
You don’t have to hire the attorney. Instead, you could pay for an hour of advice. However, if you are nervous about the upcoming settlement conference, then you should think about hiring the attorney.

, You will be more effective in the family law settlement conference if you can justify your demands. The judge pro tempore will be looking to see if your demands are reasonable or unreasonable.For example, you might want spousal maintenance. You should be able to explain why.
One justification could be that you gave up pursuing your education or career to stay at home and raise the children. In this situation, you might need financial support after divorce to help you finish up a degree and re-enter the job market. This is a strong reason for spousal support.
Try to come up with one or two reasons for each demand. Your lawyer can help you identify persuasive reasons.

, The mediator needs to understand your financial situation in order to conduct the settlement conference properly. Accordingly, you should go through the Financial Affidavit that you have already completed and gather relevant supporting financial documents, such as the following:


pay stubs
W-2 forms or other proof of self-employed income
bank account records
life insurance policies
retirement and IRA accounts
information on debts, such as mortgages, car loans, and credit cards

, You may have to complete a document called a “settlement conference memorandum,” which contains your proposals for resolving all disputes. You can get this document from the court. It may also be available on the court’s website for download., The memorandum will probably ask for background information on the marriage. You should gather the following information, as well as any supporting documentation as needed:date of your marriage
names and ages of your children
date the divorce petition was filed and served
whether there are any temporary orders (attach a copy)
whether you have reached agreement with your spouse on anything

, The memorandum will probably also ask that you identify matters you need to resolve with your spouse. For example, you should provide information about the following if they are unresolved:how you and your spouse will make legal decisions about your children’s medical, educational, and religious needs
how parenting time will be allotted
how holidays will be divided
how real estate and personal property will be split
how any business interests will be divided
how debts will be divided

, The judge pro tempore is also interested in your proposal for spousal maintenance. You should provide the following information in the memorandum:the basis for awarding spousal maintenance
the proposed amount and the length of time spousal maintenance should be awarded
the reason why spousal maintenance should not be awarded

, The memorandum will request financial information to help the court determine child support. For example, you will probably have to provide the following:mother’s income
father’s income
who should pay for the children’s health insurance
how taxes should be divided

, Make a copy for your records. If you have a lawyer, then they need one copy as well. Submit the completed memorandum to the settlement conference judge pro tempore., You might be very angry at your spouse. However, you should try as best as you can to get in a proper mindset. Realize that resolving the issues in a settlement conference will be less exhausting and time-consuming than going to trial.If you’re angry now, you’ll probably be angrier at a trial.

, Give yourself plenty of time to get to the meeting place. If you have never been there before, then plan enough time to find nearby parking and go through any building security.


If you have a lawyer, then you might want to ride over together. This is a good way to avoid getting lost, since a qualified lawyer should have attended family law settlement conferences before.

, The judge pro tempore will have read your memorandum before the conference. However, you should be prepared to discuss in detail what you want. Be prepared to give your reasons why you feel you are entitled to whatever you request.

, Your spouse also gets to speak. Generally, any kind of settlement conference will be more successful if you commit to listening. Really try to hear what your spouse is saying and why they want what they have requested.


If your spouse says something offensive, bite your lip and try to let it go. Remember, if you can’t reach a resolution you can still go to trial and present evidence that supports your side of the story., You should attend the conference in good faith and make a decent attempt to find common ground with your spouse.Be prepared to give something up to get something in return.


For example, if you want physical custody during the school week, be prepared to give your spouse holidays to spend with the children.
Alternately, if you want spousal maintenance for five years, you can compromise and reduce the amount of time to two or three years.

, You can reach agreement on some or all issues. If you reach a settlement on all issues, then the trial date is removed.However, you may reach agreement on only some issues. In this situation, you will still need to go to trial on anything that remains unresolved.


The judge pro tempore should be able to draft an agreement on any resolved issues and have you and your spouse sign it.Be sure to keep a copy.

Before you go, decide if your children are mature enough to visit.,
If you decide to visit with younger children who don't know what happened at the site, tell them in a child-friendly way that will not give too many details, but will provide them with an understanding of the disaster.,
When you get to the site, point out the huge reflecting pools where the Twin Towers once stood and describe what you know about them.,
If you know someone who died in the tragedy, find their name on the reflecting pools and bring along flowers to place inside the etching.,
Understand that there will probably be at least some people paying their respects who are visiting at the same time you are.,
Buy tickets to the 9/11 Memorial Museum.",How to Visit the World Trade Center Site With Children," Older children who understand the tragedy and were living on 9/11 should not have a problem, but very young children may get bored or fussy while you go to visit. There are sensitive parts of the site that are not exactly the most appropriate area for a toddler's temper tantrum, so think about this before you go.;
, Try not to scare them with specifics about terrorism and falling bodies. Instead, tell them in a simple way that a horrible disaster happened here and many people did not live through it.

, That will make your experience an educational one for you and your child.

, It is a practice lots of affected people partake in, and is a nice way to remember those who perished.

, Be sure to give them privacy.

, This museum covers the tragedy and will educate all visitors about the events leading up to, on the day of, and after the attacks. The museum is most appropriate for older children and teenagers.

Make sure you know museum schedules.",How to Visit New York City," If you have time to plan, think about when to make your trip. There are benefits and drawbacks to traveling at any time of the year, and there are some unique things to consider when planning a trip to New York.Temperatures in New York tend to be most pleasant in the early fall, when they range in the 60's. However, be careful when you go if you're planning a fall vacation. You may end up paying steep hotel prices if you go around Thanksgiving.
Christmastime in New York can be exciting for a variety of reasons. There's a lot to see and do in the city around the holidays. However, you're very likely to find pricey hotels around this time. You may be better off saving your money and going in January and February. While the weather will be bitter, you'll save on hotels.
Visiting in the spring and summer months can be a good idea, but the March/May months may be very rainy. A summer visit, like June or July, will usually have very humid weather and big crowds, as it's a very popular time to visit. If you'd rather avoid crowds, you may want to stay away over the summer.;
, As New York itself can be expensive, it's a good idea to aim for cheaper flights. Explore ways to book your flight for cheap, so you'll have more money to spend in the city.Fly out out on a weekday. Prices tend to be lower if you're flying out on a Tuesday or Wednesday rather than a Friday or Saturday. You can also try flying out early. As passengers tend to dislike the stress of early flights, these tickets may be cheaper.
Check to see if prices dropped 24 hours after booking your flight. If prices went down, call the airline to cancel and then rebook your flight at a cheaper rate.
Monitor social media as you get ready to book your flight. Airlines often post special discounts and sales.

, Hotels in New York vary greatly in prices. If you want to stay in a hotel, it's a good idea to use an online tool to find a hotel in your price range. Websites like TravelZoo, Groupon, and Living Social can help you find a hotel at an appropriate price for your needs.You also may notice these sites offer trip packages, which include air fare. In some cases, trip packages may be cheaper than finding a hotel and an airline ticket separately. If you see a solid trip package that would greatly reduce your airline costs, take it.

, If hotels are out of your price range, there are many alternatives. NYC is a popular travel destination, so hotels will rarely be cheap.Consider using a website like CouchSurfing. You make a profile about yourself and your travels. You'll then find hosts through the website willing to take in travelers. It's vastly cheaper than a hotel, and a good way to make friends in the city.
Consider doing a temporary rental through a site like AirBnB, where you rent someone else's apartment or room for a week. You could also look into staying in a hostel or a Bed and Breakfast, which both may be cheaper than a hotel.

, You do not need to rent a car in New York as the city has solid public transportation. Getting a metro card at one of the train stations will cut back on costs significantly, and reduce the amount of time you'll spend taking cabs.A seven day metro card costs about $30, which is significantly cheaper than what you would pay taking cabs.
You can purchase a card at the station. The process is fairly straightforward, but if you have any questions you can ask an attendant.

, The subway can be hard to navigate if you're a beginner, but technology can help. Pick up a physical subway map at the station or download one on your phone. If you have a smart phone, applications like Google Maps will also be able to direct you to the proper public transportation routes to get you where you need to go., New York can be overwhelming as there's so much to do and see. Spend some time narrowing things down by deciding what you can't miss in the city.


Think about your personal tastes. You may be coming to the city for its art and culture. Therefore, seeing a Broadway show is a must, as is hitting up the art museums like the MET and MOMA.
If you're more into something like architecture, consider touring the financial district or booking an architectural tour of the city. You could also spend time in Central Park, browsing the statues and attractions. You'll also want to see the Statue of Liberty and the Empire State Building.
Make a list of everything you want to see, and then rank your list. Group the most important attractions towards the top, and then move downward. At the bottom of your list, you should have some attractions you could stand to miss.

, New York is a massive city comprised of uptown, midtown, downtown, Brooklyn, and other neighborhoods and boroughs. When planning your itinerary, break the city down by sections. Target different neighborhoods each day to hit all the attractions you want to see.Uptown and midtown are easy to see on the same day. You can see the Empire State Building, walk up and down Broadway, hit up Times Square, and see museums like the MET and the Museum of Natural History.
You can also tour downtown and Brooklyn on the same day. You can see the Statue of Liberty, as well as the 9/11 Memorial, and then take the subway into Brooklyn. Brooklyn offers a lot of unique food that may be cheaper than other parts of the city.
You also may want to take time to visit some places off the map. You could, for example, go to Coney Island for a day, or see a nearby state park.

, Museums are a must see in New York City. In addition to the major art museums, there are a variety of science and architectural museums you may want to see on your trip.In addition to the Museum of Modern Art, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, you may want to check out the Contemporary Art Center.
If you're into science, the Natural History Museum is a must see as it contains a wide array of exhibits overviewing Earth's diverse history. You could also consider the Museum of Mathematics.
If you're interest in history, the Tenement Museum is a five-story brick building that tells the story of immigrants who first moved to New York City in mid-19th century.

, Central Park is a massive part of New York City, and it can be overwhelming to try to navigate the park solo. It is about 843 acres. If you get close to Central Park, you may notice people offering tours. You can also look up tours online and see if there are any well-reviewed tours in your price range.If you don't want to take a tour, you can always rent a bicycle. You'll get through Central Park faster if you're biking, and a bike ride through central park can be a fun and relaxing way to spend an afternoon.

, The Statue of Liberty is a must see for many when coming to New York City, but think about how you want to see it. You can view the Statue of Liberty from a distance, but you may also want to actually go up and see the statue itself. To do so, you'll need to take a ferry. You can book tickets online the day before you plan to go.There will be a brief security checkpoint before you board the ferry. You'll then be taken to the statue, where you'll exit along the wooden pier.
You can simply view the statue up close. You can also go up into the statue if you visit on a day that it's opened.

, Seeing a Broadway show is a must for many in New York City. However, tickets can be very pricey. There are a variety of ways you can find tickets in your price range when visiting New York City.You can visit what is known as the TKTS booth found in Times Square. Tickets for shows that have not sold out yet are sold at this booth for a discount price.
There are also websites, like TodayTix and nytix.com, that allow you to buy cheap tickets last minute.

, Discount tickets you can book last minute are great, but keep in mind the pickings will be slim. You're unlikely to get your first choice. If you want to see a big show currently running in New York, book your tickets ahead of time.


It's a good idea to get your tickets before you even leave. Tickets can be purchased online. You can have them mailed to you, print them, or pick them up at the theater.
Tickets to big shows are not cheap, but if there's a play or musical you have your heart set on seeing, it may be worth the extra price.

, When choosing restaurants, avoid eating out when you find yourself in Times Square. Restaurants here are rarely high quality as they're often tourist traps. As Times Square is busy, you will not have a chance to enjoy your meal as waitstaff will want you to eat quickly and leave. You're better off dining at local restaurants in smaller neighborhoods.

, If you see an empty subway car, you may be inclined to hop on to get a seat. This is a mistake. Empty subway cars are usually that way for a reason. There may be a bad smell or a spill that pushed people off the car. You're better off squeezing into a crowded car than getting on an uncharacteristically empty car in the middle of the day.

, Museum schedules vary greatly in New York City. Some museums are closed on certain days of the week. When planning your trip, it's vital that you check a museum's schedule. The Whitney, for example, is closed on Tuesdays.


You should also read reviews online to get a sense of when museums are likely to be crowded. On certain days of the week, you can expect big crowds and lines. You're better off going on days when the museums will be less packed.

In order to qualify, the defendant must be your spouse, former spouse, roommate, former roommate, parent of your child, someone you were/are involved with romantically, or close relatives.If the possible defendant does not fall within one of these categories, you will not be able to get an order of protection in Arizona. However, check with your local law enforcement agency or court to see what other options might be available to you.;
, To qualify for an order of protection, the defendant must have committed (or is about to commit) some illegal act. If a child is involved, you can ask the court for help if the defendant has (or is about to) committed murder, assault, molestation, abuse, kidnapping, or some drug related crimes. In addition, even if a child is not involved, you should go to your local courthouse if the defendant:Endangers
Threatens
Assaults
Kidnaps
Trespasses
Abuses
Intimidates
Harasses

, If you qualify for an order of protection, you will need to obtain certain documents to take with you to the courthouse. The information you bring will help you fill out the court forms and answer questions. While each local courthouse may have different requirements, in general, you should have the following documents close and available:Your picture ID
Addresses of places you would like protected (e.g., schools, homes, work)
Personal information about the defendant
Details about the incidents that led you to apply for an order of protection
Information about minor children that are involved

, With information in hand, take a trip to your local superior court. If you do not know where your local superior court is located, visit the Arizona courts website. Once there, you will be able to find courts in your area.Once you get to the courthouse, expect to be there for about two hours. Be aware that children will usually not be allowed inside the courtroom with you., When you arrive at the courthouse, ask the information desk for help applying for an order of protection. Most courthouses will have a protective order center, which is a safe space you can use to fill out the required paperwork. Once you are in a protective order center, you will usually be able to complete paperwork using a computerized prompt system. This will make your application process incredibly easy and straightforward. If you need help with the process, court staff will be available.


The main form you will need to fill out is the petition. In your petition you will provide details of the incidents that led you to apply for an order of protection. You must name each person you want protection from. At the end of your petition, you must sign and swear to the truth of your description., After your paperwork is completed, you will go before a judge and tell them about your situation. If the judge agrees with you and finds enough evidence to grant your order of protection, they will do so. This initial discussion with the judge is relatively informal, but you need to make sure you are prepared to discuss your case., If the judge signs off on your order of protection, you must give a copy to the defendant. The court will not do this for you. To accomplish service, you must use a local law enforcement agency or registered process server. If you use local law enforcement, you will not be charged a fee. You will be given a list of law enforcement agencies that can help you when you fill out your petition.


Once service is completed, the server will file an affidavit with the court proving that service was successful.
Make sure you a keep a copy of the order of protection close to you. If the defendant fails to abide by the order of protection, call emergency services immediately and explain the situation., If the defendant disagrees with the order of protection, they will have an opportunity to request a hearing on the matter. Once the defendant files a hearing request, a hearing will be scheduled within five to ten days of that request being made.As soon as you hear about this hearing, you need to start preparing. At this hearing you will have to present evidence that backs up your claims as to why an order of protection was needed. However, during this hearing, you will not simply be able to present anything you want. Instead, you have to follow certain rules of evidence., As soon as you receive notice that the defendant has asked for a hearing, you need to determine what evidence you will present. However, before you can compile evidence to use, you need to know what will be admissible. In normal state court cases (i.e., criminal cases, tort cases), the Arizona Rules of Evidence would usually apply. In protective order hearings, Arizona has decided that different evidentiary rules should apply., The rules of evidence that will apply to your protective order hearing can be found online. In addition, if you do not have consistent access to the internet, you should be able to find these rules at the courthouse. In Arizona, the rules that apply to protective order cases are called the Arizona Rules of Protective Order Procedure. These rules will govern any protective order proceeding in an Arizona court. Any other rules will apply to your hearing unless they are inconsistent with the Rules of Protective Order Procedure.If you need help gaining access to these rules, ask for help at your courthouse. If they are unable to help, visit your local law library. Ask the law librarian for help finding the Arizona Rules of Protective Order Procedure. They should be able to help.

, If your order of protection was granted as part of a larger family law case (e.g., a divorce, child custody, alimony), the Arizona Rules of Family Law Procedure may also apply.However, the Rules of Protective Order Procedure are clear in saying that the Rules of Family Law Procedure will only apply to the extent those rules are consistent. Therefore, if a rule in the Rules of Family Law Procedure is at odds with a rule in the Rules of Protective Order Procedure, the rule in the Rules of Protective Order Procedure will apply.In almost every case, the evidence rules within the Rules of Protective Order Procedure are more lenient and will apply. However, if you have any doubt as to what rules of evidence you need to apply, speak with a lawyer, court employees, or a law librarian. These individuals will be well equipped to help you ease your concerns.

, As a general evidentiary rule in protective order cases, all relevant evidence is admissible.Evidence is relevant if it has the effect of making a fact more or less probable than it would be without that evidence. In addition, the fact must be of some consequence in your protective order hearing.In other words, evidence is relevant if it helps prove (or disprove) an important fact in your case.


For example, pictures of bruises and cuts you sustained by the defendant during an altercation that led you to ask for a protective order would be relevant. This is the case because those pictures would help prove the fact that the defendant physically assaulted you, which can lead to a protective order being issued.

, While all relevant evidence may be admissible, the court, during your hearing, might choose to exclude certain pieces for various reasons. One of the reasons a court may exclude evidence is if it is particularly prejudicial to the defendant.Prejudicial evidence is often evidence that appeals to emotion as opposed to reason.With that said, this can be a difficult line to draw in protective order hearings, which are highly emotional to begin with.


For example, a judge might choose to exclude, and not allow you to present, evidence of past the defendant's convictions for the purpose of showing that the defendant was the one who assaulted you on this occasion. The judge might say that this evidence unfairly casts guilt on the defendant for actions that have already been resolved by the court. However, some judges might also admit this evidence because it tends to prove that the defendant is a violent person.

, Another reason a judge might exclude evidence is if that evidence is confusing.When a judge listens to your arguments during the hearing, they want the presentation to be as clear as possible. If you start presenting evidence that confuses things, it will hurt your case and it will make it difficult for the defendant to respond.


For example, a judge might exclude evidence of physical harm to your child if you are only filing for a protective order on behalf of yourself. In this example, assume you want to present evidence (e.g., pictures, a bloody shirt) that the defendant has physically harmed your child. However, this evidence would confuse the issues because, in this particular case, the issue is about harm to yourself, not someone else.

, As an untrained individual presenting evidence at a hearing, you may find yourself putting as much evidence on the table as you can possibly find. However, a court may start to exclude evidence when presenting it causes a delay in the proceedings.When you prepare for your hearing, look at the overall amount of evidence you have and make sure everything has a purpose. Do not present evidence that will waste the court's time.


For example, a judge might exclude a three hour video of you and the defendant arguing. While pieces of this video may help prove or disprove some important fact, the judge will likely determine that watching the whole thing would be unnecessary and would delay the hearing. In this scenario, pick and choose the important pieces of the video to show.

, You want to make sure that you present enough evidence to show the court the protective order is necessary. However, you need to make sure you only present your best evidence. In some cases, judges will exclude evidence that starts to be cumulative and repetitive.Therefore, it is important that you pick only the best pieces of evidence that help you prove each important fact.


For example, do not try to present 400 pictures of one bruise on your arm. Pick the best pictures that effectively show your injury and leave the rest at home. If you start showing the same type of picture multiple times, the court will start to exclude that cumulative evidence.

, Any piece of evidence you present at your protective order hearing needs to be trustworthy. In a lot of cases, this might mean backing up one piece of evidence with another piece of evidence (e.g., backing up a photo with testimony that the photo is what you say it is). If your evidence is not reliable, it may be excluded by the judge.Consider this rule carefully when preparing for your hearing.


For example, if you plan on presenting a bloody shirt at your hearing, which you claim helps prove that the defendant assaulted you on a particular day, you will also need to present evidence tending to prove that you were wearing that shirt on the day of the assault and that the blood is yours. Therefore, in addition to presenting the bloody shirt, you may also need to present photos of you wearing that shirt on a particular day. You should also be prepared to present evidence that the blood on the shirt is in fact yours.

, In regular family law cases, you would be required to disclose the evidence you plan to present to the defendant before the actual hearing. This general rule gives the defendant an opportunity to prepare and rebut anything you present.However, the Arizona Rules of Protective Order Procedure explicitly state that these general rules do not apply in protective order hearings.Therefore, unless the judge orders you to make disclosures, you are not required to show the defendant what you plan on presenting.

However, you must take note of the cost of the taxi and the NYC traffic. It may be better to travel by foot after all. Public transportation is also a good way of getting around

, This is the preferred method of transportation in the Big Apple, and millions of pedestrians tend to agree.

, All native New Yorkers do it, but that's because they live there and know how to do it without getting hit by oncoming vehicles. Wait until it says ""WALK"" rather than walk against the ""DON'T WALK"" signal.

Don’t feel limited to Manhattan.,
Know how long you’ll be in New York.",How to Plan a Trip to New York City1," Why do you dream of going to New York City? You probably have a few things in mind already that you’re curious about. List them, then take some time and research other places, landmarks, museums, or shows that interest you.


If you’re overwhelmed by all of the options, you can always start with a pre-planned itinerary as a jumping-off point. The city has special ones based on TV shows, classic movies, and beloved children’s literature.Look around for other resources on interesting attractions. Guide books are a good start, but the blogs of travelers (and NYC locals) are useful, too.;
, There’s something for everyone in New York City. Conversely, there’s something not for everyone in New York City. You may have seen the Empire State Building in movies and TV shows, but that doesn’t mean it’s essential to your trip. You don’t have to do anything you find boring.


Make sure to take the interests of the others you travel with into account, too.
If you’re used to the structure of a group tour, consider planning a day tour instead of one that encompasses your whole visit., Your friends know you better than any guidebook, or even travel agent, does. If you have a friend who has traveled to New York recently, grill them. What was their favorite activity? What do they wish they’d known? If you have a friend who lives or has lived in NYC, they may be able to offer even more advice.

, Manhattan is central, busy, and full of historic excitement, from the Metropolitan Museum of Art to Alexander Hamilton’s house in Harlem. However, it’s only one of the five boroughs of New York City, and if you don’t leave it, you’ll miss out on a lot of culture and fun. Make it a point to get off the island and explore places that may seem a little out of the ordinary.


Brooklyn has become notorious for its hipsters in the past ten years, but there’s much more to it than that. Visit for experimental theatre, the gorgeous botanic garden, and international food from Bajan flying fish to Polish pastries.The Bronx is best known for its amazing Bronx Zoo, which focuses on wildlife conservation and protection, and Yankee Stadium. You can also explore Wave Hill, which has gorgeous old houses that will appeal to Edith Wharton and Downton Abbey fans.Queens offers incredible restaurants and a range of museums, too. Stop by the Queens Museum of Art or the New York Hall of Science.Staten Island is the most suburban-feeling of the boroughs, which makes it a nice stop for a relaxed afternoon. Take the free ferry from Manhattan, and visit Franklin D. Roosevelt Boardwalk and Beach, the Children’s Museum, or any number of tranquil gardens and parks.

, This will help you prioritize. If you’re going to be in the city for a week, you can plan to hit the spots you’re most excited about and throw some wild cards into your itinerary, too. If you’re only stopping by for a weekend, your options will be more limited (but you can still pack in a lot of fun).Make sure you know how much time you can take off work, and if you’ll need to apply flex time, vacation days, or personal days to your trip.Consider how far you are traveling when reflecting on your timing, as well. You may need to allow for travel time, as well as jet lag or exhaustion.

Let your bank know you’ll be traveling.,
Record important info.",How to Plan a Trip to New York City2," Before you make any other reservations, make sure you know exactly how you plan to get to New York. After all, you can’t see Hamilton if you’re not in the city. There are plenty of ways to get to New York, so look around and choose based on your budget, distance, and comfort.


New York has three major airports, and it’s fairly easy to find cheap flights.If you travel with one particular airline often, it might be better to buy tickets through that one, instead of trying to find the absolutely cheapest deal.
If you’re traveling a short distance and staying a short time, you can consider driving. Make sure you have parking plans (as rates in New York City are famously steep) and be cautious when driving in busy areas.If you don’t want to drive or fly, NYC is served by Amtrak and local train lines, as well as bus lines like Greyhound, Megabus, and Peter Pan.

, There is no shortage of lodging in New York City, so you can shop around until you find the perfect place. Try to stick close to the attractions you’re interested in, or select a location that’s served by a major subway line. Manhattan is central, so it’s a popular choice for hotels, but stay out of giant business districts like Midtown if you want quieter vibes.


Start researching hotels by perusing a recommended list, or search for recommendations in a particular neighborhood. Consider size, price, and amenities like breakfast or exercise equipment.There are options for student housing and hostels as well, if you’re a young person planning a less-than-frilly trip.In recent years, AirBNB and other room-sharing apps have become popular as well. Make sure to read reviews.No matter where you want to stay, check the Bedbug Registry before you book! Bedbugs became a problem in New York several years ago, and they’re not yet completely under control., Once you have your travel and sleeping plans in place, you can start making concrete plans for the fun stuff. Look up the items on your must-see list, and see if any of them require advance purchases or reservations.


Theatre tickets are best to buy in advance. There are many discount options, both online and in the city (like the famous TKTS booth for Broadway shows.)If you’re eager to see a bunch of museums and classic destinations like the Statue of Liberty, you can save time and money by acquiring a museum pass.If there’s a particular restaurant you’re simply dying to eat at, contact them in advance, as well.

, There are so many things to do in New York that it’s tempting to stuff your itinerary to the gills. However, it’s actually better to give yourself some flexible, unstructured time as well. This way, you’ll have the opportunity to rest and reflect, impulsively try a recommendation from a local, or simply linger over a delicious slice of dollar pizza.


If you’re having trouble breaking time down, think of it this way. There are three major zones of travel time: morning, afternoon, and evening. Plan to fill two of these, and chill during the other one.You might go to the Metropolitan Museum of Art before lunch and the Metropolitan Opera at night--nap or write postcards in between for best results.

, If you’re traveling from out of state or out of country, tell your bank before you leave so they don’t flag your account for fraudulent charges. They should be able to tell you if you’ll be able to withdraw from your checking account at an ATM at this time., The best laid plans will go awry if you don’t write them down. As you continue to confirm the details of your travel, write them down. A small notebook will work for this purpose, as will a notetaking app on your smartphone--just make sure you keep the information close to you.


Write down your hotel’s address and keep it somewhere safe. This should help you get back easily at the end of a busy day.Make copies of travel documents. You may want to keep one copy on your person, and another in your hotel room.Print and save reservations, and take them with you as well.

Dress for the weather.,
Leave space in your suitcase.,
Travel lightly during the day.,
Plan to fortify and hydrate.,
Download an NYC transit app.,
Have access to cash.",How to Plan a Trip to New York City3," You may have heard that New Yorkers are famous for their sharp heels and oxfords, but if you’re trying to get a lot done in one day, comfort is key. You’ll fit in just as well in cute sneakers or sturdy, low-key walking shoes, and you’ll be grateful for them at the end of the day., New York’s climate is modified by the whims of the Atlantic Ocean. It can play host to extreme temperatures and surprising weather patterns. Pack clothes that are appropriate for the time of year you’ll be visiting, and make sure to look at the forecast for your trip before you leave.


New York in the summer is hot, humid, and sunny. Pack skirts and dresses, light shorts and pants, a sweater or jacket for chilly air conditioning, sunglasses, and sunscreen. Light shoes are good, but avoid flip-flops--they won’t keep your feet safe on crowded or dirty sidewalks.In the winter, stay warm. Wear a wool or down coat, and add sweaters, thick tights and pants, and sturdy boots. Layering is a classic element of New York winter style, and it’s practical in fluctuating temperatures., If you plan to shop for anything--souvenirs, presents, or vintage clothes--don’t stuff your bag when you pack to leave. Instead, designate some room for your purchases.You can also roll up a light duffel and tuck it in your luggage, then fill it with your new purchases.

, Do not walk around with a huge bag full of unnecessary items. They will weigh you down in ever sense of the word. Pick a low-key, practical bag, and keep it close to you.


You may need a small wallet, your cell phone, a map, and a camera for the day-to-day.
Don’t forget recorded essential information (like the name of your hotel and any major planned activities).
Bring a phone charger with you. You may need to purchase a plug adaptor for it, if you're visiting from another country with outlets different from American standard ones., Chances are you will be trying to see as many places as possible and will be walking a lot. Don’t let yourself get too hungry or thirsty, or you could get burned out. There are usually plenty of carts and shops that can offer you a quick bite, but it’s smart to travel with food options, too.


If you have a refillable water bottle, bring it. NYC tap water is safe and drinkable.Bring nonperishable snacks that don’t get squished easily. Try dried fruits, nuts, and energy bars.Remember that snacks are not a substitute for lunch, so don’t rely too heavily on them.

, New York City trains can take you nearly anywhere you want to go, as long as you can figure out how to use them. You can navigate with a map, but there are many smartphone apps available that are user-friendly and offer information that maps can’t (for instance, if there is construction happening in a particular station).Citymapper is reliable, and even tells you the best subway cars to ride in.Transit works for many different American cities--you might be able to apply it to your own city, too.Wheely helps if you have any mobility restrictions or needs., Cash is universally accepted by NYC’s famous yellow cabs. Also, vendors across the city have drinks and snacks available all day for cash purchase. If you’re looking for an ATM, you can ask at your hotel’s desk--they’re also a common feature in bodegas and greengrocers.

",How to Ride the New York City Subway," Check for service advisories. Most stations also have special lists of service changes, indicated by a black and yellow label entitled ""Planned Service Changes"" located on most island platforms (where trains arrive and depart on both sides of the platform) behind a subway map, at or near station entrances and exits, and next to the ""Waiting Areas"" at most stations. Have a subway map handy to interpret the notices.

, The current fare is $2.75 when using a Pay-Per-Ride MetroCard ($3.00 for a ""SingleRide"" Ticket: Valid for ONE (1) ride within two (2) hours purchase with no out-of-system transfer to a bus).

, It will take you on average 2-4 minutes between every stop, plus 5-20 minutes for every time you have to wait for a train. A simpler method is to leave at least 45 minutes before you must be where you are going. However, the longest trips can take up to an hour and a half - so be careful.

, Entrances that are always open have green lights, known as ""Globe Lamps."" Exit only or part-time entrances have red globe lamps, or may not have any lamps at all. Some private properties have subway entrances. However, some entrances are within private properties, and these entrances are not always visible from the outside. Also noting, some entrances are mono-directional, meaning that they only serve an entrance to a platform for boarding trains to one destination. This usually happens at stations without an underpass or overpass to transfer to the opposite platform for return service. There are some exceptions to this, as unlabeled overpasses and underpasses are present (like Bleecker Street on the (6)), mostly at transfer stations or stations with a central fare control area.

, However, carrying a map on the subway is like tattooing ""IDIOT TOURIST"" on your forehead. Nearly all train cars and stations have maps on the walls and station ""Customer Information Centers,"" so a map is not really necessary.

, To locate merchants that sell MetroCards, simply go here. All MetroCard Vending Machines accept debit and credit cards, but only some (the larger ones) accept cash. The minimum purchase for a NEW Pay-Per-Ride MetroCard is $6.50 (2 rides) including the new MetroCard fee of $1.00, however you may refill a Pay-Per-Ride MetroCard with a minimum of $0.01 at station booths and with a minimum of $0.05 (and $0.05 increments) at MetroCard Vending Machines and a maximum of $100.00 for both means. You may refill cards with both time (Unlimited-Ride) and value (Pay-Per-Ride). Please note that MetroCard Vending Machines only dispense up to $9.00 in change in coins ONLY, can accept up to 30 coins of any type per transaction (the coin slot then closes), and credit/debit card purchases must be at least $1.00. Pay-Per-Ride MetroCards allow for one free transfer from subway-to-bus, bus-to-subway, or bus-to-bus within two (2) hours of the first swipe; ""SingleRide"" tickets do not allow transfers and must be used within two (2) hours of purchase, except if used on a bus (to which you must request a transfer from the operator). Unlimited-Ride MetroCards allow use once per 18 minutes. If you try to use an Unlimited-Ride MetroCard within 18 minutes of your swipe, the turnstile screen will simply read ""JUST USED."" If you put $5 or more on your card, you will get an 11% bonus ($5 will get you $5.55 good for 2 rides, $10 will get you $11.10 good for 4 rides, $20 will get you $22.20 good for 8 rides). Your best bet may be to buy a 7-Day ($31) or 30-Day ($116.50) Unlimited-Ride MetroCard depending on your length of stay. Unlimited-Ride MetroCards are active for 7 or 30 consecutive days from the first day you swipe the MetroCard and expire at midnight of the date that it is set to expire. Unlimited-Ride Metrocards can not be shared due to the 18 minute time limit. MetroCards are valid for both subway and bus service 24/7/365.

, Train line signs are present on the overhead platform signs (denoting a synopsis of the route, destination, and part-time service if any), the front and sides of trains (color of the text and sign may vary if it is an old or new train), and in directional signs at entrances and waiting areas. Make sure you get the right number or letter and check if your arrival station is a full-time station. One thing that makes the NYC Subway a bit different from other systems is the Uptown/Downtown/Queens/Brooklyn/Bronx/Manhattan directional indicators. Rather than denoting direction by destination (as in London, Paris, etc.) entrances and platforms in Manhattan will say ""Uptown and the Bronx/Queens"" or ""Downtown and Brooklyn"" although sometimes just ""Uptown"" and ""Downtown"" (or simple the terminal) for trains terminating in Manhattan. Uptown roughly corresponds to North and Downtown roughly corresponds to South. This is opposite in Brooklyn. Be sure to know whether you are traveling Manhattan-bound, Brooklyn/Bronx/Queens-bound, uptown or downtown before entering (few trains travel crosstown). On the 7 train, the trains destination sign says either Manhattan-34th Steet or Main Street-Flushing. On the L train the trains, electronic display says either 8th Avenue-Manhattan or Brooklyn-Rockaway Parkway.

, Local trains (typically) stop at every stop along a line, while express trains skip some stops. Express trains are usually in the inside platforms/tracks or the lower level. Sometimes, there are platforms for express service but the express is only one-way. So watch out. Only 3 stations in the entire subway system have a separate platform for express trains (Atlantic Avenue - Barclays Center on the 4 and 5, 34th Street – Penn Station on the A, and 34th Street – Penn Station on the 2 and 3) as opposed to having uni-directional platforms for both local and express trains. With the 6 and 7 trains, check the side of the train to see whether there is a green circle or red diamond on the older trains. A green circle indicates 6 or 7 local (making all stops in the Bronx or Queens respectively), a red diamond indicates 6 or 7 express (making express stops in the Bronx or Queens respectively). On the newer trains, there will be a circle or a diamond on the top of the front of the train (it will be red regardless of the shape).

, People will get very angry if you block their way getting off the train.

, This will make more room in the car for the other passengers.

, If you have to stand, however, move all the way into the car and stand on either side, not in the middle. Face the seated passenger with your feet perpendicular to the seat bench and hold on.

, Staring at other passengers will be seen as a sign of aggression, and you may get an aggressive response. It is also likely that the person you're staring at will be very creeped out.

, Making small talk on the subway with complete strangers is not something generally accepted.

, That, coupled with the genuine panicked look on your face, often results in a kind and observant passerby making up the difference. Asking people for money, on the other hand, will only earn you contemptuous glares or being ignored.

, Ask the Station Agent for help if one is available in the area. If there is none, run your fingers along the black strip to make sure there are no bends and try again...eventually, either someone may swipe you through or else you should give up and get another MetroCard until you can speak to an agent. If the station agent can't help, they will provide you with an envelope (Business Reply Envelope: BRE) to mail in the card. Allow 4 to 6 weeks for the MetroCard to be processed. For faster service visit the MetroCard Customer Service Center located downtown Manhattan at 3 Stone Street between Whitehall Street and Broad Street.

While it is within blocks of the New York State Capitol building and Governor's Mansion in Albany, you will also find, down the hall, an entrance to elevator that will lead you up to the 42nd floor observation deck of the Erastus Corning Tower (North) . This observation allows you to see for many miles including sights of the Northern portions of Albany and points North including Saratoga Springs and (if you look rather closely) parts of Schenectady to the West.

Alongside that, you also have several museums and planetariums in the nearby city of Schenectady, such as the smaller Schenectady Museum/miSci and planetarium (with several shows daily) .
You'll find a mess of AHL (Albany Devils) and college-league hockey and college basketball (and sometimes even the Harlem Globetrotters come) games at the Times Union Center, along with several opera and performing arts performances at The Egg - a good walk from the New York State Museum.
A little outside and a quite a drive away, you'll find the outer-banks of the Catskill Mountains and can enjoy sightseeing in the city of Troy. If you want more museums, there's also the National Baseball Hall of Fame about a good 50-60 minute drive away in Cooperstown, NY, or if you'd like to drive even further (3 1/2 hours), there's the The Strong - National Museum of Play in Rochester, where retired toys take center stage in a museum setting..
Near the New York State Museum, you'll also find the destroyer war ship called the USS Slater that you can go visit. While very few people go and visit it on a daily average, you can go there if you have money on you. They provide tours, but you should really ask ahead to ensure someone will be there to help you, as they have a very weird schedule of only being open for 6 hours for 5 days of the week (Wednesday thru Sunday).Albany is about 2+1/2 hours (by train) away from New York City and it's major sights. However, the Albany-Rensellaer Amtrak station (the only passenger train that departs for the city from here) is across the Hudson River in Rensellaer, NY and you'd have to take a taxi or other ride-sharing program (such as Lyft or Uber) to get to the train station where you'd be boarding an Empire Service line coach to New York City or surrounding areas just North of it. Albany's train station is a terminus of the Empire line heading South to New York City but is also a central connector for other lines coming from the North and West and in fact has two separate ""buildings"" where visitors ""disembark"" or load to/from their train. Travel to New York City by regular car may take more than 4-5 hours (depending on traffic).

;
, Most often, this museum is open Tuesday through Sunday 9:30am-5pm. However, it is closed on Mondays and for a few holidays, including Independence Day (July 4), Thanksgiving, Christmas Day (December 24) and New Years Day (January 1)., Although routes will vary if you don't like interstates, the New York State Museum is inside the New York State Cultural Education Center at 222 Madison Avenue, Albany, NY 12230., This state museum has two main parking areas (both labelled P3 on the North and P3 on the South).

Out of five total underground lots underneath ""The Mall"" from the arterial, P3 on both sides is set up for visitors. The other lots are set up for employees and an overflow lot for employees. You can get to this arterial route off of the US-Routes 9 & 20 exit off of Interstate 787 which can be accessed via Interstate 90 or from a little further away at the other end from the New York State Thruway (I-87). This parking lot is great on the weekends when parking is freeand rarely is ever crowded, but bad thing is: most often on the weekdays (when Congress is in session), these lots are closed to the public.
During these weekdays, take the arterial around the bend near S Swan Street and exit off of P1 South. P1 will look like it's another underground lot when you see it from the arterial, but this isn't the case. Follow that back out to Madison Ave. Take a right at this controlled traffic area on Madison Ave, past the light underneath the overpass that leads to the Cultural Education Center and the New York State Archives on your right and the Museum on your left until you get to the next traffic light. Turn left at that second light. Your parking lot will await you at that intersection. You'll still have to pay either $5 or $10 (dependant on the time you choose to enter) and this area isn't surrounded by an underground ceiling, but it shouldn't be all that well packed with other cars.)

Don't stop anywhere's in P1 South, unless an employee of the building or grounds tell you it's okay. There are signs prohibiting you from doing so in this section at any time, however you'll see cars that are doing so. These cars are the cars of the employees of the parking lot agents. However, this area is a one-way area and isn't wide enough to accommodate any more than one car through it at any one given time..


You can stand your car to unload passengers under the overpass near the Museum (near the traffic light), but don't attempt to park on the street near or at the traffic light. It's illegal to park there and you will be towed if you do! However, since you'd technically be coming from the other side and Madison Ave has oodles of cars crossing from the opposite direction, this can be a confusing mess to the first-time visitor. There's really no place to turn around to head back the other way until you venture around the area, don't try unloading any passengers coming from this side if you ride down Madison Ave while trying to get to the parking area.

, This walk may differ from the location of each of the parking areas that exist that you may/may not have come from for your visit.


If you are coming from underground ""The Mall"" parking lots, you will need to walk to the museum using the long footpath. There are murals and paintings and sculptures down the path, but there is tons of walking here. Grab your best walking sneakers if you choose to walk from this parking area/lot - there are rarely any motorized carts that can transport you to/from the Museum if you parked inside the underground level on a weekend day. Inside the parking lot, you'll need to go from the parking lot level up a few levels to the Mezzanine then walk the path which will lead you to stairs and a back entrance that will force you to take an escalator or elevator. One part of the hallway is wide, and you can sometimes hear an echo if you talk loud enough and if no one is talking nearby (this is essentially the hallway that is below Madison Ave and a fair compromise for having to walk across busy Madison Ave if you end up being accepted in). Then take the elevator or escalators back up to the first floor and you'll arrive at the Museum's back entrance from behind the Information Desk.
If you are coming from the Madison Ave Lot, you'll see the building directly in front of you as the white building and you won't have to cross the busy S Swan Street to get to the other side. The side with all three-four hanging signs is the side you'll want to be on and the side where the Museum is located at.

, This museum is focused on two floors. While most museum-goers take in the first floor, don't miss the fourth floor gallery with the free New York State Museum Carousel, too. There's a tiny cafeteria on the 3rd floor if you can take the escalators, but the elevators won't stop on the third floor with you in it., As you arrive, you'll walk into the building and see the rather expansive Information Desk. Once you walk in, you'll initially see one entrance on your left and one entrance on your right. Towards the back of this, you'll initially see escalators that take you up to alternate levels as well as a walkway to a pair of elevators that can take you up, along with leading you to a walkway to where you'll find the restrooms that can take you in, as well., This museum is divided into several different sections with one center imaginary ring that is U-shaped. Yes, it's got its West Gallery which features an art gallery and Huxley Theater if you go through the one entrance. If you go through the entrance near the Museum Gift Shop (how this guide was set-up), you'll see the ""(New York State) Museum Shop"" at first glance and, after turning the corner, the Fire Engine Hall and World Trade Center areas. The Museum calls these sections Fire Engine Hall, New York Metropolis, Gallery Space, Native Peoples of New York, Adirondack Wilderness and more gallery space towards the end.

If you'd like to bypass the Native Peoples area and Gallery Space East, you can cut through the Birds of New York (yet another section designated on the printed map altogether) area that will allow you to get out and move around the New York Metropolis area. However, the Native Peoples area is well worth a visit to get a really accurate picture of what New York State's Native Peoples exhibit really means to New York State. Unless the Museum is planning to close within an hour or hour and a half, try to stop by there.
The big Gallery Space near the back changes rather seasonally. However, there are a few items that never change, such as the Mastodon's location (as you'll learn about a little later).

, Although much larger years ago, this area houses eleven historical fire engines, one fire-related item and one 1999 Ford-branded ambulance that was used in New York City shortly after 9/11/2001. Although you'll have to pass into the New York Metropolis area in back of the World Trade Center exhibit to get there at first, it's actually marked as being it's own separate area on the map. It's large and filled with older historical-licensed ambulances and fire engines galore (including one ambulette that was given to the Museum in 2001 following the loss of the World Trade Center), but it does have several older style fire engines from the 1800s onwards.


There are multiple fire engines being viewed here dating as far back as a 1791 Tub and a 1875 Parade Carriage., Whether it's the large piece of steel that was pulled from the rubble at the former World Trade Center, or one of the many other pieces, this is an interesting place to obtain information on this horrible tragedy that killed multiple thousands of people on that horrific day of September 11, 2001.

,,, The Museum was able to obtain 2 pews and has been on display since 2015.

On signs in the area, you'll find note about fencing that was given to the Museum, and although years ago it existed, the fencing can now no longer be found to the average visitor.

, Such things include name badges, keys, door plaques, and much, much more., This area is diverse and takes up the majority of your time in this Museum.

, You'll have to either go up several stairs, of if you can signal a Museum employee for help, they can help you up an small personal elevator to and from this Subway train.

Read some of the many New York City subway-affiliated motif on the wall nearest the subway car on display. or one of many other similar train and subway information placards on the walls (including a copy of the Subway maps as they appeared in the 1970s and 1980s).
Imagine yourself rocking to-and-fro from the handholds of the Subway car as the car turned a corner in New York City at the city's slightly-slower (but still high) speeds banking around a curb.

,, Here, you'll find the neighborhood near where the Robinson family sometimes entered and exited as well as where Oscar and his trashcan is. However, this area is barricaded off. Look at the TV where it is showing a video montage of information relating to the show.

Although you can see this area from the top of the steps of the Subway car, it is best you see this up-close for the full feeling of the exhibit.

, Although it is still on display, there is no longer a placard denoting it's use nor is it inuse as it once was (a Museum employee used to get in and operate the elevator).,,,,,,, Though not too popular a place for pictures or a selfie, it is a spot where some folks actually take pictures. If you've passed the Crossroads Gallery or the Birds of New York exhibits, you've gone too far.,, This is often an important stopping place for some., However, this section is tricky to find and some of this is set back in from the main path, it's sometimes impossible to find the way in to view it., Although this changes often, as of July 2017, this area was devoted to Ice Ages and artifacts/bones from this time period. However, this area has no sign calling it the ""Crossroads Gallery"". It does have signage to the gallery type on display at the time you pass through.


If you come across the Woolly Mammoth in your trek' (although there's no chance of missing this dino'), you've gone too far! There is one bench near the Mammoth, but several people walk past him and admire his reasoning on this Earth.

, If not, you can pass through and see the Cohoes Mastodon. This area changes seasonally. As of June 6, 2017, there's a new ""Ancient Life of New York"" gallery in this area, but it's only under renovation right now with no anticipated date of re-opening announced just yet.


As you walk past, you can pass by Birds of New York on your right, as well as the Fossils exhibit, and if you look way off into the distance, you can also spot Discovery Place on the other side. However, you might not be able to see it with the pillars and signage in the way from the Birds of New York section.

, You will more likely encounter the Woolly Mammoth area (if you came in from the East entrance near the Adirondack Wilderness section, the effects of the Wooly mammoth will increase tenfold for a small child and can sometimes be overpowering enough to scare them gratefully, however, they can sometimes be reassured that there's a glass separating them and be ultimately reassured that the Mammoth is dead and is stuffed now).

, Go inside if you'd like and listen to the traditional story ceremony that is told at the one head of the longhouse.




As signs say, do not place or climb onto the beds outside the enclosed space. Doing so may make the longhouse topple over and down.









,, This area contains stuffed birds of New York, including the cardinal, blue jay, bluebird, house wren, orioles and many others. If you walk towards the area called Fossils, you've walked in the wrong direction and have to retreat back the other way.


There are plenty of large benches to sit down on in this area, but you will still have a little more to go, if you'd like to experience all there is to see and do at this museum.

, Although there are two entrances in the Birds of New York section, head back in the direction of the Native Peoples exhibit, but pass into the Adirondack Wilderness section as this section will also enter you into.

,,

Look at the various walls worth of minerals found in New York state in the Minerals of New York section of the Adirondack Wilderness section.

, You can look at things such as their moose or deer that they have there.,, It features some signs that were used as remembrances of family members that became deceased or were thought to have been deceased following the September 11th, 2001 attack. However, in respect to those who died, try not to photograph the inside of this trailer.,, It can be found near the entrance to Birds of New York., Inside Adirondack Wilderness (behind your back when facing the Elk Pond), you'll also find an area devoted to logging. (If you'd like to donate paper cash instead, you'll find a special box for this near the Information Desk in the Main Lobby.), This is often a place to find an amateur photographer (or photographer-to-be) taking a selfie or a group shot of people. Historical markers like the one you see inside the museum called State Land dote the landscape of New York when the area has some historical significance.

Take a few seconds to look into the ""Prehistoric Wilderness"" section to the right of the Elk Pond.

, It seems like it's always closed; it's got a curtain up to prevent people from entering and it just isn't something people will want to visit (if they get in)., Here you'll find an area devoted to kids' play activities including a huge Checkers mat with large Checkers pieces.

, Although in May the West Gallery is free to Bank of America debit card-holders, it can easily be passed up if you don't like art very much.

, Keep the Museum Shop in mind for later, if you plan on going up to the 4th floor gallery as well. The Museum Shop is small, but contains quite a lot of items in a lot of different travel-oriented categories. Prices a tad on the expensive side, but the quality of the products will differ over the time the museum thinks the product will need to last.

, There is a bank of three elevators in the center alcove behind the main lobby's Information Desk. However, if you desire more space and can tolerate going up an escalator a flight or two, you will find an additional three elevators starting on the third floor.

On the third floor, you'll find a rather small cafeteria where you may eat. However, the selection of snacks they serve here are rather limited.

, Take a right off the elevator and walk straight back. If you pass by 1931 Pierce Arrow/Hansom Cab and the Plow/Wall Street area, you'd be going the right way to get there.

Rides on the New York State Museum Carousel are free but you can donate if you'd like. Donating is easy and they do take in and use every dollar you give to them to improve in exhibits and gallery space. Most people feel like after they've gotten off, most people want to ride again (and again and again). As a general rule of thumb, rides begin boarding every eight minutes, but you can ask the Carousel attendant and they'll tell you how long you'll need to wait to board.
There are signs near the Carousel that people weighing less than 225 pounds are allowed to sit on a horse. However, they do have stationery ""carriages"" that have no weight limit.
According to one of the signs on one of the walls, there is only one word on the whole entire carousel. It will be on one of the stationery carriages. While this should be easy to spot, see if you can find out what it is and spot it.

Think ""son of Greek goddess"" (Neptune) when looking around to find it.


Look out the window as the Carousel circles around and around and around again. You can see gorgeous views of the City of Albany, including The Egg and several other nearby popular venues.
If you walk and arrive at the Reception Desk (with a museum security guard), you've gone the opposite way to get there and you must pass through the elevator area walking back the opposite way.

, There's a whale scull, sailplane, and 1932 Packard, as well as a Conservation Department plane down one side. Down the other, there's Wall Street (including an old-styled) Automat Machine (from Hand & Hardart) and a Plow blade. Near the elevators, you'll find a 1931 Pierce Arrow car as well as the Hansom cab (horse-drawn carriage meant to be used as a taxi).

While the Wall Street area may seem to be a great place to take a picture when you see what types of museum pieces it has, it's got improper lighting and some additional wall-pillars that destroy the effects of the area.
Throughout the 4th floor exhibits you'll see some international flags that are flying. You can take a picture of these, but these aren't the best pieces on display on this floor's gallery space.

, (It's tail number is N397R8)., They might not be too major in the museum, but they shouldn't be missed either.

There used to be a Subway Sandwich Shop on the fourth floor (later replaced by a ""Salamanca Back Bar"" but now this whole entire area is quartered off by large colored-tall screens and this dining area no longer exists.)

If you do not have any friends or acquaintances in the city, visit online communities or message boards to ask questions and seek advice before your move. If someone you know has moved to NYC recently, ask them for any information or resources they can provide.


For example, you could ask: ""Can you tell me about the transit system in your area?"" or ""What do you wish you had known before moving here?""

, The basics of life are more expensive in New York, for the most part, so you should make sure to have extra money in the bank before moving there.Between paying any costs associated with leaving your current residence, hiring movers, paying a security deposit on a new place to live, and getting set up with new utilities there, the move itself will be quite costly as well. To truly be prepared, you should start saving as far as a year in advance of your move.You should compare your current and expected costs of living and determine whether this is a relocation you can afford at this time., Ensuring that you will have a job in your new city is of the utmost importance. Get the ball rolling on finding employment by preemptively sending out your CV to New York employers. Even if you don't find a job before your move, it is wise to get to work on the job search before the stress of moving can distract you.To increase your chances of getting a job this way, try leaving your current address off your applications, or use a local New York address.Look for opportunities in areas that interest you. New York is famous for being a hub for finance, banking, and communication, but if your interests are not aligned with that, it's still a place ripe with opportunity., Communicate in your cover letter that you will pay for your own travel expenses for potential job interviews or a move to NYC. This will demonstrate your enthusiasm and present you as less of a financial liability. Be clear and optimistic in how you word this. For example, you could say: ""I am more than willing to cover the expenses incurred to pursue an opportunity to work at your company."", To connect to possible employers in the city, join a career networking site like LinkedIn to make contacts virtually. Put effort into building a profile that sells you as a qualified job candidate to employers and job recruiters. Be sure to connect with NYC-based companies that seem interesting to you., NYC has hundreds of distinct neighborhoods to choose from, situated in its five boroughs. These communities are unique and feel like small cities of their own. Research, explore, and follow your gut feeling to choose the right area for you. Some popular neighborhoods in NYC are:Greenwich Village: one of the most expensive neighborhoods in New York; home to NYU and Washington Square ParkSoHo: a gentrified lower-Manhattan neighborhood full of art galleries and upscale shopsFinancial District: home of Wall Street, One World Trade Center, Federal Hall, Battery Park City and the 9/11 MemorialMeat Packing District:home of the Chelsea Market and Whitney Museum of American Art, and a prime neighborfood for fine dining and nightlife
Tribeca: known for the Tribeca Film Festival, Scour Craigslist and ""for rent"" ads, or hit the pavement to find a new apartment in an area that you like. Be prepared to spend a bit more on an apartment than you budgeted for; many NYC renters require you to make 40-50 times the monthly rent and require a guarantor's signature if you don't.Broker fees also apply, more often than not, and are usually 15% of the yearly rent.Don't hesitate too long before signing a lease on an apartment that you like; they go very fast.

, Transportation is a big issue in NYC, so consider your daily and weekend transit needs before choosing an apartment. Check if there are buses that stop nearby, how far away subway stations are, and how easy it is to get a taxi.


Aim to be close to a subway, particularly if you find a job far that is from your desired neighborhood. You can search the subway map on the MTA website: http://web.mta.info/maps/submap.htmlKeep in mind that even transit-friendly areas are subject to major delays on weekends., Before you choose an apartment, look into the safety of the neighborhood. Ask potential neighbors about the area or look up crime statistics online.You should also visit the neighborhood at night to see if the atmosphere is a lot more different after dark than it is during the day., To make sure that you're comfortable in the neighborhood, consider subletting an apartment for a few months rather than signing a year lease right away.Subletting will also allow you to avoid paying broker fees and skip the credit check portion of the apartment search.Finding a sublet is fairly simple by way of Craigslist and other online listing websites. Searching through social media in general or asking friends who live in the area are other ways of finding a sublet., To avoid last minute stress, work out all of the details of your move weeks in advance and pack as early as possible. Get quotes from at least three different moving companies, look into their credentials, and book one right away; work out your own travel for the move to NYC early as well to ensure that you arrive at the same time as your belongings. If you are renting a truck instead, book just as early and find friends or family to take the trip with you to help., If you are moving to NYC before you have an apartment lined up, rent storage space to hold your belongings once you arrive. This is also an increasingly popular option for inhabitants of the city who simply want less clutter and more space.Make sure to work out the rental in advance, as the demand for storage is currently greater than the supply., If you will be arriving in NYC before you have an apartment to stay in, arrange for a place to stay in the interim. Look well in advance to find accommodations, and do some extra research to find cost-effective options. Instead of hotels, consider short-term room rentals through sites like Airbnb, hostels, academic housing, and couch surfing."

Know what summertime in NYC is like.,
Bring the right shirts.,
Pick your bottoms wisely.,
Bring some dresses (women.),
Bring a light jacket and some accessories.",How to Pack for a Trip to New York City1," Summer in New York City is hot, hot, hot. Temperatures skyrocket in the months of June, July, and August. Temperatures stay hot, even through the nights when the heat can remain in the 90s (32 degrees C and above.) On top of that, NYC gets very humid. This means thick, sticky air. There are also the occasional thunderstorms that rage violently then subside., Shirts made of breathable cotton work well to combat the humidity and heat. Tank tops and light-material shirts that will catch even a whisper of a breeze are good bets too. Aim for brighter and lighter colors.



For women: Wispy graphic tanks are a cute way to beat the heat while still looking fashionable. Crop top shirts with a high-waisted skirt or shorts are a pretty standard look around NYC in the summertime.

For men: Cotton t-shirts and button-ups are good choices for a summer trip to NYC.

, As stated above, it gets really hot in the summer. That means pants that won’t keep heat in are the way to go. Shorts, skirts, etc. are great ways to combat the temperature. Cotton pants are also an option.



For women: Skirts (including miniskirts, half-cut skirts, maxi skirts, and pretty much any skirt in between) are totally acceptable. Cute shorts made from funky material, high-waisted skirts, baggy cotton gypsy pants--you can’t really go wrong, so long as you’re not wearing thick pants that will make you sweat bullets.

For men: It is a common belief that men do not wear shorts in NYC unless they are playing a sport, heading out on a boat, or going to the beach. Other New Yorkers, however, contest this and say its fine. It really depends on whether or not you care about what people think. Nice boating shorts in khaki or other Vineyard Vines-esque shorts are good. Otherwise, you can stick to breathable pants., Throw a stone in NYC in the summertime and you will be sure to hit a girl wearing a cute sundress. To blend in, bring some light summer dresses in cool patterns and bright colors. Pair it with a floppy hat, big sunglasses, and some cute shoes and you’ll fit right in.


Maxi dresses have been topping the fashion charts for a couple summers. These long dresses are great for hot days and cooler nights.

, While it generally stays warm (or hot,) it can get a bit cooler, particularly after a thunderstorm. A light jacket works well. They are also great for when you dip down into the subway and discover its freezing. You might also consider bringing a hat to wear during the day--that summer sun can be unforgiving. Bangles and funky necklaces also help add style to your wardrobe.

Wait one full week after applying before benefits start accruing.,
File a claim each week.,
Wait three to six weeks before you collect benefits.,
Register for direct deposit or debit card payments.,
Check the status of your ongoing benefit payments.",How to Get Unemployment in New York," The first requirement for eligibility for unemployment benefits is that you are out of work. The loss of your job must not be the result of anything caused by you. You are eligible, for example, if your employer has decided to reduce the size of the work staff, or if your position is no longer needed. You would not be eligible if you participated in some wrongdoing that resulted in your getting fired for cause., While you are working, a portion of your paycheck goes toward state unemployment insurance. You must work a minimum established time to build up your eligibility to collect unemployment benefits. The labor office uses a published table to calculate eligibility and the amount of the benefits that you can receive. At a minimum, to be eligible for unemployment, you must satisfy the three following elements:You must have worked and been paid at least two calendar quarters. A quarter is three months of the year. This requirement does not need to be a consecutive six months of the year, as long as you can demonstrate that were employed for two three-month quarters.
You must have been paid at least $1,900 in one calendar quarter. This is not an overall average. You will be required to show paychecks that fall within a three-month period that total this amount.
Your total payment over four quarters must be at least 1.5 times the amount that you earned in the one highest-paying quarter. For example, if during your highest-paying three month period you earned $4,000, then the total for four quarters (a year) must be at least $6,000 ($4,000 x 1.5 = $6,000).

, If you are, for example, medically unable to work, then you are not eligible to collect unemployment benefits. You must be ready to work and actively in the process of looking for work. If, at any time during your benefits period, you are offered work and you decline it, you risk losing your unemployment benefits.If you are medically unable to work, you still have some options for support. You could file a claim for worker's compensation benefits if you were injured on the job. For this, you would need to speak with the personnel manager at your place of employment. With other medical disabilities, you may qualify for social security disability benefits. Visit the website of the New York Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance at www.otda.ny.gov., You should contact the unemployment office to file your initial claim for benefits as soon as possible, preferably within the first week after losing your employment. The sooner you file, the sooner the unemployment agency can begin checking your information, verifying your claim, and beginning the process to pay your benefits., The easiest and recommended method for submitting your claim for unemployment insurance is by doing it online. You will need to access the unemployment website at www.labor.ny.gov. From that home page, choose “Unemployment Insurance,” “File a New Claim,” and then “Create NY.gov Account.” You will be prompted with a series of questions to create your account. Part of this step will include creating a userid and password, so you can return to this site and manage your account in the future., Alternatively, if you wish or if you do not have access to the Internet, you may file your unemployment claim by telephone. You can call the telephone claim center, toll-free, during regular business hours, 8:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday. The telephone number is (888) 209-8124.Translation services are available if you file by telephone. The recording will prompt you to choose the language that you desire. Information is available in Spanish, Russian, Cantonese, Mandarin, Creole, Korean and Polish. Other languages may be available as well.

, To initiate your claim, you must have certain information available. You should gather this information and have it at hand when you either get online or call. If you do not have everything, you will still be allowed to open your account and file an initial claim, but your initial benefit payments will be delayed until you can provide all the information. The material that you need is as follows:Social Security Number
Driver’s license or motor vehicle ID card number
Complete mailing address, including zip code
Telephone number where you can be reached during weekday business hours
Alien registration card number (if you are not a U.S. citizen)
Names and addresses for all employers for the past 18 months (even if out of state)
Employer registration number or Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN) of your latest employer (this is available on your last W-2 form)
Copies of forms SF8 and SF50, if you were a federal employee in your last job
Form DD14, for separation from military service, if applicable
A check from your bank with the routing and account numbers, if you wish to register for direct deposit.

, After you complete your application for unemployment benefits, you must wait one full week before your benefits will begin. This week is termed an “unpaid waiting week.” If you work during this week, your benefits will be delayed and you will be required to serve a second unpaid waiting week., Each week while you are collecting benefits, you must claim your benefits. This is also referred to as “certifying for benefits.” You can claim your benefits either online or by telephone. Most people claim their benefits on Sunday of each week, for the week that just ended. Whichever method you select, you will be asked a series of questions to verify your continuing eligibility. You must answer all questions truthfully.To claim your benefits online, visit www.labor.ny.gov/signin. The first time that you visit this site, you will be prompted to create an online account. You will create an online userid and password to open your private account. Thereafter, you will just need to enter the userid and password to go directly to your account.
To claim your benefits weekly by telephone, call (888) 581-5812. A telephone recording will prompt you to provide your personal identification number (PIN), and then answer the certifying questions.

, After the single unpaid waiting week, your unemployment benefits will begin to accrue. However, you will not actually receive payment for at least three or up to six weeks from the date of your initial claim. This additional time allows the state to confirm your eligibility and verify the amount of your benefits.Although you are not yet receiving payments, you do need to continue submitting claims each week.

, Unemployment benefits are no longer made by check. The only two formats for collecting your unemployment benefits are by direct deposit into your bank account or through an automatic debit card. You will need to register for one of these two methods before your payments begin.Sign up for direct deposit on the unemployment office website at www.labor.ny.gov. From that site, select “Unemployment Insurance” and “Claim Weekly Benefits.” Then enter your own account information. Once into your account, you can manage how you will receive payments by providing routing number and account information for your bank.
To claim your benefits by debit card, you will need to make your initial request by telephone or through the online account. When you file your initial claim request, you will need to inform the labor office that you wish to be paid through a debit card. You will be issued a card within seven to ten days, which will then receive automatic updates when each week’s benefits are issued.

, You can use your online account to verify each week’s payments. Log onto your account at www.labor.ny.gov/individualreg to monitor your account. You will see when your payments are deposited, either to your debit account or to your checking account. If you notice any discrepancies with payments, you can submit inquiries through a secure direct message system."

Decide who's going to buy what you're selling.,
Narrow your focus.,
Put yourself in the customer's shoes.,
Test the market before you launch.",How to Start a Business in New York City3," Whether you're opening a jewelry store or a scrap metal yard, your market determines most of your other business decisions, like choosing a location, advertising, and capital investments. Before you rush into making expensive purchases you might not need, analyze your market thoroughly. First, decide who is going to buy what you're selling. Ask yourself:When people buy what you're selling. Do they buy it at a certain time of year or at a certain time of life? For example, jewelry is purely a luxury item. People don't buy jewelry before they've bought groceries or paid rent, so if you were opening a jewelry store, you wouldn't want it to be on a street in a warehouse district; it needs to be in a place where people go when they want to spend money, like a commercial district.
Why people buy what you're selling. Do they buy it out of necessity or whimsy? Not only does this influence things like location, it also influences marketing. For example, people don't need cupcakes, they just want them. So if you are opening a cupcake shop, you might want to locate it in a place where lots of people inclined to indulge their wants, like children and vacationers. You might want to market it in places where people are feeling good, like sporting events, fairs, and festivals, so they associate your cupcakes with good memories.

, Once you've got a general idea of who your buyers might be, narrow the focus as much as you can. You can expand in good time, but a new business won't be able to effectively be all things to all people, so you need to target groups that you understand and have access to.Going back to the jewelry store example, you know generally when people buy jewelry and under what circumstances, but that's not a very sharply focused target market. But a jewelry store that targets young African-American men in Queens making between $30,000 and $60,000 a year is sharply focused on a particular market. If that's your target, it gives you an idea of who to market to, where to open, and what kind of inventory to buy.

, Once you've got a specific idea of who your target market is, put yourself in their shoes. Consider what the features and the bugs of the buying experience are and how you can improve on them.Instead of just thinking about what the buying experience entails, actually go through the motions of buying your product at several of your various competitors' establishments.Take notes about your experience. Think about where it was frustrating and where it was rewarding; if there's a disconnect between why the customers buy and how the sellers market and sell. Then see where you can make improvements.

, Before you dive in, see how deep the water is. Test your assumptions with a low-cost test run. Once you've got the results, modify your strategy accordingly, discarding what doesn't work and keeping what does.For example, if you're launching your cupcake bakery, offer free samples at public events. See what people like and what they dislike and change the menu accordingly.

Know what fall in NYC is like.,
Pack with the cooler weather in mind.,
Bring some jackets and sweaters.,
Gloves and scarves are great for chillier days.",How to Pack for a Trip to New York City2," The months of September, October, and November are some of the most pleasant months in New York City. The sun shines more often than not, but the air becomes cooler and loses its humidity. By November, nights can dip below freezing, while days remain pretty chilly., This means light, long or quarter-sleeve shirts, button-down shirts, and pants. Dark colors blend in and look good at this time of year.



For women: Combine a warmish dress with sweater-tights, boots, and a cute jacket. You can also try combining skinny pants with dark colored shirts, a tight leather jacket, and a scarf.

For men: Fashionable pants in dark colors (maroon, navy, black etc.) are good. Wear them with cool sweaters or plaid shirts for a good NYC fall look.

, In a city where fashion is a party of its identity, you may consider wearing your most fashionable peacoats or blazers, though you don’t need to bring your absolute warmest jacket.

, On mornings or in the evenings when temperatures dip considerably, scarves and gloves come in handy. You may also consider bringing a hat.

Know what winter in NYC is like.,
Wear clothes that will keep you warm.,
Remember--a fashionable, warm jacket goes a long way in NYC.,
Be prepared for snow.,
Consider your winter footwear.",How to Pack for a Trip to New York City3," Winter in the city is cold and, more often than not, wet. Snow and sleet grace the streets of New York City throughout December, January, and February. The wind also picks up a bit more in the winter, whipping the chilly air and (potentially) getting your clothes wet., Long-sleeve shirts, sweaters, and pants are the way to go when tromping around NYC in the winter. Go for clothes in darker colors and heavier fabrics. Black is the number one color of the winter in NYC. A winter coat is a must during this time of year.



For women: While pants will keep you warmer, it is also fashionable to wear black spandex pants with over-sized sweaters or cool, bulky jackets. You can also get away with a dress or skirt and some thick stockings--just be prepared to be a bit cold when sightseeing if you choose to wear a dress.

For men: Sweaters or thick long-sleeve shirts and nice, warm pants are the way to go.

, There are plenty of warm winter coats that also look stylish--you should buy one of these if you want to look like a New Yorker. Run a search on your favorite image browser to get an idea of what kind of coats might are in this season. Carry the jacket onto your plane with you--you will want it as soon as you step out of the airport in New York (and they take up way too much luggage space.)

, Gloves, scarves, and a hat are a must when the snow (or, God forbid, sleet) starts coming down. Waterproof jackets are a great way to go--they’re not the most fashionable things in the world, but you will be happy you brought that waterproof, super warm jacket when things get icy.

, Invest in some waterproof boots. Whether they are trendy-looking or just standard winter boots, you will not regret them. When it’s not wet outside, you can wear fashionable boots that afford a little less warmth and protection--just wear some warm socks.

Bring a jacket and some sweaters.,
Don’t wear sweatshirts.",How to Pack for a Trip to New York City4," March, April, and May can be lovely but will still have their chilly and wet moments. It can also get pretty cold in the evenings throughout the spring season., Lighter shirts and slacks are good for this time of year. Spring colors come back into fashion as well, though some New Yorkers stick to black and other dark colors all year round. Plan to bring clothes that you can layer as temperatures can vary greatly in spring.



For women: Lighter dresses come back into favor starting in spring so pack some of them in your bag. Pants with cute tanks and a light jacket are also a staple outfit.

For men: Pants and solid colored shirts with a blazer are a standard outfit on the streets of New York.

, While it does get warmer, its still good to remember to pack some clothes that will keep you warm in the cold evenings. Some ideas include bulky sweaters you can wear over spandex, and light blazers.

, Regular sweatshirts, unless they are distressed, crop-top, or graphically enhanced, are a sure sign you are not a fashionable New Yorker.

Leave some extra space in your suitcase if you plan on shopping.,
Remember your essentials.",How to Pack for a Trip to New York City5," In NYC, dress codes at clubs are fairly common. The problem is that each area in NYC has it’s own distinct style. For the most basic way to get into any club, women should wear cute night dresses and heels; men should shoot for dress pants, solid colored button-down shirts, and a blazer. Of course, when you arrive, you could always scout out some of the clubs you want to go to or visit their website--if you don’t have what they want, it’s time to go shopping. Specific styles in different areas of NYC, as outlined by the New York Times include:


Lower East Side: This area has more of a hipster vibe--lots of skinny denims (for guys and girls) paired with muted colors and natural fabrics.
The meatpacking district: Break out your 5-inch heels and classy, yet tiny, party dresses. Men should dress their best--blazers, dress shirts, unwrinkled dress pants, etc.
The East Village: Notes of punk and a bit of an edgier look inhabit the clothes of the East Village.
SoHo and NoLIta: According to some New Yorkers, you can get away with pretty much any type of fashion in these areas so long as you look fabulous doing it.

, If clubbing isn’t your thing, you will still have plenty of opportunities to dress your best. It’s important to pack some clothes that you look really nice in, be it for a fancy dinner or a night out on Broadway. Ladies, pack a couple lovely dresses and a pair of heels. Gentlemen, pack a suit or a nice dress shirt and slacks for that special evening out.

, You will walking all over the place, and concrete can be pretty unforgiving. At the very least, bring two different pairs of comfortable shoes so that you can switch between the two every other day. Comfortable does mean that you have to forsake style--you can always orthopedics to the inside of your cute boots, flats, etc.If you will die if you don’t wear sandals, at least try to find some with a bit of arch support. Just keep in mind that the streets are pretty dirty--don’t be surprised if you end up with some dirt lines by the end of the day.
As stated above, if you plan on going out at night, bring some cute high heels. While they may be uncomfortable to walk in, they are required at some clubs.

, As with every city, NYC is expensive. Depending on what you are doing while you visit, your tab may be higher or lower than other visitors. You can get a slice of pizza for as little as $3 or you can drop $300 at one of New York City’s many foodie’s-heaven restaurants., New York City has some of the most iconic scenes (like a picture in front of the Statue of Liberty for instance.) You will be kicking yourself if you forget to bring your camera with you.

, If its sunny, there are bound to be New Yorkers walking around wearing sunglasses. Don’t forget yours at home. Sunglasses also combat the brightness of sunlight reflecting off snow.

, Women in New York carry big, fashionable purses during the day. If you are concerned about getting pick-pocketed, buy a big purse with a zipper. Lots of guys also carry messenger bags. However, leave the backpacks at home unless you are a high school student., This is particularly important for fall and spring months but it's a pretty handy thing to have all year round. Summer tends to bring in thunderstorms, and winter is known for sleet. However, if you forget your umbrella, you will have about 1,001 options to choose from at street vendors’ stands.

, Even if you don’t carry it around during the day for fear that you may get pegged as a tourist, it’s important to know where you’re going. Bring one to study during your down time or on the plane on the way there., If you love fashion, you are heading to the right city. NYC is all about fashion and you will have plenty of opportunities to indulge in some serious retail therapy. If you’re hoping to do some shopping, leave extra space in your suitcase so you can bring your purchases home with you.

, While this isn't specific to New York City, it's always important to remember to bring your essentials. These include: underwear, bras, socks, a hairbrush, a toothbrush, any medications you may have, essential toiletries, phone and camera chargers, sunscreen, and anything else you absolutely must have.

Buy a MetroCard for access to the subway and bus.",How to Navigate New York City," This always comes in handy when you're trying to determine the distance between, say, Wall Street and Times Square, or if you just want to know exactly where you are. However, looking at a map too frequently will make you look like a tourist.;
, If, however, you plan traveling further distances around the city, buy a Metro card - similar to something like a bus pass but more flexible - that will allow you to take the subway or bus transportation for however long you need at a price you pay when you purchase the card.

, This will make organizing your finances much easier and will help you avoid overspending.

, Don't just stand around in the middle of the sidewalk and gawk at all the tall buildings. Keep moving, like the rest of the crowd.

, You can put enough money on the card for all the people in your party or you can buy a weekly pass for yourself. When you're done with the card (if it still has a few rides left on it), give it as a tip to the bellman at your hotel.

Forget about avoiding crowds.,
Look for better deals on hotels in mid-to-late summer and the first two months of the year.,
Consider Las Vegas weather if you plan on any Vegas attractions other than casinos.,
See Las Vegas shows year-round.,
Play the odds during Super Bowl weekend or the beginning of March Madness if you're a sports fan who likes to gamble.",How to Time Your Trip to Las Vegas," Crowds are inevitable. Luckily, Vegas there are so many attractions that everyone fits. But here are some tricks that might help:


Visit Las Vegas after Christmas, but leave before New Year's Eve for fewer crowds.
Tuesdays through Thursdays during the week tend to have fewer people unless a convention or special event is in town.
Try mid-morning strolls if you want to walk down the strip unimpeded by crowds.
Avoid three-day weekends and holidays, particularly Valentine's Day.;
,


Hotel deals for Vegas trips may come at the last minute when a hotel is having trouble filling its beds.
Weekdays are generally less expensive than weekends, particularly the week before a major holiday.
The exception to the weekday rule is when people visit Las Vegas for conventions or trade shows.
Check hotel websites for the best hotel deals for Las Vegas travel. Rates are generally posted ahead of time for a few months.

, Remember, the city is in the middle of the desert.


Average summer high temperatures are more than 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Centigrade).
Remember that Las Vegas casinos are very well air-conditioned if you plan on gambling being your chief Vegas attraction.
Humidity is highest in December and January.
Rain is infrequent, but when it occurs, it can be pounding, even resulting in flash floods.
Spring and fall are best in terms of Vegas weather if you like to walk around or want to visit Vegas attractions off the strip.

, Exceptions are:


Seasonal shows end after Christmas/New Year's.
Some shows take breaks right before or after major holidays.
Some Vegas attractions are only open on weekends.

,


Big screen sportsbook televisions are available in all casinos.
Even if you're not a sports fan or gambler, you'll be impressed with the attention that major sporting events get when you visit Las Vegas.

Walk Faster.,
Have Purpose.,
Be Subway Savvy.,
Do not bring large backpacks.,
Step Aside.,
It's Okay to Cross If the stoplight says ""Don't Walk,"" but there are no oncoming traffic, don't be afraid to cross the street.,
Try not to stare up.,
Walk in a straight line.,
Avoid abruptly changing direction.",How to Be the Perfect Tourist in New York City," You've probably heard almost everyone who has been to NYC mention that people walk faster, talk faster, and pretty much do everything faster there. This is very true. Even people who don't have anywhere to be often still walk as if they are VIPs late for a meeting. Faster pace has become an accepted part of NYC culture, so even if you are not in a hurry, you should still speed up your pace and pay attention to your surroundings, especially in crowded areas, like subway stations. Make sure you are not walking too slow or blocking someone's way. You never know if the person you are blocking behind you may really be late for a meeting that could cost him/her time and money. Be considerate and respectful of New Yorkers who are not sight-seeing, but do need to get to work.;
, Whether you are ordering a ""double, tall, extra hot, soy latte"" or a Big Mac, always know what you want before you get to the counter. It is often inconvenient, but try not to ask questions at the counter or take up more time than necessary to order what you need. In most cases, there are New Yorkers behind you who already know what they want and would like to get it ASAP. If the line's moved so fast that you ended up in the front before you know what you want, let whoever is behind you cut until you know exactly what you want. If you have trouble seeing the menu except up front, step to the side so you can see the menu while the person behind you orders.

, Always have your Metro Card in hand before you swipe through the turnstile. Don't stand in front of the turnstile and dig through your bag, while blocking everyone else. When the train comes, let people off first, before you board. (This is really important!) Move in as much as possible and hold your bag/purse close to your body, especially during rush hour. If you find a seat, quickly sit down. When you step out of the train, walk in the direction of the nearest exit. Don't stop in front of the door and look around for signs. Just keep walking until you find the exit. You will figure it out along the way and avoid blocking anybody's way. You really don't want to be the person who blocks the subway door long enough to make people miss the train. Try not to blatantly stare at the other subway passengers. People on the subway generally don't look at or talk to each other unless they're with their own family or friends. Occupy one seat only. Do not eat any food with a strong odor on the train. Your backpack belongs in your lap or behind your legs, not in the seat next to you. If you're lost and think you're on the wrong train, don't be afraid to ask directions. Someone will usually be kind enough to help you.

, You're visiting New York City, not backpacking through Europe. Large, bulky backpacks not only take up valuable space in the subway or on the sidewalks, you might also hit someone with them when you're not paying attention. Stick to tote bags, smaller book bags (like you might use for school), or purses, if you must bring something with you.

, Whenever you need to stop on the sidewalk for any reason (e.g. to check your map, etc.), remember to step to the side. Do not stop in the middle of the sidewalk and make others walk around you. It is extremely inconsiderate to others who are also sharing the sidewalk.

, If you don't feel comfortable, then step aside and let others behind you through, and walk within the crowd.

, Tourists are easily spotted because they walk around staring up at the tall buildings in Manhattan. This can cause you to be a target for theft because you're not paying attention to your surroundings, or you will walk into things and people on the sidewalk. When you're walking down the sidewalk, stare ahead of you but glance up every now and then. If you want to get a closer look, move to the side and make sure you're holding on to your belongings. Distracted people are easy targets for theft.

, The one exception is if you are going around people who walk slower than you do, otherwise you are making yourself a source of annoyance and confusion for everyone behind you.""

, If jumping out to wave taxi, make sure the area around where you're jumping is clear first to make sure you're not a) cutting someone off or (b) about to bowl over someone who is walking in a straight line past you

A high quality umbrella can allow you to stop by and look at the scenery even in the rain.Opt for a durable, storm proof umbrella. You should pack one prior to taking your trip to the falls.
Do not settle for cheap umbrellas. While a $6 umbrella may be convenient if you're caught in the rain, it may not provide that much protection and probably will not last.

, Rain can easily leak through footwear, and no one likes walking around with wet feet. It's a good idea to invest in quality boots if you're going out in the rain. If your boots have a leak, rubbing tile caulk along the seams and letting them dry can fix the issue., After coming indoors on a rainy day, your umbrella will be wet. If you, say, stop to get dinner in Niagara Falls after exploring in the rain, you don't want to walk into a shop with a wet umbrella. Carry a plastic bag to place your umbrella in when you go indoors., Your feet may get wet in the rain. A leak in your boots or shoes could develop while your out walking.

You can find a sample quitclaim deed here: https://nevadaescrowofficer.com/Downloads/SAMPLE-Nevada-QuitClaim-Deed.pdf.
Remember that any form you find on the Internet still must comply with your county’s formatting requirements. You should stop into your county Recorder of Deeds office and ask about requirements. If you don’t follow them, you may be charged more when you file or the deed might be rejected.;
, If you want to type up your own quitclaim deed, then open a blank word processing document. Set the font to something readable—Times New Roman 12 point works for many people.


Your county may have specific requirements for the page layout. For example, in Carson County, the quitclaim deed must be on 8.5” by 11” paper and have a one-inch margin on both sides and on the bottom. There must be a 3” by 3” box in the upper right hand corner., At the very top of the document you need to insert required information. Remember to include the following so that the quitclaim deed will be legal:


the assessor’s parcel number, which you can find on the current deed or by asking the Recorderthe name of the person filing the deed
the address where the deed should be returned after being recorded, The county recorder also won’t record a quitclaim deed unless you tell them where the statement of taxes should be sent.You can type in bold “Mail tax statements to” and then insert the name and address.Don’t forget to include this information.

, Put the title “Quitclaim Deed” in bold and center it between the right- and left-hand margins. You can make the title in a larger font, such as 14 point, so that it stands out., With the deed, the owners (the grantors) convey the property to the grantee for money. The amount of money is called “consideration.” You should have an opening paragraph that identifies the parties and states that consideration was given.


For example, you could write, “For a valuable consideration, receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, Melissa T. Banks and Arthur C. Banks hereby remise, release, and forever quitclaim to Andrew X. Smith, of 1111 South Winship Avenue, City, Nevada, the property in Nevada, described as….”You should be sure to include the address of the grantee.

, You should have pulled the legal description of property, which you could find on the current deed. You then need to insert the legal description onto the quitclaim deed.The legal description is usually stated in metes and bounds. For example, it might read: “Commence at the SE Corner of the East 1/2 of West 1/2 of Section 12, Township 2 East and run E 0 degrees….”, You might have to provide the name and address of the surveyor who prepared the legal description if no prior document has been recorded with that legal description.For example, if you bought half of someone’s property, then that particular portion has not been recorded before. You would need to provide the surveyor’s name and address in this situation.
However, if you buy someone’s entire parcel—and that parcel has been recorded before—then you don’t need to provide the surveyor’s address. Instead, you can cite the document number from where you got the description., You need to date the quitclaim deed, so include the word “Dated” and then a blank line so that you can write in the date., In some counties, you will need to submit an affirmation for the quitclaim deed to be filed. You should check your county’s requirements by asking the county recorder.


For example, in Esmeralda County, you should include the following: “I, the undersigned, hereby affirm that this document submitted for recording does not contain the social security number of any person or persons.”, You must sign your deed in front of a notary public. Accordingly, you should type in an appropriate notary block at the bottom of your document. Also leave a space for the official notarial seal.The Nevada Secretary of State’s office has sample notarial language, available here: http://nvsos.gov/sos/home/showdocument?id=1836.

, You need to include signature lines for all of the grantors to sign the deed, which they must do in front of a notary public. You can find notaries at the courthouse, the county recorder’s office, and at most large banks.


You should take sufficient personal identification to show the notary, such as a valid state ID or a passport.

, Take the completed deed to the Recorder of Deeds. Ask if you need to complete any other paperwork. For example, you probably will have to complete a Declaration of Value form.You should be able to complete all required paperwork at the Recorder of Deeds office.
You should also take a self-addressed stamp envelope so that the recorder can return the document. This will speed up the return., You must pay a fee to file a deed with the county recorder. The fee should be $14.00 to record the first page of a quitclaim deed and $1.00 for each additional page.However, you should call ahead of time to check about the amount and acceptable methods of payment.

, You may also have to pay a transfer tax. Both the grantor and grantee are responsible for paying the tax, so talk ahead of time about how you will divide the amount. The tax must be paid before the deed will be recorded.Fortunately, there are exemptions to the transfer tax. For example, transfers to most family members are exempted., If you are the buyer/grantee, then you should receive your copy of the deed within a couple of weeks after it has been processed. Store it in a safe place.

There are plenty of people who elope in Las Vegas in the heat of the moment, but you might regret your decision if you don't consider it carefully. Keep in mind that your family and friends might be hurt by your elopement if they were expecting a wedding., You might feel ready at the age of 17, but Nevada law requires that each person be at least 18 years old to get married. There some special circumstances that allow minors to get married. In most cases, however, you need to be 18.You can marry at the age of 16 in Nevada with a parent’s consent.

, You will need to get a Las Vegas Marriage License. Obtaining a marriage license is particularly easy in Nevada. You and your partner must bring proof of identity with you. You can download and print the marriage license application from the Clark County Marriage Bureau's website, but you must bring it to their office in person.The office is open from 8AM to midnight daily, including weekends and holidays. Keep in mind that you may have to wait an hour or more on busy holidays.
The proof of identity can be a passport, driver’s license, or social security card.

, Many chapels in Las Vegas will have someone there that is authorized to officiate the wedding. If you’re eloping in a chapel, a clergyperson or court clerk is allowed to officiate the wedding. Keep in mind that on holidays, like Valentine’s Day, many people will be eloping and you may have to find someone in the private sector to do the job., Residents of a country other than the U.S. can get married in Las Vegas, and the procedures and fees would be the same. Marriages performed in Nevada are recognized worldwide, but your home country may require a special document called an apostille to finalize your marriage. Apostilles are issued by the Nevada Secretary of State., The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority's website lists 49 licensed wedding chapels. You look up “weddings” in the Las Vegas phone book or do your own online search. While you can always find someplace to get married at a moment's notice, you should reserve a date and time if you have want to elope at a specific site, since that Garden Gazebo Chapel you want may be booked way in advance.Some chapels are more traditional and others are more fun. For example, at some chapels, you can be married by an Elvis or Marilyn Monroe impersonator.

, Eloping in Las Vegas is usually all about the chapels, but going to the courthouse is also an option. If the courthouse is busy, you can try city hall. The marriage will still be legal., Maybe there’s a pretty spot in Las Vegas where you and your partner could imagine saying “I do.” Hiring or asking someone to officiate the wedding is another option outside of a chapel or courthouse. Some wedding venues around the city may have an elopement package.Many wedding venues in Las Vegas will have an elopement package that comes with a wedding planner, limo transportation, flowers, hotel accommodation, etc. Call a venue to see if an elopement package is available.

, Eloping doesn’t usually involve planning, but some planning can happen if you want to involve friends and family. Choose a date and location within Vegas for the nuptials. You don’t have to send out invitations. You and your partner can simply give your friends and family a call and ask if they can be there., Unless you live in Las Vegas, traveling will be necessary. Think about these plans ahead of time if possible. Decide if you will go by car, plane, or bus. This is a special day, so treat yourselves if possible! If you have the means to treat yourselves, purchase first class tickets and enjoy a glass of champagne or other beverage during the flight., The ceremonies are typically pretty short when you elope, so long vows won’t be necessary. Still, you should discuss what vows you’d like with your partner. You can go with traditional vows or write them on your own., First, check to see if the venue has a dress code. If not, dress however you’d like. This is your and your partner’s day, so don’t let tradition get in the way if that’s not what you want. You can dress “traditionally” for your wedding or choose a theme. For example, you can dress as superheroes or dress in a Western theme.You can go as casual as a pair of pants and a T-shirt or choose to wear a wedding dress or tuxedo.

, You should also think about how you would like your hair and makeup to be. Would you like a simple updo, a curly style, or sleek and straight hair? For shorter and more masculine styles, consider if you’d like your hair combed back or styled with gel for volume., If you wear makeup, consider if you’d want natural makeup, like nude lipstick and light blush. Or, consider more dramatic makeup, like false eyelashes and red lipstick. You can also go as you are without planning., You don’t absolutely have to exchange rings, but it is something you should consider before the ceremony. Talk about it with your partner and make a decision together. If you decide to exchange rings, obtain them before eloping., The ceremony may be a spur of the moment decision, but that doesn’t mean you won’t want the memories to last a lifetime. Many chapels will have a wedding photographer available that can be rented by the hour. If a family or friend is present, ask them to take photos if a photographer isn’t an option."

Move to Texas.,
Change your address of record immediately.,
Live in the state for six months, if you are seeking a divorce.,
Calculate taxes based on when and where you earned income.",How to Become a Legal Resident of Texas4," Many people may want to move to Texas because the state charges no income tax.There are also other legal reasons to establish residency in Texas, such as to get a divorce. In order to benefit from these tax and legal incentives, you need to be a resident of the state first.


Texas is one of the few states in the country that divides assets and debts equally between spouses during a divorce. The is called a ""community property"" standard., This means changing the address on your driver's license, car registration, voter registration, and mailing address as soon as you can. Some of these address changes will require documentation, such as mail proving your address, and some should be done before others. Usually, it's best to change your mailing address first, including on bills, so that you get mail at your new address that makes changing the others easier.Changing your address of record quickly will help you to establish when you became a resident. For issues that require you to have been in the state for a set amount of time, this will begin that amount of time.

, In order to get a divorce in Texas, you need to have resided in the state for six months.Additionally, you need to file in a county that you, or your spouse, has lived in for at least ninety days, so don't move from county to county often.If you are in the armed forces, any time serving outside of Texas if you were already a resident is still counted as Texas residency for the six month residency requirement.
If the person you are trying to divorce has lived in Texas for the last six months but you have not, you can still file for divorce there. You just need to file for divorce in the county they reside in.

, The date you moved to Texas may have an impact on your taxes, as long as your income is generated in Texas as well. However, if you earned money in another state, you will need to pay taxes on it, whether you are a Texas resident or not.If you live in Texas but work across the border, you will need to pay non-resident taxes in the state you work in.
The lack of income taxes in Texas is made up for in high property and sales taxes. So, if you have a lot of income, moving to Texas for tax purposes may be worth it. However, if the amount you would pay in income taxes elsewhere is less than you would pay in property and sales taxes, then lack of income tax might not be a good reason to move to Texas."

, Download either Form 2301 or Form 2301-NB. The first form is for private individuals and the second is for state employees who will apply with no bond.


To access Form 2301- (Application for Appointment for Texas Notary Public) go to: https://webservices.sos.state.tx.us/forms/2301.pdfTo access Form 2301-NB - (Application for Appointment as Texas Notary Public-No Bond) go to: https://webservices.sos.state.tx.us/forms/2301-nb.pdf, You can either fill out this form online, and then print it out, or print it out first and fill it out by hand.


You'll need to have a social security number, an email address, a work address, and either valid state identification or driver license.
Make sure that your name is consistent of all these forms of documentation.
If you have been found guilty of a crime that was neither a felony, nor involved in moral turpitude, you are still eligible to apply, but you do have to note this on the form and provide documentation of your court order and sentence, papers pertaining to release from probation, a statement of the nature, circumstances, date and location of the crime and whether the case is under appeal or not.

, If you are a private individual, you must provide proof of a $10,000 surety bond and obtain a signature of the surety provider.


There is a section on Form 2301 where the surety company has to fill out and sign that you have taken out the bond, so don't forget to bring it with you so that you can have this signed in person.
The surety bond is common for many official offices, and is meant to act as a guarantee that you will perform your duties honestly and faithfully as a holder of ""public trust.""
The surety bond covers associated costs that may arise if you fail to correctly perform the duties of the public notary, or that arise directly from your notarial acts.
This bond must be provided by a surety company and/or insurance company licensed in the state of Texas. The bond must be in the amount of $10,000., The fee covers the processing of your application materials.


You can pay this fee by filling out Payment Form available at https://webservices.sos.state.tx.us/forms/payment.pdfYou can pay by personal check or credit card, though the credit card payment is subject to a 2.7% transaction fee.,


If you are going to mail the documents, send them to: Notary Public Unit, P.O. Box 13375, Austin, TX 78711-3375.
If you happen to be Austin and want to deliver them in person, go to James Earl Rudder Office Building, 1019 Brazos, Austin, TX 78701.
It's always a good idea to make a copy for your own records. For a little practice, and to make the copy ""official,"" you can even have this done by a Notary Public of Texas to see one in action!

, The notebook is a public state record, and is it a requirement.


Blank notary public notebooks are widely available for purchase.
Be as complete as possible, and follow the guidelines recommended in the commission packet you are sent by the Texas Secretary of State.

, A notary seal is required in Texas, and must conform to Texas Governmental Code Section 446.013. The wording, size and shape and design of the seal are very important. See http://www.sos.state.tx.us/statdoc/notary-seal-list.shtml#tex for the details., The fees for notary public services are set by the state of Texas in Texas Governmental Code Section 406.024, which can be found at http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/SOTWDocs/GV/htm/GV.406.htm , Your commission lasts for 4 years, but you should renew it 90 days (3 months) before it expires. For renewal, follow the same steps in Becoming a Notary in Texas, above.

, People may lodge complaints against a notary public at any time, and the Texas Secretary of State can revoke a public notary commission at any time., This is one bill you want to pay on-time or earlier, because a lapse in your bond coverage puts you at risk for being dismissed and your commission revoked.

Choose the means of transportation.,
Book your hotel in advance because there are not very many hotels in Buryatia.,
Visit the Ivolginsky Buddhist Monastery which is the biggest Buddhist temple in the former USSR.,
Take photos of the Lenin's head - the biggest Lenin's head in the world.,
Visit Lake Baikal and try to swim in its cold and transparent water!,
Try the Buryat cuisine which is approximately the same as the Mongolian cuisine.,
Visit Buryatia in different seasons.",How to Travel in Buryatia," It's possible to go by plane, because there is an airport in Ulan-Ude (the capital of Buryatia) or you can go by train, because Buryatia is situated on the Trans-Siberian railway. If you travel by plane from Moscow to Buryatia it will take you approximately 5 hours to get to Ulan-Ude. If you have enough time, you can go by train and you will be impressed by the vast territories of the Russian Federation, which is the biggest country in the world, but it will take you up to 4-5 days to get to Buryatia from Moscow. You can also take a train from Mongolia and China to Buryatia.;
, This is especially important if you plan your visit to Buryatia in summer. Summer is the high tourist season in Buryatia, especially July and August. The winters are cold in Buryatia (like everywhere in Siberia) but you will be surprised by the fact that a short summer in Buryatia can be really hot. The temperature in July can be up to 100 degrees Fahrenheit or 40 degrees Celsius above zero.

, Nowadays the Ivolginsky Monastery is the center of Buddhism in the Russian Federation. It is situated not far from Ulan-Ude - (approximately 40 minutes drive by minivan). You can't leave Buryatia without visiting the Ivolginsky Monastery.

, It is considered to be the symbol of Ulan-Ude. It is situated in the center of the city at Soviet Square. It's the most unusual monument of Vladimir Lenin. It's only the head of Lenin and nothing else.

, It is nicknamed the ""Pearl of Siberia"".

, It's a nomadic cuisine based on meat and milk products. Try the famous Buryat meat dumplings made on steam called buuza in Buryat or pozy in Russian. These Buuza-Pozy are sold everywhere in many restaurants and cafes in Buryatia. You can also try Russian Siberian cuisine, Chinese cuisine and different cuisines of the former USSR including Uzbek, Armenian and so on

, The wintertime in Buryatia is entirely different from the summertime. Try to be adventurous and see the real Siberian winter in Buryatia and Lake Baikal covered with ice!

Keep physical affection to a minimum.Whether it is romantic or platonic, make sure that you keep a respectful distance.,
Keep your hands either in front of you or in your lap.,
Do not beckon or point with your index finger.,
Greet the elderly formally.",How to Be Polite in Taiwan1,"


Handshakes are becoming more common; however, if other people are bowing or nodding, do that instead.
It is never appropriate to touch anyone on top of the head. Even children and infants’ personal space should be respected.;
, The American tendency to spread out with the arms and elbows is considered rude. People in Taiwan prefer their personal space-- it is even considered rude to take a bus seat facing someone rather than an open seat that faces forward. This applies to legs as well. Keep your feet on the ground, and do not cross your legs in an obtrusive way.

, Point and beckon with an open hand, with your palm facing toward the ground or to the side. Beckoning with an open palm to the sky is considered rude or bad luck.


This may not seem like a small point, but Taiwanese people are quite offended by it. You may also be surprised at how often you do it.

, Greet them first, and always follow their cues-- if they do not put their hand out to shake, do not attempt to shake their hand. Put your right hand on top of your left fist and raise both hands to your chest. You can also bow.


Hierarchies are very important in Taiwan, and the elderly garner the most respect. Always pay attention to their needs and never invade their personal space unless asked. "

Expensive alcohol and tea are safe gifts, especially at a dinner event. If you decide to get your hosts another item, make sure that you have multiple.

Check it out here. Most immigrants will need a visa of some kind, allowing them to live and possibly work in the UK for a certain amount of time. Once you know which type to apply for, get started at visa4uk.fco.gov.uk. It's best to allow several months for your visa to get approved.


If you need more information, the rest of this section explains the immigration and travel requirements in detail. Otherwise, skip ahead to the next section.
The United Kingdom is the state made up of England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. You do not need a visa specific to England.;
, If you are a citizen of any country in the European Economic Area (EEA), you have the right to live and work in the United Kingdom. This includes all countries in the European Union, plus Iceland, Lichtenstein, and Norway. Citizens of Switzerland also have this right. However, the Brexit referendum on 23 June 2016, which resulted in the British people voting to Leave the European Union (51.8% in favour) could lead to the EU freedom of movement rules being no longer valid in the next few years.All you need is a passport to prove your citizenship. While not required, you may also want to apply for a registration certificate. This may help you prove your rights when applying for various benefits.Family members of European citizens who are not themselves citizens must still apply for a visa. They can apply for permanent residency after the citizen family member has worked in the UK for five years., Search at monster.co.uk, fish4.co.uk, reed.co.uk, or indeed.co.uk. If a UK company wants to hire you, you can apply for a visa. How long this lets you stay depends on your job:Tier 2 visas are available for high-demand fields, listed in detail here. You may also have a chance if you are transferring within a multinational company, or if your employer can demonstrate that your job cannot be filled by a local worker. These usually allow three years of residency, extendable to six.
Tier 5 visas are temporary work permits good for 6 months to 2 years. If you are not qualified for a Tier 2 position, look for work in a charity organization, or work as an athlete, entertainer, or religious worker.
Tier 1 visas are only available to people starting a business, making multimillion pound investments, or recognized as leaders in their field. They're typically good for five years and can be extended to ten.

, You must speak English and have enough money to support yourself.You can stay until you complete the course, plus a few months. You will only be able to work in jobs required by your coursework., There are a few other ways to enter the UK for more than a short tourist visit. These require special circumstances, most commonly the following:


Family (variable length and work status): Available if joining a spouse, fiancé(e), partner of two+ years, or child. Also available if you need to be cared for by a family member in the UK.UK ancestry visa (5 years, can work): Must be a Commonwealth citizen with a grandparent born in the UK.Tier 5 Youth Mobility (2 years, can work): citizen of certain countries, between 18 and 30.Visitor visa (usually 6 months, can't work): A last resort. If you have the money to support yourself while waiting, you can arrive on a visitor visa, then try to get hired and apply for a worker permit. The odds are slim, but you get a vacation if it doesn't work out.

, Look for a hostel or hotel you can stay in temporarily when you arrive, and for potential living situations. You may need to wait until you arrive to sign a contract, but start looking a few weeks in advance for rentals, or a few months if buying. Try sites such as Gumtree, RightMove, Zoopla, or RoomMatesUK. Make sure you know how the property search may differ from your country:


London prices are very expensive, averaging £1,900/month for a 2-bedroom flat (apartment).Consider other cities, or country towns within an hour of a city.
Look closely — the listed rental price may be either weekly or monthly. Feel free to negotiate over the price.If you plan to buy a house, hire a real estate solicitor in the UK first., Before you sign a rental contract, ask which additional fees you will be paying. The cost varies greatly depending on your region and property, but here are some estimates:Utilities: Expect to pay about £120 a month for water and electricity, plus £70 for heating. This is the average cost over a year; heating costs are much higher during winter, and lower during summer.
Council tax: at least £100 per month, but potentially much more.
Television licence: In order to watch live BBC channels (even online), you need to pay £145.50 each year.Television, mobile, and Internet plans vary widely. This is in addition to the licence fee.

, If English is not your native language, start studying before you arrive. Life will be much easier if you can speak, read, and write in English. If you come from the United States, learn British English, as American English and British English have different words. For example, the hood of a car is a bonnet. It may also be a requirement for some jobs, or for applying to become a permanent resident.

, First, check here to find out whether your country is ""listed"" or ""unlisted,"" and for special requirements by country and species. For cats, dogs, and ferrets coming from most areas, you need the following:microchip
rabies vaccination (21+ days in advance)
EU pet passport or third country veterinary certificate (a veterinarian can help with this)
Dogs only: tapeworm treatment
Unlisted countries only: Blood test (3+ months in advance, 30 days+ after rabies vaccine)
Approved travel route and transport agency, listed here. If traveling from a hot climate, you may need to wait for cooler weather.

, Cost of living varies depending on your location. Use expatistan.com to compare your current location to your new home.


If you stay in the UK more than 183 days, you will owe taxes on your income., Public transportation is reliable in London and most other large cities, while parking and gas prices are challenging. If you do decide to drive, click here to find out whether you can use your current licence.


Train travel is common for longer trips, with price and speed ranging from convenient to absurd depending on the route. If you plan on traveling and are over 60 or under 25, buy a discount railcard.
In London, buy an Oyster Card from a tube (subway) station. These give discounted prices on tube, bus, and city rail fares.

, A bank account and associated debit/credit card are usually free. A few of the largest English banks are Lloyds, HSBC, Barclay's, and NatWest.


Ask your current bank whether it has a ""sister bank"" program you can use while in the UK.
You can try opening a bank account from overseas, but you may need to give a UK address.

, There are a couple useful documents a visitor in the UK should have:


National Insurance Number. This is used for tax purposes, and required for employment. Call Jobcentre at 0345 600 0643 to apply.Passport photo (with UK specifications). These are available at grocery store photo booths for £6 or less.

, Emergency medical care is free for all visitors. Hospital visits are free to most visitors, including anyone who paid a one-time healthcare surcharge when applying.For other medical care, it's up to the doctor whether to charge you.You may want to ask several doctors in your area about prices before you choose one.

, Although this may seem like something you can just get used to, it's good to figure out the English version of some words, or you might end up saying the wrong word and getting in trouble! For example: in England, 'fanny' is much ruder than it is in America, as it means something else.

Whether you’re moving there for work, love, or simply a change of pace, take time to clarify your reasons for wanting to move, including how the move will help you reach your life goals. You may find it useful to write your thoughts down in a journal.;
, Where you decide to live will be largely based on why you want to move to Mexico — for example, if you’re moving there for work or love, you may not have much flexibility in where you live. While the climate across Mexico is relatively warm and temperate, there are variations across regions.Beyond weather, you may want to live in a city with more shops, or perhaps somewhere less urban.


The Central Highlands are home to cities featuring cobbled streets, cathedrals, haciendas and other remnants of the Spanish colonial period.The Pacific Coast is home to the Sierra Madre Occidental mountain range, making for wonderful natural scenery, with a coastline featuring miles of beaches, resort cities, farmland, plantations, palm trees and more. It can get particularly hot in the summer months here, making winter the busy tourist season.Mexico City and its surrounding area offer a contrast of fertile valley terrain and all the pros and cons of big city life: art, culture, nightlife, overpopulation (over 22 million people), crime and poverty.The Yucatán Peninsula comprises 3 states (Campeche, Yucatán, and Quintana Roo) for a total of roughly 1.65 million inhabitants. It hosts a growing community of American and Canadian immigrants. Cancún, one of the largest cities in the Yucatán, is the most popular tourist destination in Mexico.If you have the time and money, you might find it helpful to travel around Mexico a bit and test out different areas through temporary housing rentals before deciding upon a more permanent residence., If you do not already have work lined up, you might research the unemployment rates and average wages of the particularly cities that you are interested in. You’ll also want to check out the crime rates and political leanings of your destination cities.


A recent report shows that while Mexico’s economy has recovered from the 2008 recession, unemployment, gross income disparities, and crime (particularly kidnappings and police corruption) remain major concerns. Violence is at its highest in Mexico’s northern border towns.Many expats describe Mexicans as being very friendly, but formal and polite in both dress and behaviour. If in doubt about how to behave, ask the locals.

, This will vary depending on where you live: as is generally the case, rural areas will generally be less expensive than cities. Expect to pay


Between 3,000 and 8,000 pesos per month for an apartment (depending on location and number of bedrooms);
1,200 pesos per month for Internet and basic utilities;
580 pesos per month for a gym membership;
7 pesos for single bus fare into a city center (336 pesos for a monthly pass);
2 pesos per minute for local calls on a prepaid phone plan.Note that mobile phone plans are more expensive than in the U.S. and Europe. To buy an iPhone 5 on a one-year contract with Telcel costs 7,639 pesos, and a plan with 420 minutes, 20 text messages, and 3 GB of data, will cost you 929 pesos per month.For international calls you’ll likely be better off going digital. You can do free video calls with many programs now (including WhatsApp and Skype), and apps like Skype offer monthly unlimited phone plans based on country as well. You just need an Internet connection.



, Read works by Mexican writers (Octavio Paz and Carlos Fuentes are two popular Mexican writers), learn about Mexican artists (Diego Rivera is a popular muralist), watch Mexican films (IMDb has a detailed list of “The 100 best Mexican Movies”)., Buy a Mexican cookbook or look up a recipe for a popular dish online, for example Chilaquiles, Pozole, Tacos al pastor, Tostadas, or guacamole., If you can’t afford to take Spanish classes at your local community college or language centers, consider buying book-CD combos (multimedia learning is much better than simply reading from a book). If that’s still too pricey, there are free language-learning apps available to you if you have a smart phone or tablet (Duolingo is a popular free app).


As part of learning the language, pay attention to body language as well. For example, Mexicans tend to hold gestures such as handshakes longer than Americans or Canadians do. You’ll also want to avoid standing with your hands on your hips or in your pockets.Be sensitive to dialectical differences in the language. There will be some differences from the Spanish spoken in Spain versus that which is spoken in Mexico; there will even be some differences between the Spanish spoken in Mexico and that spoken in the outlying areas.

, As someone living outside of your home country, you will be an “expat” (short for “expatriate”). Joining an online community of expats in Mexico will not only help you prepare for your trip, but will continue to help you once you’ve moved. Through expat forums you can find the best doctors, dentists, hairdressers, grocery stores, or even just make friends with people who will understand your struggles when you have them. , If you don’t already have a passport, you’ll need to apply for one several months before you plan to leave for Mexico.If you already have a passport, ensure that it will remain valid for your entire stay if possible. To live and work in Mexico, your passport must be valid for a period of 1 year after you apply for the necessary visa.


If you’re planning to be in Mexico for three years and your passport is only valid for one more year, you can avoid a lot of hassle by simply renewing it now.
Make sure that your passport has at least a few blank pages in it to accommodate stamps and visas. If you do not have any blank pages, check with the appropriate government agency of your country to see whether you must renew your passport, or whether you can have extra pages added to it.

, Which visa you get depends on whether you intend to work in Mexico.If you do not intend to work, you can simply buy an FMT (tourist) visa through a Mexican consulate or even from the immigration booth after you’ve crossed the border, if you’re driving ($20 USD paid by credit card). If you’re flying into Mexico, the visa will likely be included in the cost of your flight. An FMT visa is valid for 90 to 180 days (roughly 3-6 months); many people stay in Mexico for years on the FMT visa, simply renewing it every 6 months.If you intend to work, but do not intend to make Mexico your permanent residence, you’ll apply for an FM3 (non-immigrant residency) visa. There are 10 types of FM3 visas; to find out which one you require, you’ll need to go to the nearest immigration office or consulate. The fees for the visa will also differ, but you can expect to spend up to $500 USD obtaining one.If you intend to live in Mexico permanently (or at least for the foreseeable future), you’ll need to apply for an FM2 (permanent resident) visa. It must be renewed every year for five years, after which you can apply for citizenship. The cost for this visa will range from $300 USD to $500 USD.For the FM3 and FM2 visas, be prepared for a lengthy application process in which you may need to make multiple trips to the immigration office/consulate.
Also for the FM2 and FM2 visas, you’ll need to show proof of a Mexican address and a monthly income of between $1,000 and $2,000 USD, depending on your situation.

, If you are passing through any other countries on your way to Mexico, you may require a transit visa. A transit visa allows you to pass through a country without staying there.

, As Mexico does not require citizens to hold an international license, you can bring along your license from your home country. After arriving in Mexico, apply for a Mexican driver's license by filling out some paperwork and presenting your visa.


Note that if you drive into Mexico, you must leave in the same car that you arrived in, as this is marked down on your visa., You may wish to consolidate bank accounts into one to keep things more streamlined. You’ll also want to look into signing up with an international money transfer company, which can transfer money from your home bank account to a new Mexican one, usually at lower cost than your bank can.


Note that you can only bring up to $500 USD cash into Mexico by air, or $300 USD cash by land.Along with any cash you bring into Mexico, you’ll likely find it useful to bring at least one international credit card with you., Ensure all vaccinations are up to date prior to the move. Vaccinations relevant to Mexico include: Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, Typhoid, and Rabies., This allows you to have a place to stay once you arrive in Mexico and gives you additional time to search for more permanent housing and job arrangement.

, Unless you are driving a car into Mexico, this will likely be a flight.

, If you will be driving in Mexico, be sure to buy auto insurance. It isn’t necessary, but the consequences of getting into an accident can be serious. You can purchase auto insurance once you are in Mexico; there is no need to buy it beforehand., Once you’re in Mexico you’ll want to get a CURP (Clave Ú nice de Registro de Población) card. A CURP card is an ID card with your name, date of birth, place of birth, sex etc. on it (much like a driver’s licence). You’ll need your passport, visa, and proof of address to get it. You can apply for it at your local municipal branch once you’re in Mexico.You will need this card before signing up for health care in Mexico.

, The relatively low cost of health care in Mexico makes it possible to self-insure, but if you are on a budget you may find it less stressful to purchase health care.The popular public health care plan is through IMSS (the Mexican Social Security Institute).If you work in Mexico you have most likely been auto-enrolled in it through your company, which will take the cost from your paycheck.Depending on your age, the IMSS plan costs up to $350 USD per year.Many expats say that the IMSS health care is fine for aches and pains, but not as effective for more serious conditions. The quality of the care you receive will also depend on specific hospitals and offices; it’s worth looking at online reviews before going in, if possible.


You can purchase private health care through a number of companies. Just make sure that the policy is underwritten by an insurance company.Some private doctors and hospitals may accept the health insurance you have back home. Just be sure to check beforehand.To give you a sense of private health care costs if you were to pay for them out of pocket: Private doctor's office visits can cost between 150 and 300 pesos, with specialist visits ranging from 500 to 600 pesos. Lab tests are up to 2,000 pesos., This will help you decide what to keep and what to throw away while packing. You will also want to think about other factors such as the weather and where you’ll be living — for example, if you know that you’ll be moving around a lot, or that you’ll live in small spaces, you might want to consider digitizing your CDs, DVDs, and Blu-rays so that you’re not lugging those around with you. An e-reader is a space-friendly alternative to books.


Once you’ve figured out what you want to bring with you, decide whether you wish to sell, store, or donate the rest. Note that storage fees can add up, so if there’s something you simply can’t get rid of it might be worth shipping it to Mexico.
If you choose to ship some of your items, look for quotes from shipping companies at home and in Mexico to get the best price. (Be sure to look at reviews for each company, too, before deciding on one!)

, Things like art and furniture can be brought into Mexico duty-free as long as they were bought at least six months before entry, but you cannot bring in live predator fish, dead fish of any kind, and certain drugs, including medical marijuana.FM3 visa holders have the one-time option to import $5,000 USD worth of personal household items into Mexico duty-free for a $100 USD fee.If you decide to take advantage of this, you’ll need to ensure that you clearly mark each box and provide the Mexican consulate with a list of everything you are shipping, including serial numbers of electronics.
Unless you're from America, if you’re planning to bring electrical appliances, the electrical voltage requirements may not work for most of the larger appliances. Lower-voltage items, such as MP3 players, will typically adjust. If you are coming from Europe, it is best to sell them and purchase ones once you arrive. This can save you on moving costs.

, If you have cats or dogs, they will need health checks and signed certificates of their health by a veterinary professional, dated within five days of crossing the border. The certificate will also need to show that your pets have received their rabies vaccinations.Your local Mexican consulate will be able to inform you further.


Birds are more difficult to travel with as they require both paperwork and lengthy quarantine periods that can cost a minimum of $600 USD.If you have any other types of animals that you hope to bring with you, consult embassy/government sites for specific details.

, Try to make your new home as comfortable as possible. If you’re on a budget, be smart about what you choose to spend money on. Don’t skimp on things that affect your health such as a good mattress and pillow, for example.

, If possible, don’t jump into work right away. Take a few weeks to get out, wander around your neighbourhood, and explore your new home. Find your new favourite cafe or restaurant. Go on trips around the country. Really get to know it.

, Figure out the locations of your local grocery stores, doctors, pharmacies, vets (if you have pets), transit etc.

, It can be isolating living in a new place, especially if it’s just you and not any other friends or loved ones. Joining a group activity (book club, recreational sports team, community centre classes) will help you make friends and feel less lonely. Be proactive and do this soon after you’ve arrived, rather than waiting until you feel sad.

, Take language classes, go to cultural events. Keep growing and learning. Take advantage of this move!

, Being apart doesn’t mean having to lose touch. With social media and programs like Skype, it’s easy and cheap to keep in touch with loved ones. Starting out in a new place is exciting but it can also be very difficult. Having a good support network will keep you going when you’re struggling.

Give your full attention to what you’re doing.,
Look for the narrowest strip of road.,
Be very wary of motorcycles.,
Take advantage of traffic jams but keep an eye out for motorcycles trying to squeeze between vehicles.,
Take advantage of meridian islands, street light posts, and any barriers.,
Have infinite patience.,
Look for stop lights, if any, but also consider the hour.,
Cross only where you have a clear view of oncoming traffic.,
Know what time of day it is.",How to Cross the Road in Indonesia," The immediate concern is the lane nearest you and a little less, the next one. To think of the entirety of your undertaking is like proposing to live a lifetime in a day: you just can't do it.;
, Scout about 100 yards (91.4 m) or more upstream and downstream of where you want to cross. The narrow portions usually result in backed-up traffic which chokes vehicles and motorcycles. They also give you the shortest distance to the road median where there are slightly better odds of safety.

, They are the unpredictable factor of road traffic and are likely to be aggressive and downright deadly. They will gun their engines at the slightest hint of open space so stay alert even when crossing a space that has opened between larger vehicles. Other than Jakarta, motorcycles are also tolerated by the police when they ride on the wrong side of the road, including sidewalks. So, when crossing, look to both sides of the road, regardless on the lane you are on.

, This means that even when you’re squarely on one side of the road going in a particular direction, you have to remain alert for motorcycles when crossing between the lanes of that side, even when the cars have stopped.

, Stay behind them, particularly when caught by the traffic light. Be willing to stay on the meridian if stranded there, but heaven help you––try to never be caught at an unprotected meridian.

, Do not force a crossing when your mind and your gut tell you not to. This may sound like New Age advice, but you’ll know when it’s not right to cross.

, Traffic lights are usually respected during work hours and when the cops are around. Nevertheless, stay wary and don’t bet your life on the light. Expect motorists to be trying to beat the light.

, Avoid blind curves just after stoplights, and do not cross where the road bottoms out from an extended downhill drive.

, At certain times, traffic cops will allow vehicular traffic to go the wrong way, just to ease the volume. You have to know when they have done this as regular traffic will switch lanes at those times, or the traffic cops will have drifted off to other sections of the road, and you could get squished for being unaware the traffic direction had shifted.

Consider serving as a volunteer.,
Work seasonally as a campground host at national parks, campgrounds or resorts.,
Generate income through the Internet.,
Teach English overseas to non-native speakers.,
Save as much money as possible to meet income shortfalls.",How to Make a Living While Traveling," Begin your travel income research by listing a complete inventory of things you can to do to make money traveling. Having a portable skill is vital to funding your adventures and can be anything from teaching subjects such as English or music, to growing and harvesting crops on an organic farm.;
, If your most valuable and natural talents are something you no longer enjoy, consider strengthening your skill sets in less familiar areas. Your favorite unpaid hobbies can be something that an organization will pay you to do, such as gardening or teaching music.

, Extended travel websites such as TransitionsAbroad.com and GoAbroad.com are information portals for learning how to find short and long-term overseas jobs and obtaining work Visas for everything from internships in non-profit organizations to information technology work for international companies.

, Most volunteer positions can last a few weeks or several months and often help build connections that can lead to paid work.


Assist a humanitarian aid group or other non-profit organization. These organizations conduct various projects ranging from building sanitation facilities to providing medical care. Many will pay volunteers' basic living expenses.
Set a time frame for finding paid work while volunteering and budget enough money to cover costs if your volunteer stipend runs out.

, If you prefer to travel by RV, you can often find paid work that provides a small wage and oftentimes a free RV parking space with full hookups.


Allow yourself at least three months to work at a recreation facility, especially during summer. Many outdoorsy destinations are only open from June through August and ask workers to remain for the entire season.

, Working online using your current skills is one of the easiest ways to make money on the road domestically but can be expensive while overseas.


Consider developing a blog related to your specific travels. This can allow you to document your journey while generating income through online advertisers who pay you based on the number of people that click through their ads on your site.
Research connectivity options for your travel itinerary then consider ways you can set up a virtual office for income-generating opportunities in travel-related information.

Acquire a Teach English as a Foreign Language (TEFL) degree from an academic institution. Many overseas teaching institutions prefer for teachers to have this certificate before instructing students.
Prepare to stay in your destination for several months. Teaching English overseas requires a long term commitment of at least a semester and sometimes longer.

, Most people sacrifice some of their current standard of living in order to take extended travel trips. Since the pay scale for many temporary, travel-oriented jobs falls short of a more secure, long-term job, always have extra money saved to cover unexpected expenses and small luxuries you want to enjoy while traveling.

This only works if you can be admitted and pay for a school of course.
It is best to choose a school and/or degree that makes it easy for you to get a job. Technical majors will find it easier to be sponsored for a visa by an American company.

, A green card gives you permanent residence in America while a Visa is temporary. However, most people will get the work visa first, move to America, and then apply for a Green Card after some time.

,, You may want to hire a lawyer to help you navigate the different visas, or trust in your company HR department.


The Specialty Workers, or H1B Visa is designed for immigrants who wish to work in a specialized field. Ask the company you are applying to if they will ""sponsor you for an H1B."" Many companies will. They will need to pay about $25,000 in lawyer costs, but if you are in demand, it may be worth it to them. If you are unsure, you can ask them ""if they will sponsor you after 6 months if things are working out well.""
The Temporary Skilled or Unskilled Workers, or H2B, Visa is provided for immigrants who want positions that are non-agricultural but are temporary in nature.
The Intracompany Transferees, or L1, Visa is for immigrants who will be working for a company that has operations in America.

Employment-based Preference Visas are for those immigrants who are already employed, as this visa must be requested by the employer.

, Countries that are very friendly with the USA typically have better arrangements.


The E3 Visa is designed for citizens of Australia who are employed in America in a specialized capacity.
Canadian and Mexican citizens can apply for a TN Visa. Special instructions for Canadians can be found here.


, Entrepreneurs should examine the Choose Between L1 or E Visa to Set Up a New Business in the U.S L1 and E Visas. E2 Visas are well known because they allow you to get a Visa by simply investing money in a USA business, but note it does not have a path to a green card.

, Choose several cities that you find appealing. You can probably find somewhere jobs for you are plentiful, and that you'd like to live in as well.


Look for cities that have affordable housing and living costs, a wide selection of jobs, available housing, good healthcare facilities, and schools and places of worship adequate to your needs. You also should consider if you have friends of friends or others from your country in that area.
Weather in the United States is quite varied; research the seasonal averages to ensure you are comfortable with the local extremes or natural hazards, such as earthquakes or hurricanes.

,


Look at pay for your profession. Examine the Bureau of Labor statistics regarding wages by section of the country and job category to get an idea of the salary you may be able to negotiate in various regions of the country. You can also look on job search websites such as craigslist.com, linkedin.com, indeed.com or others.
The Occupational Outlook Handbook provides in depth information about job prospects in most major fields. The information is updated annually and includes information about education or experience needed for the type of job as well as an outlook and a general description of job duties.

, Some cities are better than others, depending on what you do.


The coasts, San Francisco, New York, Los Angeles are very expensive. You may find those places attractive if you have a very highly paid profession, such as Engineer, Programmer, Mathematician and so on.
If you have a profession that ""can go anywhere"" such as nurse, school teacher, doctor, you may want to look for a smaller town that is cheaper to live in and may have not enough professionals.
If you are an entrepreneur, you may find smaller towns cheaper, yet less welcoming to foreigners.

, Rent an apartment or house near your new job when you go to America. Know that many landlords consider a foreign tenant to be risky, and you may need to put up a larger deposit or provide more references.


If you sign up for a longer term apartment rental, you will need to put a deposit on the apartment you wish to rent, usually at least 1 month's rent plus a damage deposit.
You may need to provide references and information about your credit rating to potential property owners.
Most utility companies also require deposits before services may begin.

,


A good option is to rent an apartment for just one month while you figure out where you want to be. AirBnB is a good website for this. Craigslist is also good but is a bit more risky. Search for 'short term' and you will see many owners who want to let out their place on short term basis. #*If you know people in the city where you will move, you can ask them directly to stay with them for a short period of time.

, Not everyone gets insurance.


Check with your employer on their health insurance policies. If they do not provide, you will probably want to find health insurance on the open market.

Live that easygoing Caribbean Island lifestyle, even if there is no ocean in view!

",How to Live an Easygoing Caribbean Lifestyle," If you are involved in too many things, and find yourself dreading your next activity instead of looking forward to it- then drop it. The same goes for your classes or your job. If you've tried to enjoy what you're doing but can't, then drop it & try something new. Don't drop school or working all together! Just find something you enjoy and look-forward to.;
, Set some time in your life to reorganize your space and your life. Get a handle on all the projects you wanted to complete & all the chips you've been waiting to dust off your shoulder. Once you're ahead of the game, you'll feel much more relaxed.

, People in the Caribbean are very close with their families, that's why they're always so happy! They put themselves around the people they love & are rarely alone. Sometimes it's good for us to be alone, but having people around us satisfy our social life & make life a little more interesting.

, Once in a while you need to make time for you. Take a day off from work and go to a spa, or just sleep in at home!

, Instead of listening to sad music or lovey-dovey tunes when you've just come out of a relationship, blast some Bob Marley or Bee-Gees, you'll start feeling better just by listening. You can even learn to play your own instrument, it will help express yourself and you'll enjoy it.

, In life there are many things to get us down. If we go down with them, then it makes it even harder to come up. Instead of worrying about all the stresses in your life- tackle them. Don't let 'em get to you! Keep a positive attitude through & through & laugh about the things that bother you. Example, if someone at work is upsetting you or putting you down- don't stress it. The next time you see them let them know instead of avoiding them. Keep smiling through & through & no one can get to you.

, You can't buy your way to heaven, or bring your money to the grave, so don't push it. Making money and saving is very important in life but it should not rule you. People in the Caribbean are not all wealthy, but they're all happy because they don't stress it. Manage your money, and respect it, but don't get carried away by greed. There are more important things in life than money.

, If you find yourself at a boring party- make fun of it! Dance, laugh, tell interesting stories. Never be bored! Always find a way to make someone laugh or at least yourself. Don't take life to seriously, because it's meant to be enjoyed, so enjoy it already!

, Take it easy. Don't hurry, and don't worry. Go along with the flow, and live life in an easygoing, happy-go-lucky manner. Be reasonable & responsible but don't stress it! Enjoy your life knowing that you can't always control everything but you can try! Live your dreams & do what drives you!

Have the proper qualifications to teach.,
Get a college degree.,
You have a degree?,
Next piece of paper you'll need is a CV.,
If you can, have a couple of letters of recommendation handy from someone other than family or close relatives.,
Ask your employer exactly what they need for a police clearance, and get it before you leave your country.,
Do some research on whatever country you are interested in before applying.,
Search the Internet for job openings.,
If you are adventurous, fly out to your country of interest.",How to Get a Job Teaching English in Asia," Just being a native speaker of the language is enough to get you a job at some schools. However, these will be the bottom of the barrel ""backpacker"" type of schools, that will hire anyone with a white face that speaks English. The pay will be very low, you'll have large classes of unruly kids with no supervision, and academic support or materials will be few or non-existent. There will be no work visa, and indeed, if the school doesn't want to pay you, they may even report you to the local authorities for working without a permit, and have you deported. If these kind of working conditions appeal to you, go ahead, pack up your backpack, and ignore the rest of this article. For the rest of you, there are certain qualifications that will make it easier to find a decent job.;
, In Asia, qualifications are everything. You need to have the paper if you want to get a job. It can be in any subject, but one in education, English, linguistics, or something similar is a plus. If you have qualified or certified teacher status, then great. You'll start off even higher on the pay scale. Masters in any subject? You're qualified for the higher paying jobs at universities, International schools, government jobs, or in the Gulf countries. You will find those rare few teachers that are teaching without a college degree.  They've had to pay their dues, and start on the lower end of the scale, at backpacker level or near it.

, Great! Do you have qualified or certified teacher status? If so, skip to the next step. If not, then you'll need a teaching certificate. Sure, as a native speaker with a college degree, you may be able to find a teaching job, but it won't be one you'll want to tell your friends and family about. So invest your time and money in a proper certificate course, either a CELTA or a Trinity College TESOL certificate (see warning below). At the very least, you will be a candidate for a decent teaching position, instead of someone a school will look at only if no one better qualified applies.

, Write it up in Word format. Highlight any pertinent experience you may have had, especially if you are new to teaching. Remember, in Asia, qualifications are everything, so highlight any seminars attended, presentations given, certificates, awards, etc. As for references, just put down ""supplied upon request"", and then have at least three ready when they are requested.

, You have professional references? Don't leave home without them.

, Most countries now ask for a police clearance in order for you to get a work visa. This makes sense, because wouldn't you want to know who it is coming in to your country to teach your children? A police clearance is extremely difficult to get when you are overseas. Save yourself a bunch of headaches, and get it before you leave. For those more adventurous types who will look for a job once they reach their destination of choice, see what is required before you leave, and bring it with you.

, What is the political and economic situation? Are they stable? Is the country prone to earthquakes, floods, and natural disasters? What is the general standard of living in the country? At the very least, check out the CIA World Factbook for an overview. Go to Dave's ESL Cafe, (eslcafe.com) and read the postings on the ""International Job Forums"", and post any questions you may have there.

, The most popular site is probably Dave's ESL Cafe, at eslcafe.com. There is also tefl.com, eslteachersboard.com, esljobfeed.com, and many others you can find through Google.

Determine whether you can get a green card through family.,
Determine whether you are eligible to get a green card through a job.,
Determine if you have fall into the refugee or asylee green card category.",How to Get a Green Card1," This is one of the most common ways to get a green card, an in many ways the simplest. If you're directly related to a US citizen, US immigration law allows your relative to petition for you to be able to live in the US.


Many obtain a green card as the immediate relative of a US citizen. If you're a US citizen's spouse, unmarried child under the age of 21, or parent of a US citizen over the age of 21, your relative may be able to file Form I-130, Petition for Alien Relative.You would then follow up by going through the ""Adjustment of Status"" process to become a permanent resident of the US.The procedure is slightly different for people not already in the United States, and is referred to as ""consular processing""; a visa is administered by the US Department of State, and you would become a permanent resident once you are admitted into the US.
The procedure is similar, but slower, if you are trying to get a green card through an immediate relative who is a permanent resident, but not yet a US citizen.
If you turn older than 21 or get married, your status as an immediate family member changes, and this can delay getting your green card under the ""family"" category.
You can also get a green card through special family situations including being a battered spouse or child, a widow or widower of a US citizen, or a child of a foreign diplomat born in the US.;
, This general category is divided among many subcategories, but essentially entails all instances of green cards being issued for purposes related to a job offer, investment or having a specialized job. Determine whether one of the following situations applies to you:


You've received a permanent job offer for employment in the US. If this is the case, your employer will need to get a labor certificationand fill out Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker.You want to get a green card through investment. If you're an entrepreneur and have made an investment of either $1,000,000 or $500,000 in a targeted employment area, and plan to create at least 10 jobs for US citizens, you can apply for a green card through investment.You'll need to fill out Form I-526, Immigrant Petition by Alien Entrepreneur.
You have extraordinary abilities and want to self-petition for a green card. Very talented or extraordinarily skilled people who are considered to be the best in their field (Nobel Prize winners, top athletes, etc.) can self petition for a green card. This is an extremely rare category.You fall into a special job category. If you're an Afghan or Iraqi translator, an Afghan or Iraqi who assisted the US government, a member of the armed forces, or fall into another special category, you can get a green card that way., If you entered the US as a refugee or an asylee, or as an immediate family member of an asylee, you can apply for a green card 1 year after entering the country.


If you're in the country as a refugee, it is mandatory to apply for permanent status after being in the country for a year.If you're in the country as an asylee, it is not mandatory to apply for green card status.

Look for work in Townwork magazine.,
Check the Townwork website.,
Note that the Townwork magazine is very popular.,
Check the distance of the job from the nearest station.,
Check the qualifications (資格).,
Check the salary (時給).,
Remember that many places require a training time for newbies.,
Check the type of job (職種).,
Check the working time (勤務時間).,
Check for perks (待遇).",How to Find a Part Time Job in Japan," It's a free magazine that you can get anywhere in Japan: in conbini (convenience store), at the station, etc. Remember, there are two types of Townwork magazine. The one with yellow cover is for those who are looking for a part-time job (アルバイト). The one with a blue cover is for those who are looking for a job in a company (社員).;
, There is also a website townwork.net. The jobs are sorted by districts, so you can look for jobs available in your area.


It is recommended that you use the website instead of the magazine, as it's more frequently updated and easier to search.
Another good website to look for a part-time job is baito.mynavi.jp. All part-time job advertisements in Japan have the same format, even the simplest ones must include important information. If you can't read Kanji, it might be a little difficult to understand though.

, This means that most jobs listed in there will be filled very fast. Make sure you are quick enough and good enough to get the job before others.

, For example, 5-minute walk from Shinjuku station would be 新宿駅より徒歩5分. Not all advertisements have romaji, so if you can't read the station's name you should search online for the romaji or hiragana. After knowing the station name, check the distance from it to your house. If it's too far away, you should find another one. Most students either find a place near their house or school, so that they can go to work fast and easily.


If you want to work at night, find an automobile near your house so you can walk or ride a bicycle home, because you might not be able to catch the last train home.
If you live too far away from school, find a place near your school to work.
If you work somewhere also far from home, you'll have to spend too much time a day travelling to work and school alone. That would be a waste of precious time, which you should spend on working or studying instead.

, Most part-time job don't have specific qualifications, so everyone can apply. Some places don't accept high school students, but you don't have to worry about that unless you're Japanese. Some places don't accept foreigners. That you should worry about. An advertisement that doesn't mention anything about foreigners means it's okay for everyone to apply. An advertisement that says they don't accept foreigners mean they only want Japanese people. So when you look at an ad and see the word 外国人, you should check if they are accepting foreigners or not. Don't worry, 99 percent of places accept all nationalities and won't mention anything about it, so you should go ahead and apply. Just remember how to tell if a place is accepting a foreigner or not, in order to save your time and effort.


Remember that all places don't put ""must be able to speak Japanese"" in their ad, because that's a no brainer. So make sure you can speak Japanese before applying.

, Now you've come to the most important part. What's the average part-time salary in Japan? It depends on the location and time:


If you work in busy districts located in the center of Tokyo, expect a salary of ¥900 to ¥1000 yen an hour.
If you work in a less busy areas, you'll receive a salary of ¥800 to ¥850 yen.
Arubaito salary in Tokyo won't be less than ¥800, however you should expect a low-paying job in Yokohama or Chiba.
¥1000 an hour should be the highest amount you can expect if you work during the day. Some places might offer ¥1050-¥1100 yen an hour, but they are very rare and usually have strict requirements. Don't bother looking for a part-time job that pays more than ¥1100 an hour, because it doesn't exist. Only company employees have that kind of salary.
You can earn more by working at night. All private stores and companies in Japan must pay their workers an extra 25% of their salary if they work after 10pm. So if your salary is ¥1000 yen, you'll receive ¥1250 yen to work at night.

, You might have to work three to four months with a low salary as a trainee before they give you an actual salary.

, Remember that not all places let you work at night, unless you work at a bento (弁当-lunch box) store. Due to the nature of the business, the bentos must be prepared at night so it can be delivered to the customers in the morning or noon. For this particular reason, you might not be able to work during day if you choose this type of job. This job requires minimum Japanese skill because you don't have to interact with the customers, so it's very competitive. Most of these places are far from the center of Tokyo, so prepare to spend a lot of time commuting.


If you want another job that doesn't require good command of Japanese, you can work as a delivery man for Yamato.
Another popular type of job is a cashier for stores or restaurants. Convenience stores (conbini) are everywhere and they normally put job advertisement outside the store, so people can see it easily.
Fast-food restaurants like Mac or KFC also hire a lot. This type of job requires you to speak Japanese well because you must serve the customers (接客). So if you think your Japanese is not good enough, you shouldn't apply for it yet.

, Most places have flexible timetable for you to choose the time to work that fits your schedule. All you have to do is tell them what time you want to work and they'll arrange it for you. Some places don't have fixed schedule so you might have to tell the owner (オーナー) or head of restaurant/store (店長) your schedule every week in order for them to set up a working schedule not just for you but for everyone as well. However, some places do have a fixed timetable and they'll let you know when you can work. You should find a job that has flexible schedule so it won't mess up with your daily life.


Remember that most places requires you to work at least three to four hours a day (not every day of the week). Most places know that foreign students can work only 28 hours a week and they'll arrange your schedule with that in mind. But do check it yourself whether the managers give you more than 28 working hours a week, just in case they forget, or you might get into trouble with the Japanese government.

, The most common perks that restaurants might give you is to provide you with a uniform and a free meal during work. Most small restaurants offer free food. However if you work for big fast-food chain stores like Mac or KFC, you might not be offered a meal. Many people prefer jobs that offer them meals so they can save money. Most places offer to raise your salary in time, but remember that it varies. Some places will give you a higher salary when they see that you're doing your job very well. Some places will only increase your salary when you become a manager, which might be impossible for a foreigner. So don't expect too much. The most important treatment, which is better than a free meal, is the travelling expenses. Most places offer to pay for your train tickets, with the maximum of ¥1000 a day or more.

If you are already working in a multinational company or with global brands such as Microsoft, Oracle, Apple, Motorola, Unilever, P&G, Kraft, Pepsi, Coca-Cola, McDonalds, KFC, etc. , then this may be possible. Check within the company's internal jobs database and you will find many global openings worldwide. After you find a job opening of interest, approach the human resources to make an inquiry about it and to ask how to pursue it.;
, If you don't work in an MNC or you totally want to switch fields or industry, you must research in the internet heavily every day. Do research such as googling the more respected jobs databases in your targeted country, and focus where your credentials, your language ability and your working visa will be supporting factors. Example: jobsdb.com, monster.com and more.

, Prepare your language proficiency specifically the one targeted to your country destination. If you need to start learning another language, do what is needed to prepare.

, Prepare your working visa requirements, whether or not you need a sponsor in your targeted country.

Add interesting dialogue.

",How to Begin Your Journey As a Manga Ka,"


Shojo: Girly manga that usually involves moe/cute characters, romance, magical girls or slice of life drama.
Shonen: Manga usually intended towards young boys full of action, violence, ninjas, samurais, demon slayers and very few female characters. If any female characters at all, they are usually womanly side characters or young, tomboyish kunoichi's.
Seinen: A darker, more realistic version of Shounen with less action intended for adults and young adults.
Harem: A serious-plot-lacking manga that includes several female characters with strange appearances and backstories with one, seemingly boring male character anyone could easily slip into. All the females seem to really like the male character, leading an extremely large love-triangle to take place.
Hentai-Manga: Pornography.
Ecchi: Hentai with younger, cuter characters and less of a pornographic and/or explicit plot.;
, A plot is what defines a manga; it is the story that defines the characters whom live in the world you have created. A young elf who was born into a fantastical medieval themed world cannot live in a technology fulled alternate universe with nothing to do but mope around and be confused, with no purpose in life. That is an awkward and strange plot that no one cares to read about. Also, depending on your skill of art, starting with a complicated plot could be disastrous.

, Making characters is often the hardest part of creating a manga. You constantly come upon characters you've created in your past that have a special place in your heart and no matter how Mary-Sueish they seem, you just can't burn them. Then, on the other hand, you have some decent, well-rounded characters that you personally dislike but feel as if they'd be a good addition to the story, overall. But once you understand what makes a good, realistic character, you'll be fine. A male in a shojo-romance typically would be pretty-boyish and kind with maybe a limited set of flaws, however letting a brute-like older man with a kind heart and thing for romance novels be your characters love interest won't hurt you! It'll just add some originality to your story! Also a young, lovestruck girl won't ruin a shonen story, she'll just have to have some traditional, shonen qualities in order to generally be accepted. Don't create stories to shape your characters. Create characters to shape your stories!

, In order to start an interesting, different art style is difficult but will make your fans have a way to identify the manga you make. Start off by copying famous mangaka's artwork the best you can without tracing and then combine styles, fixing what you don't like. Designing characters may take a lot of work but if you have a mental image, go with out!

If you are traveling in a foreign country that has ongoing diplomatic ties with your home country, there should be one or more embassies in the country where you are traveling. The embassy is usually in the capital city. In some cases, there may be embassies in other large cities around the country as well.In France, for example, the U.S. has embassy offices in Paris, Marseilles, Bordeaux, Lyon, Rennes, Strasbourg and Toulouse.
It would be smart, when traveling to a foreign country, to research ahead of time where the nearest embassy will be. Take along the address and telephone number for contacting the embassy, just in case of emergency.
The embassy is the diplomatic office of your country's ambassador to that foreign country. Embassy officials work to form diplomatic ties between the two countries, to assist travelers, and to provide aid in times of emergency.;
, The officials at the embassy should be able to provide you with a list of local attorneys who are willing to help travelers.Be sure to inform the embassy officials about the charge against you, as much as you understand it. Ask about referrals to attorneys who practice that sort of law, and who speak your native language.


You should ask your contact at the embassy to help you in reaching a local attorney, and for advice about the local legal system. Embassy staff are generally trained in the customs and laws of the local country.
Ask your embassy connection to help identify the kind of legal practitioner you need. Different countries use different terms, like ""attorney,"" ""lawyer,"" ""barrister,"" ""solicitor,"" or ""notary."" Find out what qualifications you need in a lawyer for your situation.

, When you have received referrals to one or more attorneys, you will want to talk with them to make your selection. You need to ask the attorney about his or her qualifications, and make sure that he or she can provide the kind of representation that you need. Try to find someone with experience dealing with the kind of charges that have been issued against you.In making your decision, make sure that the attorney you choose is someone with whom you can communicate and is someone you can understand.
Be sure you understand the payment expectations. You need to discuss with any potential attorney the fee for his or her services. Make sure that you understand when payment is due and the form of payment that is required.
Finally, make sure that you and your attorney have the same understanding about the amount of work that will be covered by the payment., In addition to negotiating and handling your case, you will need your attorney to help you understand the legal system in a country that is unfamiliar to you.


Figure out the charges against you. If you did not already understand the charge against you from the arresting officers, work with your attorney to find out. Try to understand exactly what you are alleged to have done, and when and where the event allegedly occurred.
Ask your attorney about the legal system in the country you are in. In many countries, for example, a defendant is considered to be innocent until the government (police and prosecutor) can prove guilt in court. But in many others, there is a presumption of guilt, which the defendant must rebut.Work with your attorney to understand the possible penalties. If, for example, you are charged with something that only has the possibility of a monetary fine, it may be advantageous just to pay the fine and put the matter behind you, even if you did not commit the crime. That could save you from extended legal fees and the possibility of being held in a foreign country against your will.

, Help your attorney review any evidence against you. Even though you may claim that you have been framed, the local police must have some evidence to support their arrest. Work with your attorney to review that evidence. Tell your attorney everything about your travels, so that he or she can try to establish an alibi for you.Prepare for trial with your local attorney. Trial systems are different from one country to another. You will need to rely on your local attorney and his or her advice regarding trial preparation. Assist as much as possible with developing a case strategy, an alibi, and any other defenses that you can.

, Do your best to appear professional and respectful. You may claim that you have been “framed” by the charges against you, but you must treat the system as respectfully as you can. Work with your attorney and the local officials to present the best case that you can. Your case may have a jury or may be tried directly to a judge, depending on the legal system in that country.If you do not yet already know, you should learn how to speak and understand some phrases in the native language for courtroom etiquette. Practice such phrases as ""Yes, your honor,"" ""No, your honor,"" or whatever the judge is called. Have your attorney prepare you in the customs of the courtroom, when you will stand, sit, respond, and so on.

, Depending on the country where you are traveling, and your reason for being there, you may explore whether some form of immunity might apply to you. Talk with officials at the embassy and with your local attorney about this idea. If you can argue that immunity should apply, then you may be released right away.Immunity is a complicated topic, with a range of different levels of coverage. In short, it means that national diplomats, their staff, and their families cannot be prosecuted for crimes in a foreign country. Higher level diplomats and staff members have higher levels of immunity. If you believe you may be covered, you should notify local law enforcement officials of your position, and talk with the embassy staff to help make your case., As an alternative to proceeding with the criminal trial process, your attorney and your embassy might work together to make a deal to have you leave the country. This could be either as an extradition or deportation.


Being extradited generally means that you will go back to your home country and potentially face the same criminal charges there. You will still have to prove your innocence, but at least you could do it in your own country.Alternatively, you might suggest deportation.The country with the charge against you may consider this a victory because it gets rid of you.

, You could have your attorney, your embassy, and even people back at home make a plea for your release and return on human rights grounds. This will depend on the charge against you, the level of evidence, and the potential punishment. The more severe the punishment, the more relevant a human rights plea might be.A noted example is the case of Otto Warmbier, a student from the University of Virginia, who was tried and convicted in North Korea for the crime of ""subversion,"" when he took down a propaganda poster. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison. Immediately following the sentence, American diplomats and the organization Human Rights Watch condemned the sentence and tried to have Warmbier released."

Visit at the right time of year.,
Be aware of closure dates and working hours.,
Know your public sector contacts.,
Observe cultural practices.",How to Do Business in Qatar," If one plans on visiting Qatar strictly for business purpose; the most favorable time for visit would be between the months of October to June. Usually the officers from private and public sectors go for vacation during the time frame between July and September. However one should avoid going to Qatar for business trips during the fasting month of Ramadan as this is the time when the businessmen of Qatar give more priority to family and worship.;
, The people of Qatar normally observe two main religious festivals that differs every year as per the lunar calendar; Eid Al- Fitr and Eid Al-Adha. During this time the government ministries are closed for a much more duration of time as compared to the private companies. In the State of Qatar, Government working hours are from Sunday to Thursday with timings from 7am to 2pm. While Private sector working hours are from 8am to 12:30pm and 4pm to 7:30pm.

, In Qatar, it is the public sector which tenders maximum number of project opportunities. Public Sector Tenders are managed by the Central Tenders Committee (CTC) of the Ministry of Economy. The CTC applies normal tendering procedures and abides by proven performance practices. It recognizes the standards for rules that govern the bidding process. The technical bids which have been presented to the CTC are suggested to suitable government end-user for short-listing. Then the Central Tenders Committee (CTC) releases the commercial bids and advises the lowest priced competent bidder to the individual concerned who will then make decision for the final award. Besides the CTC, few other governmental bodies who have internal tender committees are Qatar Armed Forces, New Doha International Airport, Qatar Petroleum, Ministry of Interior and Public Works Authority.

, While conducting a business transaction in Qatar, it is necessary to be familiar with the Qatari culture & lifestyle. Arranging a business meeting is not a simple process as businessmen have a hectic traveling lifestyle. The country in spite of having solid financial resources, has a scarcity of skilled labor. In Qatar, while doing a business transaction it would be more sensible to have all spoken agreement to be fortified by a written contract. When it comes to modes of payment, the local establishments always give more preference for doing business through a Letter of Credit. Only when there is a deep level of bonding and plenty of trust that cash is used in advance.

Be friendly and open.,
Greet the Pakistanis with the salutation, 'As-salam-u-alikum' (or in short, 'Salam'); ( pronounced- uh sah laam ooh uh lai kum).,
Try not to indulge in national political discussions.,
Learn about the national cuisine.,
Show that you respect their religion.,
Do not make them feel inferior in any way.,
Learn the local language, Urdu.,
Respect the women Isloo-ites!,
Follow the sport of cricket!",How to Become Friends with People in Islamabad," Pakistan is a country full of energetic and lively people who will accept you as soon as you show them your funny and optimistic side! Learn to be friendly with the common people in Islamabad, and soon many of them will want to exchange contacts after the first meeting!;
, This is the common way that Muslims greet each other, and as most Pakistanis are Muslim, this is a very friendly greeting. It translates into, 'Peace be upon you'.


If you do not wish to pronounce the difficult salutation, simply speak its translation in English! Muslims acknowledge you if you greet them with peace!

, Every Pakistani is very passionate about whichever political party they follow. If you unintentionally insult their favorite party, they might get offended and take you on as an enemy. Whew! We don't want that happening, now do we?


Instead, try to maintain a neutral position as you might not understand what the fuss is on about the politics. It can get crazy! Better to ride on safe waters! However, people in Islamabad are more educated than other cities of Pakistan. Some of them might be open-minded and asking them political questions won't be dangerous. Be careful though!

, There are numerous Western restaurants in Islamabad; however, the real fun is in enjoying the tasty delicacies of the Pakistani culture!


While you're in a new country, why not taste different local foods and discuss your opinions on them with Isloo-ites (Islamabad residents)? Many Isloo-ites can be critical of their own cuisine, so it is safe to have a light-hearted discussion with them about what you enjoyed and what you did not.
Try eating out in a desi (local) restaurant with a fellow Isloo-ite, and then see the marvels a well-cooked meal will do to create new bonds! Sharing food is one common trait in Pakistanis that joins them together!

, Pakistanis are mostly Muslim (a very small population might be Hindu, or Christian or Parsi). For Muslims, their daily five prayers are an important asset so do not cause a hindrance in their prayers.


Try not to speak when the Azaan (a call to Prayer that will sound at 5 different times of the day) is taking place. Don't be scared though! No one will eat you if you do. However, it will most certainly be liked by Pakistanis if you respect their religion without them having to tell you. Try finding about other religions too and how to respect them.

, Isloo-ites are very well educated people who are well aware of the current happenings of the world and well read in English.


Do not try to show them that your country is better in any way because it might offend them. Many Isloo-ites will not want to acknowledge any racial discrimination and will accept you as one of them!
Hence be like an Isloo-ite and remain indifferent to the different race. Accept humanity, as Isloo-ites may become protective if you overly disrespect their country.

, Although most of the Isloo-ites are well-versed English speaking individuals, it is a very good idea to learn the local and national language which is called 'Urdu'. Take up a course for this, or simply learn it by asking a fellow Isloo-ite friend to teach the basics to you over time.


You only need to learn the very essentials to converse in daily life. Don't be afraid! Isloo-ites are proud of their language and will be ever ready to teach you.

, If you are a man, the women will not be always ready to be very frank with you as their religion, Islam, forbids very friendly relations between strangers of the different sex. The same applies to women who want to befriend men.


Some exceptions may apply if you are friends with a whole family of Isloo-ites, and in that case both the men and women of that family may genuinely want to befriend you. Be ware though! Also, don't stare at the opposite sex, especially if you are a man. This is because it is considered rude in the religion of Islam. Once people find out you are a nice man and are no harm, they will want to be friends with you.

, This is the most loved game in Pakistanis (even though the national sport is hockey). Isloo-ites will follow cricket matches as if they had to give an exam for it!


Try to learn to play cricket and enjoy it on the streets with the locals and have in-depth discussions on popular cricket matches (matches between Pakistan's national team and any other team are much favored to discuss as a topic).

Create an organized budget plan before you visit.,

If you do decide to stay overnight, book a hotel room early and browse the web for the cheapest rates.,
Go on a weekday.,
Make use of New York's inexpensive public transportation options.,
Make a beeline for the city's abundant free sites and attractions.,
Eat cheap.,
Don't shop till you drop.,
Remember to splurge occasionally.",How to Visit New York City on a Budget," If you know you'll be doing a lot of shopping or taking expensive sightseeing tours, check with your bank to ensure the proper finances are available. It's not a problem if you decide to forgo certain attractions on your trip because of cost - you can always visit them on a return trip to the city.;
, Exclusive cards like the New York Pass and City Pass offer free entry to more than a dozen popular tourist attractions in the Big Apple, an insider guidebook, user-friendly interfaces and even line skipping privileges all for a reasonable fee. It may feel like a lot to shell out at first, but it will likely save you thousands of dollars in the long run.

, Although New York City attracts a generous crowd year-round, here are the pros and cons of each season:


Winter: The winter season is a great time to visit New York, especially after the holidays when the crowds have thinned considerably or when the city is blanketed in snow. However, many visitors find the freezing temperatures unsuitable for walking and visiting outdoor attractions, such as Times Square, which are plentiful.
Spring: Visiting during the springtime is a pleasant experience, with warmer, mild temperatures and the trees beginning to bud and bloom with color in Central Park. On the downside, the city can get crowded around Easter and Spring Break, and some attractions and hotels often charge full price after the winter season.
Summer: New York City in the summertime is hot, humid, and a few showers or thunderstorms that can literally dampen a day are always a possibility. Conversely, the local crowd will have lightened and many hotels and restaurants offer summer deals and specials to out-of-town visitors. The longer days and mostly sunny weather are great benefits as well.
Autumn: Another good time to visit New York is in the fall, when the weather is cooler but still comfortable and the colorful leaves collect on every street corner. However, the season is typically one of the most popular, crowded, and expensive times of the year, the latter fact not a good sign if you're traveling budget-conscious.

, Without having to worry about accommodations you can save a surprisingly large investment of money. There actually is some ground you can cover in just a one day visit to New York City, whether you spend it Uptown, Midtown, or Downtown.

, Booking early is key in the process of budget traveling. Check websites for help, or see this article. Many hotels in Manhattan are clean, comfortable, and attract wallets of all sizes, so staying for several days is more simple than you may think at first.

, You'll find better hotel rates, restaurant deals, occasional discounts at many attractions and sometimes less overwhelming crowds if you avoid visiting on the weekends.

, While taking a cab everywhere may be more convenient, the costs per ride will quickly add up. Instead, buy a Metrocard with enough rides to last the length of your trip and hop on the subway or take the bus to your destination. Know where you are going to avoid getting lost and having to spend money on a taxi for the way back, and learn to navigate New York City. Also consider walking, which is not only free, but also good exercise.

, These include, but are not limited to, Times Square, the New York Public Library, Central Park, Ground Zero, and Rockefeller Center. The sites listed above are great places to see and visit, especially if you have more than one day in the city.


Keep in mind that you don't have to avoid New York's legendary department stores and shops while traveling on a budget. Window-shopping is always fun, as well as stopping into the stores to try on outfits or get a closer look at an expensive souvenir.

, While the Big Apple features some of the world's best restaurants, you don't have to dine at every one of them and end up footing the costly bill. Instead, have the best of both worlds by having a nice but small breakfast, a fast-food lunch, and splurging on dinner. If you absolutely need to save money, consider bringing your own food. A bagged lunch and some snacks for the day from a local convenience store shouldn't cost more than $10 USD.


Restaurant Week in New York City is an annual event offering full-course lunch and dinner meals at half price, typically held once in the winter and once during the summer at participating restaurants. These are both great times to visit, and feature the added bonus of less expensive meals at some of the city's more upscale eateries.

, Many of the souvenirs in New York's gift shops can be found in your local mall at half the price, as well as clothing, electronics, etc.

, While you are traveling on a budget, that doesn't mean you have to forgo everything expensive the Big Apple has to offer. Enjoy at least one dinner at a posh restaurant, buy one or two of those outfits or T-shirts you can't get anywhere else, or visit that attraction you may not return to in the future.

, Do an online search and get lists of all the Youth Hostels and Backpacker Hostels in the place that you have selected to visit. Remember that your accommodations do not necessarily have to be first class, as you are just looking for a place to sleep.


Consider sleeper and couchette trains to combine your travel and accommodation costs.

, However, make sure you follow the rule, ""Fish and Guests stink after 3 days"". So, you don't want to overstay your welcome and lose a friendship. If you are lucky enough to find friends who are willing to accommodate you, make sure to play the part of a good guest during your stay by keeping your area clean, making your bed in the morning, and helping out with the chores.

, Walk around a lot, and visit free or cheap attractions. Use shuttle buses or other cheap public transport. You can learn a lot about a place without spending a lot of money. Talk to people who seem friendly and ask for suggestions. Enjoy scenic walks as part of your travel experience.

Consider looking for ways to stay at places for free or next-to-nothing.,
Give Couchsurfing a go.,
Try Airbnb.,
Work abroad.,
Link up with friends of friends or long lost family members.,
Be sensible and cautious.,
Find the ways of travelling between cities and countries abroad which are free or very cheap.,
Visit blablacar.com.,
Try hitchhiking.,
Work on a container ship or working boat in return for free passage.,
Eating for free abroad is more difficult to do, but not impossible.,
Work when you need to.,
Keep your budget reined in by spending on the basics and nothing else.,
Use some of the following ways to keep your spending right down:


Forgo the souvenirs.",How to Travel Without Spending Money," Hostels are a very cheap way to stay and you get to meet people from all over the place. Then there are services such as Couchsurfing, which let you bunk down at someone else's house for free. Finally, you might like work a little on a worthwhile project, getting somewhere free to stay at the same time.;
, Go to Couchsurfing.org and check it out. The idea is that people everywhere in the world offer to host you in their homes (meals not included) for free, for a set number of days. Anyone from anywhere can sign up to be ""verified"" which simply means that they send you a postcard with a serial number which you enter into the website to become verified. The verification is also subject to peer reviews. Basically the idea is that you leave a comment rating the person after you stay with them. The reviews are completely transparent and the couch surfers have no control over whether they appear on their profiles or not. To stay somewhere:


Send a request to a host wherever you would like to go.
Together you decide if it is the right fit, and for how many days you will stay with them.
Since the verification process is not very strict, be aware that you could run into problems, but use your intuition, read the reviews, and steer clear of people who have not yet been reviewed. Note also that there are groups on the site as well, which might be great way to meet people travelling.

, This is not free but the verification process is stricter and you can get some very good deals with this service by searching carefully at the low end of the prices offered. Usually you'll get a single room or a pull-out sofa bed/futon, often with a shared bathroom, at the low end of the price range. Once again, read the reviews to discern trustworthiness. Be aware that the company running the site takes a service fee, which is non-refundable.

, There are many possible opportunities to do volunteer work that makes a difference. One such group is WWOOF international. WWOOF is a great way to connect with people in their towns and learn a lot while you're doing it. WWOOF stands for world wide opportunities on organic farms. It is a non-profit organization that connects travellers willing to work on farms with farmers in hundreds of countries across the globe.


Pay a small fee (usually per country). This will give you access to the contact information of hundreds of farms in any given country.
Be prepared to work. The deal is that you work for them (you negotiate with the farms how many hours per day/days per week), and they feed you and give you a place to stay. This is all done with the intention of teaching and learning techniques involved with organic farming, however this is not always the case.
Be aware that some people view this as people soliciting free work from people all over the globe, but it does give you a chance to meet people from all over the globe. You may be working on construction or something else, but you will also be given a direct back-stage pass into the lives and the cultures the locals. If you aren't picky about accommodations, (dietary restrictions are negotiable) or food, you can live and work with locals for free. Just make sure you know what you are getting into.

, Although you haven't met these people, by having a trusted person vouch for you, it may be possible to stay with people you don't yet know in different parts of the world. You might even score yourself a new friend or make new family connections by doing this. Ask friends and family if they know of people they'd be happy to ask on your behalf about the possibility of staying. However, don't be pushy, don't expect too much and pitch and help a lot if you do get to stay with people in this way.


Be aware that you might be a source of burden for some people, either because they're not well off and you're another mouth to feed, or because they felt obliged to help you but didn't really want to. If you pick up such vibes, either offer money to cover your costs or move on to give them back their space.

, When something is incredibly cheap or free, it pays to be alert at all times. While there are a great deal many good people out there, some people are shady, fickle and even dangerous, so you must exercise caution when staying with people you do not know.


Check out the websites devoted to people's experiences with services such as Couchsurfing that didn't work out so well. There are instances of failure to connect (therefore leaving a person without a place to stay), rudeness during the stay (as in, making it clear you're not welcome after all) and expectations that you'll contribute in some way (not always an appropriate way). Read the reviews and do trust filtering checks when you meet people. If a place doesn't feel right, trust your instincts and move on.

, As always though, you'll need to be careful of who you encounter out there, as people are not always friendly or have good intentions.

, This website connects people travelling in personal cars all over the world. On this website there are also verifications, and peer reviews, so there is some higher level of trust for those travelling with strangers. Caution is always advised, and often you will have to pay a small portion of gas to chip in for the journey.

, Hitchhiking has been done for hundreds of years, and can allow you to travel short distances for free while being able to chat with and get to know people. This form of travel should really be considered on a country or region specific basis because in some places it's safe while in others, it's downright dangerous. For example, hitchhiking in France is relatively easy and safe. However, in some countries you should not even consider it, especially if you are a female and or are travelling alone.


Use your intuition. This is extremely important when deciding whether or not to accept rides from strangers. If you feel at all uncomfortable at all, pass on the ride.
One great tip is to ask them where they are going first, before you divulge your destination. This allows you to quickly assess the person and decide whether to accept before jumping in.
Where hitchhiking is illegal, find out how rigorously it is enforced. A free night in jail might not be your idea of fun travel.

, Realize that this means actual real, hard work. If you're not fit, the captain won't even think twice about taking you for no cost––you must be able to do everything you're expected to do, in all forms of weather and regardless of the condition of the sea. This usually works best when planned well ahead of time, as you'll probably need to negotiate by email or letter exchanges.

, Often it's about summoning up the courage to simply ask for free food. It can seem awkward, but people are generally very generous, especially family owned businesses. Large chains will most likely not help you out.


Go to family owned restaurants and cafes at the end of the day. Ask if they are going to throw any food out. Sometimes you can score some great meals that would have gone to waste.
Small grocery stores or family owned markets will have products that are recently expired to are about to expire. Just asking for those products may feel weird at first but once you get the hang of it you will be surprised by the results. You can get all kinds of products that are still good despite their expiration dates.
Outdoor markets and fairs often have surpluses of produce. If the item is especially perishable like tomatoes or strawberries, they may be willing to give you some for free or for a greatly discounted price. It helps if you go right as the fair is closing down for the day, as this is generally when people are packing up and wanting to get rid of extra unsold product.
It can help to explain that you're traveling the world without any money or on the cheap––a background story that's fascinating can be a real benefit. Make it a good tale though, or you won't get your supper!

, A useful way to support yourself while you're abroad is to find a job to off-set any unavoidable costs. Look for casual work, pop-up work opportunities or even making your own work through busking and helping others. Some other possibilities include:


Workaway.com. This is a great website to check out. It is similar to WWOOF in a lot of ways, but it is not restricted to farms or the pretense of organic farming. Basically you volunteer your time and labor in return for a place to stay and food to eat. It is a great way to get involved with communities in foreign countries and perhaps learn a new language.
You can also simply find employment in the country or city you are interested in travelling to. Some examples of jobs abroad are: Temporary agricultural jobs, teaching English, working as an au-pair, getting a job on a cruise ship, working as a tour guide, or finding temporary work in a restaurant or retail store. There are an incredible amount of opportunities out there, you just need to look.
Busk or guide. Do an act if you are good at something, or offer to take walking tours if you know an area well enough, as well as its history. You can also try fun things, such as offering to be someone's butler for a day.

, This means not buying a lot of things that tourists are traditionally known for buying (and you're a traveller, not a tourist remember), such as guided tours, souvenirs, overpriced boat trips, ""must-do"" sites and eateries, expensive meals, top-end hotels, and so forth. It can help to realize that you are not missing out on anything by eschewing these things. In fact, you are more likely to get to know the real place by not holing yourself away in a posh hotel and eating at the finest restaurants.

, You do not need all those mementos. Think of ones you've purchased in the past and how much dust is accumulating on them or how they're already long forgotten at the back of a drawer. If you want to help a local culture, donate your time, your teaching, your knowledge or small amounts of money instead.
Eat everything if breakfast is included. Fill up at the beginning of the day when your energy needs are the greatest, at someone else's expense. Then, eat lunch from supermarket pickings, such as baguette and cheese or rice salad. For the evenings, hunt out vegetarian places––many of these will have decent feeds for small prices.
Walk as much as you can. Provided you know an area is safe, you can find out a great deal by walking through it and observing everything.
Be really choosy about sites you must pay to see or enter. Only go to those ones that are truly meaningful to you, rather than checking off every must-see in the guidebook. If it doesn't resonate with you, it's not worth outlying the money.
Find as many free activities as you can. Think as the locals do and flock to the free things they're doing, such as fairs, festivals in parks, watching street theater and simply hanging about watching people. Check local newspapers for free events thrown for the locals.
Forgo meals if they cost extra on any form of transportation. Take your own food from the supermarket. This does mean being organized ahead of time but pre-planning is an essential part of budget travel anyway.

Travel on!",How to Travel Cheaply as a Student," Traveling allows for self discovery in the most organic way, especially when you're alone. You allow yourself to explore who you are when no one else is there to define you and familiar settings are not present to constrict you. Don't ever let anybody tell you that ""You're doing too much"" when you want to experience new things. It's your life, your world. See it. Make it better.;
, If seeing the world is important to you, understand that it is possible. Then make up your mind that you will plan to do what it takes to make it happen; make a budget, save your cash, and get the basics that you need sorted out to make it happen.


You may not be able to travel to every country you want to see, but you can pick the one or ones at the top of your list. Likewise, you may not be able to stay in luxury hotels or resorts, but in most cities, you can find comfortable and safe accommodation for a reasonable price. Make some sacrifices, while prioritizing the parts that really matter to you, and you'll be able to afford travel more easily.

, There are a range of websites online to find good deals; some great student organizations offer discounted travel, including Student Universe and the Student Travel Association. Compare these deals with regular online travel deal websites, too, to make sure you get the best package you can.


It often helps to compare costs at different times of year, too. If you have the option of traveling during different seasons, picking the off-season can drastically lower your prices.

, For those who are unfamiliar with youth hostels, they are not scary. They're very similar to a clean college dorm experience. Most importantly they are safe and cheap! They usually offer free breakfast in the morning, maps, discounts on big things to do, a kitchen and dishes for you to use, a fridge to keep leftovers, a microwave to warm them up, and keys and locks for your things, with secured entry into the building!


Hostels also provide the opportunity to meet the most interesting young people: mostly college students backpacking through the country on some crazy adventure. Everyone is always super nice and eager to get your story and your name on Facebook.
Hostels are very common in Europe and other areas of the world; although less common in the US, they still exist there too.

, This program offers discounts to more than 33,000 locations in 103 countries. It also provides an insurance plan, a mobile phone and calling card communications package, and an emergency help line. It's just good to have.

, After you get to your destination you can rely on the metro, buses and hop-on/hop-off tours to get you around the city. You'll most likely be walking more than normal so as long as you have comfortable shoes you'll enjoy the climb! If you're going to do multiple cities, many of the student travel sites offer cheap flights and train passes to hop from country to country within a region, too.

, Buy snacks from the market when you get there to hold you over throughout the day. We've already said breakfast was most likely included in your boarding situation. Grab a sandwich or a pizza for lunch and sit down and eat a nice dinner.

, It's likely that you'll want to stay in touch with people from home - and those you meet along the way! Different countries have different options for temporary cell phone services, so investigate the local options. It's quite likely you'll be able to buy a cheap phone with a pay-as-you-go SIM card option; if not, you can certainly buy a calling card that gives affordable rates for calling internationally.


Beware of using pay phones that take credit cards; many of these have very high rates that aren't clearly listed at the time of calling.
Find free WiFi where you can. Many phones now allow messaging or even calling over WiFi, and certainly having an internet connection can allow you to send emails and check in with people via social media. Find out whether your hostel offers free or cheap wi-fi options, and search for local cafes, restaurants, libraries, and public spaces that offer free or affordable WiFi.

, There are a range of apps that can help when you're traveling abroad.


Pocket Earth is great for trying to navigate through narrow winding streets. It shows you exactly where you are and you don't need to be connected to wifi. This does what Siri can't.
Duolingo is helpful for learning the basics of a local language. Do a lesson a night. It's free, set up like a game and you'll learn fast.

, This kind of big trip may be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for you; even if you travel again later one, there are likely not to be too many chances to tour in the ""footloose and fancy free"" manner of a student. So be open to meeting new people, trying new foods, and going on adventures - just pick your tours and experiences smartly to stay within budget and stay safe.


Allowing yourself to be spontaneous is great, but also keep in mind that a little planning can go a long way in making sure you make the most of the trip without going over budget. Go where the spirit of adventure takes you, but also keep an eye on your bank balance and itinerary to make sure you're not veering way off course.

, Nothing adds to the cost of a trip like having your possessions stolen or losing your luggage and being out of pocket for your tickets, passes, reservations, and so on. Get travel insurance if possible, to help cover any losses in an emergency, and regardless be sure to keep your possessions safe.


Use lockers and safes where they're provided in hostels and train stations or airports.
Keep your passport, tickets, and money in a hidden travel pouch close to your body and under your clothing, rather than hanging out in a back pocket or backpack.
Just as you would in your own country, beware of how you deal with others, especially if alcohol is involved. Your safety is paramount; while you don't want to miss out on great opportunities to meet interesting people and have fun, you also don't want to be reckless. Let someone you trust know who you're with and where you're going, and stay in contact as regularly as possible.

, There is thrill in the unknown.

Make a budget.,

Make a list of all the cities and sights you hope to visit.,
Look up how much money the attractions you want to see cost.",How to Travel Cheaply in America1," Decide what you're willing to spend on travel/food/etc. Try not to go over this amount arbitrarily once you've made up your mind.;
, While most travelers have a specific place they want to go or a specific sight they want to see, being flexible can save you a lot of money. For instance, many bus and airplane companies run deals on high-traffic routes (such as New York to Boston). Check and see whether the city nearest to you hosts any of these routes.

, Plan how much time you'll want to spend in each city, and allow time for travel in between cities if you're making a multi-stage trip. Remember to give yourself an extra day or so in each location if you can manage it, allowing you to relax and enjoy the trip instead of stressing about the next item on your list.

, Try to research whether they ever have free admission. Many museums, for instance, provide free entry one day per month. For expensive sights, look and see if the company provides deals online. Finally, look into whether you qualify for any help from organizations or groups you belong to, such as AAA or senior citizen discounts.

Be pumped to face challenges and troubles. This is not an easy way to travel and requires a little courage and composure. While you're traveling in this mode, you will enhance these qualities. Ask yourself these questions like: 'What motivates me? Why am I doing this? Things like this.
Keep the benefits and rewards in mind. Why do you want to travel like this rather than to go someplace fancy? To save money, learn something new, face challenges, see some awesome places, adventure, meet new people, learn a new culture, to be mentally strong, meet a friend or relative or other motivating reasons, keeping these reasons in mind would give a mental strength and courage to carry on.
Always have fun. Fun is a very important thing. Since on the way you will most certainly face problems and troubles which you may not have faced before, but if you try hard to have fun during these situations it would be less hard to face them. One effective way to have fun would be to challenge yourself to face the problem, like for an example if you couldn't find a place to stay for the night and you feel panicky because of it, at the same time challenge yourself like 'I challenge you to stop panicking and face the situation' or 'I dare you to make it through'.
Decide where you want to go and what are the ways to get there. Air, road, rail, ocean, river. As you want to save money, think of what could be the cheapest way to get there. For example, if you want to get to New York from LA or vice versa, the cheapest ways would be by road. Then choose one of the methods below.;
, There may be a time when you would need money so working small/big jobs on the way would help relieve some financial pressure. For an example looking for small jobs/gigs on craigslist.org would be a good place to start, checking out local newspaper, asking people around. Another way would be to just walk into any store, restaurant (basically any business) and ask for work in return for some money or food. Note: People are more likely to give you goods than money.

, Busking. It means to play music or perform entertainment in a public place, usually while soliciting money. Doing things like singing, doing some magic tricks, playing some instrument, jokes, anything which you think can entertain people is a good way to make quick money. There are people who have made a plenty of money by doing things like this. Note Choose the place for it wisely for an example some open market, downtown(places like that) etc.

, Using this method, you will be able to travel by water while receiving room and board. Better still, you can even earn some money as you travel. Work on a yacht tends to be less permanent and less stable than work on a cruise ship, but on a cruise ship, you will only travel along the same set course each trip. Both yachts and cruise ships are in need of skilled laborers, though. You may have knowledge of sea travel, or you may simply have culinary, mechanical, or navigational skills. Look online for job opportunities or head to the marina in the nearest port town to look for ads.

, If you are a current student, especially at the university level, you might be able to find scholarships or exchange programs that allow you to travel for free. This is especially true if you are going to college for international studies, but international opportunities await students in all sorts of concentrations. Some programs require you to pay part of the expense, but if your academic record is strong enough, you may be able to apply for a scholarship or grant that pays your way there and allows you to stay for free at a sister university.

, If you have a specific skill, like writing or photography, you might be able to win a trip from a magazine or publisher. If you do not have a specific skill, you could still try to enter contests with airlines, cruise lines, resorts, tourism boards, or adventure companies. Even companies that do not have anything to do with travel, from food companies to pet supply companies, occasionally have sweepstakes in which you can win a trip. Just make sure to read the fine print when you apply, though. Some of these contests pay for the entire trip, while others only pay for a certain portion.

Embrace the simple joy of travel.,
Keep your needs to a minimum.,
Go slow.,
Leave your possessions and obsessions behind.,
Trust people and you will receive free food and lodging.,
Don't expect a free ride.",How to Travel the World Simply and Cheaply," Travel frees you from the grind of daily routine. You will explore new places, meet new people, try new foods and learn things about the world – and yourself – that you never imagined were possible. The joy of new experience is the most wonderful thing about travel – and new experiences are free.

Walk the streets of a city, stop and chat with a local, people watch in a public park, or even climb to the top of a hill and watch the sun set over the ocean. The simple joy of being in a new place is just a matter of going someplace new. No tour package required.



 

;
, The modern American economy is built on the false premise that people need to buy new goods and services all the time. People need fresh air, healthy food, clean water, exercise, creative stimulation, companionship, self-esteem and a safe place to sleep. All of these things are simple to obtain. Most of them are free.


For fresh air, go outside. For exercise, take a walk.
For creative stimulation, go somewhere new.
For companionship, make a friend.
For self esteem, turn off your TV, breathe deep and open your spirit to the basic goodness of the world.
Things like food and shelter are much cheaper once you get outside the United States.

, If you live in New York and want to take a 2 week vacation to Africa, it will be very difficult (though not impossible) to travel for free. Indeed, as long as you believe that time is money, you will spend money all the time. Time is not money. Time is free. You have all the time in the world.
Instead of buying a plane ticket, catch a ride out West, or remodel an old sailboat, or just hop on your bike and ride away from town. The slower you travel, the less money you will spend.

, When you travel, you don’t need to pay rent. You don’t need a car. You don’t need an oven, a washer-dryer, electricity, Cable TV, a gym membership, a sofa and loveseat or a closet full of clothes.
You don’t need a suit and tie to wear to your job because you don’t need a job. You don’t need to worry about paying the bills, because there are no bills to pay. You are free.

, Many people are willing to open their homes to travelers. Chip in with a few chores, and they will give you a free meal, too. Couch Surfing and WWOOF are two phenomenal online networks that help travelers connect with local hosts.
Couch Surfing members are willing to give travelers a place to sleep for a night or two. WWOOF connects travelers with organic farmers who want to trade room and board for an extra hand. Many members of both Couch Surfing and WWOOF are seeking an alternative to high-impact consumer culture. VolunTourism is another invaluable link; it, couchsurfing and WWOOF are all searchable.

, Couch Surfing does not mean couch potato. You only get what you give away, and if any of the above steps are not working for you, consider it a message that you need to examine your premises.

Map out your trip.,
Choose your transportation option wisely.,
Research options for lodging.,
Book early.",How to Travel Cheaply in America2," Don't travel from Los Angeles to New York and then back to Oregon unless you find some incredible deals. Instead, try to hit each stop along the way to the next one.

, Depending on how many stops you plan to make, how long your trip is, and where you're going, you may have better luck with one method of transportation than others.


Buses and trains are exciting and unique ways to see America and often cost less than planes and cars if you book far enough in advance. Not only do you save money, but you get to see the countryside roll peacefully by out the window. Also, you can leave your phone on, and many buses and trains now come with outlets at every seat.
Cars are nice because they allow freedom, both in and out of the cities. You don't have to worry about transportation schedules, and you'll easily reach each destination. However, you also might be stuck driving long distances, you could get lost, and you're responsible for all gas expenses. Also, if you plan on making a one-way trip, the car drop-off fee can be exorbitant.
Planes can quickly cover long distances, but are also often expensive and inflexible. It also means that upon arrival you may be paying additional transportation fees, since you'll probably have to rent a car or use public transportation around your destination city.
If you must fly, try to find out whether your nearest airport serves as an airline fortress hub or not. Fortress hubs are airports where a certain airline has a near-monopoly, allowing them to raise ticket prices out of that airport. Avoid flying out of these airports if you're hoping to save money. Additionally, pack light to avoid extra baggage fees.

, You don't have to stay in a five-star hotel to have an amazing trip. There are tons of other, more budget-friendly options.


Think about couch surfing, where kind-hearted homeowners allow travelers to sleep on their guest beds or couches—often at no cost.
If sleeping on a couch sounds like the wrong type of adventure, look into hostels. Most major cities have at least one, and rates are much cheaper than hotels. However, you'll probably be sleeping on a cheap bed (or bunk bed) and sharing a room.
If your budget is a bit higher, you can always stay in a motel or hotel. Use budget travel sites to find cheap rates. Inexpensive hotels aren't always the best quality, so make sure to read reviews also before making a reservation!

, Don't wait until the last minute to plan any aspect of your trip. While you can occasionally find a great deal by postponing your reservations, the risk isn't really worth it. You'll get cheaper prices by booking months in advance of your trip. Most hotels and transportation companies provide early bird discounts, sometimes to the extent of cutting your rate in half. Early, early, early is the motto of the budget adventurer.

Stick to your initial budget.,
Be careful where you eat.,
Live like a native.",How to Travel Cheaply in America3," While splurging is okay once in a while (after all, no trip plan is perfect), remember that this is supposed to be cheap travel. Don't let yourself run up a huge bill that you can't afford.

, People who live in Manhattan rarely eat in Times Square, because there are much better restaurants in the city for far cheaper. Try using a crowd-sourcing website or mobile application to find inexpensive but delicious eateries at your destination. Take a chance on that small Mexican restaurant with great reviews. It might end up being your new favorite meal.

, Don't act like a tourist, and you won't be treated like one. In addition to eating at places where people who live in the city would eat, thus avoiding overpriced tourist traps, this advice should be rule number one on your trip. While you may not notice all the money you're saving by not acting like a helpless tourist, you'd certainly notice the money you lost if you didn't follow this rule.


Unscrupulous businesses often raise prices on people they know are tourists.
Tourists are also easy marks for all sorts of shady “businesses,” such as the people who will show you to the correct train platform for a sizable “tip.”

Hitching rides.,
Rideshare.,
Gas-jugging.,
Go by bike.,
Transport other vehicles.",How to Travel for Free2," It is not just standing at the side of the road/on a ramp and sticking your thumb out or signboard(with the name of destination on it) it also involves asking people at gas stations, truck stops etc. Keep that in mind its 'Hitching rides' which involves asking rides in cars, boats, planes, cargo ships, or any other mode of transport. The methods for different modes of transport could be different but the deep basic concept is the same which is 'asking for a ride'. All these methods fall into the 'art of hitching'.


As the most common is hitchhiking . Although it is not generally considered the safest means of travel, and it is not recommended if you are someone who is not physically capable of defending yourself against potential attackers, but many people do manage to hitchhike without incident. Consider hitchhiking in pairs to improve your odds of staying safe. which is a little safer, or you could try your luck out on the road. Hitchhike during the day to stay safer and use caution when deciding whose car to get into. If your intuition tells you that a driver is trouble, it is best to listen.

, You could go onto a website that allows you pre-schedule a ride with someone. There are many sites which are available that allow people to post their travel plans like craigslist, rideshare.net etc. You can contact these people and tell them how you can help them on the way like driving their car, help in navigation(if you have GPS on your phone or good at directions), good conversationalist (most of the people who travel alone get bored while driving for hours so they are more receptive and hungry for a good conversation). You can even post your ad on these sites mentioning them that you can help driving and navigating, even help them unload if they are carrying stuff. Think of helping them in any way you can.

, It means standing at a gas station with a gas jug and asking people for fuel(mostly people who are refueling their cars). However, it comes in solicitation and panhandling. If you have a car but don't have money to pay for gas this method is quite efficient. It's a psychological phenomenon people are more likely to give you gas, when you ask them at a gas station then another place as people at a gas station are in a mental state of paying money(for their own gas) so it would be easier for them to spend some more money to pay for your gas. It's even more efficient when they are in the middle of refueling. Note: if you find it indecent then don't do it.

, If the place you want to travel is near choose the bike. Traveling by bicycle may take a little or lot longer, and you will need to pack plenty and water, but it is still a free method of travel and is a little safer than hitchhiking. To stay safe, though, it is still advisable to travel in pairs or small groups and to do the majority of your biking during daylight hours. One more thing which could be helpful is the usage of Google maps to find bike routes to your destination as provides an option for it. .

, People who move long distances often travel to their new home by airplane rather than a car, and as a result, they need someone to transport their car to their new home. Check with moving companies and car rental companies for potential job openings. You can also check the newspaper or online forums and advertisements for individuals who are in need of a driver to transport their car. Be aware of the fact that you will likely need to pass a criminal background check to take advantage of this option, however. After all, a company or individual will want to make sure that they are not hiring a convicted car thief.

Couch-surf..,
Camp.,
Hangout with people.,
Public Places: Places like railway station and airports are also a decent place to stay.,

House-swap.,

Volunteer on an organic farm.Organic farmers usually have limited resources available to hire professional workers, and as a result, some seek out volunteer workers.,
Sign up with a long-term volunteer organization.There are a number of volunteer organizations that will allow you to stay in places around the world in exchange for labor.,
Pay for a stay at a hostel by trading labor.",How to Travel for Free3," It is a very good way to stay at a place (while traveling) for free. It's not just about crashing for free but also about meeting some nice people (your hosts) who allowed you to stay at their place for free. If you have friends or acquaintances in another city, ask if you can sleep on their couch when you visit. If you do not, however, you can join online at ""couchsurfing.com"". Through this website, you can take advantage of people offering a couch to sleep on in another city. In return, though, you will need to offer a room or couch of your own to fellow couch-surfers interested in visiting your hometown.

, Since it's not always easy to find a place to stay for the night via Couch surfing or other sites like that so preparing for that becomes necessary. Camping is a good option for those situations. Although in many cities there are not many proper places to camp but if you are a little thorough in your search you can always find a crack. Like camping in the backyard of a church(People who come to visit these places are more tolerant and kind.), a small area with a lot of trees and bushes. Keep that in mind you don't need a big place to sleep, a 6X2 feet area is enough. Note: Camping is not just setting up a tent but it may involve the use of a tent, caravan, motorhome, cabin, a primitive structure, or no shelter at all. So using a sleeping bag in cities would be good enough.

, Find places like bars, or any other hangout spots where you would be able to find people. Start socializing with people to earn their trust(don't hide anything like if you are traveling you must be carrying a bag and other things so don't hide it). People are more likely to help you if you are honest about it. If someone like your attitude and is kind enough they would allow you crash at their place.

, Make sure you are confident and act as if waiting for a flight or train.

, In most cities there are many homeless shelters, especially at religious places. Google 'homeless shelters' from your phone. Note:In case you have an international phone carrier or can't connect to The Internet for any reason you can always connect to a local wifi. When you are traveling in cities you would find a lot of WIFI connections and most of them would be password protected but if you try a little harder you can find a WIFI connection which requires no password. Other places to look for free wifi spots would be McDonald's, Wendy's or any restaurant where you find a wifi signal (if you find a place like this but its wifi is password protected you can always ask any of the employees for it). If you still have a problem you can always ask someone with a working phone to look for one for you. Note: If you feel uncomfortable going into these place to use wifi just stand outside for a while to connect to their wifi, do some research and leave. Some of the homeless shelters don't admit people after a certain time, so make sure the timing of admittance in these places before going there.

, Of course they would not exactly be motels/hotels but they do provide a roof on your head if you are looking for one. You are likely to find some abandoned places in a city like some old buildings, warehouses which have not been used for years so they might also be a place to stay. These places are not recommended as these places are also attract hobos, junkies, criminals. So analyzing the place before staying the night would be a very good idea.

, If you are willing to let someone else stay in your home, you can join a home exchange program that will allow you to offer your home up in exchange for a stay in someone else's home. You can house-swap regionally, nationally, or internationally. The easiest way to go about finding someone to house-swap with is to join a home exchange website. Some of these websites are free, while others require a small registration fee. The length and terms of your house-swap are usually agreed upon by the two parties involved.

, People who are planning to spend a long time away from home occasionally hire someone to house-sit for them. House-sitting may require you to do nothing but keep the house clean and lived in, or you may have to perform basic tasks like watering plants or checking the mail. Look online for national or international classifieds, or go to websites that specialize in house-sitting services and find out what you need to do to advertise your services. You may need to have a background check performed beforehand, though.

, You will not receive a paycheck, but at minimum, you can find a place to stay in a foreign location. Many of these farms will even provide you with your meals. The biggest and most commonly used organization for volunteer farm work is WWOOF, or World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms, but this organization does require you to pay a small fee to join. Completely free opportunities will require you to comb through classifieds and free forums.

, You might need to perform physical labor, like building houses, or you might be doing something a little more academic, like teaching basic English or art. Most of these programs require you to submit a portfolio or resume and will also require you to pass a drug test and criminal background check.

, Hostels are already known to provide cheap accommodations for international travelers, but some hostels will provide room and board to a traveler in exchange for that traveler’s skills. You may need to clean, cook, or do yard work, but in return, you can receive a free room and, if you are really lucky, free meals. Contact hostels in the area you are interested in and ask if they have labor exchange opportunities.

Research the area where you are traveling, in order to find out accurate costs.,

Create a budget before you leave on your trip.,
Pay for large expenses, like plane tickets, separately.,
Buy a pre-paid travel card that covers your shared expenses budget.,

Bring a sturdy folder or envelope to include all expense receipts.,
Write down the method of payment and the expense on each receipt.,
Settle up immediately when you get home.",How to Share Expenses when Traveling1," Many travel blogs, websites and books, like Lonely Planet Guides or Bootsnall.com, will tell you what the average cost of food and hotels are. Take into account currency exchange rates.;
, Everyone should be comfortable with the costs that you share. Discuss any concerns you have with sharing expenses at this time.

, Decide if you are all committed to traveling frugally or extravagantly. Establish a general cost to aim for breakfast, lunch and dinner, to avoid meal frustrations if someone is ordering more expensive meals.

, Include hotels, transportation, food, tips, guided tours, drinks and anything else you are likely to split. Create a table in Excel and round up all expenses slightly to account for unforeseen expenses.

, Since each person's financial situation is different, large expenses should be dealt with according to personal budget. Unlike smaller travel expenses, sharing large expenses can provoke stress associated with immediate reimbursement or credit card limits.

, Search online for travel cards from major credit card companies, such as Visa or MasterCard. A pre-paid card can be used to pay for hotel reservations, tickets and food costs and it can be used at an ATM.

In case of theft, a pre-paid card offers you more protection. Although it would be distressing to lose your shared money, a pre-paid card is not linked to your bank account. The thief will not be able to withdraw more than you planned on spending on the trip or rack up credit card debt.
Make sure that if you are taking money out of an ATM with a pre-paid credit card, you split the money evenly or you pay for the services all at once.

, If the people who are traveling are using smart phones, then these can act like a sophisticated expense sheet, totaling up costs after each expense.

, Place it in a designated area in a piece of luggage or a backpack. Whenever there is a receipt for a shared expense, place it in the envelope.

, For instance, if you just visited a restaurant, you might write ""Jamie paid"" or ""Travel card"" and then ""Lunch Day 6."" Keep a marker in your envelope and make sure the expense is indicated before the receipt is filed.

If someone wants to be extravagant at dinner 1 night, they can stick a note in the envelope indicating how much more their meal was than the budgeted cost. Later on, you can include this figure as you settle up the costs.

, Input all of your receipts and notes into your spreadsheet. If there is extra money on a pre-paid card, you can request the balance from the bank or use it to pay off anyone who is owed money.

,, Most leading cities across the world have cheap accommodation for leisure travellers and back packers.

, this will give you a lot of options and people whom you can question.

, many leading tourist cities, like Singapore, have pre-loaded metro & bus passes. These passes are very convenient for internal city travel.

, You will get a lot more space at a much lower cost than what you would get from a comparable hotel room.

, Thinking ahead can also help you get a great deal. Choose your ideal destination well in advance to secure cheaper flights and accommodation. Some hotels will even give you a discount for early bookings.

, Finding cheap Hotels online is the best way to go if you are travelling often, a site like www.quickhotelrates.com can be the best way to get the best value for money for hotels while on your stay.

, Can you travel out of peak season and at busy times like school holidays? If so, you’re likely to make massive savings on both travel and accommodation.

, Take into account the cost of living in the places you’re thinking of going. Staying a little bit longer in countries like Thailand or Turkey could actually end up saving you money, as you’ll be spending less cash than you would usually spend at home.

, If possible, try to avoid departures on a Friday, Saturday or Sunday. Midweek flights are often four times cheaper than travelling at weekends.

, If you face a lengthy check-in at the airport, think about taking a few snacks and drinks with you. Not only will it save you from paying inflated airport prices, you won’t end up standing around in lengthy queues.

, Even though your destination hasn’t had any rain for the past 3 months, it doesn’t mean that it’s guaranteed to be hot and sunny when you get there. Always pack a rain jacket or coat just in case it’ll save you from having to buy one once you are there.

, Many bars, cafes and restaurants go all out to tempt in the lunchtime trade, so take advantage of their special offers such as two for one deals or three courses for the price of two. Eat the same meal at the same place later that day and you often end up paying much more.

, Rather than paying to see a show every night, ask around and see which bars and clubs have free music or comedy performances, or find free local museums, galleries and other attractions.

, Make the most of your hotel’s concierge and other staff. Ask them where are the best places to go? Just as importantly, find out where to avoid and get to know a rough idea of the prices you should expect to pay locally so you don’t get ripped off.

, Save on expensive cab rides by exploring your destination on foot. Or maybe even hire a bike, which is a great way to get around and find some of the less well-known tourist hotspots.

, Especially if you’re staying in a big town or city, check out the local library and get free internet access. It’s also a great way of avoiding paying for costly guide books, as you can download any maps and other information you need.

If you can book ahead, you can save time, money and worries.,
Pack the right clothes for the season and climate.,
Take your camera along when you go sightseeing.,
Talk to the locals.,
Minimize the use of electronics on your trip.,
Be security conscious.,
Have a positive attitude.,
If you are not from Britain, try to learn some of the words British use and how they use them.",How to Enjoy Great Britain," It's also a good idea to buy (or borrow) a travel guide on the area, such as Lonely Planet or Rough Guide. By looking through websites, blogs and travel guides, you'll find out the recommended places to visit, the places to stay and things to do. Travel guides will help you to budget, as they usually offer budget, medium and high cost alternatives for accommodations and activities to do.


Check out blogs of people who have traveled through Great Britain. These are the perfect place to find non-mainstream things to do.
Find out what the locals do. This is always a good key to finding the cheaper entertainment and even free things. For example, having fish and chips on a jetty by the sea, or visiting a local gypsy fair.
You don't have to buy travel guides; many libraries carry them and borrowing them lets you view many of them rather than sticking to just one.;
, Great Britain consists of England, Scotland and Wales.That gives you a huge range of different places to visit, along with lots of different possible cultural activities to be a part of. For starters, there are three capital cities, London, Edinburgh and Cardiff, plus many major cities. Then there are many smaller cities, towns and villages, as well as the countryside. It's unlikely you have the time to visit everywhere, so you'll need to refine your visits to what is doable.


Remember that the capital cities are big, especially London, and can definitely make a visit in their own right.
Map out your visit using an online or a paper map. Check the distances and suggested traveling times. Make sure you have up-to-date traveling times, as these change in time, given traffic congestion, new roads, etc.

, Some people have really defined notions of what they're keen on seeing and this can make organizing the trip more interesting. If you have a ""theme"" or particular interest, it can make your visit really enjoyable, as you can pick particular places and check them off one by one. Everything else will become a supporting act to each main feature you're wanting to see. A themed trip can be as mainstream or as unique as you'd like to make it; there is no right or wrong about following your interests.


For example, you could pick themes such as: Stonehenge and other ancient spiritual places, Roman ruins, the homes of Victorian writers, Shakespeare's country, great castles of Great Britain, famous royal places, green buildings, fun things such as the London Eye, great cathedrals, wildlife or bird life of Britain, posh places to stay, transportation museums, etc. The opportunities are endless!

, With the emphasis on ""enjoying"" your visit, you'll need to choose the transportation means that you love most. There are lots of possibilities, some more pricey than others. For example, you could hire a car, giving you lots of freedom of going everywhere but beware that gas (petrol) may be a lot costlier than what you're used to in the United States, Canada or Australia. Also, there is a lot of traffic and even though the distances may seem small, you can get caught up in traffic snarls easily, especially coming into large cities such as London. Other options include trains (also expensive), cycling (in some areas), canal boating (in some areas), walking (in cities and parts of the countryside), buses and flights. The drawback with flights is that you miss whatever passes between you and the place you've just left but it will speed up your visits to different places. Do check the difference between airfares and train fares though; you may find the flights work out cheaper.

, Try to book things such as tickets, travel deals, hotels and the like online, before you arrive. That said, don't overbook; you don't want to remove the spontaneity of travel, giving yourself the flexibility to make changes or to follow new leads. It all depends on how certain you need to feel before you leave.

, Britain's climate is temperate, often rainy, frequently overcast and often unpredictable. For example, you will often need a raincoat or umbrella during the fall and spring. Pack heavy jackets and articles of clothes that you would wear in the snow if you are touring in the winter.


London can be quite humid during summer and even during spring and autumn, due to its own heat generation from being such a large city. As such, layering of clothing is a good way to cope if you're walking around the city a great deal; this will help prevent you from overheating.

, Taking pictures will make your experience more memorable. If you are on a family trip and you are taking a family picture, take a silly one now and then, just for fun. It may seem like a waste of time if you hate pictures, but when you are older, you will reflect on the pictures and see how much fun you had.


For a great silly picture, stand next to a Beefeater in London and try to make the Beefeater laugh. They are not allowed to flinch, let along acknowledge your presence, so the photo can be quite entertaining.

, Don't keep to yourself! Get immersed in the culture by starting up a conversation with people. The pub is a great place to do this, but you can be bold and talk to people in many places, such as the tourist office, local shops, in the park, etc. The locals are the ""real deal"" and if they thing you're a good egg, they might just even let you into some local secrets about gems to visit or great things to try.


Some places are inappropriate for striking up a conversation. For example, on the London Tube. Don't even try cracking a smile there. It is just not the done thing.

, All you will remember was that you were text messaging your friends and listening to your iPod the whole time if you feel overly attached to your gizmos, and you will not have as much fun. Keep texting and emailing for the hotel room at night, just before bed.

, Nothing ruins a good trip more than losing your stuff or having things stolen. Try to shore yourself up against this happening. As with traveling anywhere you are not familiar with, it pays to be sensible.


Keep a copy of your ID papers somewhere other than on you, maybe online, saved in an email to yourself. If you end up losing them, to have at least a copy to prove who you are.
Don't keep all your money in the same place; have some spare money hidden in various bags, pockets in case. Traveler's checks are still a good standby, as if they're lost or stolen, they can be canceled and reissued.
Don't keep too much cash on you, better use debit cards with limited amounts so if they get lost, you have possibility to instantly block them.

, Expect to have a good time, to learn new things about the countries you're visiting and to have your mind opened by new experiences. Just because things are not done or thought about in the same way as back at home, doesn't mean they're wrong, odd or confronting. Be open to what you can learn and take home; you may even discover better ways of doing or thinking about some things!

, Understanding local words and dialects can help you to become more deeply immersed in someone the local culture.

Consider taking the train.,
Take public transit as a family.",How to Save Money when Traveling with Kids1," To save money on transportation costs, consider planning an old fashioned road trip with the kids. The price of gas will likely be cheaper than paying for multiple plane tickets, especially if you have a large family. Try to travel with at least two people who can drive so you can drive in shifts, especially if the drive will be long.To keep the peace in the backseat while on the road trip, make sure you bring lots of snacks and games for the kids. Keep them occupied with music and singalongs in the car. This way, you can all travel in peace, cheaply.;
, If you do want to fly to your destination as a family, be sure to use any points or reward miles that you have accumulated to book your plane tickets. Set up a rewards system for air travel through your credit card or through a rewards card for a specific airline. Always check to see if you can use points to reduce the cost of plane tickets or to get better deals on flights.You should also do your research on possible flight options so you can find the cheapest one. Compare flight prices online. Watch for flight deals and book them right away so you get a more affordable price.

, If train travel is an option, look into train prices to see if it will be affordable. You can often buy rail passes that you can use for many days at a time and there is usually cheaper family pricing. Train travel may be a good option if you are planning to travel across the country, such as within Europe or within a specific area in the U.S.Some train passes also cover admission to certain attractions and excursions in the area you are travelling to. This may be a good option if you want to also save money on attractions for the whole family during your trip.

, Public transit, such as buses, light rail, and trams, are ideal if you want to save money when traveling with kids. Get a public transit pass as a family and use it to get around, especially if you are traveling to major cities or destinations. Often, public transit can be a great way to interact with the locals and see different areas from the comfort of your seat.


Most public transit passes can be purchased by day or for multiple days. They are often $10 or less, depending on where you are travelling.

See if you can stay with friends or family.",How to Save Money when Traveling with Kids2," Travelling during the off-season can make your travel expenses more affordable, especially transportation and accommodation costs. Going on your trip during the off-season, usually the fall months, will make hotels and other accommodations cheaper than during peak season. Consider booking your trip during the off-season or during shoulder-season, the time between peak and off-peak.For example, if you’re planning a trip to Walt Disney World, the shoulder-season is May and September, where crowds are thinner and accommodations are more affordable.

, Finding cheap accommodations when you have kids can be a challenge, especially if you want a space larger than a hotel room. Consider renting a house through online rental property sites. Often, a home rental will have an affordable nightly rate or week by week rate.Having a home rental will also help you to also save money by cooking your own meals and not having to pay for parking, if the home rental has a parking spot already.
A home share, where you share a home with other people or another family, can also be an affordable option. You may travel with family and friends and share a large home rental together to cut down on costs.

, If you decide to stay in a hotel while travelling, use hotel points to make it more affordable. Collect points over time through your credit card or another rewards card and use the points to reduce your hotel rates. Try to book a hotel during off-season or shoulder-season so you get a more affordable rate. Sometimes booking a hotel during the week instead of the weekend can be a cheaper option.You can also try looking online for deals on hotels and book it before you leave on your trip. Often rates are cheaper online and booking in advance may save you money.

, If you are traveling to a destination that is known to be popular with kids and families, such as Disneyland, look for travel packages. Travel packages often include airfare and accommodations at a reduced rate. This could be a good way for you to save money and not have to worry about booking your own accommodations, as it is included in the package.If you are travelling to a tropical destination, such as Mexico, you may look into travel packages where you stay at a family friendly resort. Resort packages often include airfare and accommodations.

, To really save money on accommodations, see if you can all stay with friends or family who live near your destination. You may plan a trip to see friends or family members who have larger homes where you can all stay together. Or you may set up a blow up mattress that you can then use when staying with family or friends to make your accommodations very cheap.

Book excursions in advance to save money.,
Find free, fun activities for the kids.,
Bring snacks and light meals on excursions.",How to Save Money when Traveling with Kids3," Do your research and make a list of excursions you want to go to with the kids. Then, book these excursions in advance, if possible. Often, booking excursions in advance can get you a cheaper rate. It will also put less stress on you to figure out things to do once you arrive at your destination.You should also check for family pricing when booking excursions. Often, booking excursions as a group or a family can make them cheaper.

, Excursions can be expensive, even with family pricing. To save money, look for free, fun activities for your kids. Research activities online in the area you are staying in, focusing on those that are free or very cheap. Come up with a fun, free activity for the kids to do while you are traveling.For example, you may book a free tour of the city you are staying in for you and the kids. Or you may take the kids to a play area at the resort you are staying in for free activities.
You can also bring books and games from home with you on the trip so the kids have things to do while in the car or in the hotel.

, To save money during excursions and activities, make sure you pack snacks and light meals. This way, if your kids get hungry, you have snacks on hand and can avoid eating out all the time. Buy snacks in bulk when you get to your destination. Prepare a few light meals that travel well and bring them when you are out for the day with the kids.For example, healthy snacks like nuts, sliced fruit, and granola bars are all good options. Light meals like sandwiches, mini yogurts, and sliced vegetables are also good for travel.

Understand the liberal way the Dutch government deals with drugs.,
Know that heroine, cocaine, meth, crack and the likes, are considered 'hard drugs'.,
Know that cannabis (weed, hasjies, joints, spacecake and such) and, to a certain extent, 'party-drugs' like XTC, are as illegal as hard drugs in every aspect.,
Know the law with respect to personal use.",How to Enjoy Coffee Houses in Amsterdam1," Drugs (apart from alcohol and cigarettes) are illegal in the Netherlands. But the Dutch make a difference between so called 'hard drugs' and 'soft drugs'.;
, These drugs are illegal to produce, to trade in, to traffic, to own and to buy. The Dutch government has an active policy of fighting anything to do with these drugs and you will be prosecuted if you are caught participating in any of those activities. To use such drugs is also illegal, but you will very rarely be prosecuted for the use in itself. As a drug-addict, you will be seen as someone that needs help. Part of the help you can get as a heroin addict, for instance, is that you will be allowed to enter a rehab-program where the government provides you with methadone, a much less harmful substitute. This is to prevent addicts from having to go out stealing and robbing to get money to pay for their 'fix'.

, However, possession and use of them is allowed, if for personal use only. That is because they are considered to be much less addictive and harmful than hard drugs. To prevent common citizens having to engage in dangerous criminal activities for a 'bit of fun' with which they can only harm themselves, you will not be prosecuted for owning or using these drugs for personal use.

, This can be very confusing. What are the limits of 'personal use'? The Dutch law is actually quite clear on this:


You may grow up to five cannabis plants in your own house, as long as no-one complains about it.
If you grow more, and you're caught, you will be prosecuted.
If you're growing them in a rental house, the landlord has the right to evict you immediately.
If where you grow them is your own property, the government can actually prevent you from using your own property for an extent of time that they deem reasonable.
You may possess an amount of 'soft-drugs' that is on par with how much you yourself generally use.

Be informed before going to a coffee shop that sells soft drugs.,
Be aware that as a tourist travelling back from Amsterdam, you may not take any drugs from the Netherlands back to your own country.,
Find a coffee shop that does not smell drugs if the soft drug usage is not your thing.",How to Enjoy Coffee Houses in Amsterdam2," Coffee shops are places where you can buy and use an amount of soft drugs (mostly cannabis) for personal use only. They are very tightly regulated:


You have to be over 18 to even enter a coffee shop. Coffee shop owners are legally obliged to check your age before they let you in.
A coffee shop is not allowed to sell any other drugs, nor are they allowed to sell alcohol.
A coffee shop is allowed to have an amount of soft drugs behind the counter that is reasonable for the average amount of customers they have. This is checked by the police on a regular basis.
A coffee shop owner has to keep an eye on the well being of their customers and can be held responsible if something goes wrong.

, Dutch customs check on this too! Also be aware that you might even be prosecuted in your own country if you arrive home from Amsterdam still under the influence of what you used in Amsterdam.

, Where do you get an actual coffee then, if coffee shops are not the place you want to be? Fortunately, there are many choices remaining for you, including:


Look for cafes, lunchrooms, restaurants, terraces and such. Any place that does not smell of weed.
Even some bakeries (bread shops) or patisseries will sometimes have some tables and chairs to have a cup a of coffee.
Check some of the bigger general stores like V&D, Bijenkorf and Hema.

Visit this site to find out if there is a bus stop near you, and at your destination. Remember, when you make a reservation, you will need to tell the phone operator where the bus stop is at your destination.;
, Book the Belbus at least 2 hours before your departure; ideally, you should book the bus one day before. Note that the rules for making a reservation may vary from town to town. If you plan to use the Belbus all week, you can mention this to the operator and they will make arrangements. Usually, the operator will ask you the following questions:


What is your name/client number?
When would you like to depart (date and time)?
Which bus stop will you depart from?
What is your destination?
Will you return with the Belbus?

Antwerp:+32 03 218 14 94

West Flanders:+32 059 56 52 56Note: If you wish to return with the Belbus, be sure to mention this to the operator. Otherwise you might find yourself stranded in an out-of-the-way location.

, Buy your ticket(s) a day or two before your trip. You don't have to do this, but it will make your trip easier and less stressful and it will help the bus driver keep to his schedule. You can buy tickets at any NMBS station (train station) in Belgium, or at the ticket window near the bus stop in a big city. You can also buy tickets at many newspaper and magazine shops.

, As a general rule, make sure you arrive at the bus stop at least 10 minutes before the bus driver is scheduled to pick you up. Don't forget to bring your ticket and any other items you might need.

Don't wear any clothing that screams ""American""!,
Dress fashionably.,
Speak quietly in public.",How to Appear Less American While Touring in Europe," Are they wearing sneakers? Boots? Heels/dress shoes? Take a look around and notice trends. Most Europeans do not wear sneakers, so wear boots, flats, or anything that suits your fancy. Make sure that they are comfortable as well.;
, Get one that's not too bulky, but warm. A lot of European countries get a considerable amount of rain and some are very cold. Make sure your jacket keeps you warm and dry.

, Don't wear shirts with American brands or slogans on them. ""American Eagle"", ""Hollister"", or ""Abercrombie & Fitch"" are probably not a good idea.

, Speak quietly and don't draw attention to yourself. Don't behave like a tourist, and be polite and courteous. You probably won't fool people thinking that you're European for long, but you can leave them with a good impression of yourself.

, Even if they do, they might not answer. Remember that those who do would still greatly appreciate a word or two in their native tongue. If they have great vocabulary and pronunciation, tell them. They'll appreciate it and treat you better.

, Attempting to speak the language is showing respect towards the nation and its people. Good words or phrases to know include are ""hello"", ""please"", ""goodbye"", ""do you have...?"", and ""do you speak English?""

, Examples include: shirts with American flag on it, ""I Love NY"" shirts, shorts with anything written on the butt, etc. At the same time, don't pretend to be of a different nationality; it might get you in trouble and put you in the position where you either have to lie or make a strange excuse.

, You don't have to sport all the latest trends, but try to put effort into your appearance. Clothing articles like hoodies and sweatpants probably won't make you very European looking, so try to stay away from the outdated and sloppy look.

, In America a 'notice me' approach to public volume is acceptable, but in Europe, your accent and loud talk will be unappreciated. You don't have to whisper, but try to act civilized and polite.

Know which documents to take.",How to Pack for a Trip to Africa1," At a minimum, you should have the following:


Passport
Visas - ask your passport office what visas are required for the relevant African countries for someone of your citizenship. Do this well in advance (in case you need to wait for visas).
Travel insurance
Cash - do not rely on being able to use automatic teller machines when traveling. Some places may not have them and others may not be functioning. Always have a second source of money. It also helps to have small US notes to give to people as tips, thank yous and to buy small articles.;
"
"
Choose appropriate clothing.,
Pack.,
Consider seriously the lightweight long trousers, as men in many African countries do not wear shorts.,
Consider also the colour of your chosen clothes, some colours get dirty very quickly.,
Many Africans pride themselves on keeping clean and tidy, even if their clothes are well worn.",How to Pack for a Trip to Africa2," For most African countries, lightweight clothing that can handle humidity and heat are suitable. But don't forget the right gear for colder climate times too, such as winter in Morocco or climbing into mountain regions.

, The following list is a helpful indicator to guide your packing:


1 long sleeved shirt
2 light long trousers
2 skirts/dresses
3 T-Shirts
2 shorts
1 swimsuit
1 small towel (get the type that is really small and expands with water, or choose camping/bike towels which are small but efficient; great for removing sweat)
1 hat
3 pairs of socks
Cotton underwear and socks
1 pair of walking boots
1 pair of sandals or flippers

, Long trousers also offer good protection against cuts/scratches in the bush and against mosquitoes in the evening.

, Try colours that match the dark earths in many parts of Africa. Brown and Grey are particularly adept at looking cleaner for longer.

, Brilliant white shirts, perfectly ironed are surprisingly common for men.

Check with South Africa’s Department of Home Affairs to see if you’ll need a visa by visiting http://www.home-affairs.gov.za/index.php/countries-exempt-from-sa-visas.


Citizens of most countries don’t need a visa for stays shorter than 30 or 90 days.;
, If you’re traveling to a yellow fever zone, you'll need to be vaccinated first. The vaccine must be done at least 10 days before departing for South Africa. Also get inoculated for Hepatitis A and typhoid. Consider taking malaria medicine if you plan to spend a lot of time outside, including on safari.Ask your doctor if you might be at risk for other diseases common to travelers, like Hepatitis A and rabies.

, Take care of getting adequate amounts of any medicines you’ll need. Also pick up over-the-counter medication you take regularly. Don’t count on being able to get equivalent medication while in South Africa.

, Call your bank to let them know the dates when you’ll be traveling and where, so they don’t put a hold on your credit or debit cards if you try to use them. Consider getting a Unique Rand Card, which is a prepaid debit card for travelers that lets you avoid fees for converting your currency like you would with your debit or credit card. Alternatively, you can get a more generic travel money card.Avoid getting traveler’s checks, because most businesses in South Africa don’t accept them.
Ask your bank about any additional fees for using your debit and credit cards in a foreign country.
Use the Unique Rand Card or other travel money debit card to protect yourself from debit and credit card fraud. These are a safe option because they aren’t linked to your financial institution and accounts at home.

, Bring loose, cool clothes for the summer, when temperatures generally reach 86°-104° Fahrenheit (30°-40° Celsius). Consider bringing a light jacket, sweater, or shawl for evenings, when the weather can cool down. Pack rain gear or an umbrella, especially if you’ll be in the Gauteng or North West province, where there are summer rains and thunderstorms.Pack sweaters, a jackets, and rain gear for the winter, when temperatures can go down to about 40° Fahrenheit (4.44° Celsius).

, Avoid bright colors that can scare animals away and dark colors that can attract insects. Make sure this clothing will be comfortable for trekking and extended periods of travel in the bush. Plan to dress in layers so you can adapt to temperatures throughout the day and be sure you have long sleeves and long pants to deter insects.Also bring toilet paper and hand sanitizer if you need to use the bushes for the toilet.
Pack a flashlight or headlamp for camp in the evenings.
Put everything in a soft-sided bag or duffel.
Don’t pack a lot of clothing. Bring laundry detergent or arrange for laundry so you can keep packing to a minimum.

, Bring a swimsuit and cover up for the beaches. If you plan to go to clubs, shows, or up-scale restaurants, bring more dressy clothes. For business, bring your regular business attire and shoes.Otherwise pack casual clothing.

, You’ll need these for safari, other hiking, and sightseeing in cities. Take your flip flops for the beach. Bring dressier shoes for more up-scale venues because you can’t wear flip flops or athletic shoes to those venues.

, Bring a sun hat -- this is essential on safari. Also pack your sunglasses to protect your eyes. Find a good sunscreen of at least 30 SPF and rest assured that you can pick up more throughout the country., Buy an adapter or two that will safely convert South Africa’s 220/230 volts AC 50 HZ electricity for your electronic devices. Get an adapter that will fit the plugs in South Africa, which are typically 15 amp 3-prong or 5 amp 2-prong, with round pins. Don’t forget your camera and battery charger when you’re packing your electronics.For information about the voltage in your country and how it compares to South Africa’s, check http://www.worldstandards.eu/electricity/plug-voltage-by-country/.

, Getting to South Africa requires a long flight from just about anywhere except other countries in Southern Africa. Bring lots to entertain yourself on the flight, including electronics, books, and magazines.


Consider bringing compression socks to make your flight more comfortable.
Take other items like a travel pillow, tissues, lotion, earplugs, snacks, and an eye mask to help you feel more comfortable on the long flight."

Tour companies know the town better.,
Try the ""Booze Cruise"":


The company should pick you up at your hotel at around 4 pm in the afternoon.,
Check out the nightlife next!,
Take it easy the next day.,
Fly about on day three.,
Experiment with bungy-jumping.,
Try a safari.,
Fly home again.,
Take home wonderful memories.",How to Enjoy Your Stay in Victoria Falls," Do not hurry in Africa, what you left out today will be waiting for you tomorrow. Remember that you are on holiday. If you hurry in Africa, your results will also hurry you.;
, Some things are best left for locals to experiment, not you. Go to the nearest bureau de change (money changing office) for any currency exchange. Bureaux de change are owned by banks and genuine big registered companies that will give you fair deals.

, They will give you the best and safest guide around this fast paced town. Try for a company that provides a ""holiday plan under one roof"".
Touring companies will provide you with a tour guide who will drive you to Victoria Falls in a safari vehicle at a cost as little as $15.00. This excludes the entrance fee that is only paid by individuals to the National Parks at the gate upon arrival at the Falls.
You will be tour guided through all the different falls. The tour guide will provide you with some umbrellas, since the whole area is a rainforest.
Your safari will generally last for an hour to two hours.
After the tour, you will be dropped off at your hotel's doorstep before your ""sunset cruise"" or ""booze cruise"". These often leave around 4 pm and the companies should collect you from your hotel doorstep.

,
You will arrive at the Jet-yard and transfer to your boat.
The cruise is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. The reason for this is that it provides one of the best ways to see game. Animals usually go to drink water at dusk, and hippos and crocs also like to busk in the sun during that quiet time.
Your cruise will end around 7 pm and you will be driven back to your hotel.

, It is not until you explore the nightlife in this crazy town that you'll have fully experienced it. It will all depend on one's taste in music where you choose where to go. Some suggestions include:


The Kingdom Hotel - it runs a club called The Wild Thing. If you like heavy metal or technotronic music, then this is the place to go.
If you like Kwaito and rave, Explorers will be an ideal place for you.
The the most popular spot if you wish to mix with the locals is Crock-Rock; this place will drive you crazy. It plays all types of music.

, The following day, you may feel a little seedy after all this nightlife! The rafting guides will wash it off by baptising you in the Mighty Zambezi. This will be your ""raft of a lifetime"". There has never been any river in the world with such rafting rapids. The rapids run from rapid one to rapid twenty four! Some say that even if you have been bothered by some evil spirits, these rapids will cleanse you. It is just a flipping day throughout. If your shoes are dirty, do not worry; Zambezi's whirlpools will clean them up without you noticing.

, Day three is a day to watch over where you had gone through by taking a helicopter ride above the Victoria Falls before flying over the rafting trails.

, If you are not yet done yet with adrenaline-pumping activities, try bungy-jumping off the world's second highest bungy bridge; this will make you want to go and take a rest, just to think of how crazy you have been.

, You may now cool it down by going on an elephant back safari or a game drive. Your mind will cool down as you explore that peaceful and tranquil environment. Take some pictures for your memories when you go back home.

, If you're flying home, don't forget to keep $20.00 for the airport fees that are taken on all international departures.

, You will never forget this trip.

Be aware of the licensing requirement to drive in Ethiopia.,
Decide how you wish to acquire an Ethiopian driver’s License.,
Examine your home driver’s license.,
Have your home driver’s license translated / notarized.,
Get your foreign license authenticated.,
Apply for an Ethiopian Driver’s License.,
Relearn to drive in Ethiopia.,
Learn to benefit from the road traffic rules.,
Be more informed before you drive.,
You are done!",How to Obtain a Driver's License in Ethiopia," Know that you cannot rent and drive a car in Ethiopia just because you have a home driver’s license issued in your country and perhaps did so several times in another foreign country. The same holds true even if you are holder of an International Driver’s permit. In other words, you are required to acquire an Ethiopian Driver’s License.;
, If you are already issued a license driving in your country, it will only cost you a paper work to acquire an Ethiopian license in exchange. In this way, you can acquire the license at any time and whether you are granted a work or resident permit as investor or foreign employee of a new or existing establishment. If you would like to take this option, continue reading this article to the end and follow the next steps. If you do not have a home driver’s license and choose to begin from the scratch, then you have to go to a car driving school in Ethiopia and qualify to get the license. That will require taking a medical exam and one written and two practical exams (Auto Driver Club 2014). However, you can do that only after you obtained a residence permit if you wish to acquire permanent/renewable license.

, You need to examine your home driver’s license to make sure it will be valid by the time you travel to Ethiopia and process your application for Ethiopian license. If not, renew your license online or at your local driver’s license office and have the renewed one with you. If you do not have a valid license, you will never be issued an Ethiopian license.

, As holder of driver’s license issued in a foreign country, you need to first get your license translated into Amharic or English by the Embassy of your country in Ethiopia. If the license is in English, the Embassy will notarize it. To get this done, locate the Embassy office in Addis Ababa and if possible contact the embassy prior to your visit to check its working hours and requirements. Normally the requirements are:


Foreign driving license;
Passport
Service fee

, Once your license is notarized or translated, you should get the approval of same by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The requirements are as follows:


Foreign driving license;
Translation / notarization of the Embassy
Service fee

, Now you can file application with the Ethiopian Road Authority. Locate the authority on Haile Gebreselassie Street in Addis Ababa (around Megenagna area) and fill in the application form. Provide the required documents and pay fees follows:


Completed application form for driver’s license
Translation / notarization with approval/authentication stamp
Passport-size photograph;
Photocopy of the foreign driving license;
Photocopy of passport;
Foreign/original driving license
Stamp (to be bought at issuing office)
Service fee
Stamp fee

, It won’t harm to learn the standard when driving in Ethiopia. You may practice with the assistance of one knowledgeable and well experienced in driving in Ethiopia.

, This will help you a great way as you are now about to start driving in Ethiopia. The general rules include the following:


Driving is on the right-hand side of the road.
To drive, a person needs to be 18 years old
The speed limit for cars and motorcycles in towns and villages is 30-50 km/h and outside towns 100 km/h
Drivers are not permitted to use their mobile phones while driving
Motorcyclists must wear crash helmets
Pedestrians must use zebra crossings to cross a road
It is not permitted honking a horn when not necessary
Children under 7 years of age are not permitted to be in the front seat
Seat belts are compulsory for a driver and front seat passenger
It is required to have a first aid kit in each car
The third party insurance is mandatory. All vehicles must have a windshield sticker displayed as proof of insurance

, In addition to the above rules, the Auto Driver Club outlines important additional information that appears to be useful particularly for a new foreigner driver in Ethiopia like you. Some of these are;


Drivers must be spatially careful and honking is often necessary to avoid accidents.
Drivers must be very careful when going through town and villages as people tend to cross the roads without looking, and animals may be present in the road.
In Ethiopia, riders insurance is not provided; therefore foreigner visitors must have their own medical / emergency insurance.
If a driver has an accident, he will have to pay for any damage caused.
In Ethiopia, there are different types of off-road pavements. These include good condition off-roads, gravel off-roads, sand off-roads, and off-road with bigger stones.
Emergency services are non-existent in many parts of the country so drivers should always carry spare tires, fuel, and tolls on long trips.

, Rent or own a car and drive! Now you are a proud holder of an Ethiopian Driver’s License. You can weave through the traffic in Addis and even hit the highway road outside the city should you do so to find land or go to your farm if you have already established one.

",How to Drive on Murram Roads in East Africa1,";
,, In particular, it is essential to check oil and water daily due to the harsh operating conditions experienced in East Africa.

,


Check that there are the correct number of wheel nuts on each wheel. It is not uncommon to find only three or four nuts on a five nut wheel.
Spare wheels are often missing from vehicles in Africa.
A puncture is going to be your most likely 'breakdown' on murram roads due to their harsh nature on tyres.
Many 4x4 drive vehicles are not permanent all wheel drive. Check the front wheel hubs; if there is a lockable hub.If planning to travel in the rain or through wet mud, consider engaging the hubs. Refer to the vehicles operating instructions if unsure.

If the hubs are not engaged and you slide into a ditch or bank you may not be able to access them and therefore may not be able to utilise the vehicles 4x4 capacity to drive out.

(If you think that you can't get stuck in a 4x4 vehicle then you have not been trying hard enough!) See for a real life story about driving on murram


It is unlikely that there will be any form of vehicle roadside recovery available. Being stranded in the African bush overnight is not likely to be comfortable or particularly safe.



,,,,,,,"
"
Take the following factor into your emergency plan: events happen on rural roads in Africa that can take time to circumnavigate


Look out for:

Rain (washouts, missing bridges etc) Especially after heavy downpours.,
When see a vehicle approaching do not start to move over to the side.,
Remember to keep your thumbs out of the center of the steering wheel as potholes can snatch the steering wheel out of your hands and hit your thumbs, ...hard.

,
Remember that when driving on dry murram, you have much less grip and need to take care to slow down more in corners and brake more gradually.

,
Remember that when driving on murram, muddy patches/pot holes can snatch the steering wheel from your hands.,
Use the vehicle's air conditioning if you have it since driving on murram can produce a lot of dust..,
Be aware that many local people may 'ask' for lifts.

,
Check with your insurers/company/employer for their policy regarding passengers.",How to Drive on Murram Roads in East Africa2,"
Animals - Cows, goats. Snakes (don't drive over them; wait)
Stuck, stranded or abandoned vehicles
Market days get very busy.
Pedestrians and cyclist, especially on market days.
Other crowds especially around ceremonial times like funerals, circumcision ceremonies, weddings, political rallies etc.


Many murram roads are heavily cambered to protect them from heavy rainfall. This means that the usual place to drive is in the center of the road for maximum comfort for passengers and driver.
Predictably this causes a problem when faced with a vehicle travelling on the opposite direction.

, If you do, the other driver will assume that you are willing to give way and will just keep on coming, straight at you in the center of the road. Possibly even driving you into the side of the road.


The usual way of passing could be compared to playing chicken.
Approach the other vehicle head on slowing down considerably to little above walking pace and at the last moment gracefully pull over to the side and the other vehicle will (hopefully) be doing exactly the same. Allowing a safe passing with neither vehicle being forced into the ditch or side of the road.

,,, Slow down on poor murram surfaces.

, Otherwise, stay well behind any vehicles in front or even consider pulling over for a minute to allow their dust to clear before proceeding.

,, Many do not allow them.

"
"
Avoid accidents.",How to Drive on Murram Roads in East Africa3," Hopefully, if you follow the above guidelines, accidents will be avoided. However, the protocol in many countries in Africa when involved in an accident is different from what occurs in places like the USA and Europe.


If involved in an accident in one of such countries, be aware that a large crowd may quickly gather, be very noisy and intimidating with lots of blame and shouting very likely.
Do not stop. Drive immediately to a police station and report the accident/get help.
You will achieve nothing staying at the scene and could put yourself in considerable danger if the crowd believe that the accident was your fault.
If you stay to 'argue' your case or 'try' and help anyone who is injured and there is a subsequent problem, you will be deemed responsible, with possible disastrous consequences.

",How to Choose the Best African Safari Operator for Your Safari," Some of the best advice you can get about a safari company is from someone who has been on an African safari with them in the past. There are dozens of websites on the web that list safari trip reports and journals written by previous travelers. Learn from them. It is also a good idea to see their website as usually people have commented on them in the attached blog.;
, Once you have shortlisted safari operators you need to check them out to make sure they are reputable. Here are the associations you can check: KATO - Kenya Association of Tour Operators, TATO - Tanzania Association of Tour Operators, SATSA - Southern Africa Tourism Services Association, TASA - Tours and Safari Association of Namibia, ATA - Africa Travel Association, ATTA - African Travel and Tourism Association, ASTA - American Society of Travel Agents, IATAN - International Airlines Travel Agent Network and APTA - Association for the Promotion of Tourism to Africa.

, Find out how many other people will be on your trip. Being crammed into a minibus with twelve other people is not the best way of going on safari. Make sure what it's included and what's not. Try to see the car before booking.

, Some operators have a trust that they place your money into before your trip which should protect it if they go into liquidation in the meantime.

,"
"
Don't be in a hurry to buy anything that is available.,
Try to find out the price of the item you want to buy, and don't carry the money along with you.

,
Always, the price that you're told is awfully inflated.,
Always let the seller do most of the talking because he is the boss.

,
Pretend to have seen the commodity/item in another shop and that the price wasn't as high as his.

,
In the event of him trying to reduce the price, by giving a discount, Try to find out how much he has given you as discount.,
He will accept the price, after which he will require the money.,
Go get the money.",How to Buy Things in Kenya," If you're sure that whatever you want is not running out of stock then don't be in a hurry.;
,, This may be because you are new to that part of town, or of a different race or tribe, or your way of dressing may also determine how much you get charged.

,,,


Compare it to his original offer, e.g say he started at Kshs 800, and now he wants to sell it to you at 650, he has given you a discount of 150, then the cost price must be about Kshs 500.
After establishing this, now decide down much you can offer him as a margin above his cost price of 500.
Counter offer by telling him that you want to pay 450.
He/she will disclose to you that that's below the cost price and that he bought it at 500.
Then counter offer again to 550
He will complain.
Then lastly offer him 570(20 shillings above your previous offer)
He will complain that addition of 20 shillings is too minimal.
Then counter offer by making it 50, hence the new price is 600. This is less of his first price of 650.
Remain defiant

, Tell him to wait.

, If you find another shop stocking the same item, Try to get a better price than 600. If it's impossible then go back to the first shop.

, These cards are official, usually produced from the doctor's office or the creator of the pacemaker, and they can warn security officials of hidden metal within the body.

, Depending upon your age, this can be anywhere between 6 months to 1 year before even long car travel is recommended. Consult your doctor about when you are recommended to resume traveling.

, Ask the doctor if there are any activities that you should avoid on your trip. Also, seek advice for what to do if you feel your device is in disrepair when you are away from the hospital.

, This is a good idea whether you are traveling by plane, train or boat, because you are informing and noting for the travel companies that you have medical concerns. You can indicate whether you do or do not need a wheelchair.

, You will likely be taken to a different area of the screening center, where they can use a wand to ensure the position above your heart is the only place that beeps to indicate hidden metal.


There have been some reports that metal detector gates can affect pacemakers or Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators (ICD). For this reason, a metal detecting wand would be preferable. There is no evidence to show that the in-flight environment affects pacemakers adversely.
If your doctor has told you that any metal detection wands or metal detection gates may have an adverse effect, you can ask the travel security staff for a private pat-down, after showing them your pacemaker identification card.

, Scar tissue may mean that the area is sensitive for an extended period of time and this can ease the burden.

, These can interfere with pacemakers and should be turned off before you enter a home or hotel with this type of system. Inform the staff, family or friend ahead of time.

, Do not linger in these gates. Step back into the store or library, show the guard your pacemaker ID card and submit to an inspection, if necessary.


Never linger near large electronic devices. This could be anything from a device in a museum to a large speaker system. These devices can interfere with the pacemaker.

, The maker of your device, such as Medtronic, has information on their website with addresses to the local hospitals or doctors' offices that can help you repair the pacemaker should you fall ill.

Make sure the operator is a member of ABTA, IATA or similar.,
Check that they have financial bonding and insurance.,
Check they have their own valid Tanzanian Tourist Board operating licence or work with a licensed company.,
Ensure they will provide a minimum of two qualified guides on every trip (even for a single person) and a minimum ratio of one guide for three climbers.,
Ask if you are being offered a private or group climb and a fixed or flexible itinerary.,
Check the quality of the equipment they use and the food they provide on the mountain.,
Ask what happens if your flight is cancelled or your luggage delayed.,
Ask what happens if one of your group falls ill and has to descend.,Check what is included in the price quoted.Compare costings carefully - even some of the largest operators miss out the cost of the Park Fees of up to £500 per person in the prices they quote, and add these on as a locally paid cost

,
Ask for real life customer references.Do not just rely on website testimonials - they are far too easy to fake.",How to Book an Operator for a Kilimanjaro Climb," Membership of a recognized travel body, while not a guarantee of quality, is a good indication that the firm you are looking at is reputable and trustworthy.;
, Bonding means that if the company goes bankrupt you are protected financially and proper insurance not only provides protection but is another good sign of quality as an operator cannot get insurance without having well prepared operational and risk management plans.

, In order to operate legally in Tanzania operators have to be licensed by the TTB. As it is against Tanzanian laws for a foreign company to operate mountain trekking, some operators have local partners.

, Two guides for just one climber might seem excessive but even guides can get ill or have an accident. With two or more climbers, maintaining a high guide ratio ensures that the needs of every climber can be looked after

, Group climbs and fixed itineraries can be cheaper but the real price paid is that the success rate is lower and a cheap climb that doesn’t get you to the top can later seem very expensive

, Kilimanjaro is a very tough environment and a small cramped tent that leaks will spoil your climb as surely as a lack of good quality food

, Flight delays and lost luggage are an all too familiar part of life in Africa so ask what happens if you arrive a day after the climb is scheduled to start. Has it left without you?

, Sadly some people will get sick on Kilimanjaro and be forced to descend. Check it is possible to continue so that at least some can summit.

,, Get some email addresses, or better phone numbers, and check out previous customers yourselves.

Refrain from travelling during advisories.,
Use heat safely.,
Know the signs of hypothermia.",How to Travel Safely in Winter1," Before you travel anywhere during the winter, make sure to check the weather. Depending on how long you will be gone, you should check the projected weather for at least 48 hours from the time you leave.If you are travelling from one place to another, check the weather at both places. Even if you are only driving an hour or two away, the weather might be drastically different and much harsh depending on weather patterns and where the destination is located.
You can check the weather via the internet or mobile weather apps. Many sites will have weather as well as road conditions. If the site you are using does not have road conditions, the state's Department of Transportation should have this information.;
, Before you travel anywhere, monitor the travel conditions. You can find this via mobile weather apps, the local Department of Transportation, and local news stations. Look for road closures, airport delays, subway or bus delays, mountain pass closures, and even state and national park closures.If you are flying, check conditions at the airport. Make sure there are no flight delays or cancellations.
If you live in a metro area with mass transportation, you may want to check on the status of the buses or subway trains. Many major city mass transits have apps that provide alerts, schedules, and alternate routes. You can also check the mass transit website for your area, or check the local news.

, No matter what kind of travel you are doing in the winter, let someone know where you are going. Leave a friend, family member, or co-worker a list of places you are visiting and when you should return.(This is is a good practice in general, regardless of the season.)

, If the roads are bad and you don’t want to drive, consider alternate transportation. Ask if you can carpool with others to work or school. If your area has mass transit, consider taking the train or bus so you don’t have to be on the roads.Carpooling with a more experienced winter driver can help keep you and others safer.

, You should plan all winter travel ahead of time. This includes winter driving, cycling, destination travel, subway travel, or walking.


Check current weather conditions. Winter weather can change quickly, so the forecast predicted a week ago might change within four or five days. Keep updated and make any necessary adjustments.
Pack accordingly. Winter weather brings dangers that spring, summer, and fall travel do not. Make sure you pack emergency kits, extra clothes, and any other needed items before you set out on your journey.
Even if you are only going around town, you should pack in case of emergencies. Subway trains can break down, you might get stuck on a blocked interstate for hours due to ice, you might end up in a building with no power, or you could be delayed at an airport. Always wear warm clothing or carry extra layers. Pack extra food and drink in case you get stuck somewhere for a long time. Always keep cell phones charged. Consider carrying non-cell phone sources of entertainment, like mp3 players, tablets, or books.

, No matter where you are travelling, you should dress for winter weather. Checking the temperature, the wind chill, and weather conditions before you leave your home can help you travel safely and warmly.You should always dress in layers. If you get too warm, you can remove them. Wear fleece-lined tights, sweater tights, or thermal underwear under pants. Wear thermal shirts or other long-sleeved shirts beneath your main shirt. Make sure you have warm coats, gloves, hats, and ear coverings. Wear warm socks, and add an extra pair if you need to.
Wear appropriate shoes. Snow boots can help keep you from falling and keep your feet warm in snowy or icy conditions. Consider galoshes or waders in heavy rain or wet conditions.
Think about choosing a coat based on the weather. If it’s raining or snowing a lot, you may want a weather resistant coat to keep you dry. If the wind chill is extremely low or there are wind warnings, a wind jacket might be better.

, If you are planning to travel and the weather service has issued an advisory, reconsider your travel plans. Travelling during adverse conditions puts you and others at risk.If possible, move your travel plans so you can travel during better weather conditions. This not only helps you stay safe, but keeps you from getting stuck in traffic due to the weather or facing flight delays.
If you have to travel, let people know where you are going. Take caution while traveling.

, In the event that you lose power or your car breaks down and you need to create a heat source, do so safely, and keeping in mind the potential of carbon monoxide poisoning. Never use a generator or grill indoors (including in a basement and garage) and make sure fireplaces, wood stoves, or other combustion heaters are properly ventilated to the outside and there are no leaks.Carbon monoxide is colorless, odorless, and deadly. Keep a carbon monoxide detector in your home.
If you are in a car or a tent, don't try using something like a camp stove or grill to generate heat, as this puts you at great risk for carbon monoxide poisoning.

, There are any number of scenarios — from your car breaking down to getting lost while on a walk — in which you or a companion might be susceptible to hypothermia. Knowing how to recognize hypothermia and how to treat it is important when traveling in the winter and may save a life.Signs of hypothermia in adults include shivering, exhaustion, confusion, fumbling hands, memory loss, slurred speech, and drowsiness.
Signs of hypothermia in infants include having bright red and cold skin and very low energy.
If possible, take the person's temperature. If his temperature has dropped below 95°F (35°C) then it is a medical emergency and he needs immediate medical attention.
If medical help is not available, try the following: move the person into a shelter or warm room and remove any wet clothing. Focus on warming the center of the body (chest, head, neck, and groin) before the extremities. Use an electric blanket if one is available; if not, use skin-to-skin contact and cover the person with layers of dry blankets, clothing, towels, or sheets. Try giving the person warm beverages (but not alcohol).
A person with severe hypothermia may become unconscious and may not appear to have a pulse or be breathing. Perform CPR while the person is being warmed — the person may still be resuscitated.

Avoid overexerting yourself.,
Know what to do if you become stranded.",How to Travel Safely in Winter2," When you are driving in wintery conditions, you should put together a winter safety kit. This stays in your vehicle in case of an emergency. The kit should include:Ice scraper, snow brush, and de-icer
Blankets
Flashlight and extra batteries
First aid kit
Jumper cables
Flares
Shovel
Extra warm clothes, like socks, gloves, hats, scarves, and even pants or shirts
Cell phone charger
Boots
Tire chains
You should also consider bringing additional food, water bottles, and warm beverages in a thermos with you whenever you travel in wintery conditions.

, At the start of winter, you should take your car in for maintenance, or check it over yourself. You should always have proper winter-friendly tires on your car. Always keep your car’s fuel level full.Check your battery, hoses, the radiator, belts, lights, heater, defroster, wiper, and brakes on your car.
Make sure to place windshield wiper fluid for winter conditions and temperatures in your car.
Make sure that your car has winter grade oil. Check your car’s manual or take it to a specialist to determine the kind of oil you need for winter conditions.Check your tires to make sure they are ready for winter. Check air pressure, tread, and overall condition of your tires. Driving on bad tires can be dangerous. Consider changing your tires to snow tires if you live in an area with heavy snow and ice. You can also get tires with studs that can help with driving. If you don't want to change tires every winter, you can also check into buying all-season tires., Before you set out on the road, make sure to remove any ice and snow from your car. This helps prevent your vision from being obstructed, and protects others so that snow or ice won’t fly off your car and hit their car.Use a snow brush to remove all snow from the entire car, including the roof, hood, and trunk.
Use an ice scraper to get ice off windows, including the windshield, door windows, and back window.
Make sure to remove snow and ice from mirrors and lights.
Keep in your car ice melt to help melt snow and kitty litter to help with traction in case there's a buildup of snow. You should also keep a snow shovel around so you can dig out the snow around your car when it builds up.

, If you find yourself in wintery conditions, make sure not to overexert yourself trying to get going. Shoveling snow, pushing cars, or jacking a car takes a lot of energy, especially in snowstorms. You are at risk for injury if you try this.If you walk around in a storm, you can risk severe injury or death. You can easily get lost in snowstorms, along with easily exhausting yourself. Stay in a shelter during snowstorms. If you are stranded in a car, call 911 and remain in your vehicle.

, It is possible you will get caught in a winter storm and have to pull over and wait it out or wait for help. Staying in your car is the safest choice. Tie a brightly colored piece of cloth to your antenna to make your car easier for rescuers to spot.Move any supplies from the trunk to inside the car. Wrap yourself in blankets, extra clothing, or even newspaper. Wrap your head, too.
Check the exhaust pipe to make sure it is not blocked by snow (which could lead to carbon monoxide poisoning), then run the motor and heat for about 10 minutes every hour, cracking a window to let in air.
Huddle with other passengers and keep moving your arms and legs to stay warm. Try to stay awake.
Do not eat unmelted snow — this can lower your body temperature.

Stay at home if possible.,
Drive slowly and carefully.,
Leave earlier.,
Keep distance between you and other vehicles.,
Follow chain and traction laws.,
Add weight to your car.",How to Travel Safely in Winter3," During extreme winter weather, take caution and stay at home. This keeps you off potentially dangerous roads and out of extreme weather.Move work or social plans until after the bad weather has passed.


Roads that are not well-traveled or in busy areas are more prone to ice. They may not have been treated as well as roads in more populated, busy areas.
Roads may be narrower and lanes decreased because of snow piles, fallen snow, or standing water.
In blizzards, squalls, or heavy snow, visibility can be extremely limited. Fog, rain, or spray from vehicles can also lower visibility. This makes driving and walking extremely dangerous.
Extreme wind chills can cause frostbite and hypothermia if you are exposed to them for long periods of time.

, When there are wintery conditions, make sure to drive slowly. This not only protects you, but others on the road. Slippery roads and low visibility makes fast driving reckless and potentially life-threatening. Concentrate on driving and remove any distractions, such as talking on your cell phone.Use your headlights. Make sure to use low-beams in dense fog or snow.
Don’t use cruise control during slippery conditions.
Start slowing down early for red lights and stop signs. Remember that stopping on the bottom of hills may be difficult and dangerous.
Bridges ice before roads, so take caution when driving over bridges.
If you can’t see due to sudden fog, dense snow, or heavy rain, pull off the road and wait for it to pass., Always give yourself extra time to get anywhere you need to get in wintery conditions. Leave 15 minutes to an hour earlier than you usually would.Check local traffic conditions as you decide how far in advance you should leave. You should leave early regardless of traffic, but you can factor traffic delays into your start time.
Never try to rush anywhere during wintery weather. If you are running behind, take it slow and just accept that you will be late.

, If you have to stop suddenly, slippery roads or low traction may make it difficult. Some vehicles take longer to stop than others. Because of this, you should refrain from tailgating or driving too close to others.Make sure there is space between you and the car in front of you in case you have to suddenly stop or lose control of your car.
Keep distance between your car and plows or salt trucks. Those vehicles have very low visibility, so the driver may not see you. Conditions ahead of a plow or salt truck may be worse than behind it if they haven't treated the roads yet.
4x4 vehicles don't stop faster than other cars. They may get going faster, but you still should take caution when braking and stay farther behind other cars.

, To help protect passengers on roadways, some states may institute a traction and chain law. This means that vehicles must have snow tires, chains, or a traction device, or be four-wheel or all-wheel drive. These are last measures taken before transportation departments close roads and highways.Failing to adhere to these laws result in fines.
You can find out if these laws have been instituted in your area through local news sources, your state’s Department of Transportation, or by signs on the highway.

, Try adding some extra weight to the back of your car to help driving on snowy and icy roads. This is helpful if you don't have a 4-wheel drive car, and especially helpful if you have a rear-wheel drive car.Try putting blocks, bags of sand, or 2-liter bottles filled with sand or rocks.

Wear bright clothing.,
Pay attention as you walk.,
Commute on your bicycle with the right gear.,
Fly on nonstop flights.,
Book flights wisely.",How to Travel Safely in Winter4," If you plan to travel by foot in the winter, make sure you not only dress warmly, but that you dress for visibility. When you walk, you want to make sure drivers of vehicles can see you. Wear brightly colored coats, hats, pants, or boots.You may also consider reflective tape, especially at night.
If you are walking in low visibility or at night, consider placing a light on yourself to alert drivers where you are.

, Walking in the winter can be a healthy and fun activity. Whether you are walking to commute, get exercise, or just enjoy being outdoors, make sure you pay attention to your surroundings. Stay on sidewalks or out of roadways with cars, especially if they are slippery.Focus on walking and your surroundings. Looking at your phone or other electronic devices as you walk puts you at risk.
Take caution at red lights and stop signs. In icy or snowy conditions, cars may have trouble stopping. Make sure to be careful as you cross streets.
Watch for icy patches on sidewalks. Walk slowly and pay attention to where you are walking so you don’t slip and fall., If you rely on your bicycle for your transportation, you can still use it in the winter. Make sure to have the right gear, and you can rely on your bicycle all winter.Wear proper clothing since you will be exposed to the elements. This includes layers, a wind jacket, wind pants, thermal underwear, windproof mittens with liners, hat, and helmet cover with ear covers.
Make sure your bike has sturdy tires. If you’re cycling through ice, use studded bicycle tires.
Place a bright light on the front of your bicycle and a red light on the back.
Make sure to wear reflective clothing, and place reflective tape on your helmet and bicycle. Visibility is diminished during the winter, so you need to make sure drivers in vehicles can see you.

, During the winter, consider flying on nonstop flights. This can help prevent you from getting stuck at a connecting airport due to winter weather. This may be a little more expensive, but could save you a headache due to a sudden snowstorm in your layover city.If you have to fly with a connection, watch the weather in the layover city closely, too. If there looks like there might be a problem due to weather, contact your airline and ask if there is anything they can do to help you.
If you have to have a layover, consider making the layover in a city that rarely has winter weather, like southern cities. If you booked a layover in a city with the threat of winter weather, call the airline to see if you can reroute through another city., Try booking an early flight if possible. Early flights are at a lower chance to be affected by delays at other airports. This can help you avoid delays due to winter weather.Consider booking with an airline that has many flights to and from your destination. If you end up delayed because of a storm, this gives you more options for a later flight.

Travel to family-friendly destinations with a lot of free or low cost activities.,
Search for destinations that will keep your transportation costs low.,
Compare the cost of driving versus flying.,
Pick a destination in the off season, when rates are often cheaper.",How to Travel With Kids On a Budget1," For example, national parks will charge you by the car, not per person. The Smithsonian museums in Washington, D.C. are free of charge.


Get advice from other families. Talk to people you know, or read travel blogs online to find out where others have taken great vacations that did not require a huge budget.
Think outside the country. Traveling to other countries that have a great currency exchange rate might help you get more for your money. For example, Costa Rica and Thailand might be expensive to get to, but once you are there your costs will be minimal.;
, For example, if you visit a city such as San Francisco or New York, you will not have to rent a car once you arrive.


Take advantage of public transportation, rent bikes and pack good walking shoes to ensure you can get around on foot.

, Airfare for you and your children might add up quickly, but do the math to make sure gas will not cost even more.


Look for discounted airfares. Flying from city to city can often be less expensive than driving, depending on the airline and the destination. For example, you can sometimes fly from Miami to Las Vegas on Southwest Air for as little as $99 each way.
Stay close to home if you want to drive. For example, if you live in Los Angeles you can plan a trip by car to the Grand Canyon. If you live in Atlanta, you might consider a trip with your kids to one of the Florida beaches.

,


Head to Colorado in the summer rather than the ski season, for example. Or visit New England in the spring instead of the autumn. Take a chance on a cruise during hurricane season, or book a trip to Iceland in February.

Attach the water hose.,
Connect the air compressor to the 2” nipple.,
Slowly open the valves.",How to Make Snow1," Snow making depends on the weather. The ideal conditions are temperatures 28 °F (−2 °C) or lower, with a low humidity.Snow making works best with a humidity under 50%.;
, The items for a snow maker can range from cheap to expensive. For a reasonably priced snow gun, visit the plumbing section in your local hardware store. You will need the following items:


1/4” cap - 1
1/4” NPT Tee – 1
1/4”close hex nipple - 1
1/4” x 2” pipe nipple - 4
1/4"" Female Ball or Gate Valve – 2
Female garden hose adapter – 1
Teflon tape, This aids in the sealing process of the parts of your snow gun so it doesn’t leak. Wrap the tape around the threaded ends. The threads should be visible through the tape.

, Use a 7/64"" drill bit when you drill the hole. This hole is where the snow will come out. This hole needs to be small, so make sure you don't make it any larger. When the water comes out, it should be a fine mist. Otherwise, you won't have snow.


Make sure the tape is wrapped in a way so it does not come apart when screwing the pieces together.

, The parts should fit together if you bought the correct sizes. All fittings should be 1/4” NPT fittings. You will need adjustable wrenches and vice grips when putting these parts together. Also make sure that each part is as tight and secure as possible. Put the parts together the following way:


Screw the cap onto one end of the hex nipple. Then, connect one of the vertical ends of the Tee to the other end of the nipple.
On the other end of the Tee (directly across from the hex nipple), connect the 2” nipple. This should leave one smooth side on the Tee, and one remaining opening.
Connect one gate or ball valve to the other end of the 2” nipple. On the other side of the valve, connect the other 2” nipple.
On the remaining opening of the Tee, connect a 2” nipple. Next, the other valve should be attached. On the other side of the ball valve, attach the last 2” nipple.
Finally, the female garden hose adapter should be attached to end of the 2” nipple.

, You want the snow to blow up at an angle, such as 45 degrees. You can set the snow maker on a tripod made from metal bars, the edge of a fence or deck, or any other sturdy, tall surface. Make sure to secure the snowmaker securely to the stand.

, The garden hose should first be attached to the water spigot. The other end of the hose should be attached to the female garden hose adapter.


When setting up the snow maker stand, make sure to think about how long the garden hose is. You must have enough room between the water spigot and the snow maker.

, The air compressor should be able to pump 8 CFM at 40 PSI or 6-7 CFM at 90 PSI. You can find this on the side of your air compressor. Turn on your water. The air and water pressure should stay around 40-50 PSI.


CFM means cubic feet per minute, while PSI means pounds per square inch.
Before turning on your compressor or the water, make sure the valves are closed.

, This will be trial and error. Start off slowly, just letting a little water and air through at a time.


Don’t let your air pressure get higher than your water pressure.
This snow gun uses internal mixing, which is when the water and compressed air mix inside the snowmaker to make snow.Make sure you watch and regulate the amount of water and air flow.

Make sure the weather conditions are right.,
Boil water.,
Toss the boiling water into the air.",How to Make Snow2," For this method to work, the weather needs to be extremely cold, like −30 °F (−34 °C).

Get magnet supplies.,
Strip insulation from the ends of the wire.,
Set up your supplies in a small bowl made of plastic or wood.,
Wrap the nail.,
Connect the wire ends to the battery.,
Test the magnet.",How to Make an Electromagnet1," To make an electromagnet, an electric current is run through a piece of metal, which creates a magnetic field. To make a simple electromagnet, then, you'll need a source of electricity, a conductor, and metal. Look around the house or check out the hardware store to get the following supplies:


A large iron nail
3 feet (0.9 m) of thin coated copper wire
A D-cell battery
Small magnetic objects, like paperclips or pins
Wire strippers
Masking tape
Small bowl made of plastic or wood;
, In order for the wire to effectively conduct electricity, its ends must be stripped of their protective insulation. The stripped ends will be wrapped around the two ends of the battery. Use the wire strippers to remove a few centimeters of insulation from either end of the copper wire.

, It's a good idea to contain the energy you're working with in a bowl that won't conduct electricity.

, Grasp the wire about 8 inches (20.3 cm) from the end. Position it at the head of the nail and wrap it around the nail. Make a second wrap adjacent to the first one; it should touch the first wrap, but not overlap it. Continue wrapping the nail until you've covered it all the way to the tip.


It's essential to wrap the nail with the wire always running in the same direction, so that the electricity can flow in one direction. If you wrap the wire in different directions, the electricity will flow in different directions, and you won't create a magnetic field.

, Wrap the exposed end of one side of the wire around the metal part of the battery on the positive side. Wrap the other exposed end to the negative side of the battery. Place a small piece of masking tape over the wrapped wire on both sides to keep it in place.


The side of the battery you attach the wire to will determine the polarity of the magnetic field you are creating. Switching the wires will also switch the poles. Either way, the nail will become magnetized.
When you attach the second wire end, the battery will begin conducting electricity through the wire coil immediately. The nail will grow hot, so be careful not to burn yourself.

, Once the wires are attached to the battery and the electricity starts flowing, the nail will become magnetized. Test it by placing it against a paperclip or another small piece of metal. If the nail picks up the metal object, the magnet is working.


When you're finished using the magnet, detach the wire ends from the battery.

Check the history of past hurricane seasons to make your decision on whether you'd want to go. Try to compromise and pick a location in the country that is not prone to devastation from typhoons or hurricanes.Try to get the latest information and watch as the storm develops.


The Caribbean islands like Jamaica, Cuba, and the Dominican Republic are in the hurricane belt while islands like Aruba, Bonaire, and Curacao have a lower frequency of hurricanes.The Weather Channel's website provides commuter details for travelers during the hurricane season.;
, Look up the cancellation policies so that you don't lose deposits for things to do at your destination. Don't purchase tickets to things that don't have a refund policy in case of a hurricane or you may lose your money.


Places like Disney World allow travelers to cancel their hotel and activity reservations a week in advance with no added fees in the case of a hurricane.Villas and hotels on the Cayman Islands offer a worry-free hurricane guarantee that will reimburse travelers in case of hurricane cancellations., Understand hurricane season and when areas of the world are prone to hurricanes. When you plan for vacation, try to plan your trip towards the end of a hurricane season.

, The key to good ballistics gel is the gelatin that you use. While you can order specialized gelatin, the cost can be very prohibitive. Knox brand Gelatine works very similar to the specialty gelatin, and can be found at most major grocery retailers.

, To make the gel, you will need a gallon of water for every 13 ounces of gelatin. This will give you about a 10% mix by weight, which will make for the best ballistics gel.


This recipe will be using 9 gallons (34.1 L) of water and 117 ounces of gelatin.

, For this recipe, you will have to cool the gel down to about 36 °F (2 °C). Make sure that your refrigerator can fit the container, or that you have a cool place such as a garage to set the gelatin.


It will need to set for at least 8 hours in a cold location, so be sure that you can afford to make that much room in your refrigerator for that long.

,
Wait 2 to 12 hours.,
Exhale.,
Burn something with carbon in it.,
Mix carbon-containing chemicals.",How to Make CO₂," Use plastic instead of glass; if you should build enough pressure to rupture the bottle, a plastic bottle will not explode the way a glass bottle would.


If you’re planning to use the generated CO2 to supply carbon dioxide for the plants in your aquarium, a bottle of this size will provide an adequate supply for a 25-gallon (94.64 l) aquarium.;
, Use raw instead of refined sugar, as it has more complex sugars that will take longer for the yeast to break down. It’s also cheaper.

, Warm tap water is sufficient; hot water will kill the yeast.

, Sodium bicarbonate is the principal ingredient in baking soda, available at most stores.

, If available, this will help the yeast last longer.


An example of a yeast extract is Vegemite, found in Australia. Other yeast extracts include Bovril, Cenovis, and Marmite., Brewer’s yeast lasts longer than baker’s yeast, but baker’s yeast lasts long enough for the reaction and is cheaper than brewer’s yeast.

,, You should see a slight foaming at the top of the water.

,, The water should start to bubble during this time, showing that CO2 is being released. If you don’t see bubbling after 12 hours, you either had the water too hot or your yeast is no longer active.


Your solution should bubble at about the rate of 2 bubbles every second. Any faster, and you may upset the pH of the water., Your body uses the oxygen you inhale to react with the proteins, fatty acids, and carbohydrates you ingest. One of the results of this reaction is the carbon dioxide you exhale.


In contrast, plants and some forms of bacteria take carbon dioxide from the air and, with energy supplied from sunlight, make simple sugars (which are carbohydrates).

, Life on Earth is based on the element carbon. To burn something requires a spark, a fuel source, and an atmosphere to burn it in. The oxygen in our atmosphere readily reacts with other substances; put it with burning carbon, and you get carbon dioxide.


Calcium oxide (CaO), also known as quicklime, can be produced by burning limestone, which contains calcium carbonate (CaCO3). The CO2 is driven off, leaving the calcium oxide. (For this reason, it is also called burnt lime.), The carbon and oxygen that make up CO2 are found in a number of chemicals and minerals classified as carbonates or, when hydrogen is also present, bicarbonates. Reactions with other chemicals can release CO2 into the air or mix it with water to form carbonic acid (H2CO3). Some of the possible reactions include the following:


Hydrochloric acid and calcium carbonate. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) is the acid found in the human stomach. Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) is found in limestone, chalk, eggshells, pearls, and coral, as well as some antacids.When the two chemicals are mixed, calcium chloride and carbonic acid are formed, and the carbonic acid breaks down into water and carbon dioxide.
Vinegar and baking soda. Vinegar is a solution of acetic acid (C2H4O2), while baking soda is sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3). Mixing them produces water, sodium acetate, and CO2, usually in a foamy reaction.
Methane and water vapor. This reaction is performed industrially to extract hydrogen by using steam at high temperatures. The methane (CH4) reacts with the water vapor (H2O) to produce hydrogen (H2) and carbon monoxide (CO), a deadly gas. The carbon monoxide is then mixed with water vapor at lower temperatures to produce more hydrogen and turn the carbon monoxide into safer carbon dioxide.Yeast and sugar. When yeast is added to sugar in solution, as in the instructions in Part One, it forces the sugar to break down and give off CO2. The reaction also produces ethanol (C2H5OH), the form of alcohol found in alcoholic beverages. This reaction is called fermentation.

Cut two pieces of wire.,
Set up your supplies in a small bowl made of plastic or wood.,
Wrap the nail with the longer piece of wire.,
Attach wire to the battery.,
Attach the mechanical switch.You can use a regular mechanical switch or a knife switch to make this electromagnet, both available for purchase at hardware stores.,
Use the switch.",How to Make an Electromagnet2," Instead of using just one piece of wire, you'll need two pieces: one should be about 6 inches (15.2 cm) long, the other about 2 yards (1.8 m). Strip all four wire ends back about 1 inch (2.5 cm).

, It's a good idea to contain the energy you're working with in a bowl that won't conduct electricity.

, Starting about 8 inches (20.3 cm) from the end of the wire, wrap the nail from the head to the end with tight coils that touch, but do not overlap. Continue wrapping until the entire nail is covered.

, Attach one end of the wire wrapped around the nail to the positive end of the battery. Attach one end of the smaller piece of wire around the other side of the battery.

, If you don't want to buy a switch, make your own by following these instructions:


Get a small block of wood, two thumbtacks, and a paperclip.
Tack the end of the copper wire wrapped around the nail to the block of wood by wrapping it around the metal part of a thumbtack and pushing it into the wood.
Wrap the end of the short wire leading from the battery around the other tack. Use the tack to fasten the paperclip to the wood about 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) from the first tack.

, To make the electric current flow, turn the switch on. If you're using a homemade switch, slide the paperclip toward the first tack until it touches the tack. This will complete the circuit and cause the current to flow. To switch off the current, swivel the paperclip away from the first tack.

Use a power pack instead of a single battery.,
Use a larger piece of metal.,
Make more wraps around the metal.",How to Make an Electromagnet3," Power packs last longer and create a stronger electric current than a single battery. They're available at hardware stores and battery shops., Instead of using a nail, try using a longer metal rod. Be sure to use it with a power back to create a stronger magnet.

, The more coils you create, the stronger the electric current. Adding a new coil is like adding another magnet. Get more wire and make as many wraps as you can to create a very powerful magnet."

Pack essential things like prescription medicine and clothing as well.Other things that can go in your hurricane preparedness kit include wireless cell-phone chargers, a battery-powered radio, flashlight, and can opener.
You should also bring things like filtration bottles, energy bars, and batteries., Keep an eye out for potential storms or weather disasters that threaten to hit the location you're staying at. Be prepared to switch to an earlier flight to avoid the hazards of being in the middle of a hurricane. Watch local news stations and listen to the local radio to hear updates about any oncoming storms.


Call the customer service department at your airline and see if your flight can be moved for an earlier time., Communicate with the airport or monitor the status of your flight on their official website. Some airlines will even allow you to set up specialized notifications that can alert you if your flight's been canceled.If it's too dangerous to fly because of the weather, there's a likelihood that your flight could be canceled.

Communicate with hotel staff.,
Stick together and stay inside.,
Put as many walls between you and the outside elements as possible.,
Do not use electrical equipment.,
Tune into emergency alerts.",How to Travel During Hurricane Season3," Get the emergency policies from the staff, so you know the correct procedures during a hurricane.Understanding the procedures in the case of an emergency can keep you safe, and the staff most likely already has a procedure to evacuate guests to safe areas.


Talk to the front desk before the hurricane hits so that you have an understanding for the safety and evacuation plan.
If there is an evacuation plan to somewhere safe, follow hotel staff as soon as possible.

, Going outside during a hurricane poses a variety of threats to your life. Flying debris or lightning could potentially kill you.It's important that the group you're traveling with stay together inside so that if an evacuation takes place, you can stick together.


During the eye of the storm there will be a moment of calm before the hurricane picks up rapidly in the other direction. Stay inside until you're sure it's safe.Communicate your safety knowledge with others in your group so they can remain safe as well.

, The elements from a hurricane can create flying debris that can penetrate the sides of a house or building. Stay in an interior room, closet, or hallway on the lowest floor of the building.The only time this wouldn't be the case is if the building you were staying in began to flood. In this case, you should seek refuge to a higher floor.


Keep clear of glass windows, skylights, and glass doors. The debris that's moved around from the incredible winds of a hurricane can easily shatter glass windows., Stay away from all plugged in electrical appliances during a hurricane. You can also be struck by lightning if you are in contact with things like plumbing, metal doors, window frames, or a corded phone. Stay away from any exposed wires and do not shower or bathe during the hurricane.Cordless phones are safe to use during a hurricane.

, The Emergency Alert System was created by the government to help people act in the case of a major emergency or environmental disaster like a hurricane. This requires satellite and cable providers to post alerts and evacuation instructions. Also, there is the Wireless Emergency Alerts that send the same notifications to your cell phone. Make sure to follow the emergency alert's instructions.Use wireless laptops, phones, and radios to update you during a hurricane.
The NOAA Weather Radio All Hazards is a network of radio stations that report on severe weather around the U.S."

Obtain a large plastic storage container.,
Measure and mark the mold.,
Spray the container with non-stick cooking spray.",How to Make Ballistics Gel2," Find a container that is 12 (h) x 12 (w) x 20 (l) inches in size. Avoid containers with patterns on the sides or bottom, as it will make removing the gel more difficult.

, Measure the inside wall 6 inches (15.2 cm) from the bottom of the container and mark it with a permanent marker. This will be the line that you fill the water to.

, Coat the entire inside with spray to help release the gel when it is finished. Wipe any excess spray out to avoid cloudiness in the finished gel.

"
"
Fill the container with warm water.,
Get ready to mix.,
Add the gelatin.,
Scoop off foam and bubbles.,
Cool the gelatin.,
Extract the gel.,
Cut the gel.,
Shoot the block.,
Take photos.",How to Make Ballistics Gel3," Fill the mold to the line drawn earlier using warm tap water. Ideally, the temperature should be around 105 °F (41 °C). Use a thermometer to maintain a good average temperature.


Making gelatin takes longer with warm water as opposed to hot, but results in a clearer final product.

, The mixing process will take a significant amount of time, so make sure that you can comfortably mix for about twenty minutes. You’ll want to mix with a large spoon, wooden or metal.

, Use a 1-cup measuring cup to slowly add gelatin to the water. You need to be stirring constantly to avoid clumping. Add all of the gelatin over the course of about 10 minutes, sprinkling one cup at a time.


This step is much easier with two people. One person stirs, while the other slowly adds the gelatin. After the gelatin has been added, you can swap stirring duties to give your arm a break.
To improve the clarity, you can add cinnamon oil to the gelatin. You will need about 9 drops; 1 drop per gallon of water. Add the cinnamon oil about halfway through the stirring process.

, After the stirring is complete, there will be a little bit of foam on the top of the mixture. Gently scoops this out and discard. There should be no visible foam or clumps of undissolved gelatin in the final mix.

, You want to cool the mixture to about 36 °F (2 °C). Avoid freezing it, or else the blocks will become too cloudy. If you don’t get it cool enough, the gel will not get as dense as it needs to. Cool the gel for at least 8 hours, preferably overnight.

, Once the gel has fully cooled, gently turn the container over onto a clean flat surface such as a kitchen counter. Slowly guide the gel out of the container with your hands to help avoid cracking the block.

, Use a large kitchen knife to cut the block into two halves. Cut the long way so that you are left with two narrow blocks with the dimensions 6 x 6 x 20. Gently wrap each block completely in plastic wrap. This will prevent evaporation, which will affect the density and integrity of the block.


After wrapping the block, place a stiff piece of cardboard on each block and wrap it again. The cardboard will make transporting the block much easier.
Store the blocks at 40 °F (4 °C) or cooler until you are ready to shoot them. Transport the blocks in a cooler to help keep them at optimum density.

, Place the blocks on a stable flat surface. A piece of plywood on sawhorses will work. Adjust the blocks so that you shoot into a 6 x 6 square end. If you are firing a high-powered gun, place a cement block behind the ballistics gel to keep the force from knocking the block off of the platform.


Always follow proper safety procedures when handling fierarms.
Be careful unwrapping the gel, you don’t want it to crack just before you shoot it.
Ballistics gel is typically shot from about 10 feet (3.0 m) out.
There are three standard tests: Naked – nothing covering the block. Lightly clothed – two t-shirts covering the block. Heavily clothed – two t-shirts and two pairs of jeans covering the block.

, If you want to take photos of the results, paint the plywood that you placed the blocks on white. This will highlight the bullet fragments. You will be able to see the results best in bright sunlight.

Assemble your materials.,
Pour the gelatin into one of the containers.,
Slowly add the water to the gelatin.,
Fill a sink with hot water.,
Spray the other container.,
Pour the melted gel into the second container.,
Knock the gel out of the container.,
Shoot the gel.",How to Make Ballistics Gel4," You will need two plastic containers (16 oz), two packets of Knox Gelatine, a measuring cup, cooking spray, and water.

, Add both packets to one container. Measure 3/4 cup of water into the measuring cup.

, Stir the mixture with a spoon slowly to keep air bubbles from forming. Place the stirred mixture into a refrigerator for 3-4 hours.

, Place the chilled container into the hot water for about 15 minutes to melt the set gelatin back into a liquid.


If the water is not hot enough, the gelatin will not melt back down to liquid form. Heat water on a stove if necessary.

, While the gel is melting, spray the second container with the cooking spray. If you don’t have access to cooking spray, any non-stick oil will work.

, Slowly pour the melted gel to keep air bubbles from forming under the surface. Place the gel back in fridge and let it cool for 12 hours.

, Once the gel has set, you can knock it out of the container. It should easily fall out in one piece, thanks to the cooking spray.

, Place the gel on a flat stable surface and shoot it with the airsoft or pellet gun. Shoot from about 10 feet (3.0 m) away.


Always follow proper safety procedures when handling fierarms.

Understand your assignment.,
Know the parts of an animal cell.,
Draw a map of an animal cell.,
Start early.",How to Make an Animal Cell for a Science Project1," If you are building an animal cell for a science fair or as part of a homework project, you will have to know what the rules and expectations are. There is a wide variety of animal cell models you can build, and you want to do the best job you can. Be sure that you are absolutely clear about what is expected of you. Some key questions to ask yourself (or your teacher) include:


Are you supposed to come up with your own design for an animal cell, or are you supposed to follow your teacher's instructions?
Do the cells have to be edible or non-edible?
Which components of an animal cell must be included?
How large must the cell model be?
When must the cell model be completed?
Must the cell model be 3D?
;
, One of the most important parts of an animal cell model is correctly representing each of the parts of a cell. Remember that animal cells and plant cells look very different from one another: they have different parts, and animal cells are not as symmetrical as plant cells are.Be sure that you are familiar with the individual components of a cell, including their function, where in the cell they are located, and what they look like. All of this will help make your model more accurate. The parts of an animal cell you might represent include:


Nucleolus. This is an organelle where RNA is produced. It is contained within the cell's nucleus.It is usually a slightly darker color than the nucleus.Nucleus. The nucleus is in the center of the cell. DNA is contained here, and the nucleus also governs protein synthesis.Nuclear membrane. This is a thin membrane surrounding the nucleus.Centrosomes. These help create microtubules and are located just outside the nucleus.Cytoplasm. This substance is contained by the cell outside of the nucleus and within the cell membrane. It contains the other organelles of the cell that govern cell function, and it has a jellylike consistency.Lysosomes. These organelles digest nutrients, and they are round in shape.Ribosomes. Ribosomes are very small and grain like in appearance. They aid protein synthesis.Golgi bodies. These look like a stack of flat circles, and they help construct membranes for other organelles.Vacuoles. These are asymmetrical sacs filled with fluid and surrounded by a membrane. They are used to store waste material.Endoplasmic reticulum. These are a set of connected, folded tubes within the cell, used to transport material from one part of the cell to another. Endoplasmic reticulum that is covered with ribosomes is referred to as rough endoplasmic reticulum and tubes that are not covered with ribosomes are smooth endoplasmic reticulum. Smooth endoplasmic reticulum branches off from rough endoplasmic reticulum.
Mitochondria. Mitochondria convert glucose into energy for the cell.They can be round or rod-shaped.Cell membrane. The cell membrane is the thin outside barrier of the cell, made out of protein and fat.It allows certain materials though while keeping other organic materials safely within the cell., If you don't have a worksheet labeling the parts of a cell and their appearance, you should draw one yourself. You will need a thorough and complete map of an animal cell to help you plan, design, and execute your model. Be sure that the map is large enough for you to label each cell component clearly and accurately. Keep this diagram with you at all times so that you can be sure that your cell model is correct.

, Depending on the type of model you build, you might require a lot of time to create and assemble your model. For example, clay has to harden, gelatin must be given time to set, and you might have to go shopping for extra materials. Give yourself plenty of time to plan out and construct the best possible cell model you can.

Study variations of the experiment.",How to Make a Volcano out of Mentos and Soda," You can try this with various forms of soda, but a 2 liter (0.53 US gal) bottle of Diet Coke will have the most dramatic explosion, often rising more than 10 feet (3 m) in the air.If you want to have a smaller explosion, consider buying a smaller bottle, such as a 20 oz bottle. But a 2L bottle is the standard size used in these experiments and the geyser will last longer than in a smaller bottle.;
, This will act as the covering to create a volcanic shape around the bottle. Consider buying it in a dark color, like a brown or green, to mimic the actual appearance of a mountainous volcano.


You should also consider decorating or drawing on the paper to make it resemble a volcano. For this you will need markers, colored pencils or crayons.
You will also need tape, glue and a pair of scissors to secure the construction paper around the bottle.

, You can find them in the candy aisle of your local grocery store or sometimes near the checkout lane. They come in 1.32 oz rolls.

, When you add the Mentos to the bottle, you won't want to add them in gradually, one at a time. The bottle will start to explode before you can finish adding them all. Instead create a funnel to help you drop all the candies into the bottle at the same time.


Take an index card and form it into a rounded shape, so it looks like a chute. You will use this to pour all of the Mentos into the soda bottle at the same time.
You can tape the index card together so it retains its circular shape.

, You will need something strong enough to support the bottle of soda. You might need to cut a piece of a poster board as a base for your volcano.


If you have an old tray or cutting board, you can also use this as the base of your volcano.
If you are performing this experiment for a school project, make sure your surface is portable and can fit into the car or bus that takes you to school., Lay out the paper horizontally and draw from the top down (as you will fold it).


If you have brown construction paper, consider drawing on it so it resembles a volcano. Many volcanoes have ridges, so you can draw some of these in black or green, so they stand out against the brown shade of the paper.
You can also consider adding trees or other elements of green to the paper.

, Then tape it to the mouth of the bottle. You can leave the cap on as the construction paper should be attached just below the cap line on the bottle. The paper should cover the bottle in a cone shape from its mouth to the bottom flat tray or cardboard surface.


Shape the paper so it has a narrow, circular opening around the mouth of the bottle and a wide, circular opening at the bottom. You will have to overlap the paper at the mouth of the bottle to make it more narrow.
If you don't have enough paper to cover the bottom of the bottle, add an additional piece of construction paper to cover the gap. You can attach it will clear Scotch tape so it will be hard to see.

, You can just decorate the the coke bottle in construction paper, or you can add a layer of paper mache to the construction paper to give it additional depth and texture.Buy some cardboard. If you add paper mache to the construction paper, you will need to reinforce it with a sturdier material, like cardboard or poster paper.Cut out the cardboard in 3 pieces. You might need a pair of box cutters to cut through the material. Each piece doesn't have to be in a cone shape like the paper. They just have to be wide enough and tall enough to hold up the paper when you wrap it in a cone shape. Try four inches in width and six inches in height to begin with.
Use a sturdy form of glue (like Elmer's) to attach the cardboard to the cone-shaped construction paper. Put aside to let it dry while you prepare to make the paper mache mix.
Make the mix for paper mache. Take 1 cup water and 1 cup flour and mix them together in a bowl. Stir with a spoon or whisk thoroughly until all of the lumps are gone from the mixture.Add a few tablespoons of salt to prevent the mixture from becoming hardened into a mold. Stir until dissolved.Cut 20-30 strips of newspaper that are long enough to cover the cone shape of the volcano. Soak half of these in the mixture for 5 minutes so they can be fully covered.Apply one layer (or 10-15 strips) onto the cone. You can apply the strips horizontally or vertically, whichever you prefer. Make sure they lie flush against each other so you have no gaps or puckering between the strips.Allow time to dry completely (20-30 minutes). Try to make sure you first layer is even and cover the cone entirely. While you are waiting for it to dry, go ahead an add the additional strips to the mixture.
Apply a second layer of strips to the cone after the first layer has dried. It is very important that the first layer is dry before you add additional strips. Allow the second layer to fully dry.Decorate the paper mache cone. Paper mache tends to hold paint or spray paint well, so these could both be options. You can pick a traditional volcano color, like brown or green, but you could also consider bolder colors if you want something less realistic, like gold, silver or orange.
Place the cone back over the Diet Coke bottle. Since it will be free standing with the support of the cardboard, you won't need to tape it to the bottler. Make sure the opening of the cone is big enough to access the cap on the mouth of the bottle.

, If you want it to truly look like a volcano that is about the explode, consider decorating the space around the bottle. You might consider putting dirt around the surface, adding rocks and grass, or drawing in a river (if you are using a piece of poster board).


If you are using a surface like a tray or cutting board, be careful not to draw anything permanent on the surface that could damage it.
Avoid attaching the soda bottle to the surface. If you glue it to the surface, this could damage the surface or tip over the bottle once it explodes from the Mentos. Instead, simply place the bottle and its cone-shaped decoration on the surface shortly before you plan to complete the experiment.

, Because the soda will spew very violently, you need to make sure your eyes are protected. Wear goggles from your chemistry classroom or swimming goggles.

, Because this is a messy experiment -- with fizzy soda shooting everywhere -- be sure that you are wearing clothing you don't mind getting stained.


You can also wear a rain coat or another water resistant piece of clothing to protect you.

, This is a key step because this experiment will cause a huge mess if done indoors.Ideally you should pick a location with a durable surface that is far from any buildings or cars. A concrete area such as a school's parking lot or outdoor courtyard would be a great location.

, Set your poster board or tray down on the ground. Place the soda bottle volcano on the surface. Remove the cap from the soda bottle.

, Place your funnel so it fits within the mouth of the bottle. Drop 4-5 whole Mentos into the bottle all at once. Quickly remove the funnel and back away as the bottle will soon spout off fizzy soda.


If you want the explosion to occur at a slightly slower rate, then crush up the Mentos before you drop them into the bottle. You will probably need a knife to help crush and cut up the four Mentos. If you are an elementary school student, ask an adult for help with this step.

, After the soda bottle has exploded, be sure to use a hose to clean off the surface that has been hit by soda.

, Soda is different from beverages such as plain water because it is carbonated. That means it has been filled with dissolved carbon dioxide gas.Although the carbon dioxide gas bonds with water molecules in soda, it is still trying to escape from the liquid when it is not in a pressurized container. You can see this when you pour soda from a bottle into a cup -- the gas creates a slight foam or fizz as it escapes the water and touches the air., Why does the soda fizz once the Mentos hits the bottle? It's not due to a chemical component in the candy, but rather, the physical contact of the candy's shell with the liquid.


Mentos candies have very small pits in their shells. As the candy sinks to the bottom of the soda bottle, these pits increase the activity of the carbon dioxide gases in the soda. When the candies hit the bottom of the bottle, all of the gas that has been building up is released and the soda explodes from the bottle., If you have the time, you can also measure different results with different variations of this exam. Here are some methods to try:


Try rinsing the Mentos in water first before adding them to the soda bottle. This will change the texture of the candies' shells. How does this compare to the earlier explosion with normal, whole Mentos?
Check for changes in temperature. Do the results of the experiment alter when the bottle of soda has been chilled? What if the bottle has been left in the car on a hot day?Compare the height of the geyser in different experiments. If you can, try to set off the geyser near a wall or the side of building (only do this if you have a hose so you can wash the side of the building afterwards). Try to mark the height of the geyser each time you perform the experiment. Do you see any difference in the range of height? (You may need a building with a second story window or a fire escape to gauge this).

Purchase supplies at a grocery store.,
Line a bowl or large cup with a clear plastic bag.,
Prepare your gelatin.,
Add the cell components according to your diagram.,
Create a key to your gelatin cell.",How to Make an Animal Cell for a Science Project2," Edible animal cell models can be made easily with common, inexpensive ingredients at local supermarkets and grocery stores. You have some flexibility in the specific ingredients you use to represent cell components. However, in general what you require is a gelatin base that is light in color to represent cytoplasm, a plastic bag to represent a cell membrane, and various candies, fruits, and nuts to represent organelles and other cell components. In general, some good ingredients to purchase could include:A light-colored gelatin mix, such as a lemon-flavored jello. You can also purchase a clear or light-colored fruit juice (like lemonade or limeade) along with unflavored gelatin packets. This will eventually be your cytoplasm. It is important that you pick a light color so that the other cell components will stand out.
A large, pitted fruit to represent a nucleus (the fruit) and the nucleolus (the pit). Depending on how large your model is, you might use a plum, peach, apricot, or cherry.Small, round candies or fruits. These will represent your lysosomes. For example, M&Ms, Skittles, gumballs, or grapes might serve as effective lysosomes.Oval- or rod-shaped candies or fruits. These will represent your mitochondria. Raisins, craisins, Mike & Ike's, or dried apricots would all work, depending on the size of your model.Slightly larger, irregular candies or fruits. These will represent your vacuoles. Small banana slices, jaw breakers, or gummy rings are good options.Very small, grain-shaped candies. These will represent your ribosomes, so they must be considerably smaller than your other cell components. Some good possibilities could include: Tic-Tacs, Nerds, or extra-small jelly beans.A round, dense piece of candy. This will represent your centrosome. Gumdrops or Gushers could make an effective centrosome.Long, stringy pieces of candy. These will represent the endoplasmic reticulum. If you want to be very precise, you can buy one type that is coated in sugar (to represent the rough endoplasmic reticulum) and one type that is smooth (to represent the smooth endoplasmic reticulum). Some excellent options include gummy worms, sour worms, and various kinds of licorice rope.Long, flat candy or fruit roll-up. When you fold up a long, flat piece of candy or fruit snack, you will have an excellent representation of Golgi bodies. Try bubblegum tape, fruit roll-ups, or other kinds of fruit leather to create this organelle., In many projects, the clear plastic bag represents the cell membrane. It is important that it be clear so that your cell model is perfectly visible. Find a medium-size bowl or large cup--such as a vessel that can hold about a gallon of liquid--and line it with a clear plastic bag. This will serve as the mold for your gelatin as well as the outside of your cell model., Most jello and gelatin packets will have clear instructions on the best way to prepare your gelatin mold. It is a good idea to follow these instructions closely, with one exception: put in slightly less liquid than the recipe calls for. This will help your gelatin model remain tougher and more solid, which will help your cell model remain intact.In general, the instructions on how to prepare a gelatin include:


Dissolving gelatin in boiling water in a heat-proof bowl, stirring carefully.Adding cold water (the same amount as the boiling water).Cooling slightly.
Carefully pouring the mixture into the lined bowl you prepared.Sealing the bag and placing it in the refrigerator until it is not-quite-set (45 minutes to an hour).Removing from the refrigerator when the gelatin is stiff enough to suspend your cell components but soft enough to insert fruits and candies deep within the mold.

, Once your gelatin mold is slightly set, you can insert the fruits, nuts, and candies you chose for your cell components and organelles. The gelatin should be flexible enough that you can use a spoon, straw, or your fingers to push these components into their proper places within the gelatin cytoplasm.Always refer to your original diagram to make sure you are placing everything correctly.

, If you are bringing this model to school or a science fair, you will want to attach a key to your project to allow onlookers to differentiate between the different components of your cell. Be sure to tell them which candies represent which cell parts.If you have to transport the model for long distances, it is a good idea to use a cooler to make sure that your model doesn't melt in the heat.

Purchase your materials.,
Bake your cakes.,
Frost your cakes once they are cool.,
Decide how you would like to represent a nucleus.,
Color and sculpt your fondant.,
Place your organelles and cell parts on top of the cake.,
Label cell parts if necessary.",How to Make an Animal Cell for a Science Project3," In order to make a 3D cell model out of cake, you will need to have the right materials to make the structure of the cell (the cake itself), material for cytoplasm (a light-colored frosting or jelly), and 3D components for the cell parts (nuts, fruits, candies, or molded fondant). You have a lot of flexibility with the design of your cake and the specific ingredients you use to represent the parts of a cell. However, in general you will want to have the following ingredients on hand:Enough cake batter to make a two-layer round cake. You can choose to bake any flavor of cake you wish, in a light or a dark color. You could even choose to bake one layer of each. This is the base of your cell.
A cupcake top, large piece of fruit, or a round cookie-cutter to create the shape of your nucleus in the center of your cake.
At least two different colors of frosting. You could choose to use two different flavors (such as lemon and raspberry) or you could add food coloring to a light-colored frosting to create a second color. You should use the lighter-colored frosting as your cytoplasm on top of the cake, and the darker color as the cell membrane to the sides of your cake.Fondant and food coloring. If you wish to sculpt your own cell components out of fondant, you can purchase fondant in a store along with various kinds of food coloring to differentiate your organelles from one another. It is also possible to make your own fondant. If you do not wish to sculpt your cell components, you can choose appropriately shaped fruit, candy, and nuts to represent them instead.
Small, round candies or fruits. These will represent your lysosomes. For example, M&Ms, Skittles, gumballs, or grapes might serve as effective lysosomes.Oval- or rod-shaped candies, nuts, or fruits. These will represent your mitochondria. Raisins, craisins, Mike & Ike's, almonds, or dried apricots would all work, depending on the size of your model.Slightly larger, irregular candies, nuts, or fruits. These will represent your vacuoles. Small banana slices, jaw breakers, brazil nuts, or gummy rings are good options.Very small, grain-shaped candies or sprinkles. These will represent your ribosomes, so they must be considerably smaller than your other cell components. Some good possibilities could include: Tic-Tacs, Nerds, and various kinds of sprinkles or funfetti.A round, dense piece of candy. This will represent your centrosome. Gumdrops or Gushers could make an effective centrosome.Long, stringy pieces of candy. These will represent the endoplasmic reticulum. If you want to be very precise, you can buy one type that is coated in sugar (to represent the rough endoplasmic reticulum) and one type that is smooth (to represent the smooth endoplasmic reticulum). Some excellent options include gummy worms, sour worms, and various kinds of licorice rope.Long, flat candy or fruit roll-up. When you fold up a long, flat piece of candy or fruit snack, you will have an excellent representation of Golgi bodies. Try bubblegum tape, fruit roll-ups, or other kinds of fruit leather to create this organelle., Using round cake tins, bake your cake mix according to package instructions. You are also free to use your own from-scratch cake recipe if you like: just be sure to make enough cake batter for two round cake layers.

, After your cakes are fully cooked and cooled, you can begin to ice them. Add a thin layer of icing (of any color) on top of the bottom cake layer. Then place the top layer of cake on top of the bottom layer, taking care to make sure the sides are even. Then ice the top of the cake with the light color of icing. This will represent your cytoplasm. Ice the sides of the cake with the darker icing. This will represent your cell membrane., There are several ways you could place a nucleus on your cell cake. You could cut the top off of a cupcake and place it in the center of your cake. You could use a piece of round fruit--such as an apricot or plum--that has been cut in half. You could also cut out a round, cookie-sized piece from the top layer of your cake, exposing the bottom cake layer. Any of these methods would serve as an excellent nucleus. Just make sure that the nucleus is round and centered on top of your cake.

, Fondant is an edible, sculptable substance that many cake decorators use to shape smooth, complicated components. If you would like to sculpt your own cell parts, divide up your fondant into at least seven portions. Color each portion of fondant a different shade using your food coloring. Use your hands to shape each individual cell component, including:


Small, round lysosomes
Tiny, granular ribosomes
Long, thin endoplasmic reticulum
Round, dense centrosomes
A flat, circular stack of Golgi bodies
Rod-shaped mitochondria
Asymmetrical, hollow vacuoles

, At this point, you will have all of your cell components on hand, whether they are sculpted out of fondant or store-bought candy and nuts. Arrange them on top of your cake in a way that matches your drawn diagram. Pat yourself on the back for a job well done!

, If you are required to label your cell components, attach a small paper flag with the cell part's name to a toothpick and insert it into the appropriate spot on the cake. That way everybody will know which types of candy (or fondant shape) is associated with which cell part.

Paint the newly-exposed cross-section of the ball a different color.,
Attach your cell components with glue or toothpicks according to your diagram.,
Label your cell components with toothpick flags.",How to Make an Animal Cell for a Science Project4," There are many different ways for you to build an animal cell model out of common, inexpensive materials. Take some time to consider what supplies you already have around the house that might work. In general, some supplies you will require include:


Modeling clay or play-doh in many different colors
Styrofoam balls of varying sizes
Several colors of paint
Glue
Toothpicks
Scissors and/or a sharp knife
Pipe cleaners
Construction paper
Small, round objects such as buttons, dry noodles, beads, pieces of cardboard or foamboard, glitter/confetti, or small pieces of plastic

, A large Styrofoam ball is probably the best option for you to use as your cell base. However, any other spherical object that is not hollow and that can be cut with a knife or scissors could work, such as a large ball of soft clay.If the ball is not yet colored, paint the outside of the ball any color you wish. You could also use your favorite color of play-doh or modeling clay to coat the outside of the ball in a solid color., Using a sharp knife, cut away one-quarter of the ball. Do this by marking the top of the ball with a pencil. Then cut through that top point until your knife has reached the very center of the ball. Remove the knife. Then turn the ball exactly 90 degrees and make another cut into the center of the ball. This should allow you to remove a perfect 90-degree chunk from the ball. This will allow you to represent the internal workings of the cell in the form of a cross-section., The internal parts of the ball should be painted a different color. This will represent your cytoplasm. You can paint the cytoplasm any color you wish, though a lighter color will allow your cell parts to show up more clearly.

, Be creative about what common household objects can represent different cell components. If you have trouble finding an object that resembles an organelle, you can create your own using play-doh or modeling clay.Attach these cell components to the cross-section of your cell using glue or toothpicks, depending on the texture of the material. Soft materials such as styrofoam or clay should be attached with toothpicks; hard, slick material such as plastic should be attached with glue. Always refer to your original diagram to make sure you are placing everything correctly. A few suggestions for objects you can use in your model include the following:For your nucleus: a small ball of play-doh or clay, a smaller styrofoam ball (cut in half), a ping-pong ball (cut in half), the plastic top of a large milk jug, or a plastic egg
For your endoplasmic reticulum: string, twine, pipe cleaners, rubber cords, or bungee cord
For your Golgi bodies: a small stack of cardboard circles glued together, a folded piece of ribbon
Ribosomes: confetti, glitter, dry rice
Lysosomes: buttons, small plastic circles, small paper or cardboard circles, small clay balls
Mitochondria: dry macaroni noodles, oval-shaped buttons or toggles, almond-shaped beads, dry beans
Vacuoles: glass marbles, hollow rubber balls cut in half, bottle caps, small cut-up pieces of a plastic bag

, For each cell component (nucleus, lysosome, mitochondria, etc.), create a toothpick flag by gluing a small, triangular piece of construction paper to a toothpick. Label each cell component clearly and correctly. Then insert these toothpick flags into the open cross-section of your cell model. Now your teachers and classmates will be able to distinguish the parts of your cell model!

Find the gel concentration required.,
Obtain an electrophoresis gel casting tray.,
Gather the required chemicals.,
Add the agarose.,
Prepare the mixture.,
Add the EtBr.,
Fill the casting trays.,
Insert the combs.,
Allow the casting trays to cool and the gel to set for 1 hour.",How to Make an Electrophoresis Gel," This must be specified by the physician and will vary based on the type of testing required by the study the physician is performing. Common concentrations are 0.7 percent. 0.8 percent, 1.0 percent and 1.2 percent.;
, These trays are available at medical supply outlets. Note the volume of the tray because it will determine the maximum amount of electrophoresis gel that can be made at once.

, Get an amount of Tris-Acetate-EDTA (TAE) sufficient to make up the volume of the gel being made. The amount of agarose, the polymer that forms the gel, will depend on the concentration of the gel to be made. The expressed gel percentage is agarose in grams divided by TAE in mL. The final ingredient needed is ethidium bromide (EtBr). EtBr makes DNA visible under ultraviolet light. Divide the amount of TAE used by 1000 to determine the amount of EtBr needed.

, Add the determined amount of agarose to the required amount of TAE. Gently stir or swirl the mixture to ensure proper mixing.

, The agarose in TAE must be heated in a microwave oven to dissolve it. Warm the solution for short periods of time, such as 15 seconds, on low power. Check the progress of the melting constantly. If the TAE is warmed to the point where particulate matter is formed, the batch has been ruined.

, EtBr is a powerful biohazard. Laboratory gloves should be worn for this part of the process. Add the EtBr after heating of the TAE has been completed. Gently stir or swirl the container to ensure proper mixing. Allow the liquid to stand and cool for 5 minutes.

, Swirl or stir the chemical mixture to ensure that there is uniform temperature throughout the mixture. Pour the mixture carefully in to the casting tray.

, Place the casting combs into the support rails of the casting tray. The comb teeth will create wells in the gel to which the sample to be tested can be added. The combs come in various sizes to create various size wells. The size wells that need to be formed will be determined by the physician based on the study to be performed.

, Remove the casting combs. Remove the gel from the casting tray. The electrophoresis gel is now ready for use.

, If you have young children or elderly parents, there is a risk that they could fall ill and require your care. If you booked your trip months in advance, there's also a risk that during that time something could go wrong and force you to cancel.

, Don't buy trip cancellation insurance from your cruise ship or other travel provider. If the company goes out of business, that will ruin your trip -- but it's also likely that the insurance policy you purchased would be void.

, Common covered reasons include sickness, injury or the death of you or your travel companions. You may also be covered in the event of inclement weather or the theft of passports and other travel documents.


Some policies may cover additional contingencies, including pregnancy, divorce or work-related emergencies that affect your financial standing or prevent you from taking your trip.

, If you purchased the trip with your card, you may be already covered under federal credit laws. These laws protect consumers from making a purchase or contracting a service and then not receiving goods or services in return.

Determine how large your vandergraph generator will be.,
Construct the sphere.,
Build the base.,
Make the tower.",How to Make a Van de Graaff Generator1," The larger it is, the more impressive its effects will be. The size will determine the dimensions of the main components: sphere, tower and base.;
, You can buy a hollow metal sphere or make one from materials you have on hand. Some possibilities are metal mixing bowls, gazing balls or a world globe sanded of its paint.

, This is a somewhat heavy box that serves to enclose the lower part of the generator and balance the weight of the metal sphere, so the generator won't be prone to tipping over.


Transparent thermoplastic is the best choice for the base. It will do a better job of keeping moisture from the air out of the generator, as moisture may interfere with the generator's functioning. It will also allow you to see how the generator works.
Include a hinged door large enough to allow you to reach inside. You need access to the interior of the box during construction and to make adjustments, if needed. If you use a motor to operate the generator, you will need to reach inside to turn the motor on and off.

, This is a tube that connects the base to the sphere and houses the belt and rollers. A good choice is a length of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe.

"
"
Fit rollers at each end of the tower.,
Stretch a loop of dielectric material such as silk, spandex, neoprene or rubber between the rollers.",How to Make a Van de Graaff Generator2," The axles of the rollers sit in notches or holes drilled in the tube, allowing the rollers to move freely.


One roller should be made of metal and one of polyethylene. When the generator is assembled, the metal roller will be inside the sphere and the polyethelene roller will be inside the base.

, The loop will hold the rollers in place.


Take care not to allow any oil from your hands to get on the dialectric material, or the generator may not function.
If you use rubber for the belt, make sure it isn't black, since this indicates that carbon is present in the rubber. Carbon will not allow electrons to be pulled from the belt, and the generator won't function.

You can make a metal comb by attaching thin wires to a thick, stiff wire. You can also use part of a braided grounding strap, unbraiding and spreading out the individual wires to create a brush.

,, Attach the comb or bush to ground.

Bolt a small electric motor to the bottom of the base.,
Assemble the generator and connect the motor.

",How to Make a Van de Graaff Generator4," Position it so it can be attached to the axle of the polyethelene roller.


The motor can be powered by AC current or batteries. It can be connected directly to the axle (direct drive) or connected by a belt. Motors can be salvaged from other devices, like sewing machines. You can also purchase motors at an electronic supply store.
If you don't want to use a motor you can use a hand crank attached to the roller instead.

You can find a travel agent by looking in the phone book or searching online. Call them up and explain the type of insurance you want. They may be able to point you in the right direction.

, There are several different types of insurance, and some insurers will bundle all of them in a comprehensive “travel insurance” package. Consider the following types of coverage:Trip cancellation. This insurance reimburses you for your pre-paid, non-refundable expenses if you need to cancel before you depart.

lost passport
natural disaster
hijacking
civil unrest
injury, illness, or death to you, a traveling companion, or a family memberjury duty

“Cancel for any reason” rider. With this rider, you can cancel for any reason and get reimbursed. You will have to pay more for this rider, up to 12% of your trip.However, it can afford greater peace of mind.
Emergency medical or dental insurance. If you’re traveling out of the country, you shouldn’t assume your insurance will cover you should you become ill or injured. Accordingly, you might want to buy emergency medical/dental insurance.
Emergency medical transportation. This insurance will arrange for you to be transported to an appropriate medical facility to receive treatment.

, You can use a website that will gather quotes for you from many different insurers. Or you can contact several insurers on your own. Whichever method you choose, request quotes from multiple insurers. Generally, travel insurance costs roughly 4-8% of the trip cost.Also discuss details of the policy. The company may provide you with a sample policy. If not, ask what are covered events and how much you will be reimbursed if you need to use the insurance.

If a traveler fell sick or was injured, get medical records. Also get a doctor to sign a letter or a physician’s statement form, which your insurer should provide.
If you miss a connection, then find proof of payment and proof of why you missed the connection, such as severe weather.For example, you can print off weather reports or try to get something in writing from the airline explaining the reason for the delay.

, You’ll need to show the insurer how much you spent. Save all receipts.It’s best to buy a folder and store all receipts there. If possible, try to get digital copies of receipts in case you lose the physical one. For example, you could take a photo of your receipt using your smart phone.


If you have flight delay coverage, save receipts for your hotel room as well as for meals.
If you have flight cancellation coverage, find the receipt for the trip that was cancelled.

, As soon as you know there is a problem, find the phone number for your insurer. Call them and report the problem.Ask what other information they will need from you.

The European Union also has regulations regarding airline compensation for cancelled flights, provided the cancellation was due to something within the carrier's flight such as overbooking.;
, Even if compensation isn't required by law, many airlines have their own corporate policies allowing some manner of compensation for canceled flights.Keep in mind that full-service airlines are more likely to offer compensation for canceled flights than their no-frills, budget counterparts.
Typically, the airline will offer to rebook you on the next available flight. However, this may cause complications if the flight doesn't leave for several hours or even days after the flight on which you were initially scheduled – particularly if you have an appointment at your destination or need to catch a connecting flight.
Some airlines have a policy of reimbursing you for expenses you incurred for food or lodging as a result of a flight cancellation, but you must submit receipts and other information to the airline after the fact.

, You should be able to find a phone number or website for customer service issues on your purchase confirmation, ticket, or boarding pass.


You may get a more favorable response from the customer service line than you do from the employee at the ticket counter in the airport. That employee has to deal with potentially every person on your flight, while the customer service representative likely is working under less stressful conditions.
Use facts to back up your argument that the canceled flight is more than a mere inconvenience for you, but avoid exaggerating or making something up to make your situation sound more dire.
Keep in mind that if the airline does agree to compensate you, it likely will ask for proof of whatever loss you claim to have suffered.
Take detailed notes during your phone call, including the date and time of your call and the names of any representatives with whom you speak.

, Conducting your negotiations in writing provides you with proof of any promises that are made on the airline's behalf.


If you are offered compensation by a telephone representative, write a letter as soon as possible detailing the conversation and the compensation offered. Include copies of any documents, receipts, or other information you were told to provide.
Many airlines such as United also will provide a verification letter for you upon your request, which you can use as proof your flight was canceled.This letter may help you mitigate damages suffered as a result of any appointments or reservations you have to postpone or change as a result of your canceled flight.

, Even if the airline has no corporate policy or legal requirement to compensate you for a canceled flight, persistence can pay off.


If a reasonable amount of time has passed and the airline has refused your request for compensation or hasn't responded, look for the name of a director or manager to whom you can direct your future correspondence.
You might also consider filing a complaint with the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT). Since U.S. law doesn't require airline compensation for canceled flights, this likely won't get you much further, but the complaint will be passed on to the airline.To record a complaint about airline service with the DOT, you can call 202-366-2220. A DOT agent will return your call during regular business hours. You also can use the DOT's web form or write a letter and send it to Aviation Consumer Protection Division, C-75, U.S. Department of Transportation, 1200 New Jersey Ave, S.E., Washington, DC 20590.

Check your credit card agreement.,
Contact customer service.,
Explain your situation.,
Submit your claim.",How to Get Airline Compensation for Canceled Flights2," Many credit cards provide travel insurance as a benefit to cardholders who purchase plane tickets using that card.While many travel-oriented credit products offer travel insurance that provides compensation for expenses directly incurred as a result of a canceled flight, the coverage amounts and restrictions vary significantly. For example, some of these policies provide protection for the cardholder only, not members of your family who may have been traveling with you.
Ideally, you should check the protections offered by your credit cards before you book your trip so you can use the card that provides the greatest level of protection in the event something goes wrong.
While a few credit card companies do provide compensation for canceled flights, these policies most frequently cover accidents and loss or damage to luggage.

, Typically you can take advantage of any travel benefits provided by your credit card company by calling the customer service number on the back of your credit card.


If you had to sign up separately for travel insurance benefits from your credit card company, there may be a separate phone number for you to call.
Keep in mind that some of the cards require an additional sign-up process or fees to activate these benefits. This typically must be done before you purchase your tickets or go on your trip., Tell the customer service representative what happened to you and confirm the situation is covered by your cardholder benefits.


Credit card companies that cover the costs of a delay, cancellation, or trip interruption typically only do so under certain circumstances such as weather or equipment failure. If your flight was canceled for some reason other than those covered by your credit card's policy, don't expect any compensation.You may need to submit a verification letter from the airline stating the reason your flight was canceled.
Find out from the customer service representative what information and documentation is required for your claim to be processed, as well as any deadlines your credit card company may have for filing a claim., Follow your credit card company's guidelines to claim reimbursement or other compensation for your canceled flight.Typically the credit card company will only reimburse expenses you paid using their credit card, and you'll still have to provide significant documentation of the need for those expenses and their relation to the cancellation of your flight.
Most credit card companies have a maximum amount of expenses they will reimburse, and not every expense will qualify even if your total is below that threshold.
For example, your credit card company may be willing to reimburse food expenses for meals you had to eat at the airport as a result of a flight cancellation or delay, but it may balk at covering a dinner you ate at a five-star restaurant downtown after learning your flight was canceled.

Compare policies in advance.,
Choose the policy that best meets your needs.,
Keep in touch with your carrier.,
Preserve receipts and documentation.,
File your claim as soon as possible.",How to Get Airline Compensation for Canceled Flights3," Look at the prices and coverage levels of several different travel insurance policies before you commit to one.If you plan to buy travel insurance, you should purchase it either on the same day you book your trip or as soon afterward as possible.
If you travel frequently, you may want to consider a multi-trip or annual policy, which can save you both time and money compared to purchasing travel insurance for each trip separately.
Different policies cover travel for different lengths of time, and cover different types of risks. Typically the more risks are covered, the more expensive the policy will be.
You may want to check with a third-party such as a travel agent or a travel website if you're unsure about different types of policies.
You also should consider talking to friends, particularly if you know someone who is a frequent traveler or who just returned from a trip similar to the one you want to take. In addition to their recommendations, their stories can help you assess the risks you might encounter on your trip.

, Which policy is the best fit for you will depend on where you're going, how long you'll be gone, and the reasons for your trip.The policy that will work best for you also depends on how much risk you are willing to take. That may fluctuate depending on where you plan to travel. For example, you may want more comprehensive coverage if you're planning a safari in Africa than you would want if you were visiting Toronto for a week to stay with friends.
Travel insurance may go beyond compensation for canceled flights to include medical or legal expenses as well as coverage for personal liability while you're on your trip.

, Once you've purchased your travel insurance policy, make sure you update your carrier if any plans or details change that might affect your coverage.You typically must notify your carrier if you change travel plans, particularly the date of your departure or locations you plan to visit.
You also should notify your carrier if you expand your trip, causing your travel expenses to increase significantly, as the cost of your trip typically affects the maximum amount your policy covers.
Additionally, your policy is designed to cover your trip based on the costs you provide. Any difference between the actual cost and the figures you gave your insurance company can result in a claim being denied., Review the claim forms and information before your trip begins so you have a sense of the types of information your carrier requires to process a claim.You typically will need information about your trip including your dates of travel, as well as copies of receipts for any expenses you incurred as result of the cancellation.
If your flight is delayed or canceled, contact the airline and ask for a verification letter. The insurance company may require it to process your claim., Your claim is less likely to be denied if you file it soon after your flight is canceled, rather than racking up additional expenses.Travel insurance companies typically only cover a certain amount of related expenses per day, so it's in your best interest to mitigate your damages to the extent possible.
When you file your claim, make sure you've included all requested information and documentation.

Make sure you are licensed.,
Understand what you’re buying.,
Tell the rental company where you’ll be driving the car.,
Make sure the rental company knows who will be driving the car.,
Purchase the insurance when you make your reservation.",How to Get Car Insurance While Traveling Abroad1," Not all countries accept US driver’s licenses. If you don’t make a reservation ahead of time, you don’t want to find out that you’re ineligible to rent a car altogether because you don’t have an International Driving Permit.International Driving Permits (IDP) are not too difficult to obtain. You’ll need to fill out an application through the American Automobile Association or the National Auto Club, have a valid US license, two passport pictures, and $20. The AAA application can be found at http://www.aaa.com/vacation/idpf.html and the NAC’s can be found at http://www.thenac.com/idp_faqs.htm.
You should check with the US Embassy or Consulate at http://www.usembassy.gov/ in the country you’ll be visiting to see if you’ll need an IDP.;
, Liability coverage for damages to anything outside of the car (damage you or the car inflicts) is usually included in the price of the rental. When you purchase the equivalent of collision “insurance” from the rental car company, it’s actually a Collision Damage Waiver, or CDW.The CDW isn’t actually insurance. Instead, the car rental company is waiving its right to collect the full amount of damage from you in the event of a collision. There may still be a big deductible ($1000 or more) that isn’t covered by the waiver. The basic CDW will cost you about 30% extra.<Re> https://www.ricksteves.com/travel-tips/transportation/car-rental-cdw</ref>
In order to have no deductible or a very small deductible, you’ll have to purchase an additional waiver, called super-CDW or zero-deductible CDW. The additional waiver can cost another $10-$30 per day.
In order to have comprehensive protection from theft and other occurrences, you’ll need to purchase additional coverage specifically for loss and theft.

, Make sure you let the rental company know what countries you’ll be visiting. Different countries have different risk levels, and what may be a covered occurrence in one country may not be a covered occurrence in another country.Italy and Ireland are two countries with peculiar rules with respect to insurers. If you’re travelling to either country, make sure your rental car company knows ahead of time., The insurance you purchased may only apply to the people the car company knows will be driving. If they can prove someone else was driving the car when a covered occurrence happened, they may hold you liable for the totality of the damage.You may have to pay $8-$15 extra for each covered driver.

, You’ll most likely save money by purchasing the insurance when you make the reservation rather than when you’re at the counter.Not only is the price higher at the counter, it’s easier for the agents to talk you into coverage you don’t need. You’re probably tired, there may be a language barrier, bargaining customs may be more high-pressure, and the terminology may be different.

Talk to your credit card company.,
Don’t rent a car that’s worth more than your coverage limits.,
Request a letter of coverage from your credit card company.,
Bring along more than one credit card.,
Seek reimbursement from the card company.",How to Get Car Insurance While Traveling Abroad2," Many credit cards will provide collision and theft/loss insurance in foreign countries—with no deductible—free of charge. As long as you use that card to rent the car, you’ll be covered. Just call your card company to get a detailed description of the coverage they provide.Make sure you find out where the coverage applies (Italy and Ireland usually aren’t covered), what parts of the car are covered, the coverage limits, and how long the coverage lasts., If you rent a car that’s worth more than your coverage limits, you might be in for a rude awakening at the rental counter. That’s because the rental company will require you to purchase one of their CDWs to make up the loss.


On top of everything, buying a CDW from a rental company might invalidate the coverage from your card company altogether. That means you’ll need to purchase even more coverage (CDW and super-CDW and loss/theft) to get the same protection you would have had through your credit card.Just ask the rental company for the insured value of each car you’re considering before you reserve it.

, A letter of coverage is a statement explaining the limits and nuances of the coverage you get from your card company. Although you should be covered with or without the letter, the letter of coverage will prove it to your rental company.Your card company will typically cover any drivers listed on the rental agreement, but they have to be listed. Any increase in price from the rental company for extra drivers is probably worth the savings from not buying the insurance. Make sure the letter of coverage mentions this specifically, as a rental company could use its omission as a pretext to make you purchase coverage from them.

, If you use the insurance provided by your credit card company, the rental company may very well put a hold on your card for the value of the deductible, the value of the card, or up to your credit limit if that is lower. That means you might be maxed out on the card you use for the rental—hence the backup card for other purchases.Some rental companies will decline to rent you a car if your credit limit is lower than the value of the car. If you get in this situation, look at cheaper cars or different rental companies before you use the rental car company’s coverage.

, If you do get into an accident, the rental company will charge your card for the full value of the damage—which is likely to be liberally estimated. You will then have to get reimbursement from the card company.Make sure you get a copy of the police report from the local police and the rental company’s report of the accident. You’ll need them in order to document your claim.

Add rental coverage onto a travel insurance plan.,
Gather the necessary information.,
Compare prices among insurers.",How to Get Car Insurance While Traveling Abroad3," Getting rental coverage through your travel insurer can be a great option between getting insurance through your rental company and getting insurance through your card. But the rental insurance is an add on, so you’ll need to purchase it along with a travel insurance plan.There could be several reasons for not wanting to use your card company. Maybe your credit limit isn’t high enough, you don’t have another credit card, or you simply don’t want to deal with the hassle of getting reimbursed. Purchasing rental insurance through your travel insurer can be cheaper than going with the rental company, and easier than using a card company.
Just remember to bring along a copy of your policy to the car rental agency.

, As you might expect, you’ll need to gather information about your trip, your companions, and your rental car. You will need:The dates of travel (including travel while abroad). So if you travel to Europe and tour several countries, the insurer would need to know when you would be moving between each country.
The destinations, including additional destinations while abroad. For example, if you were going on a road trip through Central America, which countries you planned on visiting.
All of the names and dates of birth for anyone in your travel group.
The total trip cost.
The type of car you’ll be driving, how long you’ll be driving it, who will be driving it, and license information for all drivers.

, Most travel insurance plans will offer coverage to reimburse for a cancelled or interrupted trip, return airfare, medical expenses, and lost baggage. The coverage limits will vary according to the insurer and what you’re willing to pay for.There are a number of good travel insurers, including Travel Guard, Allianz Global Assistance, and Travelex. Many are affiliated with large general insurance companies. Make sure that you compare several brands."

Assemble your materials.,
Make ice.,
Assemble a cooling tank.,
Create a condensing coil.,
Connect 3 feet of silicone tubing to your heat source.,
Attach the other end of your silicone tubing to the top of the condenser coil.,
Create a spout for your condenser coil.,
Boil your water to distill it.,
Sanitize water containers for long-term storage.",How to Make a Water Still1," Some of these materials will likely already be in your home. Other materials might need to be purchased at a hardware store or a home-brewing supply company. Do not try to buy cheap alternatives to these products: if you want your distilled water to be safe, you will have to use food-safe, heat-resistant materials. Your supplies should include:


20ft (6 m) of 3/4 copper coil
6 feet of heat-proof silicone tubing
A two-gallon bucket
Tea kettle or pressure cooker
Ice
Sealer
A large water bottle to collect the distilled water;
, Fill your ice cube trays or some water bottles with water and then place them in your freezer. You will want to have a lot of ice on hand during the distillation process. Keep in mind that distilling water involves boiling the water into steam and then quickly cooling it down into purified water droplets. If you plan to distill a lot of water, you will require many, many trays worth of ice., Your water still will require a cool environment where the steam can re-condense into pure water droplets. The heated water will travel through waterproof, heat-proof copper tubing that is coiled inside your cooling tank, allowing the steam to cool into purified water inside the tubes. Your cooling tank can be very simple: a two-gallon plastic bucket will do. Alternatively, you could use a large milk jug that has been cut in half and filled with ice.


If you are using a two-gallon bucket, be sure that there is a 3/4-inch hole at the top of the bucket and the bottom of the bucket. The copper tubing will need to be fed through both holes in order to collect the steam (at the top) and emit the water (at the bottom)., Your water still will involve collecting the water from your heat source (the tea kettle or pressure cooker), sending it through coiled tubing inside the cooling tank to let the water condense, and then finally into your storage container for the distilled water. The most efficient way to cool the water will be to have it travel through a coiled tube that is immersed in ice water or that surrounds a very cold object (like a frozen milk jug). Coil the copper tubing about 7 or 8 times. You will have a spiral once coiled.


Simply place your coiled copper tubing inside the bucket or jug, leaving a 1-inch gap in between the tubing and the sides of the bucket.Remember to feed the top and bottom of the copper coil through the holes you've drilled in the bucket. If the tube seems too loose, you can use epoxy or sealant to ensure that the tubing fits snugly in the holes., Heatproof silicone tubing can be used to connect the source of your heated water (either your pressure cooker or tea kettle) to the top of your condenser coil. Cut the 6-ft. tubing in half to leave you with two 3-ft. tubes. If you are using a tea kettle, simply affix one end of the tubing to the spout of the kettle. If you are using a pressure cooker, affix one end of the tubing to the open pressure valve on the lid of the pressure cooker.If the pressure valve on the pressure cooker is too small, you can use a brass fitting of the same diameter as the tube to allow the silicone tubing to fit tightly.If the spout on your tea kettle is too large, simply drill a hole in a rubber stopper that is the same diameter as your tubing. Place this stopper in the kettle spout and insert your tubing.







, At this point, you can connect the water source to your condenser tubing with the silicone tubing. Take the other end of the tube that you've connected to your water heater, and fit it over the copper tubing at the top of your condenser coil. Be sure you have a tight fit.

, At this point, you should have a hot water source that is well connected to a condenser coil that is affixed to a cooling system. However, you will still need a way to collect the purified water that forms inside your condensing coils. Use the other 3-ft. piece of silicone tubing to create a spout. The bottom of your condensing coil should at this point be sticking out of the bottom of your cooling tank. Attach silicone tubing to this outlet, and then place the other end over a clean water bottle. This will complete your water distillation system.

, Fill your kettle or pressure cooker with water and place it on your stove. Turn the stove up high and wait for the water to boil. The steam will travel through your silicone tubing, into the copper tubing, and through the cooling system. There, the steam will turn into water droplets through the process of condensation, and finally travel out through your water spout and into your purified water container. All impurities such as salt, minerals, or dirt will be left behind, leaving you with pure, clean water in the final collecting bottle.

, If you plan to store your distilled water for long periods of time, be sure that your storage container has been thoroughly sanitized. Dilute one teaspoon of bleach in one gallon of water. Use this solution to thoroughly coat the inside of your storage container. After about 30 seconds, pour out the bleach solution. Let your container air-dry or rinse it with clean water."

Assemble the water tube.,
Add the glass roof.,
Place glass pans filled with water inside the still.,
Sanitize water containers for long-term storage.",How to Make a Water Still2," Most of the materials you require for a solar water still can be acquired at a hardware store or home-brewing supply store. A solar water still will require more handiwork and assembly than a stove-top water still, but a solar water still can come in handy in emergency situations where you do not have working electricity or gas.Your materials should include:Plywood (4 feet by 8 feet)
One sheet of high-finish, tempered glass (27.25 x 22 inches)
Wood glue
High-temperature black paint
Screws
Drill with drill bits
Caulk
PEX tubing (2 feet)
Rigid insulation
Two long, flat glass baking pans

, The base of your solar water still will be a wooden box made out of plywood. The top of the box should have a slight incline so that the glass top will be at an optimal angle. Your box will be made of five different plywood pieces:


A bottom base that measures 23.25 x 19 inches
A short end piece that measures 5.75 x 20.5 inches
A long end piece that measures 9 x 20.5 inches
Two trapezoidal side pieces that measure 9 1/8 inches tall (at the long end), 5 1/8 inches tall (at the short end), and 26.75 inches wide
Note that a circular saw set to a 9 degree angle can help you cut the trapezoidal pieces correctly, Cut a piece of rigid insulation using the same measurements as the bottom base of your plywood box. Screw the insulation to the plywood base., Using screws and wood glue, assemble all of the pieces of the wooden box together, except for the long end piece. The long end piece will be your hinged door and must be attached using separate door hinges. Make sure that the door faces the short end and that the two trapezoidal pieces face each other. Use caulk or weather seal to make sure all of the edges are airtight., High-temperature black paint will help the water inside the still heat up in the sun, allowing it to evaporate more efficiently. Coat the inside of the box thoroughly. Allow the painted box to dry for 3-5 days to ensure that all fumes and toxins are aired out before you finish assembling the still., Your PEX tubing will be used to collect the water droplets that form inside the solar still and pour them into a separate, clean container. To insert the piping into the box, drill a hole the same diameter of your tubing 1/2 inch down from the top of the box at the short side of the trapezoid. Only make a hole in one of the trapezoidal pieces: not both., In order to collect water effectively, your water tube must be open inside of the box (to collect water drippings) but closed outside of the box (to keep the water clean). Mark 19 inches on your PEX tubing, and slice it in half. This should leave you with a piece of tubing that is open for 19 inches and closed for 5 inches. Screw the open piping inside the short side of the box using three screws, making sure that a few inches of the closed tubing are able to stick out through the pre-drilled hole.Use a 1/4-inch incline to make sure the water flows out of the box properly.Use caulk or sealant to make sure that the piping fits snugly in the hole you drilled and that the open tubing is securely fastened to the plywood., The glass plate will fit at a slight incline into the top of your water still, allowing water droplets to form inside and then flow down the incline and into your PEX water tubing. From there, the purified droplets will leave the still through the closed piping and into a separate container. After making sure your glass plate has been thoroughly cleaned, caulk the outer edges of the glass thoroughly. Then gently lay it on top of your assembled box. If you have measured correctly, the glass roof should be at a 5-10 degree angle, which is ideal for water collection.You can use a temporary stop or painters tape to secure the caulked glass roof until it has dried thoroughly., One of the sides of your still has been attached with hinges, which will allow you to open and close the door at will. Fill two flat, glass baking pans with water (1-2 inches or so), and insert them into your assembled still. This will serve as the water source that will be purified by the sun.

, If you plan to store your distilled water for long periods of time, be sure that your storage container has been thoroughly sanitized. Dilute one teaspoon of bleach in one gallon of water. Use this solution to thoroughly coat the inside of your storage container. After about 30 seconds, pour out the bleach solution. Let your container air-dry or rinse it with clean water."

Other options include a papier mâché balloon, play dough, or even two cakes with blue and green food coloring added.;
, Draw an outline of the continents onto your ball. The easiest way to do this is to find a map of the globe online and print it out. Cut out the continents and tape them onto your globe. Draw the outlines with a pen, then take off the continents.


You might need to change the size of the printing until it looks right.

, Paint the continents with green or brown paint, except for Antarctica: Antarctica is covered with ice and snow year-round, so paint it white to distinguish it from the other continents. Paint everywhere else with blue paint to show the water. Spray paint works best on Styrofoam, but you can use any kind of paint, or even colored markers.


Work over a spread-out newspaper to protect your table or floor from dripping paint.
Paint one half, let it dry, then turn it over to paint the other half.

, Make 3D mountains out of play dough or clay, then stick them onto the model. Look at a map to figure out where the mountain ranges are. Don't make them too big, or they might fall off of your model.


You can use aluminum foil instead.

, Spice up your model with some fun toys, like miniature people, animals, or cars. Glue them onto the land using a hot glue gun.


Kids should ask an adult for help before using the glue gun.

, Clouds will make your model extra special. Stick cotton balls onto the ends of toothpicks, and fluff them up a little to make them look like clouds. Stick the other end of the toothpick into the foam so the clouds are above the surface.


Paint the toothpicks blue, green, or grey to make them blend in a little better.

, Glue the globe onto a stand or box so it doesn't roll away. If you want to hang the globe, ask an adult to help you cut a hole in the top and hang it from twine.

, Take the half of the ball you're not using. Cut out a section from the middle, in a semicircular shape. Glue this to the center of the half-Earth, so there's a bump coming out of it. This is the inner core, a solid ball formed from the pressure of the layers around it. Color this red with paint or markers.

, Draw a large circle around the inner core, on the flat half of the globe. This should take up about ⅓ to ½ the space on that surface. Color it orange and call it the outer core.

, Color the rest of the flat surface yellow, leaving only a tiny sliver of uncolored land at the edge. Label this the mantle.


The mantle is actually made up the upper mantle (solid rock) and the lower mantle (liquid rock). Divide it into two different shades of orange if you like.

, The crust is the surface layer of the Earth, and it is very thin compared to the other layers. Color this brown or black. On your model, it will look like a thin line around the entire cut surface.

, Find a golf ball or a crumpled up piece of paper, about ¼ the size of your Earth model. Glue it on the board, close to the Earth.

, Crumple up another piece of paper for each of the planets. Glue them onto the board in this order:


Mercury — small, grey
Venus — yellow, about Earth sized
Earth (your model)
Mars — red, about Earth sized
Jupiter — orange and white, the biggest planet
Saturn — yellow, almost as big as Jupiter, with rings around it
Uranus — light blue, bigger than Earth but smaller than Saturn
Neptune — light blue, about the size of Uranus
Pluto — a tiny grey dot

, Closest to Mercury, the sun is an enormous yellow-orange ball. The sun is much too big for you to show its size accurately. You can either make the biggest ball you can fit, or just color a corner of the board yellow to indicate that the sun expands far beyond the edges.

Make sure all of the wires are connected properly.,
Check the filament in your light bulb.,
Test the charge of the battery.",How to Make a Simple Electrical Circuit," To build a simple circuit, you will need a power source, two insulated wires, a light bulb, and a light bulb holder. A power source can be any type of battery or battery pack. The rest of the materials can be found at your local hardware store.


When choosing a light bulb, keep in mind the amount of power your battery emits.
To simplify the wire attachment process, use a battery snap with wires pre-attached and a nine volt battery or battery pack.;
, In order for your circuit to work properly, the wires need to be totally exposed so you must strip the ends. Using wire strippers, remove about an inch of the insulation from the ends of each wire.


If you don’t have wire strippers, you can carefully use scissors to cut off the insulation.
Be careful not to cut all the way through the wire.

, Depending on the type of batteries you are using, you may be able to skip this step. If you are using multiple batteries, you will need a power pack to hold the batteries. Push each battery in by the side taking care to put the positive and negative ends in the correct orientation.

, The wires will be conducting your electric current from the batteries to the light bulb. The easiest way to attach the wires is to use electrical tape. Attach the end of one wire to one side of the battery, making sure that the wire maintains contact with the metal of the battery. Repeat with the other wire on the other side of the battery.


Alternatively, if you are using a battery snap, snap the end onto the end of a nine volt battery or the battery pack.
Use caution while building your circuit. Although unlikely, it is possible to get a very small shock if you touch the wire directly while attached to the battery. You can avoid this by only touching the insulated part of the wire or removing the batteries until you install the light bulb.

, Take the exposed metal end of each wire and bend it into a U-shape.Loosen each screw on the light bulb holder just enough to slip the U-shape of the wire around the screw. Each wire will be attached to its own screw. Tighten the screw, ensuring that the metal of the wires remain in contact with the screw.

, Screw the light bulb into its holder until it is tight. If your circuit is hooked up properly, the bulb should light up when fully screwed into its socket.


Light bulbs can heat up quickly so be careful when installing and removing the bulb.
If the bulb doesn’t light, check to make sure the wires are touching the ends of the battery and in contact with the metal of the screws.

, To install the switch, you will need three pieces of wire instead of two. Once you strip the wires and get them attached to the battery pack you can proceed to installing the switch.

, Take the exposed metal end of one of the wires from the battery pack and bend it into a U-shape.Loosen the screw on the switch and slip the U-shape of the wire underneath. Tighten the screw making sure that the metal of the wire remains in contact with the screw.

, Bend each of the metal ends of the wire into a U-shape. Slip the U-shape under the second screw of the switch to attach it. Tighten the screw ensuring the metal of the screw stays in contact with the metal of the wire.

, Take the end of each wire (one from the battery and one from the switch) and bend it into a U-shape. Loosen each screw on the light bulb holder just enough to slip the U-shape of the wire around the screw. Each wire will be attached to its own screw. Tighten the screw, ensuring that the wires remain in contact with the metal screw.

, Screw the light bulb into its holder until it is tight. Flip the switch! If your circuit is hooked up properly, the bulb should light up when fully screwed into its socket.


Light bulbs can heat up quickly so be careful when installing and removing the bulb.
If the bulb doesn’t light, check to make sure the wires are touching the ends of the battery and in contact with the metal of the screws.

, In order to complete the circuit, all wires must be touching the metal parts of each component. If your bulb doesn’t light up, check each side of the battery and the screws on the bulb holder to make sure the wires are in contact with metal.Make sure screws are tightened down to maintain contact.
In some cases, you may need to strip more of the insulation off the wire.

, Your bulb will not light if the filament is broken. Hold the bulb up to the light and ensure the filament is one connected piece. Try replacing the bulb with a new one. If the bulb isn’t the problem, proceed to the next troubleshooting step.

, If the battery is dead or low on charge, it might not have enough power to light the bulb. Using a battery tester, check the charge or just replace the battery with a new one. If this was the problem, your bulb should light immediately after replacing the battery."

Trip cancellation: protects you if you need to cancel before you leave. You can be reimbursed for your pre-paid, non-refundable expenses.Trip interruption: protects you if you need to end your trip and go back home early.Travel delay: covers your expenses for meals and lodging when your departure or return is delayed.;
, Many companies offer annual travel insurance. You can find them online by searching for “annual travel insurance carriers.” Some of the larger carriers of travel insurance include the following:Allianz
HTH Worldwide
IMG
Roam Right
Seven Corners
Travel Guard
Travelex

, You can usually get a quote online or by calling the insurer. You will be asked for personal information, such as the following:your age
number of trips planned for the year
country where you reside
country where you are a citizen
number of travelers covered

, Some websites, such as Squaremouth, will obtain quotes from many different insurers.This makes comparing policies easy.


The aggregator will show the annual premium for the policy.
There is also a link for policy details, which you should read.
You can also read reviews at the Squaremouth website.

, Your trip might be cancelled for a variety of reasons. However, your insurance won’t kick in unless your trip is interrupted for a “covered” reason. You should compare policies based on the events they cover.


Generally, a trip cancellation policy will reimburse you for cancellations caused by injury, illness, terrorism, airline bankruptcy, loss of passport, and other reasons.Also check whether the insurer offers a “cancel for any reason” rider. This will cost more money, but it allows you to cancel your trip for any reason (including changing your mind about traveling)., Insurers also vary in how much they will reimburse you. Some might provide a maximum of $1,000 per trip.If your trip cost more than this, you won’t be compensated for the remainder.


The reimbursement rate differs considerably depending on the insurer, so read the policy closely.
Generally, the more an insurer reimburses, the higher your premium will be, so there is a trade-off.

, Some policies will include baggage delay coverage. This policy will provide you with an amount of money to buy personal items until your baggage arrives. Generally, you get $100-500.The policy might also include baggage loss insurance, which will reimburse you for lost, stolen, or damaged bags.

, Most policies should include comprehensive medical coverage, which covers emergency medical and dental, as well as emergency medical transportation.This is great if you get injured somewhere outside your home country and need to be treated or evacuated.


Alternately, other insurers might offer medical coverage as an add-on, which will increase the cost of the policy.

, Annual travel insurance often includes other benefits. Look at each policy and see if it contains the following:Flight accident insurance. This works as a term life benefit to your heirs if you die in a flight accident.
Return of minor children coverage. Should you be injured in a foreign country, your children will be returned home with a chaperone.
Bedside visit benefit. This benefit will pay for the transportation costs of one person to visit you if you are hospitalized a certain number of days.

, Compare the costs of each annual travel insurance policy, but also keep an eye on reimbursement rates and the comprehensiveness of the coverage. Choose a policy that provides you the protection that you need.


For example, you might be willing to pay a little bit more for a policy that provides greater reimbursement for cancellation and delays.
Alternately, you might make a choice strictly on price if there’s only one plan you can afford.

, Don’t leave home without a copy of your policy. You’ll need to call your insurer as soon as you think your trip might be interrupted, delayed, or cancelled. The insurance carrier should have a 24-hour emergency assistance line.To make things easy, you can create a digital scan of your policy and store it on your laptop or smart phone. Leave the paper copy at home.

, You’ll need to fully support any claim you make. For example, if you cancelled your flight because of illness, you’ll need a doctor to fill out a form or sign a letter explaining your illness.If your passport is stolen, you should have a copy of the police report.
When your baggage is stolen or lost, you’ll need to file a form with your airline first. Hold onto your copy of the form so that you can show your insurer.

, Your insurer will probably send you a claim form to fill out.Provide all requested information and double check for accuracy. Remember to make a copy of the form for your records before mailing it back.


There might also be a claim form you can download from the insurance carrier’s website. Check there.
If you download a form, you should still call your insurer and explain the problem you are having.

, Travel insurers strive to provide the best service possible. However, if they fall short of your expectations, you should lodge appropriate complaints. Consider the following methods of complaining:


If your insurance carrier denies a claim, ask how you can appeal their decision.
You might also take to social media to complain. You can leave reviews on Yelp and other websites. Remember to stick to the facts and don’t exaggerate.
You can also file a complaint with your state’s Department of Insurance. You can find your state’s department by visiting the National Association of Insurance Commissioners website and clicking on your state: https://eapps.naic.org/cis/fileComplaintMap.do.

Research potential experiments.",How to Make a Liquid Nitrogen Substitute," Wear long pants, a long-sleeve shirt, and sturdy work gloves. You should also wear protective goggles and consider tying back your hair if it's long. While this may seem excessive, cryogenic-temperature alcohol is highly flammable, can cause dizziness and irritate your skin.Your workspace should be free from food and drink. It should also be well ventilated and away from hot surfaces or open flame.;
, You'll need a 2 gallon (7.6 L) soda bottle, a smaller plastic bottle (such as a smaller soda bottle) that can fit inside the larger soda bottle, scissors, 99% isopropyl alcohol, and pellets of dry ice.


Both bottles should be empty, clean, and dry. If you remove the labels, you'll be able to watch the creation of cryogenic-temperature alcohol.

, Use a pair of sharp scissors to cut approximately 3 inches (7.62 centimeters) off the top of both bottles. Recycle or discard the tops.


Make sure the smaller bottle can easily fit in the larger bottle.

, First, you'll want to use scissors to poke holes around the bottom and lower sides of the small bottle. Then, set it inside the larger one.

, Evenly distribute them along the inside of the 2 gallon (7.6 L) bottle while you hold the smaller empty bottle in the center. This will keep it level.If you don't have pellets, you can chip your own dry ice. Just be careful using a knife and chip the dry ice into 1/2"" chunks.
Always wear gloves when handling dry ice, as it can cause injure bare skin.

, Slowly pour the alcohol directly over the dry ice pellets. You may want to gradually turn the bottle as you pour, since the dry ice will start fogging, making it difficult to see.


If you use a lower percentage isopropyl alcohol, it will freeze in a thick gel.Remember to avoid touching the cryogenic-temperature alcohol, which will stick to your hands.

, Once the dry ice has stopped fogging, you should be able to see that your smaller bottle now has several inches of the clear cryogenic-temperature alcohol in it. You can now begin using it in experiments.


Your liquid is now at its lowest temperature. Use extreme care when handling.

, It can be kept at room temperature for future use for up to 30 days. Then, discard the isopropyl alcohol according to local regulations.


Do not inhale, touch with bare skin, or consume the cryogenic-temperature alcohol. If it gets in your eyes or on your skin, rinse repeatedly with water. If inhaled, move to fresh air and rest. Call a poison control center if you feel unwell., This is a simple experiment. Use tongs to dip items into the cryogenic-temperature alcohol until they become hard. Remove the items and shatter them, if you like.


Flowers, leaves, fruits, vegetables, and small rubber balls are just a few of the things you can freeze and shatter using cryogenic-temperature alcohol. Do not eat them and remember to wear gloves when handling.

, Use a small balloon that you can nearly fit into your container of cryogenic-temperature alcohol. While wearing gloves, dip most of the balloon into the liquid. The balloon will start to shrink and you should notice liquid inside the balloon.To return the ""liquid air"" inside the balloon back into a gas, simply place your balloon in a warm area and wait for the particles to move faster and expand.

, Roll modeling clay into a ball and dip it into the cryogenic-temperature alcohol. Drop it on the floor or another hard surface and watch it shatter., If you've found an experiment that uses liquid nitrogen, consider whether or not it will work with cryogenic-temperature alcohol. While the liquid nitrogen creates nitrogen gas, the cryogenic-temperature alcohol does not. Choose experiments that simply use the liquid nitrogen for its temperature-lowering aspect.


Never eat any experiments that you've done with food and cryogenic-temperature alcohol.

Determine what kind of policy you’ll need.,
Assess your risk.,
Double-check your current insurance policies.,
Consult an agent.,
Check if the insurance company is reputable.",How to Choose Travel Insurance1," Different types of insurance are available based on where you are going and how much coverage you want. In general, the policies can be divided into certain types.



Travel insurance will cover lost luggage, missed or cancelled flights, or even basic medical care.

Travel medical insurance will provide the cost of medical care in foreign countries.

Medical evacuation services will assist you if emergency evacuation or travel is needed. These services may pay for the cost of an ambulance or help escort you back home in case of illness or injury.Multi-trip policies will cover numerous journeys in a year, reducing the number of policies you have to buy.Accidental death policies will insure your life for death or dismemberment. There are three types: air flight (death or dismemberment on an airplane), common carrier (death or dismemberment on a taxi, bus, ferry, or other type of public transportation), and general accidental death (all situations of death or dismemberment).;
, Knowing what you are at risk for will help you determine what kind of coverage is worth paying for and what kinds you can skip. Research your destination, either by checking their local tourism agencies or your own governmental advisory boards. There are various types of coverage that may be included or added to your policy:


Baggage loss and delay
Missed, delayed, or cancelled flights
Terrorism
Life insurance
Rental car insurance
Hurricane and weather, If you already have homeowners, auto, life, or health insurance, you may already be covered for travel-related expenses. Check your current policies or call your agent. They can help clarify what is and is not currently covered for you when traveling.When you call your insurance company, you can ask them if they provide travel insurance or if they would be willing to add a travel rider to your current insurance policy. This may be a cheaper option than finding a new company, and it will be with a company you already trust.

, A number of institutions sell travel insurance, including banks, tour operators, insurance companies, and specific travel insurance websites.You can easily find a wide range of insurance companies by searching for “travel insurance,” but you may find the policies to be vague or too complicated to understand. The best way to know your needs for travel is to call the company itself to speak to an agent. An agent can walk through the company's various policies and help you assess which kind of policy you need.


Even if you consult an agent, be sure to read the policy thoroughly yourself before signing. If you have any further questions, you can ask the agent for clarification.

, There are a number of internationally recognized insurers who have a network of affiliates that could offer you assistance inside and outside the country you’re visiting. Buy from a licensed agent/website that is authorized to sell the policy. Check their license number or licensed ID if necessary."

Contact your health insurance provider.,
Evaluate your health.,
Consider how long you will be gone.,
Take your planned activities into account.",How to Determine if You Need Travel Insurance1," If you are traveling overseas, you should contact your health insurance provider about your policy. Medicare and many major carriers will not cover medical expenses outside of the United States. Because of this, you should try to figure out if your plan has you covered. If you are traveling domestically, you will be covered by your current health insurance policy.Determine what your insurance company covers. Ask questions like “How much of my medical expenses do you cover?” and “What things will be covered during my trip?”
Be sure to ask about medical evacuations. If you are traveling somewhere that has a poor health care system or if you are engaging in dangerous activities, you should make sure you have medical evacuation coverage.;
, When you are thinking about getting medical insurance for your trip, consider your general health. Are you someone who gets ill easily or often? Do you have a chronic medical condition? If you answered yes to either of those questions, you should have some form of medical coverage.If you have a preexisting condition, plan to do a lot of traveling, or have not had a physical in a long time, you should visit your doctor for a basic physical before you leave.
If you are traveling to a place where there is an increased risk of getting ill, you should get medical coverage.

, The longer you are away, the more likely you are to have some kind of medical problem. Travel, jet lag, and exposure to new food can all impact your immune system and digestive health. If you will be gone for an extended period, you should get some form of medical coverage while you are overseas.Before you leave, find medical facilities in the location that you are planning to travel to that are in your medical network and carry that information with you. This may save you a lot of money if you are in an accident and need emergency attention.

, If you are planning to take an overseas trip where there is the potential for a medical emergency, you should probably get travelers health insurance. Travel medical insurance is a good idea if you will be engaging in any remotely dangerous activities like snorkeling, riding motorcycles, parasailing, or rock climbing. If you are going to engage in an activity where you might get hurt, be sure to get traveler’s health insurance.This is particularly important if you are going somewhere remote or that has poor healthcare facilities.
If you are doing anything remotely dangerous, you should buy a policy that covers emergency evacuations. If you get seriously injured and do not have medical evacuation coverage, you may be out $40,000 to $50,000 dollars.

Determine if travel insurance is right for you buy asking yourself specific questions.,
Look into the financial stability of the travel insurance company.,
Learn the types of travel insurance that are available to you.",How to Buy International Travel Insurance1,"


What are the chances that you need the travel insurance? The destination of your trip may be a big factor as some places may put you at more risk than others.
Think about the things that you will be participating in on your vacation abroad. Will you be doing physical activities that you are not normally used to and may put you at risk? Are you traveling where illnesses in travelers are common or where insects abound that may cause illness?

, Determine if it will be around awhile and can follow through on any promises made to you, especially if the vacation was bought and paid for before traveling.

, Most people are familiar with the flight and trip cancellation insurance. However, there are many other types of insurance that may provide more protection during your trip.


Medical evacuation and repatriation insurance is for international travel and allows you to be treated, stabilized, and then flown home as quickly as possible. Even though you may have health insurance in your own country, as soon as you leave the border this may not be so. Health insurance for international travel may also protect you if you become ill in a developing country and are treated there. Just like any other insurance, be sure to read the fine print to know exactly what you have to do in the event of an emergency.
Golf/adventure/extreme sports insurance may be bought at a price and may have limitations. The golf insurance can help if you travel for golf tournaments around the world and can protect your equipment and give golf fee refunds.
Insurance with ""force majeure"" clauses can cover a trip if the U.S. State Department issues a travel warning that covers your travel area. Limitations on coverage may be affected by how close an attack is to your destination, when the insurance was purchased, and what losses may be covered by situations caused by war or the threat of war.
Non-refundable ticket insurance covers you in the event that you will need to change your travel plans and have already purchased a non-refundable airline ticket.
Trip cancellation and interruption insurance is used in the event you miss your trip due to an illness or other reasons. This insurance is especially important if you have made a significant investment into the trip, such as a $10,000 once-in-a-lifetime vacation.
Baggage insurance is used when you're traveling oversees and can insure your luggage. The Warsaw Convention has set a limit of a liability of $9.07 per pound. This may often come as coverage on trip cancellation and interruption insurance.

Prepare the area for casting.,
Mix the Plaster of Paris.,
Pour the Plaster of Paris into the impression.,
Pour the casting material from one end or side of the impression and allow it to flow along the impression.,
Lift the cast out.,
Clean the cast.,
Allow it to dry overnight once the cast has been cleaned.,
Store and transport the cast.","How to Make a Plaster Cast of a Footwear Mark, Tyre Impression or Animal Footprint"," Carefully brush away any small stones or loose soil from around the edge of the area to be cast. You won't want any rocks getting into the impression once you start pouring the Plaster of Paris casting material.

If the footwear mark is a loose material, spraying the footwear mark with hairspray will hold the particles of the soil or powder together, so that the casting material does not distort it.
If the track or mark contains water, it can be carefully removed by using paper towels. Dip them into the impression and allow the water to be soaked up by the paper, taking care not to disturb the mark. There is no need to remove all the water; the Plaster of Paris will sink into the bottom of the impression and displace any water.
To stop the Plaster of Paris from spreading out and overflowing, use stones or pieces of cardboard to make a barrier around the area. This is particularly important when the impression to be cast is on a shallow or sloping ground.;
, Pour two parts plaster mix to one part water into a plastic bag. The mixture can then be kneaded through the bag to remove any air bubbles and ensure a proper mix. Add more water (if required) to get a smooth, even consistency., Once the Plaster of Paris is mixed, cut or pierce the bag in one corner. This allows the plaster of Paris to be poured out easily., Try to avoid pouring it directly into the middle of the impression. This can distort the detail or wash away the mark.

Once the impression is full, tapping the surface of the casting material (while it is still a liquid) with a stick (or a pen/ruler) will make any air bubbles within the casting material rise to the top, preventing air bubbles in the final cast.
Small pieces of string or sticks can be pushed into the surface of the casting material to reinforce it, so it is less likely to break into pieces when handled after lifting.
A paper exhibit label tied to a piece of string can be attached by pressing the string into the casting material before it sets.

, Allow to fully dry before lifting. Do not attempt to remove the cast from the ground until it is completely dry and hard or it may crumble or lose detail.

Use a spade or trowel to lift the cast from the ground. Dig into the ground a few inches away from the cast, using the soil as a cushion between the cast and space during removal. Avoid hitting the cast with the spade to prevent breakages.

, Allow the removed cast to dry overnight before attempting to remove any soil adhering to the bottom of the cast. Large, loose pieces of soil can be picked off straight away, but leave a thin layer on the cast until it has hardened sufficiently. This will protect the cast during transportation.

Carefully remove the soil, or you may damage the fine detail in the cast; a toothbrush or paintbrush used lightly will work best.
Once the majority of soil has been removed, put the cast under a running tap and, using the paint brush, gently brush the cast to remove any remaining soil.

, Then, spray with hairspray (or lacquer) to strengthen the cast and prevent it crumbling during handling., Wrap the cast in a newspaper or some bubble wrap to prevent it being damaged. You may also place the cast in a shoe/pizza box to stop it being bumped around and damaged."

Bead the pipe cleaners for the double helix.,
Bead your nitrogenous bases.,
Attach your beaded pipe cleaners together.,
Twist the double helix.",How to Make a Model of DNA Using Common Materials1," You will need at least four 12-inch pipe cleaners, and assorted beads in at least six colors.


Plastic pony beads work best for this project, although you can use any kind of beads that have a hole wide enough to fit over the pipe cleaners.
Each of the two pairs of pipe cleaners should be a different, color, giving you four total pipe cleaners preferably black and orange, they could be the phosphate and deoxyribose;
, Take two pipe cleaners of the same color, and cut them into strips that are 3” wide. You will use these to string your C--G and T--A pairs of beads on. Leave the other two pipe cleaners at their full length.

, Use two different colors of beads to represent the sugar and phosphate groups, and bead them in alternating colors down each of the pipe cleaners.


Be sure that the two long strands that form the double helix match up, so that the beads are in the same order.
Leave about a half inch of space between each bead to allow room to attach the other pieces of pipe cleaner.

, Take the other four colors of beads, and pair them together. The same two colors must always go together, to represent the pairs of cytosine and guanine, and thymine and adenine.


Place one bead from each pair at the ends of the 2” sections of pipe cleaners. Leave a little room at the ends to wrap around the double helix strands.
It doesn’t matter what order the beads are placed on the pipe cleaners, as long as they are in the correct pairs.

, Take the now beaded 2” sections of pipe cleaner and wrap the ends around the long double helix strands.


Space each small piece so they are always attached above a bead on the side of the same color. You should be skipping every-other bead on the double helix strands.
The order of small pieces does not matter, it is up to you what way you would like to organize them on the double helix strands.

, Once all of the small sections of beads have been attached, twist the ends of the double helix in a counter-clockwise direction to give the appearance of a true strand of DNA. Enjoy, your model is complete!

Make sure that the policy includes the country you are planning to visit.,
Ensure that the policy covers your medical condition.,
Read the refund policies.,
Consider cancellation waivers.",How to Choose Travel Insurance2," Some countries require different types of policies than others, and not all policies cover all countries. Countries with medical or political travel advisories may be more difficult to find travel insurance for.

, Pre-existing conditions may not be covered by the policy, or the company may require you to apply for a special waiver. If you have a medical condition that may interfere with your travel plans, double-check that the policy covers your condition., Make sure that you understand the policies for refunds and reimbursements. Research how long it typically takes the company to process a claim. Some policies will refund your money if you cancel months in advance. There are only a few insurance companies who will refund you if you cancel at the last minute. Some may refund you if your trip is canceled because of terrorism or weather. Most will not refund you if your conference was canceled or if you moved the date of your trip., If there is a chance you might cancel your trip, it might be worth investing in cancellation insurance. Cruise and tour operators may offer cancellation waivers. This means for a fee, they will reimburse you a portion of your cost if you cancel for any reason up to 24 hours prior to departure. Furthermore, if you are traveling to a country with a high risk of terrorism, a “cancel for any reason” clause can help recuperate your loss if it is not safe for you to travel."

Shop around.,
Make a spreadsheet.,
Calculate the cost.,
Use an online service.,
Read reviews.",How to Choose Travel Insurance3," When you book your trip, you may be offered travel insurance by your airline, travel agent, or tour operator. It is usually best to shop around for travel insurance. The insurance offered by your travel carrier or agent can be notoriously difficult to file claims on, especially if their company goes bankrupt. Furthermore, they may not actually offer the type of coverage you need.By considering all of your options, you will find the right coverage for a better price.

, The best way to visualize different policies is to make a chart comparing them. In one column, write the name of each company. In the next columns, write down their cost, policy type, types of coverage, and whether or not they cover preexisting conditions. Decide which policy is the best value for your money while still providing the services you need.

, Depending on what kind of coverage you want, the insurance should cost between 5-7% of your journey’s total cost.Certain types of coverage, such as terrorism or emergency medical coverage, will increase the price to 7-10% of your journey’s cost.Compare how much your insurance costs compared to the rest of your journey to understand if you are paying too much or not.

, There are various insurance comparison websites that can simplify the process for you. Search for ""compare travel insurance"" to find a good service that works for you. Simply enter in your information, and the website will compile different policies for you.


Do not consult a website that is owned by a particular insurance company. Their data may be skewed to favor their own policy.

, Some newspapers, websites, and consumer companies offer reviews of different travel insurance policies. Search for reviews of both the company and specific policy you are considering. You can understand other travelers' experiences with a company before you sign on, and the reviews may help you consider what kind of problems you may encounter on your journey.

Look for overlapping coverage.",How to Determine if You Need Travel Insurance2," It is a good idea to get insurance for major purchases like expensive flights, cruises, and tour packages. If for some reason you have to cancel, you do not want to be out the hundreds or even thousands of dollars that you paid for these things. Getting insurance for these major expenses may also provide some much-needed peace of mind.If you are traveling with expensive or invaluable items, you may also want to get some kind of coverage.

, Different credit cards have a number of different insurance-related perks. For instance, some credit cards will provide auto insurance for a rental car. Others provide travel protection and cover the expenses of lost luggage. Before you make your travel arrangements, contact your credit card provider and determine what perks, if any, your card offers.Some credit cards may even provide coverage if you have to cancel a flight.
Ask questions like “Will my luggage be protected against loss or damage?” and “If I get into a car accident, how much will you cover?”

, Some of your existing insurance policies may cover any expenses that pop up during your trip. For instance, your homeowners or renters insurance may cover loss or damage to your luggage. If you have car insurance, you are likely covered if you rent a car. Check your existing policies or talk with your insurance agent to see what things are covered.If you already have a life insurance, you should not need an accidental death policy.
With lost luggage, the airline will also cover your loss up to a certain point.
If your existing coverage does not protect your luggage, only take possessions that you can live with losing. If you have to travel with valuables and you are not covered, you should get some insurance.
Ask your insurance agent questions like “Does my auto insurance cover rental cars overseas?” and “Does my renter's insurance cover my luggage?”

Buy your own insurance.,
Shop around.,
Read the fine print.",How to Determine if You Need Travel Insurance3," Instead of buying a policy from your travel agent or booking site, find a policy through an online broker. A travel agent may be selling you a policy that pays the highest sales commission rather than offering the customer the best coverage. This will help you get cheap insurance. If you already have health insurance, contact your current provider to see if they offer extra coverage that you can purchase for your trip., When you are looking for insurance, make sure that you look at multiple carriers. Check out an online broker like InsureMyTrip and compare different rates. Talk with a sales rep and get the details of any policies that you are interested in.This is particularly important for any travel health insurance policies. Failing to get the right policy could cost you thousands of dollars.

, If you are purchasing a policy, you want to make sure that it will cover any issues you encounter. For instance, if you have a preexisting condition, make sure your travel health insurance will cover any complications associated with it. You do not want to buy insurance only to find out later that it does not meet your needs. Read the fine print and get a policy that works for you.Before you buy, ask for a copy of the policy and be sure to go over it.
Talk to an insurance agent and make sure that all of your needs are met. Ask them things like “Does this cover my preexisting condition?” and “Will this policy cover the cost of all of my luggage if I lose it?”

Gather your supplies.,
Paint your styrofoam balls.,
Pair off the nitrogenous bases.,
Make the double helix.,
Attach the nitrogenous bases to the double helix strands.,
Twist the double helix.",How to Make a Model of DNA Using Common Materials2," For this version of the project, you will need small styrofoam balls, a needle and thread, paint, and toothpicks.

, Choose six different colors to represent the sugar and phosphate groups, and the four nitrogenous bases. They can be any six colors of your choice.


You will need to paint 16 sugar balls, 14 phosphate balls, and 4 different colors for each of the nitrogenous bases (cytosine, guanine, thymine, and adenine).
You could choose to have one of the colors be white, so that you don’t have to paint some of the styrofoam. This might be easiest for the sugar balls, as it will greatly reduce your total amount of work.

, Once the paint has dried, designate one color for each of the nitrogenous bases, and then pair them with their matching base. Cytosine always goes with guanine, and thymine always goes with adenine.


The order of the colors does not matter, as long as they are in the correct pairs.
Stick a toothpick between each of the pairs, leaving a little extra space at the sharp ends of the toothpicks.

, Using the needle and string, cut a piece that is long enough to go the length of 15 styrofoam balls. Tie a knot at one end of the string, and thread the needle on the other.


Line up the styrofoam sugar and phosphate balls, so that they alternate in sets of 15. There should be more sugar balls than phosphate balls.
Make sure that the two strands of sugar and phosphate are in the same order, so that they line up when placed next to each other.
Thread through the centers of each alternating string of styrofoam sugar and phosphate balls. Tie the string off at the end of each strand, to prevent the balls from sliding off.

, Take the toothpicks with your pairs of nitrogenous bases, and stick the sharp end to the matching sugar balls on each long strand.


Only attach the pairs to the styrofoam balls representing sugar, as this is how DNA is attached in real life.
Make sure that enough of the toothpick is attached to the strands that the pairs of bases will not fall off easily.

, Once all the pairs of toothpick bases have been attached to the sugar, twist the double strands in a counter-clockwise direction to mimic the appearance of a true double helix. Your model is now complete!"

Attach your gummy bears to the licorice.,
Twist your double helix.",How to Make a Model of DNA Using Common Materials3," To make the sugar and phosphate sides, use strands of black and red licorice that have a hollow center. For the nitrogenous bases, use four different colored gummy bear candies.


Whatever candy you use, make sure that it is soft enough to allow a toothpick to puncture it.
If you have them on hand, colored marshmallows are a great substitute for gummy bears.

, Gather string and toothpicks to be used in creating the model. The string should be cut to be about a foot long, although you can make it longer or shorter based on your preferred size of DNA model.


Use two pieces of string that are the same length to make the double helix.
Make sure you have at least a dozen toothpicks, although you may need a few more or less depending on how large you make your model

, These will be strung on your string in alternating colors, and should be cut to be one inch long.

, In a DNA strand, pairs of cytosine and guanine (C and G) are paired together, while pairs of thymine and adenine (T and A) are paired together. Choose four different colored gummy bears to represent these nitrogenous bases.


It doesn’t matter if a pair goes C--G or G--C, as long as those are always the two in a pair.
You cannot mix colors between pairs. For example, you cannot combine T--G or A--C.
The colors you choose are completely arbitrary and are entirely based on personal preference.

, Take the two pieces of string and tie a knot in the bottom of each to prevent the licorice from slipping off. Then, thread the string through the hollow centers of the licorice in alternating colors.


The two colors of licorice symbolize the sugar and phosphate that make up the double helix strands.
Choose one color to be the sugar group; your gummy bear nitrogenous bases will be attaching to this color of licorice.
Make sure that your two strands have licorice in the same order, so that they line up when placed next to each other.
Tie another knot to the other end of the string once you have finished adding all your licorice pieces.

, Once you have paired off all your gummy bears in the C--G and T--A groups, use a toothpick and stick one bear from each pair at the ends of the toothpicks.


Push the gummy bears far enough on each toothpick that at least ¼ of an inch of the sharp end is still sticking out.
You can have more of some pairs than others; the number of pairs in real life DNA determines differences and changes in the genes they form.

, Lay out your two licorice strands flat on a smooth surface, and then attach the gummy bear toothpicks to the licorice by inserting the sharp ends into the licorice.


You should be attaching the toothpicks only to the “sugar” molecules that you decided on. These are all the pieces of licorice in the same color (for example, all the red pieces).
Use all your gummy bear toothpicks, don’t worry about saving any.

, Once you have attached all your gummy bear toothpicks to the licorice, twist the strands in a counter-clockwise direction to give the spiral appearance of a true double helix. Enjoy your completed DNA model!"

Gather the necessary materials.,
Fill the container with water and put the iceberg in.,
Mark the water level of the container.,
Observe the icebergs location in the water.,
Let the iceberg melt and observe the water level.",How to Make a Mini Iceberg," To make a miniature iceberg, you will need a balloon or cup, water, food coloring, and a freezer. The balloon or cup will serve as the base shape for your iceberg. You can choose any container you’d like for the shape of your iceberg. If you want to sculpt your iceberg to make it more realistic use a balloon.To make an iceberg you need enough time for the water to freeze so make sure you have at least two days to do this.
The food coloring is optional, but can be used to add interesting colors to your iceberg.;
, Keep in mind that water expands as it freezes, so don’t fill the balloon all the way to the top. Fill it about ¾ full to give it plenty of space to expand. Tie the end with a knot to prevent the water from spilling out.


If you want to color your iceberg, add the food coloring before you tie the knot., Once full of water, store your water balloon in the freezer for at least 5 hours. The total time needed to freeze depends on how large your balloon is. If you leave it overnight, it will definitely be frozen when you wake up the next morning.If you want to shape your iceberg while it’s freezing, you can position other items in the freezer around the balloon so that it will come out more conical than spherical.
If it is below freezing outside, you could even place your balloon outside and let it freeze overnight!

, The next day, check to make sure the water is completely frozen. Remove your iceberg from the freezer and carefully cut away the balloon: cut the knot off, cut down the sides of the balloon, and then peel it away from the ice.Parental supervision is recommended for this step when using the scissors.

, If you’re making this iceberg for a science presentation, you might want to decorate it to make it look more realistic. With parental help, use a screwdriver and a hammer to make chips in the ice until it looks more like a floating iceberg.


Keep the iceberg in the freezer until your presentation or it will melt!

, Scientists study icebergs to learn about ocean currents and climate change.You can use your homemade iceberg to learn about density and ocean water levels.For these experiments you will need a container large enough for your iceberg, some water, and salt (optional).

, First, fill your container with tap water. Leave enough space at the top so when you put your iceberg in the water it doesn’t overflow. At the same time, make sure there is enough water that the iceberg doesn’t touch the bottom of the container.


You can also try these same experiments with the container filled with salt water.The results may surprise you!

, After placing the iceberg into the water, use a marker or a piece of tape to mark the location of the water level. This is the starting point of your “ocean level”. Mark this level as soon as you put the iceberg in before any of it can melt into the water.

, The first thing you should notice is that the majority of the iceberg is submerged underwater, but it still floats. The ice floats because frozen water is less dense than liquid water, but because of their relative densities, most of the iceberg is submerged.If you are using salt water, you may notice that the iceberg sits higher than it does in fresh water. This is because salt water has a higher density than fresh water., Leave the iceberg for at least 30 minutes to an hour or until the iceberg has completely melted. Did the water level rise above the line your marked? You might be surprised to observe that it hasn’t. This is because the iceberg displaced the same amount of water in its frozen form as it added in its liquid form.If you let the iceberg melt into salt water, are the results different? You should notice that the water level has actually risen. This is due to the differences in the densities between fresh and salt water. It will not rise by much, but it is enough that on a global scale, melting icebergs can affect ocean levels."

",How to Make a Laser," Lasers work, or “lase,” by stimulating electrons to emit light of a particular wavelength. (This process was first proposed in 1917 by Albert Einstein.)For electrons to emit light, they must first absorb energy to boost them to a higher orbit, then discharge that energy as light when returning to their original orbit. These energy sources are known as “pumps.”


Small lasers, such as those in CD and DVD players and laser pointers, use electronic circuits to provide electric current to diodes, which serves as the pump.
Carbon dioxide lasers are pumped with electrical discharges to excite their electrons.
Excimer lasers get their energy from chemical reactions.Lasers built around crystals or glasses use strong light sources such as arc or flash lamps.;
, A gain medium, or active laser medium, amplifies the power of the light given off by the stimulated electrons.Gain media can be any of the following items:


Semiconductors made of materials such as gallium arsenide, aluminum gallium arsenide, or indium gallium arsenide.
Crystals such as the ruby cylinder used in the Hughes Laboratories laser. Sapphire and garnet have also been used, as have fibers of optical glass. These glasses and crystals are treated with ions of rare earth elements
Ceramics, which have also been treated with rare earth ions.
Liquids, usually dyes, although an infrared laser was produced by using a gin and tonic as the gain medium. Gelatin dessert (Jell-O) has also been used successfully as a gain medium.Gases, such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen, mercury vapor, or a helium-neon mixture.Chemical reactions.
Electron beams.
Nuclear materials. A uranium laser was first produced in November, 1960, six months after the first ruby laser., These mirrors, or resonators, keep the light within the laser chamber until it builds up to the desired energy level for release, either through a tiny aperture in one of the mirrors or through a lens.The simplest resonator setup, the linear resonator, uses two mirrors placed at opposite sides of the laser chamber. It produces a single output beam.
A more complicated setup, the ring resonator, uses three or more mirrors. It may create a single beam, with the help of an optical isolator, or multiple beams.

, Along with the mirrors, the lens helps concentrate and direct the light so that the gain medium receives as much as possible.

, You can go to an electronics store or search online for “laser kit,” “laser module,” or “laser diode.” Your laser kit should include the following:


A driver circuit. (This is sometimes sold separately from the other components.) Look for a driver circuit that lets you adjust the current.
A laser diode.
An adjustable lens of either glass or plastic. Typically, the diode and lens are packaged together in a small tube. (These components are sometimes sold separately from the driver circuit.)

, Many laser kits require you to assemble the driver circuit. These kits include a circuit board and related parts and require you to solder it together, following the enclosed schematic. Other kits may have the circuit already assembled.


You can also design your own driver circuit, if you have the electronics skills to do so. The LM317 driver circuit provides a good template for designing your own. Be sure to use a resistor-capacitor (RC) circuit to protect the power output from spikes.Once you have assembled the driver circuit, you can test it by connecting it to a light-emitting diode (LED). If the LED doesn’t light up right away, adjust the potentiometer. If that doesn’t fix the problem, recheck the circuit to see that everything is correctly connected.

, If you have a digital multimeter, you can wire it to the circuit to monitor the current the diode is receiving. Most diodes can accommodate a range of 30 to 250 milliamperes (mA), while a range of 100 to 150 mA will produce a sufficiently powerful beam.


While a more powerful beam from the diode will produce a more powerful beam, the additional current needed to generate that beam will burn the diode out faster.

, The diode should now glow brightly.

, If you’re aiming at a wall, adjust until a nice, bright dot appears.


Once you’ve adjusted the lens this far, place a match in line with the beam and adjust the lens until you see the match head start to smoke. You can also try to pop balloons or burn holes in paper.

, Look for a unit with a writing speed of 16x or faster. These units have diodes with a power output of 150 milliwatts (mW) or better.


A DVD writer has a red diode with a wavelength of 650 nanometers (nm).
A Blu-Ray writer has a blue diode with a wavelength of 405 nm.
The DVD writer needs to be functional enough to write discs, although not necessarily successfully. (In other words, its diode needs to be functional.)
Do not substitute a DVD reader, CD writer, or CD reader for the DVD writer. A DVD reader has a red diode, but not as powerful as a DVD writer. The CD writer’s diode is powerful enough, but emits light in the infrared range, tempting you to look for a beam you can’t see.

, Turn the drive over. You’ll see four or more screws that you’ll have to unscrew before you can separate the drive and harvest the diode.


Once you’ve separated the drive, you’ll see a pair of metal rails held in place with screws. These support the laser assembly. When you unscrew the rails, you can remove them and take out the laser assembly.
The diode will be smaller than a penny. It has three metal pins and may be encased in a metal jacket, with or without a protective transparent window, or it may be exposed.
You’ll have to pry the diode out of the laser assembly. You may find it easier to remove the heat sink from the assembly before trying to extract the diode. If you have an anti-static wrist band, use it while removing the diode.
Handle the diode with care, more so if it is an exposed diode. You may want to have an anti-static container to put the diode in until you can assemble your laser.

, You will have to pass the diode’s beam through a focusing lens to use it as a laser. You can do this one of two ways:


Use a magnifying glass as a focuser. You’ll have to move the glass around to find the right spot to produce a laser beam, and you’ll have to do this each time you use your laser.
Get a low-powered laser diode, such as 5 mW, lens tube assembly and substitute your DVD writer diode for the assembly’s diode.

,, You connect the positive pin to the positive lead from the driver circuit and the negative pin to the negative lead. The pin location differs according to whether you are working with a red DVD writer diode or a blue Blu-Ray writer diode.


Hold the diode with the pins pointing toward you, rotated so the pinheads make a triangle that points to the right. On both diodes, the pin at the top is the positive pin.
On the red DVD writer diode, the centermost pin, which forms the apex of the triangle, is the negative pin.
On the blue Blu-Ray writer diode, the bottom pin is the negative pin.

Search for a rental through a property management company if you want a rental that has been pre-screened by the agency. These rentals can often be more expensive, but you will have immediate access to a property manager if something breaks or you have questions.
Stick to renting directly from owners if you appreciate personal contact. These vacation rentals can often be less expensive as well, since owners do not have to pay commissions to a property management company.

, Make a list of the things you are looking for, and put them in order of importance.


Search for a rental that is kid-friendly if you are traveling with your family. Extra bedrooms, a pool and a nearby playground might come in handy.
Find rentals that come with a jet ski or a boat if you love water sports. If quiet and solitude are important to your vacation, look for a rental with a private beach in a secluded area.

, Most beach vacation rentals can be found on websites with pictures, rates and reviews.


Look for properties that provide a lot of photos. You should be able to see pictures of the interior and exterior of the properties.
Pay attention to location. If you will not have a car, you will want to make sure the property is within walking distance of shops, restaurants and entertainment. You will also want to know whether you are on the beach or near the beach.

, Look for an email address or a phone number, and get in touch to discuss specifics.


Ask all of the things you need to know, such as what size the beds are in each bedroom, what kind of kitchen utilities are included, how far it is to the nearest grocery store and whether there is parking available.
Take note of response times. If your calls go unreturned or it takes a week to get an email back, those might be red flags.

, Plug the property address into Yahoo Maps or Google Earth to determine the exact location of the properties you are considering.

, They will ask where you’re going and why, how you would wish to travel, how long you plan to stay, and what your travel budget is. Be open and honest with your answers. A good agent will gladly put together a sample tours that describe availabilities in transportation, accommodations, and estimated costs.

, However, while an agent will typically ask questions to get this type of information from you (and you should take it as a bad sign if the agent does not), you will also need to do your part by speaking your mind.


Clarify the main purpose of your trip.
Decide where you want to go and when, making sure the trip will fit into everyone's plan.
Choose your mode of transportation, whether it's Airline, Cruise, rental car, or something else.
Try to determine a realistic budget for your trip based on all your other considerations.

, You should ask most of these questions to person, in addition, when you meet with those agents:


What kind of travel do you specialize in?
Can I contact you 24 hours a day?
Which services do you charge for and how much will they cost?

, As you start to discuss travel options with an agent you like, keep these guidelines in mind:


Do not rely on vocal agreements alone.
Do not suppose your accommodations will look as impressive as they do in the glossy direct mail.
Always read all the paperwork carefully before you sign it, especially when it comes to package deals.

Strip and prep the wire ends.,
Connect one wire end to a battery’s positive terminal.,
Connect to the battery’s negative terminal.,
Watch the needle.,
Read about the Oersted experiment.,
Consider that magnetic fields are vectors.,
Observe how similar charges repel each other.",How to Make a Galvanometer," A compass has a magnetic needle. This needle will allow you to detect electrical currents because electrical currents generate a magnetic field (and this field interacts with the needle). The most effective compass will be one meant for navigational purposes (i.e. designed to align to the earth’s magnetic field and point north), rather than a toy.You can buy a compass online, an outdoor recreation store, or at some large general stores.;
, Use about twelve inches of thin, insulated copper wire. Keep in mind that the tighter you wrap the wire around the compass, the more turns (wraps) you will get. Since you are coiling the wire around the compass, more turns translates to a stronger magnetic field being produced. Be sure that you leave two leads about three inches long (one on either end of the wire)., First, you should use wire strippers to remove any plastic or other insulation from both ends of the wire, leaving an inch of wire exposed. Next, make sure that the wire is clean by sanding it gently with sandpaper. Wires are often coated with films or chemicals that you cannot see to prevent them from corroding. Unfortunately, if you don’t sand this off, it can hinder the flow of electricity., Batteries store power by creating an electrical gradient. That is to say that one side of the battery is positively charged and the other side is negatively charged. The two sides are separated by an insulator. By touching your wire (a conductor) to both sides, you will create a path for this charge to move. First, touch one end of the wire to the positive terminal.The positive terminal of the battery will be marked with a plus sign.

, Doing this will close the circuit and allow the charge in the battery to flow. Flowing charge is an electrical current. To create this current, touch the second wire end to the negative terminal while holding the first on the positive. Remove either end to stop the current.The negative terminal of the battery will be marked with a negative sign.
It is a good idea to wear gloves for this part of the experiment. This will help prevent shocks and/or burns.
The current flow will make the battery and wires very hot in just a few seconds. Leave the wire connected to the battery just long enough to watch the compass spin.

, Now that you’ve generated an electric current, a magnetic field will also be created. This magnetic field will cause the needle in the compass to move. When the needle moves, you will know that you are detecting an electrical current., Hans Christian Oersted was the first to show that magnetic fields were induced by electrical current. He built a galvanometer using copper wire and a compass to show that the needle moved when a current was passed through the wire. This is the science on which galvanometers work., Magnetic fields have a magnitude (how strong the field is) and a direction. The direction is important, because it governs how and where the needle moves. The magnitude of the field can affect how fast the needle moves.


For example, if you line the compass needle parallel to the coil and then turn on the current, the needle will be repelled., To replicate the way that the needle moves away from the coiled wire, you can try to put two magnets together with the same end (negative or positive) facing each other. The like charges will repel and push them away from each other in the same way that the needle is repelled by the copper wire."

Plus, several vacation destinations are all but designed for solo backpackers. For example, Thailand is an especially popular place for solo travelers, in part because it’s easy to backpack here.Thailand is easy and safe to navigate, many people speak English, and there are plenty of hostels - the ideal place to stay for many solo travelers.
Further, Thailand is one of the best places to meet other people traveling solo.
Specific draws include an active nightlife in Bangkok, beaches and island, notoriously good food, and the calm that only Buddhist temples can bring.;
, Not only is it inexpensive to travel in Vietnam, this country is also especially easy to navigate. Since the country is geographically long and thin, most travelers go from one end to the other, so it’s an especially easy place to meet others trying to satisfy some solo wanderlust.On the other hand, solo travelers to Vietnam need to be especially wary of getting scammed. Familiarize yourself with the appropriate costs of different things, such as taxi rides, before you’re in a situation where someone is trying to convince you otherwise.
Vietnam boasts some incredibly bustling urban areas, incredible geographic features, and non-stop parties in Nha Trang.

, Costa Rica is one of the best places for solo travel, as it is rife with adventure and natural beauty. It is also very popular with tourists, very accessible, and very safe. It has some of the richest biodiversity on the planet, and you can find hostels in close proximity to both surfing meccas and dense rain forests.Since the rich forests and accessible beaches of Costa Rica are so popular, you'll wind up meeting other travelers from all over the world. This is especially likely if you stay in hostels.
While Costa Rica is especially safe and developed, it is also more expensive to travel here relative to other Central American countries.

, The list of worthy destinations in this part of the world is hard to summarize. You can find Incan ruins and trails, the largest high-altitude lake on the planet (with great historic significance), and natural salt flats. Plus, there’s pretty much a permanent circuit of backpackers, so if you do want to partner up for a portion of your travels, it’s especially easy to do in Peru.The Peruvian city of Cusco is a place that many visitors never forget. They city has been hosting travelers for thousands of years, and is very near Machu Picchu, one of the most popular destinations in the Western Hemisphere., The food and culture of Southern Mexico are worth the trip alone. Of course, this region also boasts legendary beaches, Mayan ruins, and lake Atitlan in the cloud forest of Guatemala. Transportation is cheap and easy to find. Go to Guatemala for more backpack-specific excursions, and to Tulum or Playa del Carmen in Mexico for a more social solo trip."

Wander Western Europe.,
Visit Australia.,
Travel to Hong Kong.,
Get up to Alaska.",How to Choose a Travel Destination when Going Alone2," Want to see and do as much as possible? With innumerable landscapes, historic cities, and several global cultural epicenters all within a short distance of one another, Western Europe offers an unrivaled destination. Paris, London, Rome, and Barcelona, for instance are some of the most visited cities in the world. Though a good bit of traveling will required to visit multiple cities, there are accessible, safe, and comfortable ways to get all over the region.The costs of traveling will inevitably be much higher than most other options. However, the comfort and ease of travel in the region is also especially high.

, Australia offers coasts and coral reefs to an extent that do not exist elsewhere. Australian people are especially welcoming to travelers, as many Australians enjoy traveling themselves. Further, many of the destination cities are closer together than you may think - they’re all in the South/Southeast part of the country.Hostels are especially active and vibrant in Australia - but may also be frequented with a group of rowdy, alcohol-fueled youths during your stay.
An especially favorable destination for solo travelers is Melbourne, as the city is entirely navigable by foot or bicycle.

, Another especially safe and comfortable place to visit is Hong Kong. While is one of the largest cities in the world, it also offers ample opportunity to relaxation.Hong Kong is also a place where Eastern and Western cultures have become deeply interwoven. As indicative of this relationship, this is one of the few cities in China were many of the locals speak English.

, Believe it or not, 1 of 5 people that go to Alaska do so on their own. And for good reason: with breathtaking natural beauty, some of the most wild terrain you can get to, and wildlife unlike anywhere else in the world, there is plenty to contemplate for a lover of the outdoors.Seasonal conditions vary dramatically in Alaska. You likely want to plan a trip sometime between mid-June and mid-August, especially if you're hoping to enjoy the outdoors as much as possible. It's not just the relative warmth that makes this season ideal - June and July are also the months when Alaska receives the most sunlight.If you plan to camp, especially on your own, make sure you are thoroughly prepared to do so. Alaska truly is one of the last wilderness frontiers on this planet - the freedom it offers a lone traveler must be met with a full awareness of the important of safety in the wild.

Favor well-traveled destinations.,
Account for logistics.,
Consider visa requirements.,
Weigh the benefits of a pre-determined route.,
Make reservations, but have a back-up plan.,
Go where you want to go.,
Be as social as you want.,
Be careful.",How to Choose a Travel Destination when Going Alone3," There are many reasons that it makes sense to travel somewhere popular when going alone. The main factor is safety. Related to this, you’ll have a much easier time finding places to stay that are fun and affordable in popular tourist destinations. Another important consideration is companionship. Even if you’re traveling along to get more in touch with yourself, there will be moments you want to share., There are a few specific factors you should consider about potential destinations in terms of logistical concerns. For instance, it is advisable to go somewhere with an accessible, reliable method of transportation.If you are a relatively large human in terms of height or weight, traveling in certain areas - such as Central and South America, may often be uncomfortable. While this may not bother everyone, it can be rougher than expected several hours in a bus seat designed for a much smaller person, for instance.
If internet connectivity is of high importance to you, be aware that some countries will have far slower - and less commonly available - internet than you’re used to. Malaysia is a good option if you want to visit southern Asia as technological advances have made internet more accessible here than in other parts of the region., Some countries are surprisingly hard to get into, while others don’t require a visa at all for short stays. Depending on where you’re from, you are also unlikely to be allowed into some countries at all. An embassy to your destination country is the best source of knowledge about visa requirements and availability.Some countries in Africa and the Middle East will be especially hard or even impossible to get into. This is especially true of countries where Islam is extremely prominent, or ongoing conflicts give cause for concerns about the safety of tourists.
You may also need certain vaccinations to be allowed to enter certain counties, especially in Africa.

, Another factor than can contribute to safety and ease of travel is a well-established travel route within a certain country. If you’re hoping to move around (as opposed to simply visiting one city), this is especially important.Another benefit of an established circuit is a higher likelihood that you’re able to find temporary traveling partners to share the road with. You’re also more likely to meet people who can give you valuable tips about what to do.
In short, having a bit of an established route can take a lot of stress out of planning, and it won’t prevent you from simply going with the flow whensoever the mood strikes.

, In addition to a somewhat established route, try to plan where you’ll stay ahead of time as well. If staying in hostels, call ahead to see about availability. If they’re pretty open, you can probably just show up and book a spot when you get there - and leave your plans open in the meantime. However, in busier seasons or cities, it’s worth reserving places ahead of time.Either way, flexibility is key to a successful trip. Whenever you’re making reservations, ask about cancellation policies and avoid making bookings that will heavily penalize you for changes. Always have a backup place in mind too, especially when you don’t make formal reservations.

, One of the greatest advantages of traveling alone is that it’s entirely up to you how to spend your time. Though it may seem obvious, it’s worth reminding yourself that you should be doing what you want to do. In fact, consider deleting Instagram and posting minimally, if at all, on Facebook. You can always share photos later. In the meantime, be where you are, and do whatever you feel like!State otherwise, this vacation is all yours. You want to go to the creepy doll museum? Do it. You want to take surfing lessons for the third day in a row. Heck, why not? Without a traveling partner, you’ll be much more free to do literally exactly what you want to do.

, You shouldn’t feel obligated to try to meet people, but it’s worth maintaining casual conversations with people you meet while traveling. You’ll get inside knowledge about the area or worthy stops along your path. It can also be incredibly exciting to meet people and interact with them without much context - which can happen most naturally while you’re traveling.Of course, don’t hesitate to spend time on your own as well. Walking in ancient cities, or through landscapes you’ve seen before can be deeply enriching on your own. You’ll really get to listen to your own thoughts, in a way that being in a new place inspires.

, The one major negative about traveling alone is that you don’t have the security that comes with the presence of others. In fact, if you’re going out at night, you should do so with other travelers. Even during the day, stick to public areas that are frequented by families and professionals.If you’re drinking, keep it moderate. One drink too many can lead to dangerous situations, especially in cities where you may stick out.
Another vital safety measure to take while traveling alone is sharing your whereabouts with someone back home. Further, make sure someone knows how to get a hold of you if need be. Let someone know your itinerary, as well as the specific places you mind up staying along the way.
While you may want to turn your phone off to enjoy your vacation, you should keep it with you, keep it charged, and turn it on once in a while to make sure no one has been trying to reach you.

Watch the exchange rate between the Euro and the currency used in your country.,
Find a bank or foreign exchange firm that sells foreign currency.,
Enter the shipping address.,
Learn the symbols.,
Figure out what places use euros as their currency.,
Decide what kind of currency you want.,
Get euros from your bank before your trip.,
Exchange currency into euros at the airport.,
Withdraw money from an ATM in a country that uses euros.",How to Buy Euros Online," You want to be able to buy as many Euros as you can. Look up the current exchange rate and find out whether the rate is falling or rising. It may be helpful to look at a graph for the last few months to see how the Euro is performing against your currency.Determine which currency is being used to calculate the exchange rate; this is called the base currency. For instance, if you see this exchange rate: 1 EUR = 1.36 USD, that means it costs $1.36 American dollars to buy one Euro. The base rate is the first figure listed. Each country's currency has its own code.
If the base currency is American dollars and the exchange rate is 1 USD = .772 EUR, then it will cost you 100 American dollars to buy about 77 Euros. In this situation, the exchange rate is being calculated with the U.S. dollar as the base.;
, You can buy Euros with either an e-check (you enter the check information) or a credit card. The exchange rates will differ depending on your payment method. Be sure to check what the transaction and shipping fees are. You may want to browse several web sites to find one whose fees are acceptable.Some sellers give you the current exchange rate but charge a fee for the transaction. Others offer an exchange rate that's less than the current rate to make money on the transaction.
For example, if the exchange rate is 1 USD = 1.29 EUR but the seller is offering an exchange rate of 1 USD = 1.22 EUR, then you will spend 100 U.S. dollars to buy 122 Euros from that seller. This is the same as if the seller charged seven Euros (or the dollar equivalent) for the transaction.

, You must use the address that's associated with your bank or credit card account. Generally, the seller will not ship to post office boxes, and you will need to be available at the address to accept the package. If you can't be available, you may choose to pick up your Euros at a local bank branch., You want to make sure you order the correct currency, so you’ll need to learn what symbols equate to euros. Sometimes euros are referred to by the abbreviation EUR. Other times they are represented by the symbol €., In general, you’ll only be able to use euros in countries that use the euro as their national currency. Most countries in the European Union use the euro as currency. There are, however, some exceptions. Here is a list of countries that use euros as their currency:


Austria
Belgium
Cyprus
Estonia
Finland
France
Germany
Greece
Ireland
Italy
Latvia
Lithuania
Luxembourg
Malta
the Netherlands
Portugal
Slovakia
Slovenia
Spain

, When you order euros, you’ll need to decide what form of the currency you’ll want to use. There are coins and paper currency in the euro.


You might only want big bills so it’s easier to transport. Or you might want to get a collection of smaller bills so that they are easier to use for day-to-day expenses.
You might also consider whether or not you’ll need to order any euro coins. Many exchanges do not deal in coins. Luckily, it is quite easy to convert a paper Euro note into coins in the destination country.
Euro bills come in the following denominations: €5, €10, €20, €50, €100, €200, and €500., Most banks can order euros for you in person. Just notify your bank (in person or over the phone) that you’ll need to order some euros and tell them how much and what denomination of bills you want. Banks can usually get the foreign currency for you within a few business days.Some banks will charge you a nominal fee for this service., When you arrive at most large or international airports, there will be several currency exchange places that you can take advantage of. They will charge you a fee to take your cash (whatever currency) and change it into euros.


You can also find money-exchanging places outside of the airport. Most major cities have them, especially near tourist locations.

, When you arrive in a country that uses euros, you can use your debit card to take out cash. It will dispense in the local currency, which will give you the euros that you need.


Just remember that you will probably incur a foreign ATM usage fee and/or a foreign transaction fee from your home bank."

Decide where you want to go.,
Decide if you want to go.",How to Book a Vacation1," First decide if you want to go somewhere inside your country or outside your country. Decide if you want to stay in a hotel (alone or with your wife; etc) or stay at a family member who lives in that particular destination (city/country).;
, Sometimes, you will just have thoughts coming up. There may be thoughts like the 'it is too expensive' or your mum is telling you to stay with a particular family member who you don't like (the family member is too talkative or you don't get on with him/her). These are problems which will cause you to rethink your trip. Think about these things before you do the booking.

Visit a bank in your destination country.,
Alternatively, visit a bank in your home country.,
Try a postal bank.,
Visit an international airport.,
Visit a currency exchange.,
Try a European ATM.",How to Buy Euros1," If you've already traveled into the Eurozone, you're in luck — it's not usually hard to get your hands on Euros. For example, most European banks will sell Euros to non-citizens at very reasonable rates. Best of all, most banks in major European cities will have at least some staff members that speak English. If you're not comfortable awkwardly asking for an English speaker, you can always use the ATM (see below for more information).


Exchange rates at European banks tend to be quite good. Many banks will not charge a transaction fee for the service (though some will).
Note that the hours of operation for banks in Europe can be different than they are abroad. Banking holidays will also vary from country to country. If possible, check when the bank is open online before making your trip.;
, You can also buy Euros at most major banks in the UK, Canada, Australia, and the US. This is handy if you want to have a small amount of European currency in your wallet when you step off the plane. Some traveler's guides strongly recommend this.Others, however, favor buying Euros in Europe to avoid the risk of traveling with large amounts of currency.


Fees at banks in the English-speaking world can vary from place to place and based on whether or not you have an account. Anecdotally, American banks are said to have less-favorable dollar-to-euro exchange rates than their European counterparts., Believe it or not, many European post offices (especially in major cities) will have small ""mini-banks"" inside that will be able to change your money from your home country's currency to euros. Not all post offices will have these mini-banks, but the ones that do are claimed to have some of the best exchange rates available.Even some post offices in the English-speaking world will have small banks or exchange bureaus available to exchange your currency. This is by no means guaranteed, however, so check online or via phone before visiting if possible.

, Since busy airports are host to thousands (sometimes millions) of passengers from around the world every day, they will usually have their own currency exchange booths and kiosks. Any of these will be happy to convert your cash into Euros — whether you're in your home country or the Eurozone.


You may want to avoid this option if you have other choices available. While airport exchanges are are convenient, according to some sources, they often have some of the least-favorable exchange rates.Note that airports that don't receive a great deal of international traffic (like smaller regional airports) may not have their own exchanges.

, Some major cities and tourist locations will have currency exchanges completely separate from banks, post offices, airports, and so on. These can range from small kiosks to bank-like brick and mortar locations, depending on where you are. The most well-known currency exchange service for most Americans is Travelex, but you may be able to find other currency exchanges (also called bureaus de change) in the following locations:


At major transportation hubs (airports, train stations, etc.)
Near tourist destinations/landmarks
Near hotels, resorts, etc.
Near commercial areas (markets, malls, etc.)
If you haven't left for Europe yet, try using Travelex's store locatore here to find a currency exchange near you., It's important to note that most ATMs in Europe — those at banks and those elsewhere — will allow you to buy Euros by debiting your checking account. This can be an exceptionally convenient option since there are likely to be hundreds of ATMs in any major European city. In addition, most ATMs will operate in a variety of languages including English.


With ATMs, the fees you incur can vary greatly depending on the bank you use. Some banks may charge a ""foreign transaction"" fee in addition to the standard ATM fee, which can make using ATMs expensive. Thus, it is usually cheapest to make a few big withdrawals, rather than many small ones.If you intend to use ATMs in Europe, notify your bank in your home country before leaving. If not, your bank may interpret the financial transactions in Europe as fraudulent activity or identity theft.

, You may book your room in the particular hotel online and pay in on arrival or you may go and book it there and then but it is good to get it done in advance so that you do not have to wait at the hotel.

, While he/she may take charges for his/her services, it is always considered a good decision especially for tours so that you are spared the trouble of going around and getting everything done.

, During your stay it is better to get a car arranged full-time rather than getting a taxi. You can go anywhere you want anytime and the car will be available. (Just give your driver a break for lunch and dinner :)

, Now it is time to check if you get the visa on-arrival at the airport of the particular city or you have to apply. Apply from the visa application center of that particular country in your area or from the consulate/embassy/high commission. It is a necessity. Without it, you are sent back or if you get in without it, you're arrested.

Check major currency exchange sites for phone order options.,
Order the euros from a bank or exchange.,
Keep in mind that all methods will charge a fee.,
Remember that the price will be affected by the currency market.,
Be wary of scam artists.",How to Buy Euros2," Planning your trip to Europe well in advance? If you have enough time left before your trip to be able to receive mail, you may be able to order Euros online. This is an easy process — simply visit a major currency exchange site (like, for instance, travelex.com and foreignmoney.com), follow the prompts to place your order, and provide proper payment information.With this option, you can usually choose to have the Euros delivered to your home. Some sites even offer free shipping on orders over a certain value. You usually may also pick your order up at a currency exchange location.

, Most services that allow you to order Euros online will also give you the option to order over the phone. This is true both for major exchange websites like Travelex.com and for smaller local or regional exchanges. In the latter case, contact options can vary from location to location.


To contact Travelex via phone, call 516-300-1622., In addition to Travelex and other currency exchange sites, you can also usually order foreign currency from your bank. Depending on your bank, you may be able to place this order either online or over the phone. In either case, the basic process is the same: you contact the bank, place your order, and the currency is delivered to your home. Be sure to allow time for the Euros to arrive before you must leave for your trip.


If time is short, you may be able to pick the Euros up in person shortly after placing your order.

, Nearly every location that allows you to buy Euros will charge you a small fee to do so. Usually, this is done by taking a percentage ""cut"" of your money — for instance, a currency exchange might give you 90% of your money's value in Euros and keep the remaining 10%. It is difficult to get a perfectly ""fair"" exchange between your native currency and Euros, so plan accordingly.


Your best bet to avoid these sorts of costs may be to visit a bank that you are a member of. However, even in these cases, there may be minor fees for changing your currency.

, The values of the world's currencies are constantly changing. Depending on how valuable your home country's currency is compared to the Euro, you may enjoy a favorable exchange rate or be forced to deal with an unfavorable one. In general:


It's best to buy Euros when your home country's currency is relatively strong compared to the Euro. This means that each unit of currency you spend will get you more Euros for your trip.
On the other hand, for the opposite reason, it's not favorable to buy Euros when your currency is weak compared to the Euro.
Visit xe.com for an up-to-speed look at the exchange rates between the world's most important currencies., It should go without saying that it's only wise to buy Euros from licensed, reputable agencies with names you trust. Paying a little extra in exchange fees is always better than unwittingly committing a crime in a foreign country. Don't accept an offer from a stranger to change your money to Euros — you may end up short-changed or with a wallet full of counterfeit currency, which is a serious crime.


The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission additionally warns against so-called ""forex"" (foreign exchange) investment opportunities. In these schemes, unwitting investors are tricked into buying large amounts of foreign currency with promises of ""high returns coupled with low risks.""In reality, the scam artists steal the money — and often get away with it, because it is difficult for police to pursue criminals across national borders.

If you think the vacation package seems too good to be true, you're probably right.There are no buy one, get one free offers. These promotions are offered by resorts with the intention that the marketing company sell them for a set price. These resorts do not want you coming to their resort with a free vacation package for next year’s travel. They are trying to sell you a vacation service. This is completely against all the terms and conditions that the resort has set and should be reported to them directly.

, There are many companies that claim they are US-based and really working out of other countries. Don't correspond with people only through e-mail. Instead, talk to them on the phone, or to a landlord, travel coordinator, or booking agent.Many foreign scammers get US phone numbers to make consumers think they are local. You need to investigate the company you are going to buy your timeshare vacation package through before giving them any money.

, The ultimate goal of a timeshare presentation or tour is to get you to buy a timeshare. The salespeople will use many sales tactics, including making you speak with 3-4 sales representatives who each lower the price even further.They also might make you feel guilty for taking the discount package, for wasting their time, or for not buying because they won't get paid if you don't buy from them. Don't fall for this.


Make sure to ask for cancellation periods. Most salespeople won't tell you about your right to cancel if you sign up for a timeshare.Don't lead a salesperson on. If you have no intention of buying, don't pretend you are more interested than you are."

Give your travel plan to someone back in civilization.",How to Choose a Hiking Vacation Destination," From waterfalls to sprawling stretches of forest, a hike can offer a range of gorgeous vistas. Think about the natural beauties that appeal to you and include them in your search queries when you look for trails.For example, if you want to find a location that offers endless views, look for a hiking trail that increases in elevation and culminates at the top of a hill or mountain.;
, As you consider the scenery and environments you’re interested in, look for spots that you can travel to affordably. You’ll have more options available if you can afford to travel long distance but, even on a budget, you’ll be able to track down an appealing destination closer to home.


While you might not be able to find a nearby tropical forest trail if you live in a temperate environment, chances are you’ll be able to track down an awe-inspiring vacation destination without having to spend lots of money on long-distance travel.

, If you’re a beginner, it’s best to stick to day hiking, so look for a nearby hotel or cabin and, if necessary, a car rental agency. If you’re more experienced, look for backpacking trails that have resources like fresh water and suitable campsites.If you plan on camping overnight, you’ll most likely need to acquire a permit and register with the local park service.Park or trail websites will include maps that note resources for camping and any applicable registration procedures.

, After getting a general idea of the types of environments and trails that appeal to you, look for a match online. The easiest way is to enter your location (or a location where you’d like to travel) and keywords like ""hiking"" and ""backpacking"" into a search engine. Include terms like waterfall, mountains, old growth forest, and other environmental characteristics in your search.You can also look for destinations on the American Hiking Society’s website.Try searching for locations using the U.S. National Park Service.Look for international destinations on Trails.com., Once you’ve put together a list of potential trails, try to find out what other hikers have said about their experiences. Search for a local hiking association or organization with trip reports, and check Google for reviews.For example, if you’re thinking about visiting a hiking trail in Washington, U.S., search the Washington Trails Association website for a trip report.
While you can usually find good recent photographs on Google listings, take the reviews with a grain of salt. Remember that any positive or negative online review might be biased. A report by an experienced hiker on a hiking association or organization website will most likely provide more credible information.

, Your level of experience is an essential consideration when choosing a hiking destination. Easy trails are well-maintained with little elevation, moderate trails have steady ascents with some roots and other obstacles, and strenuous trails have steep ascents and frequent obstacles.Trails are often rated on a scale of 1 to 5, with class 1 being easy hiking with minimal elevation and class 5 being advanced-level rock climbing.
Check potential trails’ ratings and avoid choosing a trail that’s beyond your experience level.

, If you’re just starting out, a 5 mile (8 kilometer) round trip hike is a good maximum distance. Use a potential trail’s map to plan out your day hike or, if you’re more experienced, your multi-day backpacking trip.While the range you can cover per hour will depend on trail difficulty, an average rate is about 1.5 miles (about 2.5 kilometers) per hour. When you plan your trip, make sure you have enough time to complete your hike before sunset.

, If you’re planning a trip with your family, look for a trail that’s easy enough for the youngest child joining you. Search for kid-friendly trails around the travel location you’ve chosen.If you want to hike with your dog, it’s best to avoid climbing trails with steep inclines that require opposable thumbs.
When hiking in groups, remember that a trail’s difficulty level should always match the least experienced hiker’s abilities., While you should always check out your trail’s map before starting your hike, studying your route is even more essential when backpacking. Look for spots where you can refill your water supply and clearings where you can set up camp.Be sure to give yourself plenty of time to reach a prospective campsite before it gets dark.
Check the websites of the park service or local hiking associations for topographical maps. If you know your route’s elevation in advance, you’ll be able to pace your hike accordingly.

, Most overnight trips will require registration with the local park office or ranger. If you plan on parking your car during a day hike, you might need to get a parking pass to avoid getting a ticket.The park or trail website will list information about parking, permits, and registration requirements.

, You’ll need to familiarize yourself with local daylight hours, whether you’re planning a day hike or an overnight camping trip. Look online for sunset times during the days you’re planning your vacation. Always make sure you give yourself plenty of time to finish your hike or reach your campsite before it gets dark., When choosing your vacation spot, keep the local climate in mind. While you won’t know exactly what the weather will be far in advance, knowing your destination’s climate will give you the best shot at avoiding undesirable weather. As your vacation approaches, check your hiking destination’s local weather so you can pack appropriate attire and gear., When you narrow down your list of potential destinations, call local park rangers or offices and ask about temporary or long-term hazards and closures. Just before your trip, call them again to check in about any local conditions or advisements that could impact your hiking vacation.For example, wildfires or downed trees can shut down trails for anywhere from a few days to many months.

, Before you leave for your hiking vacation, make sure you inform a friend or family member about your travel plans. Let them know where you plan to be on each day of your vacation. If you’re backpacking, give them your planned campsites locations and let them know when you plan on setting up and breaking down each camp.If possible, especially you’re a beginner, try to check in with someone regularly during your trip.

Look into local accommodations.,
Decide what off-season activities are available.,
Research transportation availability.,
Find ways to save money.",How to Choose an Off‐Season Winter Travel Destination1," One of the benefits of traveling in the off-season is that hotels and other local forms of accommodation often discount their room rates, in order to attract more travelers during a slower travel period.Before you leave on your trip, you’ll want to be confirm that none of your prospective accommodations are only seasonally open. Some hotels in popular tourist areas may close their doors for the winter.


Don’t limit yourself to staying in hotels: AirBnBs, regular bed and breakfasts, and other forms of accommodation may also offer discounts for off-season winter travel.;
, Off-season travel also presents opportunities to participate in travel activities that may be overly crowded and filled with tourists during the summer. If you’d like to visit popular restaurants, amusement parks, theaters, museums, or shopping districts, the off season is a great time to do so. Look online to see if you can find any discounted deals for off-season entertainment.A concern with off-season travel is that many activities may be open only in the summer for peak tourist season, and may close in the winter. Look online for activates that like you’d like to do while traveling, and make sure that they haven’t closed for the winter.

, As part of choosing a travel destination, research transportation options before you go. If you’re planning to visit a domestic or international city, look to see what car-rental options are available, or if the city infrastructure includes a developed public transit system. If you’ll be in a more rural area, check out bus schedules or ride-sharing options that may be available.


Also look into the effects that the winter weather may have on your travel. You may find that rental companies reduce their scope of operations in off-season months.
Make sure that your planned method of transportation is feasible during the winter, especially with increased season snow and rain. For example, if you’re in a country area, renting a car or taking the bus over rural roads may be impossible., For many, the primary benefit to traveling in the off season—especially to destinations frequented in winter—is to save money. Do plenty of research before finalizing your travel plans: look online (or call) to find hotels that offer off-season discounts. Also research online to see if travel attractions—restaurants, theme parks, museums, theaters—offer discounted rates, buy-one-get-one deals, or unique off-season perks designed to attract visitors such as yourself.Also consider the local school schedules. If you plan to visit a popular winter destination during June and July, be aware that you may be seeking entertainment along with school children and high schoolers on their summer break.

Stop by Yellowstone National Park, or other western Parks.,
Visit the Caribbean.,
Visit Portugal and other locations in southwestern Europe.",How to Choose an Off‐Season Winter Travel Destination2," During winter, the number of tourists in Yellowstone drops from 3,000,000 to 140,000, resulting in much easier access to all of the sites and amenities that the Park offers. Although the temperatures in northern Wyoming can dip well below freezing, the beautiful views and quiet, uncrowded environment will more than compensate.Call ahead before you visit the Park: roads often close in winter due to snowfall or icy conditions, so you may need to incorporate these closures into your daily plans.
Other Parks in the western U.S. will see a similar decline in tourists during the winter. Look into visiting Rocky Mountain National Park, Yosemite National Park, Arches National Park, Badlands National Park, or Olympic National Park.

, Caribbean islands near Florida—including Barbados—can be a great off-season travel destination. Many tourists from colder climates choose to visit the balmy Caribbean during the summer months, so if you visit in the winter, you’ll be confronted with fewer crowds, although you may encounter rainy weather and high humidity. Caribbean travel destinations offer beaches, hiking, resorts, and festivals.The Caribbean experiences hurricane season most seriously in August, September, and October, so you may want to avoid those months for weather-based reasons. In addition, many hotels and restaurants shut down during the worst weeks of hurricane season.
Barbados can still draw crowds during winter, so if you’re planning to eat at any of the fine-dining establishments on the island, you may want to make reservations in advance., Portugal has mild, relatively pleasant winters, and this season is also its off-season for tourist travel. The region has a lot to offer if you’re interested in beach activities—despite the cold weather, the beaches will be relatively empty, and present great opportunities for surfing, sailing, and strolls along the beach.Portugal has nearly 950 kilometers (590 miles) of shoreline, so it shouldn’t be a challenge to find a tourist-free stretch of beach on which to spend your vacation.

Plan a trip to a large city.,
Visit coastal Britain between December and February.,
Anticipate unexpected weather.",How to Choose an Off‐Season Winter Travel Destination3," Many large cities—especially those with pleasant summers—may be relatively tourist-free during the off-season winter months. If you’re looking to visit a cultural city in a time when it won’t be crowded, think about visiting Las Vegas in the winter. The scorching hot summers will have cooled down, and you’ll be able to enjoy your time on the strip and nearby neighborhoods without the level of tourists you’d see in summer.


Several other cities worth visiting in the winter off-season are located in the south: Miami, Tampa, Orlando, Atlanta, Savannah, etc. Southern cities—and the South in general—will have more temperate weather during the winter.

, The British coasts are beautiful (e.g. the cliffs of Dover) and crowded during the summer, but host fewer tourists in the winter months. With an off-season visit, you can still participate in popular activities—such as birdwatching—but without the crowds you’d find during summer months.As long as you’re in Britain during the winter, you could expand your travel plans to include destinations including cities like London and Liverpool, or travel up into the north of England and Scotland.
Although you may experience cold temperatures in northern regions, you likely will have few other tourists to contend with, and will be able to have a more local, authentic cultural travel experience.

, Summer-specific travel destinations will typically have dramatically different weather during the off season than during tourist season. You’ll need to do your research ahead of time, to see if typically warm climates become unbearably cold, snowy, or rainy during the wintry off season.If possible, purchase travel insurance when traveling during off-season months. Even if weather is routinely hot and pleasant during the winter season, off-season travel to the same location could include blizzards, freezing rain, or other unexpected weather. Travel insurance will protect belongings that become damaged due to weather. Contact your main insurance provider (e.g. your house or car insurance provider) and ask if they provide travel insurance, or can recommend a company which does.

Visit Europe in months other than June, July, and August.,
Think in opposites for the Southern Hemisphere.,
Visit Africa during the Northern Hemisphere’s summer.",How to Choose an Off‐Season Winter Travel Destination4," Peak tourist season in Europe will render popular destinations overcrowded and coincides with unpleasantly warm summer weather. Some destinations popularly visited in the winter months—especially warmer destinations in southern Europe, such as Italy, Greece, and Spain—can be equally pleasant in the spring and fall months, when crowds have died down and many hotels offer discounted fares.If you have specific European destinations you’d like to visit (e.g. museums, restaurants, vineyards, or historical sites), make sure to check online beforehand to see if the destinations are still open in the off season., Seasons are reversed between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres: summer in the Northern occurs during winter in the Southern. This means that during the Northern off season, you can visit Southern Hemisphere destinations during the peak of their winter. This increases the range of travel opportunities you can take advantage of during the off season.


Southern-hemisphere destinations, including Australia and New Zealand, can be visited relatively inexpensively during their off season (summer in the Northern Hemisphere).These destinations may be quite cold when you visit, naturally—although you’ll mostly be at risk for rainstorms., If you visit an African destination—for example, South Africa—during the months of May through September, you’ll be arriving in the middle of the Southern-Hemisphere winter. However, this is a good time to visit sub-Saharan Africa, especially if you plan to spend time outdoors in the natural world. The cooler temperatures will mean fewer tourists.If you choose to visit Africa, you will be able to find highly discounted rates in wilderness lodges, and travel with tour groups (including those giving safari-like photography tours) for relatively cheaply. Considering checking out the deals offered by Kensington Tours or Adventures in Africa during (northern) summer months.

Many Western countries have widespread Wi-Fi, and you can sometimes pay extra for a local micro-SIM card.


Download a Wi-Fi Finder application before you leave home. This will allow you to find locations that have free Wi-Fi for easy access while you travel. Check near your hotel, airport and more.;
, You will want a good amount of applications, documents and content to be stored on it. The 32 and 64 gigabyte options are the best choices.

, It is a good idea to keep them open long enough after landing so that the iPad can latch on to your location. Controlling the amount of power you use is essential if you are often away from a charging station.

, In 2011, the TSA does not require you to remove it.

, This is best done to avoid any syncing problems 10 minutes before you leave. It's best to do any cleaning up or changing 1 to 2 days before to avoid any technical difficulties that may arise.

, If you choose to do this away from home, you may be at the mercy of slow Internet connection, and you may use up precious battery life. Set them up to download overnight so you can be ready when you don't have an Internet connection in flight.

, Many airline websites run their check-in pages with Flash, which is not compatible with the iPad. If this is the case, you will need to find another way to check in early.

, Download the Dropbox application before your trip, so that you can keep all of your work documents in ""the cloud"" and download them when you have an Internet connection. Download those documents that you will need directly onto the iPad in anticipation for a lack of Internet mid-flight.


If you work in Microsoft Office, you can download the Documents to Go app to make sure you are compatible on your Apple product.
Many people suggest ""batch scheduling"" of work on the iPad. When you don't have an Internet connection, you may be more inclined to use the iPad to work rather than surf online.

, Just like choosing the perfect carry-on suitcase, passport book or walking shoes, iPad accessories can increase the effectiveness of the iPad. With the right tools, you may be able to replace your laptop completely.


Buy an iPad keyboard, if you plan to work or email extensively on your trip. While the iPad's touch screen keyboard may be ideal for social media, like Facebook and Twitter, it is difficult to write a document or a travel log abroad. Look for a keyboard that is built in to a case and stand or a silicon keyboard that is less fragile and rolls away easily into your carry-on.
Bring a wall plug to charge your iPad. This is especially important if you do not plan to bring a computer. Research whether or not you need an adapter before leaving home and purchase one, if you do not think you can find an Apple store where you are going.
Buy an iPad case that is also a stand and doesn't draw too much attention. iPads already attract attention, so just like a diamond ring or a wad of cash, a bright red case flashes an announcement at potential thieves that you have something worth stealing.
Bring a set of headphones that contain a microphone. This can help you to talk on video chat applications while abroad.
Buy a headphone splitter, if you have a traveling companion. You can both watch content or listen to music while you are on a flight.
Buy a camera connection kit and SD card. Load the SD card with movies that can be transferred directly to your iPad with the kit whilst on the road.

Spending some time to choose a budget-friendly country with exciting animals will pay back in dividends! You’ll both save money and have a great time.


For example, if seeing a lion is on the top of your bucket list, make sure you go to one of the six countries where you can actually see them. While you can find lions in Botswana, perhaps South Africa would be a better pick since it is less expensive.;
, Researching what African countries are the most budget friendly will pay off in dollars. Choosing smartly doesn’t mean having to give up any aspects of the experience. Southern Africa has some of the most affordable options with cheaper park entrance fees.Botswana, for example, is one of the most expensive countries for booking safaris so it would be better to choose a cheaper option in South Africa., Driving your own four wheel drive vehicle through national parks will be an adventure all on its own! Look for parks that have well-maintained roads that are easily driveable. Foregoing a paid guide will save you some big bucks.

Kruger National Park in South Africa is highly recommended for going on a safari without a guide.A benefit to self-guided safaris is that you can set your own pace.If you worry about safety when doing a self-guided tour, you can always hire a company that follows you with a support vehicle. This will be more expensive than the fully self-guided tour, but will put your mind at ease and still be less expensive than a guided safari., Booking your trip during the wet season of your chosen country will help ensure lower airfares. Go at the beginning of the wet season before the grass grows too tall. Just make sure to pack your rain jacket!Check the wet season for your specific destination as they happen at different times throughout the continent. South Africa’s wet season, which lasts from May through September, makes for a great deal since a large portion of South Africa during this time is actually not rainy!
Wet seasons in East Africa do correspond with the rain and are from March through June and October through December., As tempting as it may be to stretch yourself thin by visiting multiple countries in a single visit, choose the one country that offers the most and go there. This will help cut down on airline costs and, as a bonus, allow you to get to know a single location well. You can rent a car and have fun driving around seeing the country!

The more spaces in your car you fill, the cheaper the cost will be for everyone., During low or shoulder seasons, the period between low and high travel seasons, many lodges will cut their costs reducing rates by about 20%-30%., Booking your accommodations nearly a year ahead of time can work to your advantage since some properties offer specials for advance bookings. On the other hand, if you book a place last minute you might just snap up unsold rooms that lodges are looking to get rid of at a discount price.If you decide to risk a last minute booking, you should be prepared to camp if you cannot reserve a lodge space., Instead of staying in a luxurious lodge with loads of amenities, consider pitching that tent yourself! Add to the sense of adventure by getting down and dirty with nature, while not adding significantly to your costs. Camping also allows you to cook your own meals, which will cut down on costs of lodge dining., Are you not quite cut out for camping, but can’t afford $1,000/night luxury lodges? No need to worry since there are budget lodges available. You can usually dine a la carte in budget lodges to reduce food costs., Instead of staying within the boundaries of your chosen park, book a place on the outskirts and then drive in. These accommodations located further out will save you a pretty penny or two., Avoiding big chains will help drive down those costs. Plus you’ll be supporting the local economy by staying in smaller, owner-operated lodges. , Want to score cheap accommodations and get an educated outlook as a bonus?

Go to a clinic.,
Expect feelings of culture shock.,
Anticipate homesickness.,
Cope with stressors.",How to Travel with Mental Illness," Travel can be stressful by itself, and the stress of physical, emotional, and social changes can affect pre-existing emotional disorders.Before you make travel plans, know that conditions can reappear or become exacerbated with travel.


It’s also possible for people pre-disposed to certain disorders (such as having a strong genetic link) to experience the emergence of a disorder while traveling.Be aware of your family history and personal history before planning a trip.;
, If you fear having an episode or crisis situation, look into buying travel insurance and medical evacuation insurance. Ensure you declare any and all existing conditions.If you are involved in an emergency situation and require airlifting, this can be covered under this insurance. You can choose from many options for insurance depending on your needs.


Check with your insurance provider to see what options you may have involving mental health while traveling., If you are scared to fly or have a fear of airplanes, many major airlines provide courses to help with this.If you suffer from anxiety related to travel or planes, use some coping strategies for the worry and anxiety. Ask yourself, “Will worrying help me solve this?”


Instead of using worry to run away from unpleasant emotions, embrace the emotions you feel, even if they feel unpleasant.Learn to live with uncertainty. Ask yourself, “Can I live with the small chance that something bad will happen to me, even if it’s highly unlikely it will happen?”, Before traveling, set up an appointment and discuss your travel plans with your mental health professional. Have a mental health screening prior to your trip done by a mental health professional and not at a travel clinic, as travel clinics are not trained in mental health treatment.Consult with your mental health professional if you are in a difficult emotional or mental state. If your mental health is unstable or you recently changed medications, you may want to delay your trip.

, If it is a short-term trip, take enough medications to last at least the duration of the trip, if not more. If you have long-term travels, ask your physician whether your medications are purchasable overseas and readily available.


Have written prescriptions of your medications, as some countries do not allow psychotropic medications without a prescription. Ideally, have it translated into the native language of the country you are visiting.Not all countries will have the medications you need while you travel. Check with a country’s embassy or a reputable health clinic about obtaining prescription refills while abroad., If you take medication for mental health, consider checking any possible drug interactions. That way, if you fall ill and need medical treatment, you can know up front if there are medications you may need to avoid. Medical practitioners abroad may be unfamiliar with your prescription or unaware of potential interactions with foreign medications.


Those with mental health issues should avoid the medication mefloquine, which is used to treat Malaria. It can have potential side effects that include neuropsychiatric consequences., Know your itinerary, modes of transportation, characteristics of cities and the nature of your trip.While many things can be unpredictable during travel, the more you are aware of your trip, the more peace of mind you can have. Gathering information can eliminate some of the unpredictability of travel and ensure a sense of ease.


Before you leave for your trip, think about what potential risks may exist on your trip, and how you will deal with them. For instance, if you take meds, put them in your carry-on bag in case your checked baggage gets lost.
If you don’t like the idea of not having an international phone, buy a SIM card so you can place local calls while abroad.

, A lack of sleep can contribute to problems with mental health.This can be more relevant while traveling because of heightened stress and adjustment. If you start to have mental health problems while traveling, make sure you start getting regular restful sleep.


If hotels or hostels are loud, consider taking some earplugs. You may also want something to cover your eyes if it becomes unusually bright in your room in the mornings or at night.

, While on your trip, take some time to exercise. Exercise can reduce and prevent stress, which can be especially important while traveling with mental health diagnoses.It can be hard to find a gym while traveling, but you don’t need to lift weights or use a treadmill to exercise. Instead, spend some time learning dances, go on a walk or a hike, rent a bicycle and tour your surroundings, or find a popular sport to play.


The maximum benefit from exercise happens when you exercise 30 or more minutes most days, but do what you can when you travel.If you have the option of taking a taxi or walking, choose to walk.

, Think about who you will be traveling with and if someone can help you if you have a health crisis. Also consider the access you may have to receiving support from friends and family back home.


You may want to download a phone or video application for your phone or computer to connect with friends and family back home. You may want someone back home to check in with each week, like a parent or family member, that can help you monitor your mental health.

, If you are struggling with mental health challenges while traveling, go to a hospital or clinic. Depending on your trip, you may have to find a clinic that your insurance covers (if within your own country) or find a clinic that treats mental health disorders.


If you do go to a clinic abroad, realize that cultural differences may exist in mental health treatment. You may need an interpreter to express your needs for you.Check with an embassy to find mental health services if you plan to travel to a foreign country., If you’re somewhere with an unfamiliar language and/or culture, you may experience “culture shock” and struggle with language barriers and cultural differences. It can be hard to adjust to a different way of life, different foods, transportation, and surrounding sights. Interacting with people from a different culture can be difficult, too; you may find yourself offending someone or becoming offended because different cultures interact differently.


Try to find out as much as you can about the social norms of places you will be visiting before you go. For example, do people shake hands when they meet, prefer not to make too much eye contact, or avoid certain topics of conversation? Are there any unusual foods or traditions that you might be expected to try?
Cultural information is often available in travel guides, or you can ask someone who lives in the country you will be visiting.

, Especially if you’re somewhere for a length of time, many people become homesick while traveling. You may miss friends and family, or miss familiar foods and activities. Homesickness and isolation can deepen feelings of depression.


If you feel homesick, remind yourself that you are on an adventure. Home is waiting for you, but enjoy what’s in front of you each day as you travel.

, Even though you may prepare well for your trip, there will likely be moments of stress (trying to catch a flight or a bus, electronics not working, food poisoning). Before leaving on your trip, know ways the deal with stress.Prepare your travel bags with things that can help, like a stress ball or a journal you can write in.


If you don’t know how you cope with stress, try different ways before you leave for your trip, and practice before you leave. Think of things you can do while traveling: for instance, you can go on a walk, spend time in nature, call a friend, light a candle, listen to music or read a book."

Be Nice, Even When Everything Goes Downhill!",How to Be Clear and Decisive when Using a Travel Agent," Try not to walk into an agency and say "" I want to go _______ sometime in April, May, or June..."" This is the surest way to get onto your agent's bad side! The programs that are used to find your all inclusive vacation/flight/train tickets require your agent to enter ONE date--each time a new date is suggested they must once again wade through all of the results to find something that you may like. In short: try to find a date range of four days to a week that work for you and your traveling companion(s) and try to stick to it.;
, If you want to backpack Europe it is not necessary to bring a day-by-day itinerary to your agent, but having an idea of the city(s) that you want to visit is key. If your only requirements are a beach, a beer, and a cheap fare, let them know. Also, after your agent asks you questions s/he will almost always suggest a destination to you if they think that it is more suiting to your tastes. For example, someone who walks into an agency asking for Mazatlan has quite a few options--but if you are looking for clear water and copious amounts of diving, then your agent will most likely suggest Cozumel or Hawaii as a more suitable destination. If you honestly have no idea where you want to go, call the agency at least ten minutes ahead and try to schedule an appointment with an agent before coming in. This will allow the agent a little bit of prep time to best serve you.

, Remember that it is generally not possible to enjoy Champagne on a beer budget. Sometimes great deals do come along, but Last Minute Deals are a thing of the past! LMD's, or as the industry calls them Sell-Offs, are a money loser for companies. You are generally not going to find a genuine five star resort in Cancun at any time of year for less that $900 plus taxes for one week all inclusive. Now, there are exceptions to this, but for the most part in order to get quality you have to pay for it.

, Mosquitoes, hurricanes, travelers diarrhea, poor taxi drivers, lost luggage....these are, unfortunately, a part of travel no matter who you are or who you book with! Everyone gets frustrated, and agents get that (maybe more than you know!) but try to remember that they didn't call the airline and request that your luggage be delayed, nor did they use their magic want to direct mosquitoes/hurricanes/diarrhea towards you. Please try not to swear at them or blame them. They are just trying to help.

, Your friendliness (or lack thereof) towards your agent will directly impact how much your agent will want to help you!

Figure out if a study abroad program is right for you.,
Decide where you want to study abroad.,
Start planning well in advance.,
Find a program.,
Talk to your support system.",How to Use Your Summer Vacation Time Wisely1," It sounds great. But is it a good fit for you? Ask yourself these questions:


Do you like traveling to unfamiliar places?
Are you comfortable being away from friends and family for an extended period of time?
Would you enjoy exploring another culture?

If you answered “yes” to most of these questions, studying abroad may be a terrific choice for you. If you answered “no” to most, you may need more soul searching before you decide. Studying abroad is an exciting and unique opportunity to grow both as a student and as a person. However, it does come with some challenges like being out of your comfort zone and far away from people who you’re close to.;
, There are so many exciting places to choose from that it can be an overwhelming choice. You may want to first narrow down the kind of locale that interests you the most and make your decision from there. For instance, ask yourself: Would you prefer an urban or a rural setting? Do you want to go to an English-speaking location or where they speak a foreign language? Is it important that you be centrally located so that you can spend time on weekends traveling to neighboring cities?To assist you in finding the perfect place, it’s also a good idea to visit some of the study abroad websites to read from fellow student bloggers on what it’s like to visit there.

, You will need to plan at least 6 months, if not 9 months, in advance of your summer vacation. Most programs require that you apply 6 months prior. Having 9 months will give you time to research, find, and apply to a program at your leisure., Once you’ve decided where and when, it’s time to find a program. Since you’re thinking about studying abroad during the summer, then that helps to narrow your choices down somewhat. At this point, it’s important to talk directly with someone from the program you are interested in. From this person, you can learn more about what it offers, the cost and which amenities are or aren’t included such as onsite orientation, airport pickup, housing etc.

, Meet with your academic counselor to discuss with him or her how this program fits in with coursework for the next year and if it meets the same criteria for any of the classes you will be taking next year. If you’re still in high school or in college and your parents are involved in helping you with these kinds of decisions, talk with them about all the details of the program."
"
Think about your goals.,
Use the internet.,
Take advantage of other avenues.",How to Use Your Summer Vacation Time Wisely2," To start the process of finding the right internship, think about the skills you want to learn and the areas you want to explore. Do you love graphic design? Do you want to know what an oceanographer does all day or what scientific research is like? Having clear objectives in your mind will help you find an internship that you can get excited about.For instance, a potential pre-med student can intern in a hospital or a research lab. A business student can volunteer in a public relations or marketing firm. A future environmentalist can work with rangers in a forest.

, Once you know the direction you want to head in, you can start looking for an internship online. Begin by searching for local organizations and businesses in your areas of interest to see if they offer internship programs. There are also large websites that allow you to search for internships at non-profits as well as opportunities in different countries., Using local resources and personal contacts are other terrific ways to find an internship. Visit your school’s career office. Ask your teachers and high school advisor for help. Check with coaches. Find out if friends or family know someone in a field that interests you. You can also find alumni from your school through one of the big networking websites who are employed at one of your preferred companies. Connect with them, and let them know you’re interested in an internship and if they have any advice for you or tips.If there’s a specific organization or company you’d like to intern with, don’t be afraid to contact someone there.

Pinpoint your passion.,
Develop it.,
Establish measurable objectives.,
Reevaluate your progress.",How to Use Your Summer Vacation Time Wisely3," It only makes sense that before you develop it you have to find it first. Ask yourself, what is that you like to do? Or what have you always dreamed of doing? Do you have a favorite hobby that you could turn into your dream job? If you have varied interests or you’re unsure, consider taking an aptitude test. There are a few terrific ones that can help a person to really pinpoint their strengths in given areas. , Once you’ve identified it, spend as much time as possible developing what it is that you really want to explore. If writing screenplays is your passion, work on it. Sign up for a writing group. Ask friends to read and critique your work.If you love photography, get a decent camera and learn how to use it. Then start taking photos – lots of them, far away and close-up. You get the picture. Whatever your passion is, follow it.

, In order to turn your passion into a reality, it’s important to set specific objectives. Many people make daily “to do” lists but that’s not enough. You may have certain steps for each day, but also think about what you want to achieve by the end of the week, month and a year from now. Then set goals to make it happen. Set specific deadlines for yourself, and you will be more likely to reach them., After 4 to 6 weeks, reflect on the progress you’ve made and where you are. Look at the objectives you’ve set, and compare them to where you are on your path. If you’ve met all of them along the way, then congratulate yourself. If you fell behind, then reevaluate.Ask yourself, have you worked hard enough? Should you change something? Or were your goals too big to start with? Be realistic in the process as you take steps towards your passion, and you’re more likely to achieve it."
"
Get a job.,
Volunteer somewhere.,
Take a class.",How to Use Your Summer Vacation Time Wisely4," Starting in the work force early in life can serve many purposes. Some of these include building your resume, earning money and the development of interpersonal and organizational skills. Getting a job is a fairly practical option, and it can’t help but build character., There are plenty of deserving causes that need help and the summer is a perfect time to do it. Whether it’s digging boreholes in Uganda or reading to kids at the local library, the outcome is the same: you’re helping society in a hands-on way. From homeless shelters to hospitals, choose something you care about and give back to the greater good., Once final exams are finished, most students look forward to a long summer break before classes resume again in the fall. However, you may want to consider signing up for a summer class. There are many great reasons to do it. It can help you make up for a course that you didn’t do well in. It could also help if you want to complete a prerequisite class so that you can take a certain class in the fall.Taking a summer class may also give you an advantage in finishing your school program early.
Another terrific benefit, though you need to make sure you really focus, is that the classes are usually shorter.

Tell the child where they are going and why.,
Ask them for input on the trip.,
Rehearse calming techniques with the child.,
Pack the child's medication.,
Bring interactive toys and games.,
Remind the child of the rules and guidelines for travel.,
Arrange for some downtime.,
Look for opportunities for your child to play or get physical activity.,
Let others know about the child’s needs.,
Accept help, when offered.,
Establish a routine once you arrive.,
Do calming exercises if the child acts up.,
Praise the child when they are well behaved.",How to Travel with a Child with ADHD," Children with ADHD can be overwhelmed by sudden changes or shifts in their routine. To prepare the child for the trip, you should let them know where they are going and why they are traveling. You may sit down with them and have a discussion about where they are going to stay and who they are going to visit. This way, they are aware of what is going to happen.For example, you may tell the child, “We are going to visit Aunt Bev in Florida for one week. We are going to stay with Aunt Bev in her house in Tampa. While we’re in Tampa, we’re going to drive to Disney World for a few days and have fun as a family.”;
, You should include the child in the trip planning so they can feel useful and part of the experience. You may ask them what they think about the plan for the trip and if they would like to see anything specific on the trip. Discuss their ideas and try to put one or two of them in the schedule so they feel included.For example, the child may ask if they can go visit a particular location or eat a particular food on the trip. You may then agree to work this activity into the schedule of the trip.
You may also present the child with several options that they can then choose from. For example, you may tell the child that on one day during the trip, they can try rafting or kayaking. You may then ask the child which one they would prefer to do so they feel they have options.

, You should also prepare the child by practicing calming techniques together in the weeks leading up to the trip. You may do deep breathing exercises together or have a calming session before bed where you do a few relaxing yoga moves.


You may also encourage your child to use verbal cues to stay calm and relax in new environments. For example, you may teach your child to say “I am calm” or “Relax” when they start to feel overwhelmed or frustrated.

, If the child with ADHD takes medication for their condition, you should make sure their medication is packed for the trip. You may also get prescriptions for their medication from their doctor so you have it on hand when you are traveling. This will make it easier for you to get the medication when needed during the trip.


You should make sure you have enough medication to last the entire duration of the trip. You may use a pill container that is labeled by day and count out the child's medication so they have enough for each day of the trip.
Make sure to bring the medication in your purse or in a carry-on, not in checked luggage. You don't want to take the chance of lost luggage.

, Children with ADHD can find spending too much down time in a car or a plane frustrating and limiting. You can keep the child occupied by bringing interactive toys and games with you and giving them to the child to play with. This can ensure the child is not idle or feels bored during travel.You may bring interactive games like puzzles, card games, or maze games. You can also pack interactive plush toys and toys that require the child to use their hands, such as silly putty or gel packs.

, You can keep the child on track during travel by reminding them of the rules and guidelines for travel. Do this by gently reminding them to stay calm or focus on their toys if they start to get distracted or agitated. You can also outline the guidelines for traveling if the child starts to get upset.For example, if the child starts to get annoyed or bored, you may say, “Focus on this game” or “Let’s play with this puzzle.”
You can also remind the child of the guidelines for travel by asking, “Is that how we play in the back seat?” or “How do we spend time on the airplane?”

, Having a tight driving schedule or back to back flights may make traveling with your child feel more stressful. To make things easier on yourself and your child, try to arrange for some downtime during your trip.

If you are driving, you might plan to stop halfway through your drive for a long lunch, or pick a rest stop to take a break at once every two hours.
If you are flying, then you might plan on a long layover between one of your flights so that you and your child can get something to eat and relax off of the plane for a while.

, It may help your child to work off some energy if you can find a place for them to play while you are traveling, such as a playground at a park or at a fast food restaurant. If this is not possible, then try walking around with the child, such as by walking around the airport between flights., Do not be ashamed or shy about the child’s needs, especially if you know that with a few small adjustments, the child will be well behaved. Be willing to ask for help from others and get the child the help the need when you are traveling. This could make traveling with the child is less stressful.If you are traveling by plane, you may pull a flight attendant aside and let them know the child is ADHD and needs some extra attention. Some airlines have policies where they give a child with ADHD small jobs on the plane to help them stay occupied during the flight.

, Though you may feel you need to do everything yourself for the child when traveling, you should be willing to accept help when it is offered. Taking on the responsibility of the child can be a lot for one person and sometimes you need help. You should accept help from your partner, other family members, or even friendly strangers when you need it so you do not burnout or get too frustrated with the child.For example, you may accept the help of a friendly stranger sitting next to you and the child on the plane. Or you may ask your partner to assist you with keep the child calm and relaxed when traveling.

, Try to integrate routines into the child’s day right away so they feel more comfortable in their new environment. Put routines in place so the child can ease into being on a trip.For example, you may prepare breakfast for the child in the morning at the same time every day. Or you may set aside some relaxation time once a day so the child has time to chill out and focus on a relaxing activity.
You should also have a routine for giving the child their medication. Try to give the child their medication at the same time or times as you would when you are at home. Keep the medication time consistent every day so the child feels comfortable and gets the medication they need.

, If the child starts to act up on the trip, you should encourage them to do calming exercises. This will help them control their emotions better and be less anxious when they are away from home. You may do the calming exercises with them to support them.For example, if the child starts to get upset in the morning, you may sit together and do deep breathing exercises. Or if the child gets distracted or bored while on a planned outing, you may do a few fun yoga moves together to get them to focus and pay attention.

, You should always reinforce positive behavior in the child using praise, especially when they are out of their element and in a new environment. Use verbal praise to let the child know they are behaving well, such as “Good job!” or “You’ve been really great today.”


You can also reward the child with a special outing on the trip or a satisfying snack to show them that you appreciate their good behavior.

Keep emergency information with you.",How to Avoid Severe Allergic Reactions While Traveling," Knowledge is often the best way to prevent an unpleasant situation like a severe allergic reaction. Checking your destination to see what allergens may be present in the environment, foods, or other elements can help you avoid them and a potential reaction. It can also help you know what types of medications and other precautions to take.Look at the environmental conditions if you have seasonal allergies. Organizations such as the Environmental Protection Agency and local county extensions can provide information on factors such as dominant outdoor allergens and air quality in the United States.Consider things such as cuisine, accommodations, and side trips to determine what types of allergens are present in your destination. For example, if you are traveling in Southeast Asia and are allergic to peanuts, you may want to learn the word for peanuts so you can avoid it in dishes.;
, No matter what your allergy is, talk to your doctor about your travel plans. The doctor can advise you ways to avoid a severe allergic reaction at your destination. They can also provide you with prescriptions for extra medication or emergency doses of epinephrine.Let your doctor know where you are traveling. If you have figured out specific allergens present at your destination, make sure you inform your doctor of these, too.Ask your doctor any questions you may have about preventing a severe reaction. See if you should update your allergy action program to accommodate your travel plans. Your doctor may want to fill out an Anaphylaxis Emergency Action Plan form or write a letter verifying your allergies, medications and any special precautions you may need to take, which can assist with travel accommodations..Say, for example, “Hi Dr. del Toro, I’m getting ready to head to Peru on vacation. I’ll be in the desert, mountains, and a little bit of rain forest. Do you have any suggestions about keeping my allergies at bay while I’m traveling? Do you think it makes sense to double up on medication or carry an epinephrine pen?”

, Your doctor will let you know if you need to take a different dose of your allergy medications during your trip. Check your prescriptions to make sure you have enough and a little bit extra in case of an emergency or losing your meds.Make sure you have 1-2 Epipens, oral steroids, and a rescue inhaler if you suffer from allergic asthma or are at risk of anaphylaxis. Be sure to keep them in the original pharmacy container labeled with your name. Keep only the prescribed medication in each container to avoid confusion while traveling.
Consider packing over the counter topical and/or steroids and antihistamines as a back up to your prescription medications.
Pack your medication supplies in your carry-on luggage in case your luggage gets lost., If you have insurance, contact your representative or agent to see if your policy covers medical care at your destination. In some cases, your policy may pay for doctor's visits or emergency care. Consider purchasing an extra travel policy to cover any severe allergic reaction you may have.Let your insurer know about your allergies and the potential for a severe reaction. Your agent can give you information and tips about navigating medical care with your policy on vacation. Ask if your insurance company offers policies for persons traveling overseas if you are only covered in your home country.Say, for example, “Hello, this is April Harris and I have an insurance policy with you. I’m about to travel to Turks and Caicos and have allergies that have the potential for severe reactions. Will my policy cover medical care when outside of the country? If not, am I able to purchase a travel policy that will cover any potential emergencies?”

, If you are traveling by plane, train, or bus, let the companies with which you’re traveling know in advance about your allergies. In some cases, travel agencies and transportation companies can—or have to—make special accommodation for you and your allergies.Ask for allergy-free meals and snacks if possible. You can also avoid airline food altogether by packing your own snacks and light meals.
Request a buffer zone from other passengers if you have food, animal, or other allergies.

, If you are staying in a hotel, hostel, rental apartment, or even with friends and family, let them know about your allergies. They may have special services, rooms, or other accommodations to help you avoid a severe allergic reaction during your stay.Ask if your accommodations have special rooms friendly to individuals with allergies. See if air conditioning is available, which may also reduce the number of environmental allergens in your room.Request rooms that are non-smoking, mold-free, or pet free. You can also request that snacks and/or beverages not be put in your room., For someone with allergies, the potential for a reaction can lie almost anywhere. This may be from walking around places like markets, in nature, or even a popular restaurant. Having a daily plan can help you avoid allergens and minimize the risk of a severe reaction.Write a detailed daily plan before each morning. This can ensure that you can enjoy yourself without exposing yourself to allergens. For example, break down each day: “Sunday, January 5: Hike from Lauterbrunnen to Wengen. Lunch at restaurant on the Kleine Scheidegg. Train available if grass or pollen causing severe allergies. Wipes to clean off table at restaurant. Train or hike to Grindelwald.”
Allow room for flexibility depending on how you feel. For example, you may find your allergies aren’t really bothering you and can try something you thought you might not be able to do such as a trip to a farm or special restaurant., If you have environmental, smoke, or pet allergies and you notice them where you’re staying, talk to your hosts or staff. They may be able to move your room or provide allergy-free bedding to help minimize the risk of a severe reaction.Remind staff when you check in that you arranged for a special room because of your allergies.For example, “Hello there, I’m Sam Corinthos. I called and made an advance reservation for an allergen-free room because of my severe allergies. I just want to make sure that this is the type of room I have and that there are no pets in rooms near mine.”
Bring your own pillow(s) if you are allergic to dust mites or other environmental allergens. This may reduce your exposure and minimize the risk of a severe reaction.

, If you are traveling in warmer climates, turn on the air conditioning in your room. Closing the window will also help.Consider traveling in vehicles with air conditioning to reduce the amount of allergens to which you’re exposed.Use a nasal spray or gel to reduce allergens in your nose if you don’t have access to air-conditioning.Wear an allergy mask or head to the beach, which can also reduce the number of allergens to which you’re exposed.

, Some people have food allergies that can lead to severe reactions including anaphylaxis. If you have this, it’s important to make sensible food choices. Ask questions about ingredients if you’re unsure of something. This can minimize the risk of exposure to allergens as well as a severe reaction.Keep a list of foods to which you’re allergic. Ask restaurant staff or your hosts if the food has any of these ingredients or has touched a surface with them. If you’re traveling abroad keep a list of foods in the local language so you can let people know what you need to avoid.
Consider packing some extra food and snacks in case you can’t get a meal.Avoid any foods of which you’re unsure. It’s better to be safe than sorry. For example, if you’re allergic to peanuts, you might want to choose grilled fish and vegetables instead of a coconut curry.
Carry an Epipen with you at all times to handle potential severe reactions to food., No matter what your allergy is, any surface you contact may expose you to an allergen that causes a severe reaction. Wiping down these surfaces may limit your exposure and help you avoid an allergic reaction.Wipe down surfaces such as tray tables, dining tables, and seats with a cleansing wipe. If these are not available or you forget them, simply wiping a surface off may limit your exposure to allergens that cause severe reactions.

, You can control a lot of situations that may expose to you allergens that cause severe reactions. But you can’t always control everything, especially when you’re traveling. Planning for the unexpected can help you avoid or promptly deal with a severe allergic reaction. Carrying injectable epinephrine, such as an Epipen, can add a measure of security should you have a severe reaction., Even if you prepared for the unexpected, carry a list of emergency information with you at all times. You should include your medications, allergies, and the phone numbers or locations of local doctors. This can ensure that other travelers or a doctor provide you proper and prompt care if you have a severe allergic reaction.Keep a list of your medications and any medical allergies you may have.
Research which medicines may be available at your destination and where you can purchase them if necessary. Equivalent medications may be available without a prescription, but under a different name.
Have a list of phone numbers for your doctor, local medical staff, your insurance and emergency contacts such as family members.If you are traveling abroad, include the information of the embassy or local consulate in your destination."

Decide if you want to spend all of your time in a single country, a single continent, or if you truly want to travel over the entire globe. It can be helpful to start your international travel in a location you’ve been to before, and branch out further from there.Certain countries (especially in Asia) can be less expensive for Western travelers, although they may lack some of the amenities that we’ve grown used to.
Certain regions are also better set up to accommodate tourists and travelers, by offering hostels and other accommodations. (For example, New Zealand is well set up for travelers, while Japan is less so.)However, if you’re looking for a more adventurous travel experience and want to avoid places most international travelers visit, you may want to plan to visit less accommodating destinations.;
, Before you jump on a plane, train, or ship, you’ll need to have at least a rough idea of where you’ll be going and how long you’ll spend at each destination. It can be easy for a worldwide vacation to take more time than anticipated, so try to set out as specific of a schedule as possible before you leave. Alternately, some people prefer to leave their travel open-ended, and to only plan one week and one destination into the future.How long do you want your trip to be? Your schedule will be dramatically different if you want to travel the world for a month, 6 months, or a full year.
Plan ahead for how your world travel will fit into your life back home. Are you going to quit your job, or will your employer allow you to work while you travel?

, Do your homework about histories and current events in each country you plan to visit when you travel across the world. This will help you be aware of any local customs you need to follow and any conflicts or dangerous areas of the country you should avoid.


If you know any individuals in a country you’ll be traveling too (even if they’re only the friend of a friend), get in touch and ask them about any disruptive political or cultural events that may interfere with your travel plan.

, The expense of round-the-world travel is a major deterrent for many people. In addition to the plane tickets and other travel fees, you will need to pay for food and lodging, both of which quickly become expensive.Plan this out (as much as possible) ahead of time, so that you can limit your spending and will not be unpleasantly surprised by your expenditures once your trip has ended.Start planning well ahead of time and decide how you’re going to fund your trip. For example, if you’re going to pay for everything out of a savings account, you may need to work extra hours for months on end to fund your travel.
A general rule of thumb is to try not to exceed $50 a day (not including air fare.)Avoid expensive travel options within a country; travel by foot or local transportation whenever possible, and keep an eye out for budget-friendly airline or train options.
Unless eating in restaurants when you travel is important to you, avoid them. Restaurants quickly become expensive, and you can buy groceries and cook your meals for much less money.Put a cap on your spending: an amount that you absolutely cannot exceed, and make sure that your budget doesn’t put you over that amount.

, If you have the time and interest, you may be able to travel extremely inexpensively by either uniting your travel goals and your employment, or by taking a few cost-cutting measures for lodging.


Work for an international teaching organization. Operations like the EKIP Program allow you to teach English overseas for an extended period of time, often with the majority of your expenses paid.Stay at hostels when you travel.Hostels are inexpensive, generally safe environments to spend a few nights in while you’re traveling.
Work on a cruise ship. These are built to travel, and you’ll be generating an income at the same time.

, It would be a huge undertaking to learn the language of each country you want to visit when you travel the world, but you can make traveling easier by memorizing a few key phrases in each country’s language to help you communicate with the locals and get around. Learn how to:


Greet and thank someone.
How to agree and disagree (a polite “yes” or “no).
How to ask how much money something costs.
How to ask where a place is located (the bathroom, the library, a restaurant, the airport or train station, etc.).

, You will likely have the option of traveling by ship, train, or airplane. All of these methods will have multi-country ticket plans. Price out around-the-world ticket packages for the countries you want to visit so you can choose the most economical form of travel.


Although financial saving may be your main goal, also consider the speed and safety of the methods of travel you are considering.

, Traveling to other countries requires you to have a valid passport. Planning to start traveling the world will be much easier and more efficient if you have this well ahead of time.


The passport application process can take 4 to 6 weeks to complete, so give yourself a few months before you plan to travel in order to acquire this documentation.
If you do not have a passport, the best place to look for instruction is online. There are online forms you can fill out to receive your passport.You can also fill out and submit the passport paperwork at your local post office.

, Certain countries will require you to have a travel visa before entering, while others only need to see a passport. (For example, American citizens do not need a travel visa to enter the EU.) The document will specify your reason for being in a country, and how long you anticipate staying.In addition, different countries have distinct visas, and you will need a separate visa for each visa-requiring country you travel to.


Some visas last for more time than others. Check before you start traveling. You’ll need to know if your visa lasts for five years, three years, or only one year.
Check the U.S. State Department website to see if you need a travel visa for your intended destination. The State Department can also provide the paperwork you’ll fill out to apply for a visa.

, Although this is not a glamorous part of the travel process, it will benefit you immensely.Foreign countries may have different diseases from those you could contract in your native country, so it’s best to inform your doctor of every region you’ll be traveling to and ask which immunizations they recommend.


Be sure to heed any travel health warnings in the countries you’ll be visiting. Always check local and national health warnings before traveling to a new region.
Be sure to pack any prescription or over-the-counter medications you need, since these could be difficult to acquire overseas.

, You should bring only essentials in your luggage. Heavy luggage and multiple bags will only weight you down and increase the cost of your travel.


Bring sturdy, comfortable shoes and clothing that can be layered to accommodate changing climates.
Leave expensive electronics and valuable jewelry at home.

, Getting sick when traveling in other countries will be time-consuming and take the fun out of the adventure, so take care of your health before you leave and when you travel. When you’re traveling, follow these general health tips:


Get plenty of sleep, especially if you’re often changing time zones.
Avoid drinking too much alcohol, this will dehydrate you and can lead to poor decisions.
Drink plenty of purified water. Unless you’ve checked ahead of time, the tap water at your destination may not be as clean and safe to drink as your local water at home.
Eat a somewhat balanced diet. In unfamiliar countries, it can be tempting to eat an unhealthy diet (or even one comprised of junk food). Keep yourself healthy by eating regular, balanced meals.
Wash your hands often.

, Most domestic cell phones (i.e. the phone you currently use) will build up exorbitant fees if you use them internationally. You can be a world traveler and still stay in touch with family and friends by purchasing a universal cell phone that will work all over the world.Before you look into an international cell phone, check with your current cell provider—they may be able to add an international calling plan for an additional monthly charge.Depending on the number of countries you’ll be traveling in, and the duration of your stay(s), it may be more practical to rent an international phone in each country, rather than buying a single phone for your entire trip.International cell phones sometimes require that you buy separate SIM cards or recharge it with more minutes, but will keep you in constant contact with familiar people.

, A great way to do this is by keeping in touch with the people you miss the most.Whether through a phone call, a Skype or FaceTime session, or sending a postcard, communicating with your friends and loved ones will help bridge the distance and keep you from feeling homesick.

Determine how much money you have.,
Compare prices on the major components of your trip.,
Draft a preliminary budget.,
Book your reservations.,
Time your trip for low costs, if you can.,
Travel with friends or family.,
Avoid unplanned extras.,
Dine on a budget.,
Use cash.",How to Travel on a Tight Senior Budget," Before making any plans at all, you need to spend a little time examining your finances so you can form an idea of how much money you have for the trip.


Consider any money you may have set aside for traveling. In addition, consider regularly putting aside some money for travel. This can be a very small portion of your fixed income or of a part-time job.
Account for any incidental or recreational money you may have built into your normal day-to-day budget. This money can be diverted to traveling.
Avoid using your savings or fixed income that is earmarked for day-to-day living expenses. You’ll need this money to live on.
Don’t accumulate debt just to travel, unless you must for some sort of family or social obligation like a wedding, funeral, or another similar event.
If you simply don’t have the money to travel for a family obligation, let your family member know. For instance, say something like “I’m sorry I can’t attend Josh’s wedding, but I’m on a really tight fixed income.”;
, After figuring out how much money you have, you should spend a good deal of time researching how much major elements like lodging and travel will cost.


Use travel websites like Travelocity, Expedia, and Priceline.
Call hotels, car rental companies, and airline companies to check their prices.
After a decent search, you should have a good idea of if your available funds will pay for the major components of your trip. If they won’t, you may have to reconsider your trip or shop around for even lower prices., Once you’ve researched major components of your trip, you need to put together a preliminary budget. Your preliminary budget will detail the cost of major expenses such as travel, lodging, food, and recreational expenses.


Include the total cost of lodging. This should include the quotes you gained from popular travel websites, but also associated costs such as taxes.
Include the total cost of travel. If you’re traveling by car, you should include the cost of an oil change and gasoline if you’re using your own car. If you’re using a rental car, include the cost of the rental and gasoline. In addition, consider toll charges if you’ll be traveling on toll roads.
Include the cost of food. Take the opportunity to plan how many full dine-out meals you will eat. Plan to eat mostly food you prepare yourself, whether that is cold cut sandwiches or egg or tuna salad.
Include the cost of recreational expenses. Depending on the type of trip, you may spend money on recreation. If so, try to estimate how much this will cost.
Build in 10% to 20% extra (in total) for any overages you may experience beyond your estimates., After drafting an initial budget, you’ll need to book your reservations. Booking your reservations should be relatively easy since you already researched what you want to book.


Use whatever service or company quoted you the lowest price when you compared prices.
Booking in advance is important, as prices may rise the closer you get to the day you need to travel or use lodging., Another way to travel on a tight senior budget is to time your trips so that you can take advantage of low seasonal costs and other discounts. By doing this, you’ll avoid crowds and save money.


Most of the time, booking early will save you money. However, there are some instances – like booking hotels in the off season – when you might be able to get discounts for booking last minute. This will vary on location, so do some internet digging to see if it applies to your trip.
If you’re planning a trip where you’ll need to book lodging, plan it to avoid peak season. This is true for renting cabins in the mountains or houses on the beach during the summer. Instead, plan your beach trip to Panama City, Florida in October, when it’s still relatively warm, but when prices will be low., You should also consider traveling with friends or family to save money. This could save money since you may be able to travel together or get group or bulk rates on lodging or recreational activities.


One of the easiest ways to save money when traveling with others is on ground transportation. For instance, if you’re driving a long distance to your destination, consider taking one car or renting a van or sports utility vehicle.
If you’re traveling with a large group, inquire about group rates for lodging or group discounts for destinations like Disney World.
Make sure the people you plan to travel with are on the same page as you and understand your monetary limitations. While you don’t want them to foot the bill for you, you do want them to realize that you may not be able to do everything they do., Experienced travelers will tell you that the easiest way to break a travel budget is to splurge on unexpected extras. As a result, you should:


Avoid high-priced dining out.
Avoid detours on road trips that may increase your fuel expenses or prolong your trip.
Avoid upgrading your seat on a plane or your room in a hotel., One of the biggest challenges of staying on budget is eating. Thus, you need to take several steps so that your food budget doesn’t break your entire budget. You can do this by:


Packing sandwiches or other homemade food whenever you can. Bring snacks, like chips, fruit, and more.
Avoiding eating places where you need to tip a server. Instead, try healthy options at fast food restaurants, or self-serve restaurants like Panera or Chipotle., Another good way to stay on budget is to use cash to pay for your transactions. By using cash, you’ll make sure that you’re only using money that is set aside for a specific activity. In the end, you’ll help yourself avoid the pitfalls of using a credit card – an action that can rapidly increase the costs of a trip.


Withdraw all the spending money you will need for a trip. This excludes costs for transportation, lodging, and other major expenses. Book these on a credit card or debit card.
Estimate the cost of your daily expenses and take the corresponding amount of cash and put it into an envelope labeled with that date.
Include the pre-estimated 10% to 20% overages in each envelope so if you experience higher-than-expected costs, you’ll have the money to cover them.
Place the envelopes in a secure location until you use them.
Do not use money you have not budgeted out for a specific day or a specific item."

Explain where you're going.,
Pack some essentials.,
Let them pack.,
Avoid fights.,
Play games.,
Take breaks.,
Let them sleep.",How to Travel Long Distances in a Car with Young Children," While it may sound like a good idea to keep the children guessing, it will actually make them even more bored because there's nothing for them to look forward too. Instead, explain to them where you're going, how far away it is and what you're going to do there. This should give them an idea of how much fun you will have once you arrive. You can explain that if they do not behave on the way, they will not be allowed to do certain things. Be sure to stick to your word though or they will take advantage of your kindness.;
, If you're going to a hotel or campsite, suitcases are a must. If you're just going sightseeing, a large backpack or messenger bag should be large enough to hold some essentials. If you arrive at your destination and you're missing one of these items, you could find yourself in a spot of trouble. These items include:


Food.
Drinks.
Nappies/diapers.
Baby milk.
First aid kit.
A bag to vomit in.
Small cushions to sleep on.
Spare batteries for toys.

, Now that they know where you're going and how long it will take to get there, they probably want to bring their favourite toys and games along with them. Don't tell them to leave everything at home, let them bring at least two toys so they can have fun along the way. If you're OK with it, let them have a backpack full of their own things. Keep the backpack small enough to fit in the car and help them choose toys that'll fit in the backpack. If they want to bring a 6 feet (1.8 m) action figure, try to convince them to bring a book instead.

, If two of your children fight a lot, try to sit them apart from each other. This can be done by sitting the oldest child in the front and the youngest child in the back, sitting an adult in between the two or sitting another sibling in between them. This will, hopefully, avoid any fights between the two siblings and keep everyone happy. Alternatively, you can try to get the two siblings on talking terms before the big journey by getting them to play games together or taking them for a smaller drive once in a while so they get used to sitting next to each other.

, Nothing is more fun than playing I-spy on a long car journey. It can help pass some time and keep everybody happy at the same time. Who knows, the kids might end up playing one game for the whole journey. Simply because you have a headache, don't discourage them from playing their favourite games with their siblings or friends. You can maybe ask them to keep it down a little while explaining that you have a headache but still allow them to continue playing. Also, make sure the game they're playing does not require too much movement (like tag, for example) as this can distract the driver and sometimes get a little bit violent.

, When everybody is tired, hungry and sweaty, their moods can start to go south. You can't really blame them, but you can take breaks. Find somewhere to park up, eat a sandwich and refill your car's petrol. Sometimes just some fresh air can make everybody happy again, especially if the scenery is pretty to look at or interesting. Keep the kids together at all time. If there is a picnic area with some benches, make sure that everyone stays seated until you've finished eating. You don't want to be running after your child so they can finish their food. You can, however, allow them to play a game like tag while you relax. Make sure they know how far they're allowed to go and what areas are out of bounds.

, If your kids are tired, there's no reason to force them to stay awake. When they start yawning, give them a cushion or a pillow each and let them fall asleep. This will also give you some peace and quiet and will make the time pass quickly for the children. If one child is not tired, don't force them to sleep. They will probably fall asleep after everybody else has dozed off and there is nobody to play with anymore. If you get tired from driving, feel free to swap with another adult and do the same. You should have brought a pillow for everyone so everyone can sleep at once. If you forgot to bring enough pillows, something soft like a scrunched up jumper can be a nice alternative.

Catch a bus.,
Take a plane.",How to Travel in Kenya," If you are within a city, you can map out your route and walk to your destination provided it is not very far. If you don't have to pay to travel, don't. If you are worried about your safety (depending on what part of the country you are in) then you can opt for other means of transport.;
, They are a recent addition to the means of transport within the country. They are also popular in many of the neighbouring countries. They are cheap and get you around towns easily and quickly. Be sure to ask for a helmet and when travelling and a safety jacket for night-time travel.

, This is a very small taxi that runs on three wheels. It will also have a tarp covering it for protection against the elements. It is much cheaper than an ordinary taxi but often a little more expensive to take than buses or minivans. It is most often used for the same purpose and does not have a set route.

, This is the most preferred means of travel by foreigners. The taxi will get you wherever you want to go but will cost a lot more than other means of travel. If you are travelling in a group, this is a very efficient method since you can divide the cost among yourselves. A taxi will always have the standard yellow line marked along the sides of its body.

, The minibus is the most common means of transport within Kenya cities. Sometimes, there are minivans that will take you across the country as well. Within the cities, the fare of minivans may change so it is always good to ask for the price before boarding.


It would be even better to ask your guide to tell you the fares before hand so you will be prepared. If your destination is along the way but you do not know where, ask the conductor to let you know when you have arrived. They will be more than willing to help.

, Buses will not be marked by a yellow line but will have the name of their company printed on the side. Once again, if you do not know where you are going or which bus to board, ask the conductor and they will be able to guide you. Ask for the fares before you board. At designated bus stops, the conductor will call out the fare but it is always prudent to double-check.Some buses can also take you across the country or even across the border into another East African country.

Try to drink or brush from bottled or boiled water only. It is even possible that the bottled water you buy may be spurious!
If in doubt, boil the water for 10 minutes yourself. This will purify it.
Prefer bottled carbonated drinks (soda) or canned fruit juices to unsafe water.
Avoid ice if you are not sure of the water used to prepare it.
Eat freshly cooked, warm food. Avoid food which was cooked the previous day.
Do not ask for pork. It is prohibited in Islam. All meat served is halal (which can usually satisfy kosher requirements).
Avoid street food. Most street food is prepared in unhygienic conditions and can lead to bacterial or amoebic infections.;
, Many people have strong views about politics, specially the western view of the world and it is best to avoid controversial discussions or arguments.

, Although uncommon, you may be unknowingly talking to a person who may not take kindly to even the slightest disrespect (in his/her view) shown to Islam.

, Since many Pakistani men wear a beard, growing one before travelling can help you blend with the local crowd and not easy to identify or target. This is specially applicable for the northern and western tribal areas like FATA and Baluchistan.

, Always cover your body completely in public, especially if you are a woman. However, the dress rules are not as restrictive as in fundamentalist countries like Saudi Arabia, Iran or Kuwait.


Shorts, above the knee skirts, sleeveless dresses, tight or braless T-shirts or a low neck showing cleavage are deemed to be disrespectful according to the Islamic culture.
A hijab (head scarf) is useful. There is no necessity however for a burqa (face covering).
If possible, buy local clothes on your arrival in Pakistan. They are indeed quite stylish and comfortable if you stick to cottons.
If you visit a mosque or a home, leave your shoes at the gate. In the mosque, remember to wash your hands, feet and face before you pray.

, It is important for men to shake hands only if the woman initiates, not attempt to kiss an unknown woman on the cheek or hug as a form of greeting, common in the west and for men to keep out of women designated areas & vice versa. Pakistan has much greater gender segregation compared to the west with most homes having two living rooms, for male guests and female. Pre-puberty girls are exempted from this classification., Air travel by far is the safest and the most comfortable, trains being the worst. Avoid long intercity road journeys. If you must travel by road, try to choose reliable taxis from your hotel instead of hailing one from the road. Activate your GPS map to know your route. Most people you visit or meet will try to offer you a ride. Not all may be trustworthy., Most incidents of terrorism occur at crowded places like mosques, schools, sports arenas, markets and public gatherings. Avoid visiting places which have a large number of people. These kind of places are also infested with pick-pockets and petty thieves., Credit cards are not as widely accepted as in other parts of the world. United States dollars are the most widely accepted foreign currency, followed by Euro, British Pounds and UAE Dirhams. Always exchange at an official place like a bank or an authorized money changer rather than in the street (even if the offered exchange rate is higher) and take a receipt. Counterfeit currency is common. Preserve this receipt until you exit Pakistan.

, There are useful articles on wikiHow, such as Use a Squat Toilet and Use an Indian Bathroom.

, Even a few words like Assalaam-o-Alaikum (greetings), janaab (sir), mohtarma (madam) and shukriya (thank you) go a long way in warming up the discussion., Being an Islamic state, import of alcoholic beverages is prohibited. You can buy alcohol in larger hotels or certain wine shops in major cities by showing your non-Muslim identification such as a passport. However, avoid alcohol consumption in public places or going out of your hotel if you are inebriated.

, Pakistan has a rich culture of music. All kinds of music including traditional, classical, sufi, rock, jazz etc. is played widely and there are several performances on weekends in most cities you could attend. You can ask your hotel concierge or local contacts to arrange tickets., Resist the temptation to try drugs or firearms practice even though these may be easily available and tempting. You may be tested for both upon arrival in your home country. Drug residues remain in your blood for weeks and gunpowder traces can be detected from your skin/clothes for a long time. Stay away from prostitution even though widely available and cheap.

, Stay indoors with people you trust or in your hotel. Do not be tempted by offers of nightlife entertainment.

, No price in Pakistan is fixed and you can bargain everywhere, including hotel room rates.

Find Your Local Passport Acceptance Office.,
Submit Your Form and Documentation.,
Prepare Payment for the Passport Fee.,
Wait.",How to Obtain Your First Passport," Before you take any further steps, it is vital that you already have access to all the documents required for obtaining a passport. You will need proof of U.S. citizenship and proof of Identification. Proof of citizenship could include a birth certificate, nationalization certificate or proof of U.S. birth abroad. Proof of identification will typically require a driver’s license, birth certificate, state ID card, military ID card or other such government-issued photo identification.;
, A passport photo isn’t just an average photograph. It has very particular dimensions and requirements. To make sure you meet the right guidelines, you may want to visit a photo establishment that specializes in these pictures—they are often found in drugstores and photo labs.

, In most cases, the form you will fill out to obtain your passport is the DS-11. This form is available online at the U.S Department of State or you can obtain it from a local passport office—or sometimes at your post office. No matter where you obtain it, make sure you fill it out clearly, neatly and in ink. This will assure that your request for a passport is handled expeditiously.

, The State Department offers an easy way for you to search for the closest passport office near you. Additionally, you can call 1-877-487-2778 to find out more information 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

, While adult renewals can be handled by mail, those who are obtaining their first passport (and young people who are renewing) will need to turn in their forms and all required proof in-person at a local passport office. The process may take a few minutes, especially if there is a line. Make sure you allow enough time for this in your schedule.

, Passports are not free. In fact, the fee can vary depending on whether you want the traditional passport book ($110), or the newer passport card ($30, but has limited use). This can be paid in cash, by credit or debit card and in some cases by personal check. If you are concerned, you may wish to call the office ahead of time to make sure they can accept your payment.

, The time necessary to obtain a passport can be significant. It makes sense to do this ahead of time if you are concerned. It is possible to put a “rush order” on a passport; however, this will be an additional cost and could still take up to two weeks to arrive.

Consider whether your country of birth grants you a second citizenship.,
Find out how to exercise citizenship through unrestricted right of soil.,
Research the laws of both states regarding dual citizenship.",How to Obtain Dual Citizenship1," Were you born in a state whose right to citizenship you have never exercised? If so, then you might be eligible for citizenship through an unrestricted right of soil, also known as unconditional jus soli. This means that you have an automatic birthright to be a citizen of that country because you were born there. For example, if you are currently a British citizen who was born in the United States, you are entitled to American citizenship through unrestricted jus soli.Research the immigration laws of your country of birth. Most countries do not grant citizenship through right of soil, so it is important to research the laws of the country in which you were born.30 of the world’s 194 countries practice unconditional jus soli.Of these 30 countries, Canada and the United States (as of 2010) are the only countries among the world’s advanced economies that practice unconditional jus soli and grant citizenship to most children born on its soil, including children born to persons present in the state illegally.However, children born in the United States to foreign diplomats and foreign heads of state do not acquire citizenship through right of soil.;
, You may find that your country of birth, which is not the country whose citizenship rights you exercise, grants you a right to its citizenship through a right of soil. If so, discover how you can exercise that right.


One way to exercise a right to citizenship is to apply for a passport. You can apply for a passport through the state’s embassy or consulate in your current country of citizenship and/or residence. You may be asked to present an original or certified copy of your birth certificate to the consulate or embassy as evidence.
For example, if you apply for a Canadian passport, then you can present a birth certificate issued by the Canadian province or territory in which you were born. This serves as evidence of your Canadian citizenship because Canada practices unrestricted jus soli., Find out the laws regarding dual citizenship of both the state of your current citizenship and of the state whose second citizenship you are trying to obtain. Consider whether enforcing your right of soil citizenship may require renouncing your current citizenship. This is important because not all states that practice unconditional jus soli permit their citizens to hold dual citizenship.


For example, Pakistan practices unconditional jus soli (with a few minor exceptions) but only permits dual citizenship with a select number of states.Examples of countries that both practice unconditional jus soli and permit dual citizenship are the United States and Canada."

Consider your parents’ citizenship.,
Research the laws regarding dual citizenship of both countries.,
Find out how to exercise your citizenship through right of blood.",How to Obtain Dual Citizenship2," Most countries in the world grant citizenship on the basis of right of blood or jus sanguinis. Under the jus sanguinis principle, you acquire one or both of your parents’ citizenship upon birth.This means that the child acquires the parents’ citizenship regardless of where she is born, and her only citizenship is the one acquired through right of blood if she is born in a country that does not practice jus soli.


For example, if you were born in the United States, but your parents are both British citizens, then you are also a British citizen.

, Find out if obtaining a second citizenship through the jus sanguinis principle of a state would require you to renounce your prior citizenship. If that is the case, you cannot become a dual citizen.


Both the United States and the United Kingdom permit dual citizenship. However, there are other countries that grant citizenship on the jus sanguinis principle and do not permit dual citizenship.Singapore, for example, practices jus sanguinis but does not allow dual citizenship., The process that you will need to follow to gain citizenship through parentage will vary by country. Check with the country’s consulate to determine what you will need to do.


For example, if you are currently an American citizen who was born to British parents, and you are under the age of 18, it is your parents who must apply on your behalf to register you as a British citizen. The application form and guidance on how to register as a British citizen in this scenario are available here.

Consider acquiring a second citizenship by investment.,
Find out how long it will take to become a citizen by investment.,
Check to see if there is a residency requirement.,
Check the citizenship laws of the country in which you are investing.",How to Obtain Dual Citizenship3," Many countries issue resident visas or permits to individuals who are willing to invest in the country’s economy, and those resident visas can make you eligible for citizenship after a few years. This can be an expensive route as the minimum investment amounts range from several hundred thousand dollars to several million dollars.For example, the United States requires an investment of $1 million (or $500,000 if you are investing in a high unemployment or rural area), and in return you receive a conditional permanent resident permit., This path to citizenship can take a long time, so research the amount of time that it will take you to become a citizen before you decide to invest.


For example, the United States and Belgium grant citizenship after five years of holding a resident permit of this type. However, Malta (whose minimum investment requirement is EUR 1 million) grants citizenship after only 1 year.

, Some states that grant investor visas also require that you remain a resident in that state before you can become a citizen. However, not all countries have residency requirements.


For example, Cyprus does not have a residency requirement but the United States does., Not all countries permit dual citizenship. You may be required to renounce your prior citizenship in order to acquire citizenship by investment. If that is the case, you cannot become a dual citizen in this way.

Consider your spouse's citizenship.,
Beware of the consequences of sham marriages.,
Confirm the laws regarding dual citizenship of both countries.",How to Obtain Dual Citizenship4," If you are married to someone who holds a citizenship that you do not, then you might consider whether your spouse’s country of citizenship grants you citizenship by marriage. This process involves applying for a resident permit that you would qualify for based on your marriage. You would also need to meet any residency requirements.


If you believe that you can acquire a second citizenship through marriage, research the laws of your spouse’s country of citizenship regarding citizenship by this route. The laws about the application process and amount of time involved to obtain citizenship will vary by country.
For example, if you are married to a British citizen, you must meet certain requirements before you can apply to become a British citizen by marriage. You must be 18 years of age or older, of sound mind, of good character (e.g. you don’t have a serious criminal record), you must meet English language requirements and show knowledge of life in the UK, you must have been granted indefinite permission to stay in the UK, and you must meet a residency requirement., Note that entering into a sham or fake marriage for the sole purpose of acquiring residency and (subsequent citizenship) of your spouse’s country is considered fraud and is a serious criminal offense in most countries. Do not attempt to enter into a sham marriage for the purpose of becoming a dual citizen, as the legal consequences of this can be severe., Not all countries permit dual citizenship, and your spouse’s country of citizenship may be one that requires you to renounce your previous citizenship. If that is the case, then you cannot become a dual citizen through marriage.

Apply for an employment visa.,
Apply for residency through special immigration programs.,
Confirm the laws regarding dual citizenship of both the countries.",How to Obtain Dual Citizenship5," You may also gain citizenship by applying for a job in another country. Some countries allow individuals who have legally entered the country on a work visa to convert their visa status to permanent residency and then to citizenship.


For example, in Australia you can apply for a number of categories of employment visas that have their own requirements. One type is called a Skilled-Independent Visa and it allows you to enter Australia with the intention of working in Australia as long as you meet the criteria. If you spend four consecutive years in Australia under the visa, then you become eligible for Australian citizenship., In many countries, the first step to becoming a citizen is to apply for residency. Once you become a resident, you may then apply for citizenship through naturalization. Eligibility requirements vary from country to country.


For example, in the United States you can qualify for permanent residency through the Diversity Immigrant Visa Program. This program randomly draws from a pool of individuals who are from countries with low rates of immigration to the United States.Check to see if the country in which you are interested in acquiring a second citizenship has a similar route to acquiring residency.
Once you acquire residency and meet any other criteria, then you can apply for citizenship.

, Keep in mind that not all countries permit dual citizenship. If you acquire citizenship of a state through a work visa, visa lottery, or other program, then you may be required to renounce your prior citizenship. If that is the case, you cannot become a dual citizen by following this route.

You may already have a claim to citizenship based on where one or both of your parents or grandparents were born. The rules about family heritage citizenship vary from one country to another, so make sure that you check the rules of your ancestral country.


For example, if you were born in wedlock between Jan. 1, 1914 and Dec. 31, 1974 and your father was a German citizen, then you have a claim to citizenship. A child born after January 1st 1975 has a right to German citizenship if one or both parents were German citizens at the time of birth.Keep in mind that family heritage is not always necessary to obtain citizenship in an EU country, but it can help make the process easier in some cases. For example, if you want to become a citizen of Ireland, then one of the requirements for citizenship may be waived if you have Irish ancestry.;
, Some EU countries allow people who have been living there for a certain period of time to obtain citizenship by application. Most countries have special requirements for aliens who wish to apply for citizenship. For example, to be eligible to become a citizen of Austria, you must:have lived in Austria permanently for at least 10 years
have no criminal record
prove that you have adequate income to live in Austria
be able to speak and read the German language
be knowledgeable about Austrian history and current affairs
have a positive opinion of the Republic of Austria

, Those who are married to someone with citizenship in an EU country may also apply for citizenship. If you are married and your spouse already has citizenship, then you are eligible to apply for citizenship in your spouse’s home country.


If your spouse was born in an EU country or has a parent who was born in an EU country, then he or she may be eligible to apply for citizenship and then you can apply as well.
Keep in mind that each EU country has different rules about gaining citizenship through a spouse. For example, those who wish to gain citizenship through a spouse in Austria must have been living in Austria for at least six years and have been living in the same household as their spouse for at least five years.Spouses or registered same sex-partners of German citizens must have lived in Germany for at least three years and have resided in the same household as the spouse or partner for at least two years., Depending on the path to citizenship that you choose, you will need to have a different set of documents. The documents that will be required for your application will also vary by country, so make sure that you check the country’s requirements. Required documents may include:birth certificate
US passport
marriage certificate
paystubs
bank statements

, Complete the required application for citizenship. Most countries have these forms available online. The application form that you need to complete may also vary depending on the path to citizenship you have chosen and the country where you hope to gain citizenship.


Make sure that you get the correct form and read it carefully before completing it.

, Before your application for citizenship will be processed, you will have to pay the fees. Citizenship application fees vary by country, so make sure that you check the requirements of the country you are applying to.


For example, the naturalization fee for Germany is €255, but the fees can be waived in some situations.The naturalization fee for Ireland is €175, but you may also have to pay up to €950 if your application is approved and the fees cannot be waived for any reason., Hearing back about your application can take quite a while because of all of the documents and information that have to be checked. You will receive a letter to let you know if your application was approved or denied.


If your application is incomplete or does not meet the requirements, then it will be denied. However, you can apply again when you do meet the requirements.
For example, applicants for citizenship in Ireland may be denied if they have not met the residency requirements, but they can reapply when they have lived in Ireland long enough to meet the requirements and may be granted citizenship at that point., After you have become a citizen of an EU country, you will be eligible to apply for a passport from that country. At the time of application, you will need to be fingerprinted and you will also need to present several documents to obtain a passport from an EU country where you have been granted citizenship. These documents may include:birth certificate
marriage certificate
proof of citizenship
various other identifying documents such as paystubs, tax forms, college registration forms, etc.
documents that prove your address is correct such as utility bills, letters from the government, bank statements, etc.

, The path that you took to gain citizenship will influence the sections of the application that you will need to complete. Read each section carefully to determine if you need to complete that section.


For example, if you obtained citizenship because you were born to a parent or parent from an EU country, then you would fill out a different section than someone who gained citizenship through a spouse., Two recent photos will be required along with your application. Passport photos have special requirements, so it is important to get your passport photos done by a professional who understands these requirements. Passport photo requirements include:


A high-quality color photo with a 600 dpi or higher resolution that gives the skin a natural appearance.
Your face size in the photo needs to be between 1 ¼ inches (32mm) and 1 3/8 inches (36mm) from the bottom of your chin to your hairline.
The photo should be sharp and not blurry or dim.
If you wear glasses, you will need to remove them for the photo., Passport fees will vary by country and passport type as well. Check with your country of citizenship to determine how much you will need to pay.


For example, in Ireland, the standard 10 year passport costs €80, but the larger size passport (66 pages) costs €110., Many countries allow you to track the progress of your application online so that you can get a better idea of when you will receive it.If you need your passport in a hurry, express or emergency service may also be an option.Unless you have an emergency, it is best to wait until you receive your passport to make any travel arrangements.

You need to have been physically present in Canada for at least 1460 days (4 years) in a 6 year period before you apply for Canadian citizenship. Also, within these four years, each year, you must have been physically present in Canada for 183 days.
You must not be under review for immigration or fraud reasons or be under a removal order.

, Whether you live in the US or not, you will have to file taxes each year if you are a US citizen. You are taxed based on your worldwide income regardless of where you live.For example, if you have been living in Canada for the past year, you will need to file both Canadian and U.S. tax returns.


Fortunately, the US and Canada have a tax treaty that provides relief for individuals with dual citizenship so they don't have to pay double tax. Instead, they pay one country and receive credit in the other for taxes paid.
If you are a Canadian citizen, you only have to file taxes for the period you have been actually living in Canada. So if you have been living in the US for a year, you only have to file a US tax return.

, In most cases, if you are a citizen of two countries, you will have obtained a passport for both. When you are entering certain countries, you risk having one of your passports confiscated for whatever reason. You may also need to show both passports if you have dual citizenship during immigration.


Always research the policies of travelling as a dual citizen of wherever your destination is.

All details and official requirements can be found on the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) website. However, if you have given up or relinquished your US citizenship in the past, you will not be able to obtain a US citizenship. The only exception is if you renounced your US citizenship under the age of 18. Then you must make the desire to be a US citizen known to the Department of State within six months of turning 18.Other than that, you can become a US citizen if:


You have been a permanent resident for at least 5 years (citizenship through naturalization).
You were born in Canada, but your genetic parents or non-genetic gestational mother were legal US citizens at the time of your birth (citizenship through parents).
Your married spouse is a legal US citizen and you have been a permanent residence and married to the same spouse for at least 3 years (naturalization for spouses of U.S. citizens).

, There are several requirements you need to meet before you can be eligible to apply for a US citizenship through naturalization:


You must be 18 years or older to apply.
You must be a green card holder for at least 5 years.
You must file your application with the State or Service District with jurisdiction that you have truly reside in your place of residence and have been for at least 3 months before applying for citizenship.You must have been continuously living in the US for 5 years after obtaining a green card and after applying for citizenship. That means you have not been outside of the US for more than 6 months and can prove that you have been physically present in the US 30 months before you plan to apply for citizenship.You must be able to read, write, and speak English and have knowledge and understanding of US history and government.
You must be a person with good moral character, accept the principles of the Constitution of the United States, and agree with the good order and happiness of the United States during all relevant periods under the law.

, In most cases, you are required to have had permanent residence in the US for at least 3 years and married to your spouse at the same time. However, if your spouse is employed abroad for at least 1 year by the US government, military, or other qualifying employer, no minimum time of permanent residence is specified or required of you. But you still need to have a green card or be a permanent resident of the US. The requirements for citizenship are quite similar to the requirements needed for applicants who are applying for citizenship through naturalization:


You must be 18 years or older to apply.
You must be a green card holder for at least 3 years.
You must be in a civil union with your US citizen spouse during the 3 years before you submit your citizenship application and all the way up to your citizenship examination date.
You must file your application with the State or Service District with jurisdiction that you have truly reside in your place of residence and have been for at least 3 months before applying for citizenship.You must have been continuously living in the US for 3 years after obtaining a green card and after applying for citizenship. That means you have not been outside of the US for more than 6 months.You must prove you have been physically present in the US for at least 18 months out of the 3 years before your citizenship application date.
You must be able to read, right, and speak English and have knowledge and understanding of US history and government.
You must be a person with good moral character, accept the principles of the Constitution of the United States, and agree with the good order and happiness of the United States during all relevant periods under the law.
If your spouse is being employed abroad, you must establish that you plan to depart immediately after you receive citizenship and also reside in the US immediately after your spouse's employment is terminated.

, If you plan to have your child in Canada and you and/or your spouse is a US citizen, your child will most likely be able to receive US citizenship automatically through you. In most cases, permanent residency is not required of the child but in certain circumstances, you must be able to prove you have resided the US for a certain period of time. Check the USCIS Policy Manual guidance on Children of U.S. Citizens for a full list of requirements.


The rules for citizenship through parents is extremely complex. It is dependent on various things such as whether the child was born in or out of wedlock, when the child was born, when the parent was born, and if one or both parents were US citizens at the time of birth. In some circumstances, blood tests would need to be done to prove a parent is indeed blood related to the child.
If parents are naturalized US citizens after the birth of a child, the child must have been under 18 at the time their parents were naturalized and must have had a green card before 18.
If you were adopted or your child is an adopted Canadian child, the adoptive parent must have adopted them before the child's 16th birthday and have had legal custody at the same time. As well, the child must have been admitted to the United States as an orphan or Convention adoptee.

, Depending on how you plan to obtain a US citizenship, you will be required to fill out a different form. All forms are located on Official Website of the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). You can find PDF files of detailed instructions on how to fill out these forms, what the application fee is, and even a comprehensive checklist of all required documents.


If you are applying through naturalization, fill out Form N-400. You will be instructed to mail in your application along with a $680 check payable to the US Department of Homeland Security. Where you mail in your application depends on where you live and whether you are a current or former member of the military, spouse of a current or former member of the military, or close relative to a deceased member of the military. Your application requires you to not only submit Form N-400, but also any copy proofs of marriage certificates, birth certificates, Armed Forces memberships, and even photographs for evidence.
If you are applying for citizenship through your parents, fill out Form N-600. You will be instructed to mail in your application to the USCIS Phoenix Lockbox facility along with a $600 check payable to the US Department of Homeland Security. The price is adjusted to $550 if the child is adopted and completely waived if the applicant is a child of a veteran or member of the US Armed Forces. Your application requires you to not only submit Form N-600, but also any copy proofs of parent or parents' citizenship, birth certificates, Armed Forces memberships, and even photographs for evidence.

, Within a month or two, the USCIS will send you a receipt to let you know your application has been received and is in processing. On the receipt, there will be a number you can use to check up on the status of your application through their website.


In most cases, the USCIS will also send you a letter a few months later telling you come to a fingerprinting appointment. A date and time will be scheduled for you to go into your local USCIS office. You will be required to bring in your letter, green card or resident card, and an additional form of identification with your photograph on it (driver's license, or passport).
You may be required to send the USCIS additional documents.

, If you are applying through naturalization, you will be interviewed and required to take a naturalization exam where your knowledge of US history and government will be tested. The USCIS will send you a letter with a scheduled location, date, and time of your examination and interview. If you need to reschedule, you must ask in writing to have your interview rescheduled.If you don't receive a letter within 7 months after you have applied, contact the USCIS customer service at 1-800-375-5283.
There are many resources available to help you study for your naturalization test. USCIS provides some study materials on their website. You can also find tutors or classes that specialize in helping people take the naturalization exam.

, You only have 2 chances to pass the examination. If you fail both times, you will need to restart your application process again. If you don't show up to your interview and you don't contact the USCIS beforehand, the USCIS will close your case and application. You will have one year to reopen your case before your application is denied and you will need to restart your application process all over again. If you do show up for your interview, the process consists of:


An USCIS officer will ask about your application and your background. It's important you go over what you wrote in your application and be as truthful as possible during the interview. This portion of the process counts towards the speaking component of the naturalization exam.
To test your reading abilities, you will be asked to read aloud three English sentence. The USCIS provides a helpful Reading Vocabulary to prepare for your exam.
To test your writing abilities, you will be asked to write out three English sentences provided by the USCIS officer. The USCIS provides a helpful Writing Test Vocabulary to prepare for your examination.
Finally, during your interview, you will be asked 10 civics questions and you must answer 6 of them correctly to pass this portion of the exam. Thankfully, the USCIS provides you with a list of 100 possible civics questions with their answers that will be asked.
You will receive your naturalization exam results after the interview and be told whether you are approved or denied citizenship.

, Once you are approved for US citizenship, you will take part in a naturalization ceremony where you will say the Oath of Allegiance and officially become a citizen of the US. In some cases, you can take the oath on the same day as your interview. In most cases, the USCIS will mail you a letter with the date and time of your ceremony.


You will be asked to fill out Form N-445 before your ceremony which confirms your ceremony details and lists the required documents you must bring to your ceremony. It also asks you a few brief questions about yourself in case your status has changed after your examination (for example, you married, divorced, or was widowed any time between your naturalization examination and ceremony).
When you arrive for your ceremony, a USCIS officer will review with you your responses in your N-445 form.
You will be required to turn in your Permanent Resident Card or Green Card at the ceremony.
After you take your Oath of Allegiance, you will be given a Certificate of Naturalization. Be sure to review your certificate to ensure it is free of errors. Your certificate acts as proof of your US citizenship.
After your ceremony, you are now eligible to apply for a US passport, register to vote, and asked to update your social security records at your local Social Security Administration (SSA) office.

Find out if you are already a Canadian citizen.,
Determine your eligibility for citizenship.,
Get an application package.,
Prepare for your citizenship test.,
Take the citizenship test.,
Attend your Oath of Citizenship ceremony.",How to Have Dual Citizenship in the US and Canada3," In some cases, you may have already been automatically given Canadian status. The Government of Canada allows you to submit an application for proof of Canadian citizenship to help you determine if you are a Canadian citizen (this is different from applying for a Canadian citizenship). If you are indeed a Canadian citizen, you will be given your Certificate of Citizenship. In most cases, you are a Canadian citizen already if:


You were born in Canada.
Your parent or legal guardian naturalized you as a minor by applying for your citizenship.
You were born outside of Canada after April 17, 2009 and at least one of your parents were born in Canada, or naturalized before your birth.
The changes made in 2015 and 2009 of the Citizenship Act apply to you. A comprehensive list of changes can be found on the Citizenship and Immigration Canada website.

, Before applying for Canadian citizenship, you should check if you are eligible to receive citizenship. To be eligible for Canadian citizenship, you must meet these conditions:



Age: You must be at least 18 years old to apply. If you are applying for a child under 18, you must be the child’s parent, adoptive parent or legal guardian, the child must be a permanent resident, and one parent must be a Canadian citizen or be applying to become a citizen at the same time.

Permanent Resident Status: You must have permanent resident status and must not have any unfulfilled conditions related to your status. That means you are not under investigation, have no committed any crimes, or under a removal order. Fortunately, you don't need a PR card to apply for citizenship.

Time lived in Canada: After you have obtained permanent residency, you will have needed to be physically present in Canada for at least 1460 days (4 years) in a 6 year before before you apply for Canadian citizenship. Also, within these four years, each year, you must have been physically present in Canada for 183 days. These conditions do not apply to children under 18 or certain Crown servants. Luckily, the government has provided a tool to help you find out if you have lived in Canada long enough.

Income tax filing: You must have met your personal income tax filing obligations in four taxation years that are fully or partially within the six years immediately before the date you apply for citizenship.

Intent to reside: You must declare your intent to reside during the citizenship application process. That means you intend to live in Canada, work outside Canada as a Crown servant, or live abroad with certain family members who are Crown servants.

Be able to speak English or French: You will need to send documents to prove that you can speak and listen in English or French. An officer during your application process will also evaluate your language skills. Being able to speak in English or French means you can take part in short, everyday conversations about common topics, understand simple instructions, questions and directions, use basic grammar, and know enough common words and phrases to answer questions and express yourself.

Know Canada well: You will need to take a citizenship test that tests your knowledge of Canada. You will need to know Canada's history, values, institutions, and symbols. It is usually a written test but can sometimes be taken orally with a officer.

Prohibitions: If you have committed a crime, you are not eligible for citizenship for a period of time. That means you are not currently on parole or probation, you have not been convicted or indicted of any crimes, and you are not on trial or involved in an appeal of an offence.

, On Canada's Immigration website, you can find information guides about how to fill out applications, how to pay fees, and how to submit applications. There are three kinds of application packages:


For Adults (over 18 years old).

For Minors (under 18 years old).

For Canadian Armed Forces (over 18 years old).
Make photocopies of all documents. The detailed instruction guide will tell you what original documents you will need to bring to you test or interview.
When you submit your application, you must include all the forms, information, documents and fees, including postal codes for all Canadian and overseas addresses.

, You will have to take a citizenship test if you are between the ages of 14 and 64 when you apply for citizenship.If a minor is taking the citizenship test or going for an interview, a parent or guardian may accompany them, but they cannot help the child during the test or interview. Prepare for the citizenship test by:


Reading Discover Canada. You download a PDF or eBook copy as well as listen to an audio version of the book.
Brushing up on Canada's beliefs on the rights, freedoms and responsibilities of Canadian citizens, Canada's democracy and ways to take part in Canadian society, Canadian political and military history, social and cultural history and symbols, and Canadian physical and political geography.
Improving your English or French to prepare for the oral or interview portion of the test.

, You will receive a notice about the time, date, and location of your test. If you cannot make it to the scheduled date, contact the Call Centre and they will reschedule your citizenship test. If you don't attend the test, you will also have to contact the Call Centre or they will close your application.


Bring your original documents that you sent with your application to the test and any passports or travel documents you have had in the past four years.
Depending on your application, Immigration Canada will decide whether you do an oral or written test. If you have trouble reading and writing in English or French, you will most likely be given an oral test.
Your test results will be given to you right after your test. If you pass, a ceremony date to take your Oath of Citizenship will be given to you at the same time as your results. The ceremony will occur within six months after your test. If you do not pass, you will either be asked to reapply for citizenship or you will be rescheduled to take another test or interview with an officer.

, To receive your certificate of citizenship, all applicants over the age of 14 must attend the ceremony. You will need to bring:


Your original immigration documents.

Get enough sleep.",How to Look Good for Your Passport Photo," Don’t do anything you wouldn’t ordinarily do to your hair for a passport photo. Passport photos should be a good representation of what you usually look like so that you don’t get detained.Do not wear a hat or any other head covering unless you already do so on a daily basis for religious purposes. If you do wear a head covering, for a U.S. passport, your face has to be visible. The covering can’t hide your hairline or cast shadows over any part of your face.;
, If you usually wear makeup, go ahead and put it on as usual. If you never wear makeup, you probably don’t want to put on a ton of it for the photo. You won’t look like yourself, and you could get detained.Wear a little oil-absorbing powder to prevent shine if you want to. This will be most useful on your forehead or nose.
Even if you don’t usually wear makeup, you may want to put a bit of concealer or powder over any dark circles under your eyes. These dark places can cause a glare (and make you look sick or tired). , Remember that you may need to use your passport for many occasions other than traveling. (For example, sometimes you can use it to get a background check when you apply for a job.) Try to wear solid colored clothing in muted tones. Wear something flattering and reasonably comfortable.
Don’t wear anything too flashy, or it will cause people to look at your outfit instead of your face.
Pay most attention to your shirt, since that’s what will be in the photo. Scoop or v-necks work nicely.If it’s too low cut or if it’s a tank top, you might look naked, so check the neckline. Since you will be in front of a white or black background, avoid those colors. Choose colors that flatter your skin tone.
Wear a minimal amount of jewelry.
Uniforms or anything that resembles a uniform (including camouflage) are not allowed unless they are religious attire that you wear every day.Some people have reported that the passport office rejected their photo because it looked too much like previous photos (which means that the passport office couldn’t confirm that it was a recent picture), so you should dress a bit differently than you did in your last photo if this is an update. , Be sure to brush your teeth the morning of your photo so that they’re pearly white. Right before the photo, you should also duck into the bathroom or pull out a compact to be sure there is nothing in them.

, This is a requirement.If you cannot remove your glasses for medical reasons, please include a signed note from your doctor with application.
Reapply makeup. In particular, if you tend to look shiny in photos, you may want to add a bit of oil-absorbing powder at the last minute. Be sure to also check for lipstick smears or eye makeup that has smudged. , If you’re wearing your hair down (especially if it’s long), arrange it over your shoulders if you want. If your hair is short, make sure that it’s laying the way you want it to. Rub a tiny bit of gel or mousse between your fingers and run it over your hair at the last minute to keep flyaways at bay. If your hair is very long, you may want to only arrange one side of it over your shoulders. If it covers the straps of your shirt or hides the sleeves, you might look naked. , Assuming you’re not taking your own photo, listen carefully to the person who is. The photographer wants to capture you from your most flattering angle. Follow his or her directions accurately and don't move from one pose to the next unless he or she asks you to. There are strict requirements about headspace in a passport photo, so you don’t want to ruin their shot..


The photographer will ask you to face the camera directly, since this is a government requirement. If you’re taking your own photo, be sure to square your shoulders and look directly into the camera. Your head must be between 50% and 69% of the total height of the photo. Measure from the top of your head (including your hair and any headwear) to the bottom of your chin. , Be sure that your posture looks nice and confident. Keep your shoulders down and back. Don’t hold your head up high to avoid a double chin, because it will make your neck look large. Instead, thrust your chin forward very slightly (a little farther out than you would normally hold it, but not much)., In general, either a “natural smile” (one that doesn’t show your teeth) or a neutral expression are permitted for passport photos. Choose an expression that you think flatters your face, but listen carefully to the photographer’s instructions if they tell you you look unnatural. If your expression looks “unusual” or you are squinting at all, the passport office may reject the photo, which will delay the process of getting your passport.If you choose not to smile at all, think of a happy thought so that your eyes will still appear friendly and pleasant. , A good photographer will look at the pictures with you and recommend the ones he or she thinks turned out best from a professional point of view. Be assertive and choose the one you like best if you disagree with the photographer, but be sure that your photo meets the requirements.

, There are dozens of options, and they all have different benefits. Choose one that’s conveniently located and fits your budget. You can get a good photo without shelling out a lot of cash, but of course a professional photographer will offer the highest quality photo. Some places require appointments, so plan ahead. Some options include


shipping centers (in the U.S., this includes Fedex and UPS)
places with memberships (such as Costco and AAA)

Costco offers some of the cheapest passport photos. AAA will sometimes do it for free if you’ve booked a trip through their travel services.


pharmacies and retail stores (CVS, Rite Aid, Walgreens, and Walmart all offer this service)
professional photography studios
passport offices (many offer this service, but not all, so call ahead)
registered passport expediters (if you need it in under two weeks)
in your own home (but be sure to follow the strict requirements)

, Give your hair a little time to get over that fresh cut look by planning a haircut in advance if you need one. About a week or two should still leave your hair looking neat and tidy by picture time. Of course, if you want the fresh cut look and trust your stylist not to botch it, you can wait until the last minute., If you like to shape your eyebrows, it’s best to do it about a day in advance to get rid of any redness before the photo but not give strays enough time to return. You could also get them waxed if you want to shell out a few bucks for this special occasion. If you find that the skin around your eyebrows gets red after you pluck them, try applying cool, wet tea bags or a bit of aloe.

, To prevent dark shadows under your eyes and redness in your eyes, try to get enough sleep for several days before you take your passport photo. This will also help brighten your skin and make you look healthier. "

Fill out the appropriate form.,
Submit form and documentation in person.,
Have money for the fee.,
Know that there are extra steps for a child’s passport.,
Apply well in advance of your travel date.,
Track your application online.,
Apply outside of the US.,
Make sure your child support is paid.",How to Get a US Passport," The major necessary documentation are Proof of Citizenship and Proof of Identity. There are a number of different documents that can be used, depending on if this is the first time apply or if the passport is for a minor.


Proof of citizenship includes a previous US passport or a birth certificate for those born inside the US. For those born outside the US, a Consular Report of Birth Abroad, Naturalization Certificate, or Certificate of Citizenship will be necessary.Proof of identity includes items like a previous US passport, driver’s license, current government or military ID, or a Naturalization Certificate. These items should have your photo and your signature.
If you do not have one of those forms of ID, you will need two forms of what are called “secondary ID”. These include items like a social security card, credit card or library card. You can also appear with an identifying witness, who will need their own sufficient forms of ID.;
, You will need a passport photo. This is not just a normal photo: it must be a very particular size and you must be clearly visible. The easiest way to get this photo is to go to a place which takes these photos. Many large chain grocery and drug stores will do this if they have a photo lab.

, This is form DS-11 in almost all cases. This can be filled in by hand at the place where you submit the form, or online (after which you will need to print it out). This form asks for your details (where you live, where you were born, your Social Security Number, etc) as well as information like your height and eye color. Filling in your SSN is absolutely required.

, Unless you are renewing an adult passport, you will usually have to submit your application in-person. This can be done at your local passport authority, or at designated locations (often major post offices). You will also need to apply in person if you changed your name since your previous passport, if it has been more than 15 years since your last passport was issued, or if your previous passport was stolen,lost, or damaged.

Acceptance Facility. You may locate the Acceptance Facility nearest you, but visiting the Passport Acceptance Facility search page at http://iafdb.travel.state.gov/. Acceptance facilities may include post offices, clerks of court, public libraries or other state, county, township, and municipal government offices.
Passport Agency or Center. You must have an appointment in order to apply at a Passport Agency or Center, and an Expedited Fee is required for each application submitted in person at any agency or center. A list of Agencies is located on the Department’s website at http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/passports/information/where-to-apply/agencies.html.
If expediting the process or requesting an emergency passport, some Passport Agencies and Centers require proof of international travel within two weeks, or proof of need to obtain a foreign visa within four weeks, so be sure to contact the center in advance in order to ensure that you have all the necessary information.
Passport renewal for previously issued adult passports can be done by mail, though this method is much less secure.

, You will have to pay for your passport and it is relatively expensive, so be prepared. The fee for a basic, first-time adult passport totals $135. It is less if you are renewing or if you are getting a passport for a minor. This fee can be paid checks, credit cards, money orders, and sometimes personal checks, depending on the facility where you submit your application.If you only want to travel between the US and Canada or the US and Mexico (and you plan to drive, not fly), then you can get a passport card instead of a passport book. This will be cheaper.

, Getting a passport for a child is slightly more complicated (and children WILL need their own passport, even if they are infants). You will need to submit proof of relationship (such as a custody order or birth certificate with appropriate signatures), have your own appropriate ID (plus photocopies of that ID), and provide in-person consent from both parents (or one parent, plus written, notarized consent from the second or proof of sole custody).


Minors aged 16 or 17 can apply for adult passports but still require parental consent.

, The process of applying and receiving your passport can sometimes take a very long time (4-10 weeks, usually, depending upon demand). You will want to try to get a passport well in advance of needing one.

Expedite the process if necessary. It is possible to expedite the process by selecting and declaring this option when you submit your forms. There will be an extra $60 fee, plus shipping charges. The US government recommends 2-day overnight shipping.Passports can also be issued quickly in life or death emergencies. Contact your local issuing authority for more information.

, You can track your application on the official website, which you should be informed of when you submit the application. It takes roughly a week after submitting the forms for your status to appear. You will want to keep an eye on it, since you only have 90 days from issue date to report that your passport has not arrived. Don’t forget about it and then need to reapply!, You can also apply for a US passport while outside of the US, but the process will likely be a little different. The form will be the same, though the documentation may vary, but the submitting process changes based on your location. Call your local embassy to find out what you need to do.


Keep in mind that the expedited application process is not available overseas and your passport will be mailed to you from the US. Apply well in advance.

, If you are behind in paying your child support, you may not be able to get a US passport (for yourself, not a child)."

Await a final decision.",How to Get Your B1 Business Visa Extended," If you want to extend your stay in the United States, you need to plan ahead. USCIS recommends that you file an extension application at least 45 days before your stay expires. To find out when your B-1 visa expires, you will need to look at a copy of your USCIS Form I-94, which is your Arrival - Departure Record. In the lower right hand corner of that record, you will see your visa's expiration date. An extension will only be granted if you are in the United States lawfully and your B-1 visa has not expired.In some circumstances, you may find that your business travels will not last as long as your visa, in which case you will not need to get an extension. For example, assume you have a three month training in the United States and you were granted a six month B-1 visa. If, after your three month training was completed, you were asked to stay for another two month training, your visa would cover the extended stay. Therefore, in this situation, you would not need to ask for an extension.;
, In order to be eligible fro a B-1 visa extension, you must not have committed any serious crimes during your stay in the United States.For example, any crime involving moral turpitude can make you ineligible. Moral turpitude is not clearly defined within the law but is considered to be any crime, regardless of its seriousness, that involves some sort of moral wrong (e.g., lying, fraud, evil intent, recklessness).In addition, a lot of drug crimes and prostitution are considered ineligibilities.However, something like a parking ticket or speeding ticket is not likely going to make you ineligible unless you lie about it or try to evade punishment. At that point, it could turn into a crime of moral turpitude.
A more complete list of disqualifying crimes can be found on USCIS Form I-539, Part 4., When you were granted your initial B-1 visa, you received it because you met certain eligibility criteria. For example, your reason for entering the United States must be for a legitimate business reason, you must have the funds available to support yourself throughout your stay, and you must only intend to stay for a short period of time.In order to get an extension, you must have abided by, and continue to abide by, these conditions.For example, you might be denied an extension if you do not have the funds available to continue to support yourself while in the United States. While this is not a crime, it could be a violation of one of the conditions of your being in the United States.

, In order to extend your visit in the United States, your passport must remain valid for the entire length of your stay.If your passport will expire while in the United States, you will not be granted an extension and you will have to go to your home country to get a new passport.


For example, assume you received a B-1 visa that lasts two months. Further assume your passport, at the time you received your visa, had three months before it expired. If you wanted to extend your B-1 visa for an extra two months (i.e., you want to stay in the United States for four months total), you would be unable to do so because your passport will expire before those four months are up.

, If you are eligible for a B-1 visa extension, you will need to file a request with USCIS. This request will need to be filed on USCIS Form I-539.Form I-539 is the Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status. This form can be obtained by visiting the USCIS website.If you do not have consistent access to the internet, you can get the form by calling USCIS at 1-800-870-3676 and providing the following information:The form number (i.e., Form I-539) and how many copies you need
Your name and your mailing address

, When it comes time to fill out Form I-539, you will start by completing Part 1. Part 1 asks for your personal information. When you fill out the application, make sure you type or use a black pen. When you answer questions, give complete and honest answers. Failure to do these things may cause your application to be rejected.Part 1 of Form I-539 asks for the following information:Alien Registration Number
USCIS ELIS Account Number
Name
Mailing address
Physical address
Country of citizenship/birth
Date of birth
Date of arrival in the United States
Information from your I-94

, Part 2 of your application requires you to check a series of boxes telling USCIS what type of application you are filing. Because you are filing for a B-1 visa extension, you will most likely check the box numbered ""1"" in Part 2. Next, assuming you are the only applicant, you will check the box numbered ""4"" in Part 2., The final pieces of your application ask you to provide USCIS with some information that will help them process your application. For example, you need to provide USCIS with how much of an extension you need, information about your current passport, and information about the circumstances of your stay in the United States. All of this information will be input in Part 4 of Form I-539., Part 5 of Form I-539 asks you to certify that you understand the form you are filling out. In addition, after you make this certification, you will sign and date the form. If you had the help of an interpreter, they will also need to sign the form and answer a few questions., Once your I-539 is complete, you must attach your original I-94.If you do not have your original I-94, you can obtain a copy from the United States Customs and Border Protection (CBP). To do this, visit their website and print an official copy., As a final attachment to your extension application, you must submit a written statement that details why you are making an extension request, why your extended stay would be temporary, your arrangements for leaving the country, and the effect your extended stay would have on your foreign employment or residency.As a part of this written statement, you are going to have to prove the legitimacy of your extended stay. This means you will have to provide USCIS with documentation that will convince them that your extension is legitimate and necessary. The documentation you provide might include written statements from business associates, pamphlets from training programs, a list of references, and financial statements proving that you have paid for the training classes.

, The USCIS website provides all the information you need about where to send your completed application and attachments. If you do not have consistent access to the internet, you can call 1-800-375-5283 for information.Form I-539 is usually submitted in paper through the mail. If you choose this method, you will send your form to the following address: USCIS P.O. Box 660166, Dallas, TX 75266.Be sure you check with USCIS often to ensure you are sending your application to the correct location.


While there are other addresses where an I-539 can be sent, those addresses are for different, unrelated processing actions. For example, someone filing for a V visa would send their forms to Chicago.

, Before you mail your application, you need to attach a check or money order to cover the filing fee. As of 2016, the filing fee is $290. The check or money order you use will have to be drawn on a bank or other financial institution within the United States and must be payable in United States currency. The check or money order must be made out to ""U.S. Department of Homeland Security"". It cannot be made out to ""USDHS"" or ""DHS""., If you are filing your extension application at least 45 days in advance of your B-1 visa expiring, you should have your application processed before your authorized stay expires. The sooner you file the better. However, if you file your extension application after your visa expiration date, you will have to include a written statement with your application that demonstrates the following:The delay in filing was due to extraordinary circumstances that were out of your control
The delay in filing was reasonable
You have not violated your status in any other way
You are still a nonimmigrant
You are not currently taking part in removal proceedings

, Once you have your entire application package put together, send it to the correct address. At this point, your extension application will be considered filed. You cannot currently file USCIS Form I-539 online., Once your application has been received by USCIS, they will send you a receipt in the mail. The receipt you receive will have tracking information and instructions to help you check the progress of your application., The time it takes USCIS to process your application varies depending on the complexity of your case and how many applications are coming in at any given time. the USCIS website offers an interactive chart you can use to estimate how long your application will take to process. To use the chart, visit the website and choose the field office or service center that is handling your application. Based on this information, USCIS will give you a date when you can expect a decision., When USCIS reviews your application, they will initially look for completeness. If you do not completely fill out your extension application, which includes any required attachments, your application may be denied. In addition, if you fail to sign your Form I-539 or send in the correct fee, your application will not even be accepted. If this happens, you will have the opportunity to correct these things and refile., In some cases, USCIS might request additional information and may even ask to conduct an interview.If you get one of these requests, make sure you comply in a timely manner. Failure to do so may result in your application being denied.

, USCIS will inform you of their decision in writing.Even if you are eligible and you fill out your forms correctly, the final decision is discretionary and is made based on a number of factors (e.g., your situation, your status, and your reason for wanting to stay). If USCIS grants your extension, they will determine how long you can stay. In general, a B-1 visa can be extended up to a maximum of six months."

Make your kids a map, or get a kid friendly map from your town to your destination.,
Bring lots of snacks.,
Depending on how long your trip is, make some stops.,
If you are planning on eating a meal during the car trip, make it a stop if your kids are little so you all won't make a mess in the car.

Keep a cooler for drinks and snacks by you or another adult or an older kid who can give out snacks and drinks to the younger ones.

,
If your car is big enough, separate the ones who are going to have a problem together.

,
Make rules for your car trip.,
Here's some things that the kids can do in the car:


Listen to iPods, books on tape, etc
Read a book or magazine
Watch DVDs in a portable DVD player
Color in a coloring book or do stuff in one of those game books
Sleep
Talk
Older ones can use their phones
Look at the maps I suggested you make
Sing
Write
Make list of things you need when you get to your destination
Play games like I Spy and other car games
Tell stories

,Dress the kids in the same color so its easier to keep track of them when you stop places

,
Every time you stop somewhere, before you get going again do a count to make sure you have everybody.

,
As you're driving, have the kids look for certain landmarks.

,
Play some games that involve talking and no game pieces.

,
Listen to the radio.

",How to Survive a Car Trip With Many Kids," In your bag you might have CD's, DVDs and portable DVD players,yarn/needles snacks and drinks, new toys, and anything else that is for the whole family. In a kid bag, they might have their iPod, their books or magazines, their blanket or stuffed animal, any toys they want to bring.;
,, This will give the kids stuff to look forward in the car.

, You could draw your house, where you leave the town, lakes, rivers, other landmarks, some famous places, towns that they might have heard of, the destination, and where you will stop and anything else. The younger they are, the more basic you want to make the map.


Make the map colorful. Make bodies of water blue, etc.
Make a separate map for each kid (if you have a lot of kids, then just copy the map in a copy machine but you can write each kids name on the map to make them feel special.
Go over it with them before the trip, and then have them look at it during the trip, and they can mark off where you've been.

, But make sure they are not messy, crumbly snacks. Also, if your kids have too much sugar, they could get grumpy so for every junk food snack you have, have a healthy snack. Snacks will keep the kids busy.

, Usually our trips are not any longer than 6 hours and we make 1-2 stops. Do the buddy system for stopping and try to make the girls with girls and the boys with boys for bathroom reasons. Allow time for the kids to run around and get some energy out.

,,,, Make some serious rules like getting along, when you're allowed to eat, and stuff like that, but also make some funny rules. One rule I use is if you start arguing or bickering or whatever, you have to make an animal sound and that usually makes people start laughing and forget about fighting. Make your own silly rules like that.

Music!,
Games!,
Draw!,
Talk!,
Pictures!,
Sleep!,
At every stop, try to get out even if for a few minutes to stretch your legs, grab a coffee (if it's available) and just stock up.

,
Once you've reached your destination, return all the bedclothes, throw your trash in the bin and double check to see you aren't leaving anything behind.",How to Spend Time on the Train," Take up your seat and put all your belongings in the correct storage area (eg under your seat). You can call or text any friends or waiting relatives till the other passengers arrive and the train finally departs. This will cut down some pre-travel boredom.;
, Don't take out your bedclothes or food immediately. Take some time to calmly get used to your surroundings, including the gentle swaying of the train. Observe who you'll be traveling with for the next hours or days. Make yourself as comfortable as possible. Ensure none of your belongings are in danger of falling or rolling away on the floor with the train's motions. In other words, secure everything.

, If you're a friendly sort, don't hesitate to befriend them and start talking to bide the time away. If you're not in the mood for conversation, or are simply feeling contemplative, just introduce yourself, ask their name and... that's it. It may be possible that they won't be feeling chatty themselves. However, don't let this bother you and do your own thing.

, Bring your favourite snacks and you'll notice that time passes by faster. Take care to avoid bringing perishable food, but if you do bring it, ensure you consume it within 8 hours otherwise it may decay.

, Bring a new book, or an engrossing old one, or you may buy a newspaper from the station beforehand. If you take a newspaper though, don't forget that you'll probably finish it faster than a book, so it won't keep you entertained for much time.

, Now's the time to take out that MP3 player or your headphones and lose yourself to the beat. Compose a playlist at that very moment, suiting the scenery outside to reduce even more time in which you can get bored. Don't forget: your device's battery won't last forever.

, Solve the Sudoku in the newspaper, or bring along a crossword puzzle book. Or if you want, play games on your phone or tablet. If you have wifi available, why you could use that opportunity to even contribute to WikiHow! It's up to you, however why would you spend time on your phone when you could enjoy the scenery outside? Open the window and enjoy the wind. Think about life.

, Write! Bring your sketchbook or journal (if you keep one of these) or even use the newspaper (if you've bought one) to write, draw or make origami items or simply doodle your heart out.

, You've spent plenty of time now. Why not talk to your fellow passengers? You never know how interesting a person can be without talking to them. Share funny incidents, music or even chat about anything and everything.

, Take pictures of the scenery racing past you to preserve the moments forever.

, If you're convinced that time just isn't passing by, go to sleep and when you wake up, you'll be happy to discover that the hands on your watch have traversed a lot. Besides, the more you rest, the more refreshed you will be at the end.

,, Disembark. Say goodbye to your fellow passengers. Thank the conductor.

Note that the zone number is independent from the number of zones you're travelling. For example, if you're travelling within Surrey, you would be in Zone 3 (because geographically, Surrey is in Zone 3), but you're only travelling within one zone (because you're not crossing any other zones).;
,



Concession: children ages 5 to 13, high school students ages 14 to 19 with a valid GoCard (a card displaying the student's name, grade, and high school which enables the student to pay concession fare prices), seniors ages 65 and up, and those with disabilities with a valid HandyCard. Confession fares are generally cheaper.

Adult: all other people not considered concession.

,


The most common way is using cash to purchase a single fare paper ticket valid for 90 minutes. The price depends on how many zones you plan on travelling through. While fareboxes on buses only accept coins, electronic ticket machines accept bills, credit, and debit cards.Adult prices are as follows (in Canadian dollars): one zone is $2.75, two zones is $4, and three zones is $5.50
Concession prices are as follows: one zone is $1.75, two zones is $2.75, and three zones is $3.75.
Note that the above prices are for weekdays until 6:30 pm. On weekday nights after 6:30 pm, as well as all day on weekends and holidays, the prices for all zones lower to $2.75 for adult and $1.75 for concession.



FareSaver tickets: these are one of four prepaid options and sold in booklets of ten. Like single fares, these are valid for 90 minutes.Adult prices are as follows: one zone is $21, two zones is $31.50, and three zones is $42.
For concession, FareSaver tickets are only available for one zone at $17.50. Those wanting to travel through the other two zones must add a fare of $1 for two zones and $2 for three zones.



DayPass: the second prepaid option which allows unlimited travel through all three zones for 24 hours. This is great if you're a tourist planning a day of sightseeing, or if you're running multiple errands across Metro Vancouver.The prices are $9.95 for adult and $7.50 for concession.



FareCards (monthly passes): the third prepaid option which allows unlimited travel for the entire month shown. Unlike the DayPass, however, prices differ for each zone.

Adult prices are as follows: one zone is $91, two zones is $124, and three zones is $170.
Concession passes are valid for three zones for $52.



U-Passes: available to students enrolled in participating universities only, the U-Pass is a prepaid card that entitles students to unlimited travel across all three zones when shown with their student card. Students must print their full name on the pass in order for it to be valid.The cost of the U-Pass is included with student fees for the semester. Currently, it is $35 per month.Note that not all post-secondary institutions are included in the program. Participating schools include UBC, Simon Fraser University, Kwantlen Polytechnic University, and British Columbia Institute of Technology.



, Take into account your final destination, the travel time, the time spent at the destination, and whether you plan on transferring to other vehicles.


For example, if you're an adult living in Surrey and plan to spend a couple hours shopping at a mall in Burnaby, you can buy a single two-zone fare for $4 for the journey to the mall. At the end of your shopping session, you can buy the same single two-zone fare for the ride home since your previous ticket will have expired.
Consider using TransLink's trip planner to organize your route.

, Depending on where you live, you may need to hop on a bus and ride it all the way to the station. Some stations, such as Scott Road Station in Surrey, offer a park-and-ride service which allows you to drive to the station, use pay parking, and commute using the train.

, The SkyTrain has three lines on its network, which are colour coded in transit maps and signage.


Expo Line: serves Vancouver, Burnaby, New Westminster, and Surrey across 20 stations. Terminus stations are Waterfront in downtown Vancouver and King George in Surrey. Coloured dark blue in maps and signage.
Millennium Line: serves Vancouver, Burnaby, and New Westminster across 13 stations. For a portion of the ride, the tracks are shared with the Expo Line, but splits at a transfer station and continues on its own track along North Burnaby. Terminus stations are Waterfront and VCC-Clark in Vancouver. Coloured yellow in maps and signage.
Canada Line: serves downtown Vancouver, Richmond, and Vancouver International Airport across 16 stations Terminus stations are Waterfront, Richmond-Brighouse in Richmond, and YVR-Airport. The line splits at a transfer station and continues along two tracks to either Richmond-Brighouse or the airport. Coloured cyan in maps and signage.

, As previously stated, ticket machines for single fares accept cash in the form of bills or coins, as well as major credit cards and Interac debit cards. To validate a FareSaver or DayPass, insert it into the validation machine. FareCards and U-Passes do not need to be electronically validated.

, Elevators are provided if you're handicapped or pushing a stroller.


At this point, proof of payment is required to board the trains. You must keep your ticket with you throughout your journey until it expires or your trip is finished. Random ticket inspections may occur and you may be fined for fare evasion if you are caught with an invalid or nonexistent ticket.

, Pay attention to on-board announcements indicating the line of the current train. If you're waiting at a station, watch the LED signs displaying the line of the incoming train.


Switch trains at Columbia if you're on an Expo Line train towards King George and you're wanting to transfer to the Millennium Line towards VCC-Clark, or vice versa.
Switch trains at Commercial-Broadway if you're on an Expo Line train towards Waterfront and you're wanting to transfer to the Millennium Line towards VCC-Clark, or vice versa.

Waterfront is the terminus station for the Expo Line and is also a transfer point to the Canada Line.
Switch trains at Bridgeport if you're on a Canada Line train towards Richmond-Brighouse and you're wanting to go to the airport, or vice versa.

,


Wait for others to exit the train before boarding.
Consider giving up your seat to the elderly and/or handicapped, but don't feel obligated to do this, especially if you have an invisible physical disability yourself.
Hold onto the poles when standing on a moving train.
Avoid leaning onto the doors and keep your hands away from the door windows.
Remove your backpack and place it at your feet when standing to make more room. When sitting, only place your belongings on the seat next to you if the car isn't crowded.
Refrain from wearing strong scents as you may trigger some people's allergies.
Clean up after yourself when eating or drinking. Leave no garbage behind.
Resist the urge to engage in large public displays of affection. Hand holding and small kisses on the cheek are fine, but please don't spend 10 minutes making out on a crowded train.
Consider investing in self-defense weapons, like mace, if you tend to use the SkyTrain at night.

, When the train is approaching a station, an on-board announcement will state the name of the next station. Some newer trains have maps with LEDs that light up the remaining stations.


If you're plugged in and can't hear the announcements, look out the window and watch for clues that indicate your station is next (e.g. station signage, buildings along the route, bridges).

,


All cars on the SkyTrain fleet are equipped with both two-way speakerphones and yellow silent alarm strips to contact SkyTrain control operators in the event of an emergency or security threat.
If the train needs to be evacuated, follow the instructions of all SkyTrain employees. Under no circumstances should you attempt to exit the train without guided assistance.
If a fire breaks out, contact SkyTrain personnel and open all the windows to clear out smoke.

, A small portion of the track is underground, but, as the name implies, SkyTrain is mostly elevated above the ground and gives riders a great view of Metro Vancouver!


At night, the geodesic dome of Science World near Main Street-Science World station illuminates the sky with dots of blue light.
During hockey games at the Rogers Arena near Stadium-Chinatown station, the arena lights up blue, one of the colours of the Vancouver Canucks.

Make whole grain tortilla wraps.,
Pack turkey jerky for longer trips.,
Try almond butter and banana sandwiches.,
Bring along some hard boiled eggs.",How to Prepare Healthy Road Trip Snacks1," Whole grain tortillas can serve as a neat wrap for sliced meats, vegetables, and spreads that will give you fuel and energy without making a mess in the car or making it difficult to drive.Choose fresh-sliced lean meats like chicken or turkey for a healthy serving of protein. Add fresh vegetables and avocado or hummus, which won't drip the way salsa or salad dressing would.
Make smaller wraps so they'll hold together easily in one hand, and fold wax paper around them for easy holding.
Keep in mind these snacks are only ideal for shorter road trips (less than 2 hours). Only bring them on longer road trips if you plan to carry a cooler in the car. Otherwise, your vegetables will wilt and your meat may not keep at room temperature.;
, If you're going to be on the road for several hours and don't have room for a cooler, consider buying some turkey jerky. Look for a low-sodium brand to get a healthy helping of protein in a palm-sized snack.There are organic jerky options available as well.


Kale chips also are a healthy snack that won't require refrigeration, or you can bring nuts and seeds for a little protein. Split larger containers into single-serving bags before your trip so you aren't tempted to overeat.

, The flavor of almond butter and bananas goes together well, and the fiber, healthy fat, and protein will keep you energized and alert on the road. Use whole-grain bread to limit your carbohydrates.Keep your sandwiches in plastic containers with a lid so they're easier to access while you're on the road and don't get squished. You might also try cutting them into quarters so they're more bite-sized and you don't have to try to manage a whole sandwich with one hand.
Peanut butter and jelly is another option. Instead of sugar-laden commercial jellies, use preserves or a whole-fruit spread.
These simple sandwiches typically will keep for several hours without refrigeration, as long as you don't have them laying in direct sunlight.

, If you've got a cooler on board, hard boiled eggs are a great snack that doesn't take long to prepare. Peel your eggs before you store them in the cooler so you don't have to deal with egg shells in the car.Make sure to keep the eggs between 32 and 40 degrees Fahrenheit to prevent them from spoiling and making you sick.

There are dolmush stops every twenty minutes by walk.You can either stand there and hold your hand up as to call the dolmush when you see it or you can just go to main stops with lots of dolmush`s waiting to get passengers.,

Freeze grapes or blueberries the day before your trip.,
Bag up fresh fruit in season.,
Dip dried fruit in yogurt.,
Shake up your own trail mix.,
Indulge your inner child with fruit bars.,
Try all-natural licorice.",How to Prepare Healthy Road Trip Snacks2," Grapes and blueberries freeze well, making them better for travel. On the road, they'll provide you plenty of vitamins and fiber to keep you feeling full and satisfied. Separate big bunches into single servings before your trip.If you don't plan to bring a cooler with you, spread your individual serving bags of frozen grapes or blueberries throughout your food bag to help keep your other food cold for a few hours.

, Fresh fruit is a filling snack that will give you plenty of sugar, as well as fiber and an antioxidant boost. If your road trip occurs during warmer months, you'll typically have plenty of different types of fruit to choose from.Make sure that you wash fresh fruit with some clean water before eating it.
Most fresh fruit can be stored at room temperature, which can be a benefit if you're going on a long road trip and don't have a cooler. Just remember to keep it out of direct sunlight.
Aim for fruit that doesn't require a lot of work to eat. Oranges, for example, might not be the best road-trip snack because peeling the orange can be a bit difficult and messy in a car.
If you bring apples or peaches, make sure to bring a bag you can use to dispose of the cores and pits when you're finished. Just because it's food waste doesn't mean it's okay to throw it out the window of your car.
Smaller fruit, such as raspberries and blueberries, will be easier to portion out and store, and you won't have to worry about the mess of pits or cores.

, Yogurt on its own is a healthy snack, but dipping larger dried fruit such as dried apple rings makes it easier to eat on the road. Even better, you don't have to worry about dirty spoons.To save space and pack everything together, try a mason jar. You can drop the yogurt cup into the bottom and fit your dried fruit in around it. When you want to eat your snack, you can put the yogurt cup in your car's cup holder so your snack doesn't get all over the car.
Fresh fruit can work as well, but keep in mind that if you slice fruit ahead of time for dipping purposes and don't store it properly, it's liable to turn while you're on the road.

, Dried fruit mixed with whole-grain cereal and low-fat granola can make a healthy and filling snack that's easy to take on the road. Use larger pieces in the mix so you don't have to worry about crumbs all over the car.Trail mix gives you the opportunity to mix sweet and salty treats together to satisfy any craving. Try dried pineapple and raisins mixed with whole-grain cereal, sunflower seeds, almonds, and coconut.
You can even mix in organic chocolate chips for an extra sweet treat. The caffeine and sugar can give you a short energy burst if you need it to stay awake on the road.

, Just because you're traveling during the winter months doesn't mean you can't have a healthy sweet fruit snack. Several different companies make dried whole fruit bars that pack a whole serving into a tiny package – perfect for travel.These sweet treats are made for (and marketed to) little kids, but that doesn't mean you can't get in on the fun.
To make the healthiest choice, look for fruit bars made from whole fruit, with no additives or preservatives. There are organic options available as well.
Keep in mind these snacks can be pretty sticky, so if you include them, make sure you have antibacterial wipes handy to clean your hands after eating one.

, When you think licorice, you may think of American sugary treats, but all-natural licorice of the type made by European companies is certified organic, with real licorice extract and pureed fruit, making it more of a fruit snack than a candy.All-natural licorice comes in many different flavors, including sweeter flavors such as raspberry and strawberry, so don't worry if you're not fond of the taste of licorice itself.

Keep snacks in individual bags.,
Bring along a small cooler.,
Use thicker dips.,
Spread dips on the bottom of containers.,
Choose snacks that are simple and odor-free.,
Use containers that can do double duty.",How to Prepare Healthy Road Trip Snacks3," Smaller bags or containers allow you to portion out snacks so you can be sure you're not eating more than you should. With a larger container that contains several servings, you could end up mindlessly eating the whole thing.Keep all of your snacks in a large tote or basket so everything remains contained in your car.
You can buy a set of plastic containers with a variety of sizes at relatively low cost at most discount or kitchen stores. Hard-sided containers often work better than bags because they keep food from getting crushed or damaged.

, Particularly if you're going on a longer road trip, a cooler will enable you to bring a greater variety of healthy snacks and whole foods, so you won't be tempted by roadside diners and convenience store fare.You can get ""disposable"" coolers relatively cheaply if you don't anticipate using it after you get back home from your trip. You also can find coolers that collapse when not in use, if you're concerned about storage.
If space is at a premium, consider getting a smaller lunch-bag sized insulated bag, and just use it for the food that absolutely must stay cold. Put ice packs inside to increase the cooling power.

, Salad dressings may drip all over the place, and can easily spill if you roll over a pothole or speed bump. Anything you want to use as a dip should be thick enough that you can turn the container sideways without it running out.Peanut butter and hummus work well as dips that won't drip or spill on bumpy roads.
You also might consider using a cup that fits in your cup holder for a dip, if you have something that's thinner that you still want to bring.

, If you spread a few tablespoons of thicker dip along the bottom of a plastic container, you can pack in vegetables or crackers on top. Then you don't have to balance two containers while driving or riding on a bumpy road.For example, you might make a munchie tray by spreading hummus or peanut butter on the bottom of a plastic storage container, then topping it with baby carrots, cherry tomatoes, cucumber slices, and celery sticks., You may not care if your car smells like apricots for miles, but having a car that reeks of garlic for days may be a different story. Save the onions for meals at home, and pack whole foods with no assembly required to minimize damage to your car's interior.The same can be said for particularly juicy fruits or sticky foods. Particularly if you also have children in the car, don't pack anything for a snack that you wouldn't want on your upholstery.
Things can be difficult to do in a car that are relatively simple to do anywhere else. Depending on the road conditions, just spreading cheese on a cracker can be a difficult proposition. Stick to things you can prepare ahead of time, and that can be eaten using only one hand.
If you're planning to stop for a picnic, you may want to pack some more complicated fare – but keep it out of reach for snacking purposes while the car's in motion.

, Pack your foods carefully in lidded containers that can double as receptacles for any litter. Once you reach your destination, you can rinse the containers out and use them again.In most cases, going on a long road trip means an equally long trip back home. Reusable containers generally mean less waste, and also mean you won't have to purchase additional supplies for your trip back.

, Pack it to make it as comfortable as possible. Clip it to your wrist or to the seat.

, It also helps to have bags that look ordinary instead of flashy. Be discreet.

, Don't draw attention to yourself by wearing touristy clothes such as shirts emblazoned with slogans or white sneakers. Thieves will be less likely to target you if you blend in.

, Avoid letting others see you accessing it if possible as skilled pickpockets can get to just about anything.

, Thieves often jump on, grab a bag, and jump back off.

, Never leave your bags unattended while you go to the toilet or the dining room. If you are alone, take them with you. Always keep your bags in front of you while waiting at train stations. It only takes a thief a second to grab your bag and run. You can even try positioning your bags between your feet for added safety when waiting for the train.

, Avoid sitting or sleeping alone, especially during overnight jaunts. If you are a woman, look for a compartment with other females.


Try to get an upper berth in a couchette, or sleeping compartment. This makes you and your bag less easy to access.
Secure your bag to the storage rack or sleep on it.
Insure the door to the compartment or couchette stays locked overnight. Make sure the others in the compartment understand how important it is.

, If your passport gets stolen, it's easier to get a new one if you have a copy. Consider emailing these to yourself so you can access them electronically.

, The fewer bags you have and the lighter they are, the easier it is for you to keep your belongings safe. Also, you won't be struggling to drag all your heavy stuff around with you which can lead to multiple distractions.

, Part of the fun of traveling by train throughout Europe is meeting interesting people. But be cautious of people who are too forward or ""helpful."" Strangers who offer to help carry your bags or purchase tickets may be thieves.

Prepare for winter driving by taking your car to the shop for a check-up.,
Have your battery tested, especially if your battery is more than three years old.,
Check your vehicle's belts and hoses for wear and tear.,
Have your vehicle's oil changed.,
Check the antifreeze level in your radiator.,
Replace any worn out wiper blades, as worn out blades will decrease visibility in the event of rain or snow.

,
Keep your gas tank at least half full to keep your vehicle's gas lines from freezing in cold temperatures due to build up of condensation in the lines.

,
Check the windshield washer fluid.,
Inspect your tires and replace any that are worn.,
Pack a winter survival kit that includes an ice scraper, shovel, sand or kitty litter, road flares, first aid kit, fire extinguisher, small tool kit, candle, matches, tin can, booster cables, tow rope, flashlight with extra batteries, extra shoes and socks, extra gloves, a change of warm clothing, paper towels, blanket and tool kit, at least one jug of water and extra food such as granola bars.

,
Plan your route in advance, using up-to-date road maps.,
Check road conditions and weather on your anticipated route and make any necessary adjustments such as altering your route or going earlier or later in the day.,
Pack plenty of snacks in case you're unable to stop for meals.,
Prepare for winter emergencies.",How to Prepare for a Winter Road Trip," Ask the mechanic to check your vehicle's brakes, lights, oil, tires, exhaust system, heater and defroster.;
, Auto repair stores usually perform this test for free if you don't own your own battery tester. Clean any corrosion from posts and connections.

, Replace any belts and hoses that look worn.

, Read your vehicle manual or ask your mechanic about the best type of oil to use for a winter road trip, as cold temperatures will cause oil to thicken.

, Use a mixture of half water and half antifreeze, which will prevent your radiator from freezing, even in very cold temperatures. Antifreeze is easy to test using an inexpensive antifreeze tester that you can purchase at hardware or auto parts stores. An antifreeze tester is a small plastic gadget that will determine the level and condition of antifreeze in your engine.

,,, If you're traveling in a cold climate, use a fluid that is rated for a minimum of −40 °F (−40 °C). Keep an extra container of fluid in the trunk.

, Check your tires often throughout your trip as tire pressure decreases in cold weather and under-inflated tires can be dangerous, especially on slick roads. If you'll be driving in snow, use winter tires which will provide better tracking and improve vehicle braking in the even of a skid.

,, Use main roads which are more likely to be plowed or sanded in bad weather. Let at least one friend or family member know your route, destination and your expected arrival time.

, If possible, avoid night driving during inclement weather.

, Include CDs or books on tape. If you're traveling with kids, pack a few games to prevent boredom.

, Carry a car charger for your cell phone, as your cell phone may be your lifeline if you car breaks down or if you're lost or stuck in the snow. Program your phone with any important numbers, such as emergency road service or weather or traffic reports.

Make lists a week or two before the trip.,
Make sure you have every thing you need, including things to entertain you or young children.,
Charge your electronics.,
Talk to people going on the trip beforehand.,
Be sure you have booked your hotel two or three days before you reach your destination to ensure availability.

,

Wear something comfortable.,
Check everything one last time before you leave.,
Choose your seat once you get in the car, if permitted.,
Drive to your destination.",How to Prepare for a Long Car Trip," List what will go in your suitcase and make another list of things you need to do before the trip. This can include getting a car tune-up, or washing/waxing/cleaning the car. This will help you be less stressed since everything is written on paper, and you will be less likely to forget something.;
, If you have a portable DVD player, make sure everything is set up in the car the night before, as it will save time later.

, Even if you have a car charger, it will be easier to sit back with your phone than being tangled with a cord.


Download what you need. Want the hottest new songs to listen to during the car ride? Download it. Want to get the new game that just came out? Download it. Want to watch the movie your friends say is awesome? Download it. Don't wait for the last minute to download new songs, apps, and movies.

, If you have people going with you on the trip, make sure you have everything planned out. Set a time for rest stops and when to switch turns in driving.


If you are one of several who drives, create a schedule to figure out who drives when and where.
Plan when you will take rest stops and when you will get food.

,, You don't want to be cramming all your hand luggage into your handbag.

, This gives you time to think about adding things in or taking things out and will generally make you less stressed before the trip.


Pack comfortably.

, This could include some books, electronic entertainment (handheld games, mp3 players, laptops, DVDs if the car has a DVD player, etc.), non-perishable snacks (such as granola bars and cookies), and drinks if you have a cooler. Remember that if you bring carbonated drinks, they may go flat.


Pack a pillow to sleep well.
You could go to your local library and check out books. Or get new books on your Kindle. Books are a good and easy way to pass time in the car. You could also get magazines or newspaper articles.
Talk to your family. Find out who wants to watch which movie at what time. It can become a big problem when you all want to watch a different movie or listen to different music.

, It's better to prepare your snacks beforehand than be scrambling to fill resealable bags at the last second. If your whole family is sharing a snack, don't bring the whole bag. Then you have to pass the bag around the car. It's easier to separate servings into resealable bags or plastic food containers so each family member can their own snack. Some good snacks to take might be:

Pretzels, chips
Cheese sticks
Veggies such as celery bite-sized pieces, carrot sticks and cherry tomatoes
Fruit such as mandarins and apple slices.

, Bring gum, peppermints and ginger on your trip. These foods can help ease queasiness on the trip and can help calm down the person eating or chewing them.

, Under your regular clothes, wear something comfortable (maybe even pajamas). Wear a pair of sweatpants, a light t-shirt, and a hoodie. You don't want to be uncomfortable for the entire length of a long car trip.

, Make sure everyone has used the bathroom, that you have money for gas, that there is entertainment in the car, and that nothing was left on in your house.

, Try not to sit behind someone who is notorious for pulling their seat back. Sitting by the window is generally a good choice, as you can open it if you need air and you can view the sights that you pass by.


Don't fight over seating. Switch around and share the different places.
Be considerate of anyone who gets very sick in the back seat––let them sit in the front.

, Punch the location in on your GPS system if you have one. Go to rest stops on the way there to get meals and use the bathroom.

Good things to see include art installations, national parks, museums, landmarks, and historic sites. Include these things into your travel plans.Landmarks include Machu Picchu in Peru, St. Peter’s Basilica in the Vatican City, and the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool in the United States.;
, You can visit festivals and shows that take place once a year. Do an online search for music or art events that are going on across your country and see when they are happening. If you can be in the right location at the right time, you'll be able to partake in the event.

Some special events that you can visit include Carnival in Brazil, Boryeong Mud Festival in South Korea, Burning Man in the United States, and the Harbin Ice and Snow Festival in China., Different regions contain different food preferences and unique cuisines. Search for highly rated restaurants in the areas where you'll be staying. Plan to stop and eat in different areas of the country so that you can try a diversity of food while you're traveling. If you want a more authentic experience, avoid large chains and fast food.For instance, in the United States, New England is known for their hearty dishes like pot roast, baked beans, and lobster, while the South is known for fried chicken, barbecue, and soul food.If traveling across the United Kingdom, you can try haggis in Scotland, pea pudding in Northumberland, and scouse, a lamb stew, in Liverpool., While it's good to plan, it's also important that you leave space in your schedule so you can adapt to what happens on the trip. You shouldn't turn down unique or fun experiences like visiting roadside attractions or specialty stores.If you are traveling and you see signs for special stores or attractions, you can amend your original plan to find something unique.Pick one or two must-see locations, and be flexible when it comes to the rest of your stops.
Famous roadside attractions include The Enchanted Highway in North Dakota, Lucy the Elephant in New Jersey, and Paul Bunyan in Minnesota."

Keep in mind that you'll have to pay for gas, lodging, food, and any entry fees that might be associated with the events or places you want to visit. If you have a limited amount of money to spend, find free things that you can see or do on your trip.

Many historic sites, outdoor art installations, and markets are free of charge.

, The cost of driving your own car or renting one cross country will be about the same.Some rental companies have locations coast to coast, so it's possible that you can do a one-way cross-country drive and drop the car off at the destination.


Driving your own vehicle cross country will save you upfront money on rental fees but will cost money in repairs from wear and tear on the road.
Consider renting a fuel-efficient car to save you gas money.

, When you go cross-country, you'll need a place to stay when you stop driving. Search online for hotels or motels that are in places where you want to stop. If you're looking for cheaper alternatives, you can also try house sharing websites like Couchsurf, Airbnb, or hostels to save some money., Unless you plan on buying things as you travel, you'll need enough clothes for the length of the trip. After planning the route of your trip, determine how many days the trip will take, and how many pairs of clothes you'll need. Remember to bring basic toiletries as well, like a toothbrush, razors, deodorant, and any prescription medicine., If you are plan on working on your drive, you'll need to have the proper technology. Luckily, many motels and hotels come with free WiFi so that you can respond to emails and do work while you're on the road."

Pick a meaningful destination.,
Plan out where you will make stops.,
Create a romantic playlist.,
Take a scenic route.",How to Make a Road Trip Romantic1," When planning a road trip, the destination is as important as the journey. You will want to enjoy your destination as much as your beloved. You may want to pick the location together to ensure that you both contribute to the destination and are both happy with the choice. A surprise trip may not be fun if your significant other does not enjoy the chosen location.Pick a location that has significance or meaning for one or both of you. For example, you could visit the city where you both first met, or you could both visit a childhood home.
If you do want to make the trip a surprise, but don’t know where your loved one is interested in visiting, have them pick three places that they would someday like to visit and choose from one of those three places.;
, The time spent on the road is just as critical as the destination, especially if it is a longer route that could take two or more days. When planning your road trip, look carefully at a map of the route to find romantic places to stop. There may be a nature preserve or park to stop and have a romantic picnic. There may be a winery along your route, which can make for a romantic excursion. Perhaps there is a lake or river where you can rent a boat and paddle for your loved one while they relax.


If you’re not sure, try using a search engine to look for interesting locations along the interstate or route you plan on taking. For example, you could type into Google: “romantic stops along I-75.""

, A great way to set the mood for a road trip is with the right music. Assemble a playlist of songs that are meaningful to you and your significant other. These could be songs you both enjoy or songs that have sentimental value for the both of you, such as a wedding song or a song you both heard on your first date. Request input from your significant other as to some songs they would like to hear that evoke pleasant memories of the two of you.


On iTunes, click on “File” and select “New” and then “Playlist”
It will prompt you to name the playlist.
Go back to your library, and click and drag the songs from the library to the playlist in the lefthand menu.

, Taking a scenic, rather than the fastest, route will be both memorable and romantic. You and your significant other will bond as you take in the views and experience something new together. You could drive along the Pacific Coast Highway in California, Bear Tooth Highway in Wyoming and Montana, or Route 100 in Vermont, to name just a few of the beautiful highways in the United States."
"
Do something spontaneous.,
Play romantic road trip games.,
Take lots of pictures.,
Listen carefully to your partner.",How to Make a Road Trip Romantic2," Driving for hours on end can be tedious. Make it fun and exciting for you and your partner by doing something spontaneous, such as stopping at a coffee shop you’ve never been to, or stopping at a museum you’ve never heard of. Doing something new or unplanned can be exciting and could spark romance between the two of you, as you both experience something different together.

, Games can be used to amuse both of you on the road and spark romance as well. They can spark creativity, laughter, or romantic conversations, effectively keeping both of you entertained for hours at a time. Take some time before your trip to learn a game or two you can play on the road. You could be surprised at what you end up learning about each other along the way.


Play “Would You Rather.” This game will get those creative juices flowing, as both of you think of crazy, embarrassing, terrifying, or even wonderful options to offer to the other person. The other person has to choose which option they would do. For example, you could say, “Would you rather receive a dozen roses every week or be told you're beautiful every day?” This game can get very interesting and you may learn a lot about your partner. It can also be an opportunity to spark a fun, flirty conversation or a deep, romantic conversation in which you learn more about your part net and how they see the world., As you make stops along your road trip, make sure to take plenty of pictures. As you both bond over a new adventure together, you will have pictures to preserve the memories. Take silly pictures as well, so that you can both have something to laugh about and fondly remember.

, As you are on the road together for hours at one time, it is likely that you will stumble into a conversation that is very meaningful, serious, or philosophical. Listen to your partner with an open heart and mind. Hold their hand as they speak, to show that you care about them and support them. Remember to show affection to your significant other and to remind them how important they are to you."

Hide a love note or gift.,
Go to a romantic dinner.,
Go for a walk.,
Set devices aside.",How to Make a Road Trip Romantic3," When you get to your destination, find some time to hide a small gift or a love note written to your partner. You can hide it in their belongings while they are occupied in the bathroom or in one of the drawers of the hotel. You can get very creative with this, such as setting up a scavenger hunt (which would require a lot of work, preparation, and time to yourself to set this up properly).

, There are few things as romantic as a candlelit dinner with you and your loved one at a nice restaurant you both enjoy. This may be something worth splurging on if you are in the mood to do so. Choose an upscale restaurant and treat your beloved to a wonderful dinner.


If you are willing to pay extra, some restaurants will allow you to have a customized menu for special occasions, such as anniversaries. Call the restaurant ahead of time to find out if they will allow you to do so and how much they charge. It usually requires printing an extra menu or two with your names or a message written at the top.

, When you have arrived at your destination, take your beloved and go for a walk. Enjoy the sights that your location has to offer. If it’s a city, walk around the downtown for a while and get a glimpse of the building and the nightlife (if it’s nighttime). If you chose a rural destination, go out for a hike and enjoy the outdoors. Discovering new things with your loved one will bring the two of you closer and will help you to bond and create memories that will last forever.

, A romantic way to spend time with your partner is to set aside quality time where both of you keep your smartphones and tablets turned off and put away (or left behind in your hotel room) to focus completely on each other. Nothing kills the vibe more than you or your partner checking phone notifications or texting other people. Show your significant other how much you care by giving them your undivided attention, free from distracting devices.

Exchange in the country you travel to.,
Avoid the airport and hotels.",How to Exchange Currency," If you've never exchanged currency before, it's a good idea for you to understand a bit about the process so that you don't get any expensive surprises. The general idea is that you'll find a business that exchanges currency, and they'll give you the currency that you want in exchange for a small fee (plus, obviously, the amount of money you want changed). Now, in addition to this, it's important to understand that some currencies are worth more than others. For example, a single euro is usually equivalent to $1.30 USD or .80 GBP. How much the difference is will fluctuate, usually with the state of those economies. So, even though you're exchanging $100, you may only get out 75 euro.


Your goal, then, is to exchange currency when your currency is high and the foreign currency is low, because this means that you'll get more of the foreign money than you would otherwise.
Understand that the dollar (for example) being worth less than the euro doesn't have much to do with the cost of items. The relative cost of items is determined by the market in that area. So, for example, a banana in the US is much cheaper than a banana in Sweden, even though the dollar is strong compared to krona.;
, It is important to exchange some money before you leave for your trip. You’ll probably encounter the advice that it’s better to exchange currency in the country you’re traveling to and that’s usually true. However, you will want to have some cash prepared for when you arrive. There is going to be some amount of travel time, between landing in your destination and getting the chance to exchange more money, where lots of things can go wrong. It’s a good idea to have a little cash on hand, including small bills and coins if possible, so that you’re prepared for anything.


The amount that you should have will vary by where you’re traveling to, but the equivalent of $40 USD is generally a good starting point, if you’re going to be in your destination for more than 3 days.

, Before you exchange money or decide how much to exchange, do a little research on the exchange rate. The rate will fluctuate and if you’re likely to exchange a lot of money, you’ll want to time it carefully so that you don’t lose too much money. Generally, you’re better off waiting to exchange most of your money until you arrive. However, if the rate for your home currency is falling, you’re better off exchanging almost everything you’ll need before you go.


Googling “currency exchange rate” will bring up a chart for your chosen currencies, letting you gauge where your currency currently sits.

, The easiest place to exchange currency when you’re at home is at your bank. Go to the banking institution that you use and tell them that you’d like to exchange currency. The upside of bank exchanging is that most banks will charge only a very small fee for exchanging currency (if they charge a fee at all) and you’ll know you’re getting a good rate.


The only trick here is that, unless it is a very major bank in a very major city, they’re unlikely to have the currency on hand. You’ll need to order the currency at least a few days and sometimes as much as two weeks in advance. Plan ahead!

, Before you leave, call your bank or go in and ask about what their policy is of charging your card overseas. Many banks will charge you a fee for using your card, at an ATM, foreign bank, for writing checks, etc. when you’re overseas. If they charge a lot of fees, you might want to see about starting up a separate bank account with another bank. Shop around until you find a bank that charges low or no fees at all. Then, transfer your money into that account. You can then use this account whenever you want to travel abroad.


Some banks charge a monthly fee for having below a certain amount of money in your account. If you plan on keeping a traveler’s account, you’ll want to plan on keeping at least a certain amount of money in the account at all times, to avoid incurring fees.

, It is possible to order money online as well. This will need to be done before you leave, as it isn’t particularly safe to do once you arrive. The rates tends to be up-to-date and the fees fair, but the cost to have the money shipped to you can make this option undesirable. If you’re feeling a bit lazy, however, this can save you a trip to the bank.


The best time to do this is if you’re planning on getting a lot of cash exchanged. If you order a large amount, somewhere in the hundreds to thousands of dollars, then you can ask them to waive the delivery fees. Some companies may do this and it makes the rate you get much more reasonable., When you travel outside of your country, you should be prepared to pay cash for a lot more services and products than you normally would at home. Not all countries have the widespread use of cards that is seen in English speaking countries. This means that you should be aware that you might have to pay for things with cash that you’re accustomed to using your card to buy normally. Plan ahead.


This is especially common in poorer countries. They often have less infrastructure for the widespread use of cards.

, Your best bet for exchanging currency when you’re traveling is to use an ATM. Find an ATM with a major bank in the area and then, so long as you have one of the major VISA or Master/Maestro cards, you’ll be able to do basic transactions like withdrawing money. This will usually give you the best rate and if you have a travel-friendly bank, you’ll hardly pay any fees at all.


Finding an ATM can be tricky. Your best best will be to let Google be your guide. Get to a place, early on, where you will have internet access and then ask Google Maps for the locations of all nearby ATMs. You can also usually locate an ATM by locating a bank. If you don’t know where to find those, ask a local hotel concierge or taxi driver.

, When you can, simply pay for items and services with your card. As long as it’s one of the major cards (VISA or Master/Maestro card), any business that takes credit and debit cards should be able to take your card without problems. This is handy because your bank will simply exchange the money on their end and you don’t have to worry about exchanging currency yourself much at all.


Be aware, however, that you may encounter problems with the card itself. Certain countries have switched to the more secure chip-and-pin system. Certain card readers will then be unable to read the traditional North American swipe card.
Again, some banks charge extortionate fees for this. Know what your bank charges before you leave.

, Just like you can exchange currency at home with a local bank, you can also use any bank once you arrive in your destination. This can be tricky but much like it is at home, you’re more likely to get a legitimate rate and minimal fees.


You might think the language barrier will be your biggest issue but as long as you’re in a fairly large city and you go to a major bank in a central location, you’re very likely to find at least one teller who speaks English.
The main problem is that some banks won’t exchange currency if you’re not a customer. Your best bet is to ask around and hope for the best. If they won’t exchange your currency, they’ll probably at least be able to help you find a bank that will. They are much more likely to exchange your currency if you’re withdrawing money using your card, since this is more secure for them.
You can also ask your hotel concierge to help you find a bank that will exchange your currency.

, This is not your best option but it is an option that is available. Pre-paid cards are like debit cards but they have a set amount of cash on them. You can order these before you leave or you can buy them once you arrive. However, the rates on these tend to be terrible, some businesses may not accept them, and you’re in hot water if you lose it. Still, for some people it might be the best option they have.


Be extremely cautious when purchasing these cards. They should only come from reputable vendors.

, Before you leave or at least before you exchange too much money, plan ahead on what you’ll be doing and how much money you’ll need. Exchange on the low side of how much you think you’re going to use. This way, you won’t risk over-exchanging and wasting money on having to exchange the money back once you return.


This will also help you incur the minimum number of fees, if the exchange fee with your chosen method is a one-time fee (such as at an ATM or bank).

, Look up the most current exchange rate before you exchange money using a service, especially if you’re using a currency exchange service specifically. Businesses that specialize in exchanging currency and some small businesses that exchange currency will both often give you an outdated exchange rate that works in their favor, so that they can make more money off of you.


Download an app before you leave so that you can easily check the exchange rate on your phone. Just be careful to only leave data on when you’re actively checking the rate, so that you don’t go over on your data plan while you’re abroad.

, Don’t be afraid to find out what you can get at a different location. Banks may be less of an issue, although some banks might have less fees than others, but currency exchange businesses will definitely have very variable rates. This will also give you the added bonus of possibly being able to haggle with the business, since a small currency exchange will be more willing to fight for your business.

, If you are in an area where you have the option to pay in your own currency, do that.Usually, if a business allows this they will tell you or the price will be marked. Make sure you’re informed about the exchange rate before paying, however. You can expect a small markup, so that they can pay the exchange fees on their end, but it should only be small.


This is most common in areas and countries where your currency is very highly valued or is used frequently.

, Most of the time, your best bet is to exchange your money in the country you travel to. This is especially true if you’re coming from one of the major countries to a minor one, because your money will be more highly valued. The idea is that you want to carry as little cash on you as possible when you’re traveling (although you can keep cash in hidden or secure locations, such as a hotel safe) so exchanging once you get there is better than possibly forgetting your wallet at an airport layover in Bangladesh.

, Do not, as much as is humanly possible, exchange currency at an airport or hotel. You will get charged huge fees and you will get a terrible exchange rate. Be especially cautious if they advertise as having “zero fees” or “fee free”, because those places will give you the worst exchange rate possible. Exchanging in either of these locations should be a last resort.

Clear enough land, if necessary, to site the travel trailer.,
Skirt the bottom of the trailer well with impervious material, all-around, to block wind and cold.,
Winterize your trailer by improving the insulation of the floor, walls, windows, door(s), and ceiling.,
'Summarize' your trailer by erecting a ""shade house"" -- an open, wooden or wire, trellis structure attached to the north side of the trailer.,
Grow as much of your own food as possible.,
Water.",How to Homestead in a Travel Trailer," Almost every state has land that is longer than a one-hour drive from an urban area and without utilities. These are priced much cheaper than other properties. Prices of from $1,000 to $5,000 per lot are still possible to find in such areas.

Check Craigslist, eBay, the local newspapers, and the local free advertising tabloids. Avoid realtors if possible, since they will take a cut from any sales. If you don't have the cash to buy a lot outright, look for phrases such as, ""owner will hold,"" meaning that the owner will agree to finance the property. If you go this route, though, don't expect the absolute lowest price.
Ensure that the land is not in a floodplain and that the title is clear. Examine the mineral and logging rights and any easements for access. Check to assure there are no outstanding native/indiginous tribal land claims.



 

;
, You should be able to find a serviceable travel trailer for under $5,000, especially if you search during the off-season.

Consider dealers. They will mark up the price of a used trailer but will sometimes add value by making repairs and issuing a warranty. Sometimes you can negotiate with the owner or dealer to tow the trailer to your site as part of the deal. If not, rent a truck or hire a service to do it if you can't yourself. Add the trailer to your auto insurance policy temporarily so you are covered during the move.







, Do not site on a hilltop or saddle, if possible, to avoid cold temperatures due to swirling winds, danger from fires which can engulf all sides of a hill at once, and often poor soil. Similarly, do not site in a valley with poor drainage and stagnant air. Siting on a gentle slope or on flat land is usually optimal. Site the trailer with the majority of windows and the door facing south for passive heating in winter and cooling in summer.

, Alternatively, consider digging a trench and backing the trailer down into it so that the wheels are below ground level and the door is at ground level. (This may present an issue, however, when it rains or snows. Check the drainage.)

, Insulate tubular vessels and pipes. Consider painting the exterior with one of the new ceramic insulating paints based on technology developed by NASA for the Space Shuttle, which can increase the ""R"" value of your wall insulation by 9 units or more. Eventually, you might want to erect a ""carport"" overhead (see How to Construct an Inexpensive Shelter) to prevent damage and noise from rain and also snow buildup on the trailer roof. (It will reflect the hot summer sun, too!)


Advanced winterizing includes attaching an inexpensive home-built wood/PVC and plastic greenhouse to the south side of the trailer to capture heat from the winter sun and direct it into the trailer. Storing the heat of the sun with black-painted 55 gallon (208.2 L) drums filled with water will heat your trailer at night as the stored heat is released through a window or vent. A greenhouse floor of heat-storing gravel, rocks, or concrete slab will behave similarly. Finally, the water in the drums will also function as an emergency water supply as well as aid in extinguishing fires.

, Grow climbing and/or creeping vines, such as grape vines on the ""roof"" and the ""walls"" for shade, food, and beauty. Cool air will enter the shade house and flow through the north windows into the trailer. You can surround the trailer with such vines on -- or a few inches away from -- the surface (to prevent possible longterm damage to the exterior). Studies show that such ""living walls"" can repel up to 70% of the heat from the sun during the summer and prevent up to 30% of heat loss from inside during the winter.

, If your soil is poor, grow in containers or improve the soil with compost and mulch or sheet mulch it well with any available free or low-cost natural materials.

Potatoes can grow almost anywhere, such as in a contractor's bag full of hay, straw, or finished compost. Tomatoes can grow from hanging baskets. Your greenhouse will supply you with fresh produce throughout the winter. Alternatively, some seed companies feature cold-hardy seeds that also tolerate reduced sunlight as another way to lengthen the growing season.







, There are several ways to supply water in rural areas. Rainwater catchment strategies abound. Or for well drilling, consider the inexpensive do-it-yourself driven-point well technique. Additionally, in remote and arid regions there are often inexpensive water delivery services. You'll need to set up a plastic cistern or a more expensive metal or concrete tank and conserve water to benefit.


Washing clothes. Save them up and do them at the laundromat in town when you do your shopping. Or, do it the old red-knuckles way on a washboard and tub. An improvement is the inexpensive 'Yukon plunger' -- basically a metal cone with a furrowed interior and wooden handle which looks like a common drain plunger on steroids. With an up-and-down motion it churns the clothes under pressure driving the soapy water or rinse water into and out of the fabric.

Songs with an upbeat tune. If you're driving, you'll probably be tired and you don't want to lose control of the wheel. Choose upbeat songs to keep you awake and feeling fresh.
A lot of songs. If the ride is long, running out of songs and having to replay them can make music become boring. You can calculate how long the ride will be and try to bring enough songs to last the ride.

, You can find many interesting books or podcasts to listen to while on the road. This is helpful if you'd like to read in the car but you're the one driving or you easily get carsick doing so.


There are a variety of genres of podcasts to listen to. Some podcasts are comedic, some are creative, and some are educational. They can last anywhere from 5 minutes to 2 hours long.
Audiobooks give a dramatic feel to conventional book-reading. Some books have different narrators and styles of narration. Sample each narrator to find one that you like the best.
If you want your kids to keep entertained by watching videos offline on YouTube, download the videos they want before the trip. Don't wait for the last minute!

, A long car ride is a perfect environment to learn a new skill, language, or subject. Bring along audio lessons, textbook materials, and supplies to take notes.


If you're travelling in a bus or in a car with internet connection, you can even do research online with a laptop or on your smartphone.
If you have homework or paperwork to complete, a car ride provides you with ample time to finish these tasks.

, One of the easiest ways to pass time is to sleep. Wear comfortable clothes or change into your pyjamas to create a comfy environment to lull yourself to sleep.


Bring a neck pillow to help support your head. It can get uncomfortable sleeping while sitting up in a car. A neck pillow can prevent you from getting neck cramps and protect your head from hitting the window while driving on a bumpy road.
Listen to relaxing music if you're having trouble sleeping.

, iPads, tablets, portable DVD players, laptops, and portable game consoles can be very entertaining, especially if you load them up with games and movies.


Remember to bring each device's chargers. Purchase or bring a car charger to charge your devices while in the car.

, A good, long book should occupy you for a while. Just look up every now and then to stop yourself from feeling sick.


Bring multiple books in case you finish one or you feel like reading another book.
Bring books about your destination. By the time you arrive, you'll be an expert and can point out the best places to eat, shop, and find entertain.

Know the limitations of your own car insurance.,
Find out if your credit card company provides any kind of protection.,
Check if you're covered under any of the following specific conditions:


On a business trip - Some personal auto policies might not cover rentals on business trips.Most insurance companies DO NOT cover any automobile use that involves delivery for business purposes of food, materials, supplies, papers or people.,
If you are not covered adequately by your own insurance policy and/or the credit card company, then you might want to consider the rental agency's options - any insurance is better than no insurance.",How to Know Which Insurance to Take on a Rental Car," When you rent a car, most private auto insurance companies' coverage (the coverage you have on your own personal automobile) transfers over to the rental vehicle during the time the rental is utilized by you. Call your insurance agency to make sure.


If you allow additional drivers who are NOT on your personal auto policy, you run the risk that if those persons are operating the rental, they, and the damages they cause, will not be covered. Ask your insurance company about this.
If your policy provides minimum coverage, you may need to compute the value of the loss or damage of a newer vehicle (the rental car) and decide if you need to supplement your coverage. Personal auto policies that extend collision coverage to a rental car may only provide a coverage limit equal to the value of your own vehicle. If the value of your personal vehicle is less than that of the rental vehicle, you could still incur some damage responsibility.;
, Some credit card companies offer rental car insurance coverage if you use their card to pay for the rental.


Ask about the requirements for getting reimbursed. For example, you may not be reimbursed if you don't notify the credit card company within a certain period of time (e.g. 45 days) after the incident.Typically, for credit card insurance to work, the rental car has to be paid in full with that credit card, and you must decline the rental company's collision waiver, and be the primary renter of the car (although additional authorized drivers are also covered).,
Long-term rentals - Coverage may be limited.Most credit card company plans cover vehicles rented for up to one month.In a foreign country - Coverage may not apply.Certain rental vehicles - Some rental vehicles aren't covered (exotic cars, camper, pickup trucks, etc.), Hindsight is 20/20, and it is always better to pay a nominal amount per day rather than having to pay thousands of dollars over years in a payment plan for property damage, or having liens placed against you for bodily injury damage. There are a few plans that most states are required by law to offer:


Collision damage waiver (CDW), also known as ""optional vehicle protection"" or ""loss damage waiver"" (LDW). Loss damage waiver means that if the car is damaged for any reason, you can just walk away without any liability. This is true even if your own personal auto policy carries over. This gets you out of paying the deductible that you would normally have to pay under your own car insurance policy, unless the waiver itself has a deductible.

costs up to $19/day
shifts liability for collision damage from you to the car rental company
covers for ""loss of use"". Loss of use is a fee that is charged by the rental company if your rental car is damaged and is sent out for repair. You would be billed a loss-of-use fee for all damages and repair to the rental car as well as a fee for every day that the vehicle was not able to be rented. That can add up! A loss-of-use fee is not normally covered by personal auto insurance policies.
can be voided if you were driving illegally or on unpaved roads
If you don't have collision and comprehensive insurance of your own, it's generally a good idea to buy a waiver. There are different levels, dictating how much your responsible for (none of the damage, damage in excess of $500 or $3000, etc.).Liability insurance

protects for up to $1 million
costs between $7 and $14 a day
if you already have an insurance policy, you already have this
Most states require rental companies to cover a minimum liability at no cost to you. Check to see what those requirements are in your state, and decide if that is sufficient for you.Personal accident insurance

covers medical and ambulance bills for anyone in the car
costs $1-5 a day
you probably don't need this if you have an existing car insurance policy, or if you (and everyone else in the car) has adequate health insurance coverage


Personal effects coverage

covers theft of items in vehicle
costs $1-4 a day
an alternative is to buy a floating policy under home or renters insurance so valuable items are fully protected wherever you go

Call the car rental agency.,
Consider what country you’re traveling to.,
Identify the nations which do not require or recognize the IDP.,
Think about what kind of vehicle you’ll be renting.,
Collect the necessary paperwork.,
Apply for the IDP.,
Bring your regular driver’s license with you.",How to Know if You Need an International Drivers Permit for a Car Rental Overseas," The easiest way to discover if you need an IDP to rent a car overseas is to contact the agency directly.Call or email a representative from the agency you plan on renting a car from. The agency can tell you their policy regarding whether or not an IDP is needed to rent a car from them.


Check the law regarding whether an IDP is needed to drive in that country. While a car rental service might be more than willing to rent a car to you without an IDP, their policy may not be in concert with the law regarding who can legally drive a car in that country.
Conversely, a country may not legally require an IDP, but a rental agency might.;
, If you’re traveling to an English-speaking country, you’re probably fine just using your US driver’s license.If you travel for business, think about where your company does business and what countries you might be asked to travel to. If you’re traveling for pleasure, you will have a better idea as to where you want to go.


In either case, if you intend to travel to any nation within the English-speaking world, you might be able to get away with skipping the application for an International Driving Permit. For instance, an American driver can probably rent a car in Canada or South Africa without needing an IDP.
Japan requires the IDP for foreign drivers.In France and Germany, you can drive with just a US driver’s license as long as it is accompanied by a notarized French or German translation, respectively.15 nations (Bahrain, Brunei, Croatia, Curaçao (Netherlands Antilles), Georgia, Israel, Lebanon, Mauritius, Namibia, the Philippines, Qatar, Samoa, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, and Tanzania) require an IDP to hire a car., Brazil, China, and several other major nations do not recognize the IDP. Therefore, you will not be asked to produce an IDP in countries which do not accept the IDP as valid.


Brazil and several Central and South American nations accept a similar document, the Inter-American Driving Permit.Consider bringing the IADP when renting a car in a relevant nation.

, While most people think of the IDP as necessary when renting or driving a regular passenger car overseas, few know that the IDP can and should be used to drive many other types of vehicles. Below your identification info and above your permit is a row of vehicle options; you will need to choose at least one in order to obtain the IDP.


In addition to the passenger car, you can request that your IDP cover the use of vehicles over 7,700 pounds; vehicles over eight seats, and vehicles with heavy trailers. You need a license to operate such vehicles in the US, too, if you want to operate them abroad.You can use the IDP to rent or drive a motorcycles as well. Simply check the “motorcycle” option above your signature in order to indicate you want your IDP to reflect the fact that you hold a motorcycle license in the US and want to ride one in a foreign nation which honors the IDP.
Many nations do not require a license for small-engine vehicles. A 50cc scooter or electric bike, for instance, requires no license to drive or rent in much of East and Southeast Asia., When applying for an IDP, you will need several important items. First, you’ll need your regular driver’s license. You’ll also need two passport photos. Finally, you’ll need to fill out the IDP application and a check covering the application fee ($15 through AAA, $25 through NAC with domestic priority shipping).You can apply for the IDP with either the American Automobile Association, and the National Auto Club. The applications are available at https://www.aaa.com/vacation/idpapplc.html and http://www.thenac.com/international_driving_permit.pdf, respectively.
Do not apply with any other agency or organization; there are many fraudulent IDP purveyors out there.Your US driver’s license must be valid for at least 6 months beyond the issuance date of your IDP.
Only checks are accepted, not cash.

, You can apply for the IDP either by mail or in person. If applying by mail, send your assembled documents to the appropriate address. If applying through AAA, you can also drop your application off at your local AAA office for processing.


Dropping the application off in person is a good idea if you have questions or concerns regarding your application
Emailed or faxed applications cannot be accepted., With your IDP in hand, you might think you’ll be ready to rent a car in any of the countries listed. However, it is important to remember that your IDP only supplements your regular driver’s license. You will need both to rent and drive a car in another country."

Check gas prices using online fuel calculators and gas station price comparison charts to determine what major regions have the cheapest gas on your way to Miami.;
, This will determine how many miles you need to drive each day to reach Miami within your desired time frame. The total distance between Bangor and Miami is 1,731 miles (2785.774 km) and would take nearly 28 hours if you drove continuously without stopping.


Taking the scenic route and driving just 250 miles (402.336 km) each day will put you in Miami in 1 week.
Drive 346 miles per day (556.833 km) and your trip will require about 5 days to arrive in Miami.

,


Leisurely drivers who take 7 days to get to Miami may want to explore the sights in Boston, Massachusetts; New York, New York; Fredericksburg, Virginia; Raleigh, North Carolina; Charleston, South Carolina and finally, Saint Augustine Florida.
Faster-paced road trippers who want to arrive in roughly 5 days may find it practical to stop in Hartford, Connecticut; Alexandria, Virginia; Florence, South Carolina and Jacksonville, Florida.

, Campers who pitch a tent or park their RV along the way to Miami will find more accommodations options during the summer season when everything is open. Many East Coast campgrounds close after Labor Day and those that are open may not have full utilities such as sewer dumps and piped water.


Travelers who prefer hotel stays have year-round choices but making advance reservations will often result in lower rates.

,


Put your newspaper and mail on hold and ask a friend to check on your home. If you have small pets that can be left alone for long periods of time, such as fish, hire a pet sitter who will do everything from feeding your pets to making sure that nighttime security lights are functioning.

, Some of the best road trip stories occur when you don't plan too far ahead. But if you're traveling during the summer season, reservations are mandatory near major East Coast attractions.

Count things.",How to Not Get Bored on a Long Car Ride3," An interesting way to spark a riveting conversation is to debate. Simply choose a topic and have one person argue for it and another to argue against it.


Remind yourself and your companions that the debate is just a game. A fun debate can quickly turn into a heated argument that might create discomfort between everyone in the car.
Choose funny and light-hearted topics. Avoid heavy or complex topics to keep everyone in good spirits. Instead of arguing about morals or religious beliefs, debate about whether strawberries are the best kind of berry or whether squirrels are cute or just plain annoying.

, There are many word games that can be competitively fun and entertaining, in situations where you're driving alone or with others:


Have a spelling bee.
Name all the countries of the world.
Name all the states or provinces or a country.
Think of words that rhyme with each other as fast as you can. Whoever stops the pace, loses.
Say one word at a time. Have each person say one word to create a sentence or story. You might come up with some hilarious examples.

, Read aloud a book or play and have everyone in the car act out a role or multiple roles.

Play two truths and a lie. Have one person tell two truths and a lie. The others must guess which statements are truths and which one is a lie.
Play Never Have I Ever. Each person will keep track of their own points, or hold up 10 fingers, or even be prepared to drink or eat something every time someone says something they have never done, but has actually done the activity. For example, Sally will say, ""Never have I ever danced on stage."" If Bob has danced on stage before, he will lose a point or have to eat or drink something to show that he has indeed done that activity.
Play truth or dare. However, be careful when designing the dares, ensuring that they can be safely done inside or outside the car.

Many US hotels have their own self-service laundries.,
Keep alternatives in mind.,
Watch your timing.,
Shower first.,
Plan where you will hang the laundry before you get anything wet.,
Place the sink stopper (plug) in the drain.

,
Add laundry and soap, shampoo, or detergent, as you fill the sink with cool or warm water.

,
Wash the clothes by moving them around in the soapy water.,
Rub the fabric against itself gently to help the soap do its job.

,
Drain the soapy water out of the sink and squeeze the laundry gently to get most of the soap out.

,

,

,
Roll the towel around them and squeeze to remove most of the excess water, or put the rolled towel on the floor and walk back and forth on it.,
Hang the clothes to dry.,
Hang the towel to dry also.

,
Dry garments the rest of the way.",How to Do Laundry While Traveling," Part of being able to do laundry on the road is packing accordingly. Pack lighter, wrinkle-resistant clothing that will dry quickly.


If it will be cold at your destination, dress in layers. You can use lighter garments, and you may not need to wash the outer layers as frequently as the inner ones.

Pack fewer garments. Plan to wash a few items more often. You can travel with as few as two or three changes of clothing and not have to carry so much luggage.
Plan to wear some items more than once before they are washed. You should wear clean underwear daily, but you can wear pants and outer shirts a couple of times before washing, if they are not too dirty. However, make sure they pass the smell test: if the strong odor you notice is not detergent or fabric softener, wash it.;
, It is generally easiest to find these items at home, where you know the area. See the list below in the Things You'll Need section. If you choose wisely, all the laundry supplies together can take up less space and require less weight than one change of clothes.

, Be sure to bring sufficient change in addition to travel-size detergent sealed in a baggie in case of accident. Dryer sheets such as fabric softener and color/stain removers travel well in baggies. Consider bringing a tube or two of spot remover for small soiling emergencies. (These are also great at work, in the car, or even in your home laundry.)

, If you are more willing to spend money rather than time, you need not do all your laundry yourself.


Find out if there is a laundry service where you are staying. Many hotels and hostels offer laundry service, which can be a good option if your budget permits or your wardrobe requires it.
Look for a laundromat or laundry service near where you are staying. Most towns and cities have them. They are a good alternative to washing clothes by hand, especially if you have more clothes to wash at once.
Remember that you can mix approaches for laundry. You might pay to send clothes that need to look good for a business meeting but wash underwear and pajamas by hand in the sink to save time and money.
Check days and times. Depending on where you are, laundry service may not be available on Sundays. You may need to drop off your laundry before a certain hour to have it back the same day or the next day.

, If you have a couple of days' outfits and you think ahead a bit, you can generally avoid having to cram damp clothing into a suitcase just before a long flight or bus trip.

, While not strictly required, it will get you out of your dirty clothes (the ones you need to wash) and it will mean you shower with a dry towel if you're doing laundry by hand.


Consider showering in the evening, either before dinner if you need to freshen up, or before bed. You'll avoid taking the day's travels with you to bed, and your laundry and towel will have overnight to dry.

, Almost any hotel or hostel room will have some option for hanging laundry if you get creative, but it's far better to figure out where to hang stuff before you have a bunch of wet laundry.

,,, You can apply extra soap or detergent directly to any stains and any places you know are dirty: bottoms of socks, underarms, underwear, and so on.

,,, Squeeze the water through the fabric a bit.

,, Do not wring or twist the fabric. Just squeeze. The more water you get out this way, the less your towel will need to soak up.

,, At this point, most garments should dry reasonably quickly and you should be able to hang them without too much dripping.

, Leave as much space around them as possible, and leave closet doors or windows open (climate and security permitting) to ensure air circulation.


Many hotel rooms include at least a few hangers in their closets.

,, If hanging overnight did the job, great. If not, try these options.


Use the hotel iron. Many hotel rooms include irons and ironing boards, and you can press the whole garment or just touch up cuffs, collars, pockets, etc. that didn't dry completely. Make sure the fabric can take the heat, and avoid ironing silkscreens on t-shirts.
Leave it hanging longer. If you're staying another day and one or two things in the closet won't be in the way of the hotel staff, leave it be.
If the room has forced-air heat or ventilation (like a blower, usually below the window), drape the garment so the airflow hits it. Either hang the garment on a chair in front of the blower or -- for faster drying, although it can make your garment kind of stiff -- drape it directly over the blower vent (reposition as needed).
Put it on, anyway. It may be a bit uncomfortable at first, but your body heat will help to dry stuff the last part of the way in a reasonable time. Don't do this if it's cold or if you already have a cold and are trying to stay warm.

Play classic car ride games.,
Play car-friendly games and activities.,
Read a book.,
Take turns navigating.,
Talk to each other.",How to Have Fun on a Car Trip2," Before there were tablets and cell phones, road trippers passed the time by playing car games. Car games are a fun way to engage with your fellow passengers and your changing surroundings. Participants are required to react quickly, think creatively, and remain observant. Classic car ride games include:


The License Plate Game—each time you spot a license plate from a different state, check off the state on a map. Whoever spots the most license plates from different states at the end of the trip wins.
The Alphabet Signs Game—scan signs, license plates, and billboards for the letters of the alphabet. Whoever spots all the letters, A through Z, in order first wins.
Custom Scavenger Hunt—prior to leaving for the trip, come up with a list of items, people, and places. Give everyone a list so they can keep track of their discoveries and points. Whoever finds the most items, people, and/or places by the end of the trip wins. Create your own car game. Determine who can repeat the most lines from a song or movie. Count the number of advertisements you see for a specific product. Have a contest to see who can purchase the wackiest souvenirs., There are plenty of wireless games and activities that you can play in the car. Trade in your tablet for a magnetic board game. Set aside your cell phone and pick up a card game. Put away your computer and pick up pens and an activity book or drawing pad.


Car friendly games include: Tic-Tac-Toe, magnetic checkers/chess, hangman, trivia card games, games that only require a deck of cards, such as solitaire or free cell.Car friendly activities include: drawing, journaling, crossword puzzles, word searches, sudoku puzzles, and fill-in-the-blank stories., Reading allows you to escape into another universe, time period, and/or life. Reading a captivating story (or even assigned reading) will help the miles fly by. Pick out a book or two from your local library or bookshop before you leave on your trip.


If you’re prone to car sickness, ask someone in the car to read out loud to everyone.

, Put your GPS in the glove box and pull out of good ol’ fashioned map. Every passenger can take turns reading the map and guiding the drive towards the next destination. You can even turn navigating into a game.


Print out maps and an itinerary of your trip for every passenger. Whenever someone asks “Where are we?” or “Are we there yet?” have them pull out their map and itinerary. They can use road signs and these resources to determine where they are and/or when they might arrive at their next destination., Road trips are excellent times to catch up with your loved ones, get to know new people, and create new memories. Spend time talking to the people in your car. You can share personal anecdotes, tell funny jokes, debate hot topics.


If you didn’t all participate in planning the trip, discuss the itinerary in the car."

Eat at local restaurants and markets.,
Visit local attractions.,
Take nature breaks.",How to Have Fun on a Car Trip3," When you take a road trip, it is tempting to eat along the interstate in an effort to “make good time.” Rather than rushing to your destination, slow down and enjoy the small communities and towns you are passing through. One of the best ways to experience a town or city is through its local eateries.


Stop for breakfast, lunch, or dinner at a locally owned restaurant.
Grab snacks and a coffee at the farmer’s market.
Pick out restaurants you would like to try before leaving on the trip or ask locals for recommendations., Your route to and from your final destination will be dotted with wonderful natural landmarks, quirky tourist traps, and unique historical sites. Don’t be afraid to deviate from your route to take in the region’s beauty and lore. Take a brief hiatus from the care whenever you see an attraction that peaks your interest.


Use the stops as restroom breaks.
Potential stops include local museums, factories, flea markets, roadside attractions, national parks, sports facilities, and university or college campuses., After spending endless miles cooped up in a car, road trippers can get a little stiff and stir crazy. Instead of pressing on, set aside time to stretch your legs and breathe fresh air. You and your passengers can stop at parks, playgrounds, waterfalls, caves, lakes, beaches, mountains, or deserts.


Have a picnic at the park
Take a thirty minute walk in the woods
Play frisbee at the playground
Dip your toes into an ocean, lake, river, or stream
Take a guided tour through a cave or cavern
Admire the beauty of the desert or the power of a waterfall"

Ditch the athletic shoes.,
Avoid wearing anything that has to do with the USA or America.,
Buy accessories at local stores, especially ones that you see the locals wearing, like scarves.,
Avoid US brand name clothing with easily readable names (e.g., Nike, Gap, Abercrombie, etc.).,
Dress a little nicer than usual.,
Dress appropriately for the local weather.,
Camouflage.,
Leave your baseball hats, backpack, fanny pack and water bottles at home.,
Be careful about socks.,
Avoid the stereotypical nylon cargo pants and travel shirt.,
Wear the same swimwear as the locals.",How to Avoid Looking Like an American Tourist1," White athletic shoes (otherwise referred to as tennis shoes or sneakers) are stereotypically American. Any shoes that don't look like they were meant for exercise will suffice. If you do wear socks, make sure they're dark or match the color of your pants. Flip-flops are also very noticeable as American attire, unless you're in a country like Brazil where Havaianas reign, or Australia or New Zealand where the Brazilian flip-flops are also ubiquitous. In most countries, open-toed sandals (Chacos, Tevas and Keens) are borderline at best, and may be totally unacceptable. Shoes are always the safest bet in urban areas. However, these are quite acceptable for hiking and active outdoor pursuits, just as they are here. Also, Crocs, the popular foam clogs, may be ubiquitous in the US, but in most of the world are regarded as ridiculous in the extreme and are worn mostly by gardeners and the very young, if at all. Sneakers like K-Swiss, Vans or Adidas in a dark color with no or very subtle logos are much less conspicuous and are a good compromise if you are planning to do a lot of walking.;
, In particular, avoid clothing with the city's name, the country or state's flag, or similar printing.

, Sometimes not wearing something could signal that you are a tourist. For example, in some countries, hats or scarves are worn by the majority, or most people wear neck scarves during the winter. Also, head scarves or coverings are required in some religious establishments. It would be wise to research this in advance and be prepared to take something with you if you plan to visit religious places. Wearing a headscarf incorrectly will signal that you are a tourist, and local people may be offended and feel that you are appropriating their customs. If you do not normally wear a headscarf, it may be better to only wear one when it is required.

, In fact, don't wear any slogans (like ""Virginia is for lovers"") as that will tie you to a specific place. Notoriously American brands are becoming more popular outside of the US due to globalization. However, it's still a good idea to stick to non-slogan clothing.

, Casual dress is not as common outside the USA. You will fit in better in most places if you wear long pants or skirts and buttoned shirts or blouses rather than sneakers, sweatshirts, t-shirts, jeans, or shorts -- especially athletic shorts. Blue jeans are not acceptable in all situations. Instead, pack versatile ""casual Friday"" business attire. Shorts are best avoided by all adults, especially women, except for hiking and similar activities. In many countries, adults wearing shorts are seen as silly, uncouth, half-naked, or worse. Use your eyes to adapt yourself to the finer points of personal appearance and grooming. Look around and see whether people tuck their shirts in or leave them hanging out. Sometimes this differs for men and women in the same country. In hot weather where you're tempted to wear shorts, consider a lightweight long sleeve shirt and linen pants instead. They may be more appropriate and will help limit sun exposure.

, Shorts and a t-shirt in cool climates (or wintertime) are a clear sign that you are not in touch with the local weather. Many Americans also tend to wear technical outdoor gear, such as down jackets and ski jackets, as casual winter outerwear. This is not common in most countries, even very cold ones. More formal coats of wool, fur, or leather are de rigueur. If you have one or are willing to buy one, bring it.

, What colors do the locals wear? Mostly black and other neutral shades, like in London, or bright, bold colors like in the Caribbean? Wear colors that you see the locals wearing. Folks in Paris, London, and other European capitals tend to wear lots of black, and as a tourist, you tend to blend in if you’re wearing it, too. Your hot pink sweater vest or bright blue collared shirt might be fashionable in Minneapolis, but it won't fly in Budapest. In tropical climes, keep in mind that local modes of dress may still be less casual than you expect - so a t-shirt and loud board shorts may still look silly. Check travel forums and photos online to get a feel for what the locals wear. In SE Asia any shirt with a collar is preferable to a T shirt.

, Baseball caps and fanny packs scream ""American!"" Besides,""fanny"" means something entirely different in some places, not to mention how unsafe these packs are. It's best to not carry bags of any kind, with your personal effects concealed about your person in pockets and on lanyards. A purse or tote bag, bought locally, may also work. If you are worried about getting sun in your eyes then wear sunglasses instead of a baseball cap.

, In some countries like Brazil, avoid wearing shorts with black socks - most people wear white socks and clothes that go with them. And most important, they don't pull the socks up to their knees like football players. In many countries, socks are never worn with shorts at all. If you plan to walk a lot where it's warm (like Spain) and want to wear shorts and socks, choose short socks that aren't visible above the tops of your shoes.

, While they may dry quickly and offer appealing functionality, avoid these unless you're trekking, rafting, or otherwise truly out in the wilderness. If you're simply sightseeing in a developed area with plenty of residents, it's almost guaranteed that the residents will find you comical at best and be offended at worst. Nothing will set you apart faster. Thankfully, it is possible to obtain clothing that offers the technical advantages of quick-dry nylon in styles that are unobtrusive.

, In many countries it is common for men to wear Speedos on the beach or at the pool. In some European countries, like France, men are even required by law to wear a Speedo in public pools. Wearing a swim short is forbidden. Also, wearing a swimming cap is required for both men and women in some countries.

It will be worth finding out about your destination’s social structure, religious practices and attitude toward foreign travelers. Reading up on where you’re headed is a must, as it will offer valuable insight into daily life there and give you an idea of what to expect as an outsider.For a casual vacation to the South of France, you might only need to look into acceptable dinner attire, whereas a work trip to Japan or the Netherlands should be prefaced with some investigation into how leaders there ordinarily conduct formal business.
Peruse travel blogs written by other visitors from around the world to get their take on a particular place.;
, How is the culture you come similar to that of the place you’re traveling to? How is it different? Look at yourself through someone else’s eyes and take note of values and characteristics that may set you apart from those around you. You might, for example, identify as a feminist and be headed for a place where women traditionally occupy a marginalized role in society. Try not to let culture clashes influence your attitude. Make it your mission to present the best of yourself and where you're from to others while you’re away.Remember that you’ll be representing your home country while abroad, even on casual pleasure trips.Be especially mindful when traveling to places that have been embroiled in conflict with your place of origin.

, The culture that you’ll be stepping into won’t be the same as your own, and that’s a good thing. Diversity is a quality that should be embraced. You might feel uncomfortable in a given cultural setting at first, but with an open mind you’ll start to see just how truly colorful and astounding the world can be.Let go of any stereotypes or generalizations about the place you’re visiting.
Using a squatting toilet or being warned against sitting with your legs crossed in Turkey might catch you off guard, but gaining a deeper understanding of these types practices is probably the one of the reasons you’re traveling in the first place.

, As a traveler, you’ll be in someone else’s backyard, which means you have an unspoken obligation to abide by their way of life. With this in mind, your behavior should be modest and in keeping with that of your native counterparts. This means being polite, considerate and eager to make a good impression without trying to show off or make light of your new environment. Keep your voice at a respectable volume in public places. Avoid shouting, cursing or doing anything that might cause a scene.
Know what the norms are when it comes to things like alcohol and tobacco use, photography and other forms expression.

, Though not a must, it can be extremely helpful to learn a few choice words and phrases in the local dialect. Not only is speaking another language a practical skill, as it will help you find your way around, it shows that you’re taking a genuine interest in the culture. This will allow you to forge more meaningful connections with the people you interact with.Memorize the names of important objects and places first, like the hotel, bathroom or cafe, to better orient yourself with the area.
Bring along a phrasebook, or use an app like DuoLingo or Rosetta Stone to polish your handling of a foreign tongue.If nothing else, learn to say “please,” “thank you” and other basic courtesies. In many cultures, this is a sign of good faith that you’re making an effort., Knowing how to act on foreign soil, and how not to act, can keep you from landing in hot water with the local people and authorities. For instance, it is customary in some parts of the world to greet someone with a bow or a kiss on the cheek rather than a handshake, or for couples to refrain from excessive displays of affection in public places. It’s important to abide by these regulations, even if you don’t understand or agree with them.Some more peculiar types of laws have come to be termed ""tourist traps"" because of their tendency to get unsuspecting travelers in trouble. Some examples of these include a chewing gum ban in Singapore and a law prohibiting motorists from stopping for pedestrians in Beijing.Take off your shoes before entering any private residence in Japan, Russia, Finland, Turkey or Switzerland., While you're carrying out your preliminary research, be sure to look up a list of ""don'ts"" for the area you'll be staying in. In the Middle East, India and some parts of Africa, for example, it's impolite to offer your left hand for a handshake due to that hand's association with unclean sanitary activities. Being informed will keep you from making an unfortunate faux pas.Be mindful not to touch anyone's head in countries where Buddhism is practiced or point the soles of your feet at anyone in Arabian cultures, as these are clear signs of disrespect.
Innocent hand gestures like the thumbs up, peace sign or ""A-OK"" motion may have vulgar alternative meanings depending on where you go.If you happen to offend someone inadvertently, apologize sincerely and gently remind them that you didn't know any better.

, Familiarize yourself with the particular country's tipping customs when eating out or hitching a ride. In some parts of the world, including Australia, Costa Rica and most of Europe, tipping is neither required nor expected. Everywhere else it is often extended as a gesture of gratitude. Remember that members of other professions, like rickshaw drivers and hotel porters, survive on tips as well, not just waiters.When in doubt, leave a modest but customary tip of 15% of the bill's total at dining establishments. Always tip using the local currency, if you can.Tipping in Japan and Korea may be construed as an insult.

, Most people are used to wearing whatever they please, but other parts of the world that are more conservative may have different standards for their inhabitants. Observe the style of dress of those around you and aim to approximate their appearance and avoid upsetting others with impolite displays. As a general rule, you should clad yourself modestly and avoid clothing with slogans or imagery that may be considered offensive.When visiting a temple, mosque or other place of worship, it's a good idea to dress simply and unostentatiously and be careful about wearing clothing that shows too much skin. Women should be prepared to cover their heads at Islamic religious sites.Many cultures, from the United Arab Emirates to Spain, have laws against public nudity and indecency. Save swimwear and other revealing outfits for the beaches.

, If you want to discover what makes a place special, make it a point to engage with those who call it home. Get out and live among the people rather than just passively observing them. Your taxi driver or tour guide can tell you things that no map can.Do your best to appear in control at all times. Making it obvious that you're a tourist in over your head can make you an easy target.
Stop and ask someone when you need help or directions instead of relying on your mobile device.
Make new friends and have them show you around during your stay for a more intimate and authentic experience of the culture.

, In many ways, traveling is the ultimate teacher. You have a rare chance to dive in headfirst and see so many new and astonishing things firsthand, and to learn about what makes life interesting in the process. Capture new sights on camera, or keep a travel journal to record the details of your adventures. Take advantage of this chance to enrich yourself.Take part in local cultural events like the Mardi Gras in French New Orleans, Germany's Oktoberfest or the Songkran Water Festival in Thailand.A stacked itinerary will not only keep you busy but allow you to get better acquainted with unique character of a given culture.

, Traveling is every bit as much about doing and feeling as it is witnessing. Go hang-gliding in the Alps or sign up for salsa lessons in Brazil. Don’t be afraid to put yourself out there and experience everything a culture has to offer, from its history and politics to its charming and unusual quirks.Write down a list of specific things you want to see and do, or challenge yourself to try one new thing every day.
It’s normal to feel like you’re in over your head at first. This can be a very good thing, as it means you’re able to recognize and appreciate cultural disparities. If you wanted to be completely comfortable at all times, you could just as easily stay home.

, There are many times when traveling can become a source of frustration, especially when you’re lost somewhere halfway around the world where no one speaks the same language. But nothing can cure a sour outlook like a smile. No matter what happens, keep a cool head and a positive attitude and be grateful for the opportunity to see more of the world.A happy, confident demeanor will make you more approachable, and make it less likely for scheming opportunists to try to take advantage of you.
Inconveniences happen: you’ll get lost, run low on money or encounter a frustrating language barrier. What’s important is that you don’t let unforeseen mishaps keep you from falling in love with new places.

,
Don't ask for tap water.",How to Avoid Looking Like an American Tourist2," Requesting typical US condiments (ketchup, salt, pepper, etc.) is a sure giveaway that you are an American tourist. Use the typical condiments in your host country, and if you don't like them or can't bear to eat without your American condiments, bring your own. Take small packets with you to use rather than insisting that the restaurant supply you with it.

, In many parts of the world, you will be served your drinks with little or no ice - much less than you're accustomed to in the US. Of course, if you want ice in your drink because that's how you prefer it and you're paying for it, you're perfectly entitled to ask for it, but the point of this article is to help you avoid being labeled as an American, and requesting ice is a definite giveaway. What's more, be warned the tap water of some other countries isn't as safe as the water back home. Your beverage may be made with filtered or sterilized water, but often the ice is not. You can get a bad case of food poisoning from drinking safe bottled beverages with unsafe ice.

, Many American tourists visit US chain restaurants for every meal, afraid to dabble in the local cuisine, but becoming a regular at the local McDonald's and Pizza Hut will tip everyone off that you're an American really quickly. You'll also deprive yourself of a fantastic window into the local culture. Don't be scared: if your host is eating it, it won't harm you. Let your host or waitress advise you about local specialties. And don't ever spit out the food you're given!

,


In Europe, a fork and knife are used differently than in the US. If you are right-handed, eat with the fork in the left hand and the knife in the right. Europeans cut each bite individually with the knife in the right hand and the fork in the left hand, and rest their arms midway between wrist and elbow. The elbow should stay off the table. Also, don't rest your arm in between yourself and your plate. This is considered as rude in some countries.
In some Asian nations chopsticks. It might be more appropriate than a knife and fork.

, In some countries, for instance, a salad is the last item served, not the first. In others, people don't eat what we in the US think of as a ""salad"".

,, In some European countries there won't be one as it is illegal to smoke indoors in a public area. Alternatively, some places won't actually have a non-smoking area. If this is the case either try to live with the smoke or move outside. Don't kick up a fuss.

Try to speak the language.,
Don't just stick your hand out.,
Research and observe ""manners"" and ""mannerisms"" or lack thereof.",How to Avoid Looking Like an American Tourist3," Pulling out and looking at your map in a public space is a no-no. Study it before you leave your hotel, and if you do need to consult your map, step into a store or any other less public place. Have the maps pre-folded so they may be easily accessed and read. The same goes for other items:


If you must use a dictionary to translate a sign or menu, be discreet. For example, copy down the words of the sign and move aside to a less public place to work out the translation. Or copy some basic words in a notebook which you can easily pull out at dinner.
If you must consult a guidebook, keep it wrapped in a newspaper or novel. You may want to wrap the cover in brown paper before leaving home. You may wish to remove the pages detailing the day's destinations from your guidebook ahead of time, staple or paperclip them, and simply carry them as a sheaf of pages.
Don't carry US newspapers, magazines or books in plain view. Pick up a local/regional magazine or the local newspaper.
Just like in the US, most tourist friendly museums have literature in multiple languages. Look for the UK flag on them instead of an American flag.

, Try to find information online or in guidebooks. At least know what country you're going to, what language they speak and the name of their capital. Study the map in advance and learn about geography. (Thinking Copenhagen is in the Netherlands or Europe is a country is the fastest way to pick out an American tourist.)

, Many Americans are recognized for being louder than is customary in other parts of the world. Large arm and hand movements and boisterous behavior should be avoided until you know how the locals act. Adults in many non-American cultures use lower voices in public places. Either way, you're always better off being a little more reserved and quiet, at least for starters, than blasting onto a foreign scene with your vitality and making the wrong impression.

, When you pull things out of your bag in public to show your friends or family what you purchased, you might as well yell ""I have money and I'm ready to spend it, unless you want to take it from me against my will!""

, Something as seemingly harmless as ""Oh, I just love the scarves here!"" will mark you as a tourist. And don't assume people can't understand what you're saying, just because you said it in English. In many parts of the world, people are taught to speak English along with their native language.

, Not every country is as ""spacious"" as the US (unless you're in New York City, where space is at a premium). When you're at a counter, for example, don't spread out your arms. When you're sitting down on the bus or train, don't stretch out your legs in a way that might get in someone's way. Be careful about physical contact. Get an idea of what is acceptable, and mind local customs, such as not touching the head or feet in most of South Asia. Don't get freaked out by the person in line behind you being very close, and if you leave too much room between you and the person in front of you, expect someone to step in to the space.

, It's just not very common outside of the US, and even within the US, it's a breach of etiquette under some circumstances.

, When traveling to a foreign country, you are bound to take pictures. However, having a camera strap and wearing it around your neck for easy access is a sure way to look like a tourist. If you can, keep it in a pocket or in a purse and pull it out when needed.

, If you're going to a country that speaks a different language, why not try to make an effort to speak the local language? It's a sign of respect and appreciation of the local culture. Learn a few basic words like ""Hello"", ""Please"" and ""Thank you"". Nobody will mind if your accent is not perfect; the fact that you've been willing to speak their language, even when you could well have spoken yours, is a thing that many people appreciate in tourists. While you are at it, learn the words for some foods that you like, and the ones that you don't like. It makes eating out much less scary.

, Shake hands with caution. In the west, the handshake is an acceptable greeting. In Thailand, handshakes are reserved for business with Westerners. The preferred greeting is the wai, hands pressed together in prayer position in front of the chin with a slight nod. In India the handshake is becoming common, but you must greet the eldest or most important person present first and work your way down, and shaking a woman's hand may be unacceptable. Your take-away message here? Do some research on etiquette and learn how to respectfully greet your hosts.

, In some countries, merely saying ""excuse me,"" ""I'm sorry"" or ""Please"" will mark you as a tourist.

Understand you can only drink alcohol served by the air carrier.,
Make sure your alcohol meets quantity restrictions for liquids in carryon luggage.,
Understand the rules for duty-free alcohol.",How to Pack Alcohol in Your Luggage2," On most flights, you are only allowed to drink alcohol that is served by the airline. For example, Federal Aviation Administration regulations in the United States prohibit the consumption of alcohol on board unless it is served by the airline. This means it is a direct violation of federal regulations to drink alcohol you take on board in your carryon luggage., Federal regulators set standards for the amount of liquids, gels, and aerosols that passengers can take on board in their carry on luggage. For U.S. flights, the Federal Aviation Administration requires that liquids, including alcohol, be in containers that are no more than 100 milliliters or 3.4 ounces in volume. These containers must all fit into a 1-quart-sized resealable plastic bag., Duty-free alcohol purchased internationally can be carried on board inbound international flights to the United States. The alcohol can be in containers larger than 3.4 ounces or 100 milliliters if packed in a secure, transparent, tamper-evident bag by the retailer. The purchase must have been made within the last 48 hours, and you must have the original receipt present during your flight.If you have a connecting flight after reentering the U.S., however, you will have to go through security again and the duty-free alcohol will then be subject to the 3.4 ounces or 100 milliliter regulation for liquids in carryon luggage.

Padding the bottles will help protect them against impact and accident while in transport., Wrapping your beer, wine, or liquor bottles in plastic bags can ameliorate some of the damage should the bottles break during your flight or while your bag is being tossed about before or after boarding. Consider resealable plastic bags, and double bag if possible!, If you are transporting multiple bottles of alcohol in your checked luggage, it’s a good idea to put a barrier between the bottles. The last thing you want is for your two bottles of wine to smash into each other and break! A barrier can be something as simple as a pair of shoes or several rolled up pieces of bulky clothing. This step can save you a lot of heartache once you get to your destination., Make sure that the sides, bottom, and top of your luggage are padded with your most bulky travel items such as clothing, towels, or blankets. Padding your suitcase in this way will help to create a barrier between the outside of your bag, which will likely get thrashed during transport, and the alcohol you are packing inside it.

, Sometimes it is easier to have your beer, wine, and liquor shipped professionally. This takes some hassle out of travelling and ensures your alcohol will arrive safely. There are multiple shipping companies that can ship your alcohol for you. This is a great option if you want to travel with more alcohol than is allowed by airline or country-specific regulations, or will fit in your luggage."

The weight of the rucksack itself and sometimes the color are also important considerations. Good rucksacks will also be sized to fit your body, with internal frames to offer support.


The distinction between a rucksack and a backpack is somewhat disputed and the terms are used differently in different places. The process and the principles of packing a rucksack or an internal-frame backpack, though, are basically the same.
Put something reflective or luminescent on the top of the rucksack so it is easy to find at night. Put your last name on the rucksack, or some other identifying mark that will let you distinguish it from other packs quickly.;
, If you're going to be traveling in the elements and living out of a bag, you need to make sure you've got the essentials secured, wherever you're going. Being able to stay warm at night, hydrated during the day, and safe from the elements should come before almost any other packing concerns.


Making room for water or water filtration devices should be your first priority if you're traveling remotely. Almost everything else should come second when compared with providing enough potable water for yourself.
Are you going someplace that gets cold? Even desert climates can get frigid at night, and you should always travel with at least one layer of warmth, a hat, rain protection, and a lightweight mylar emergency blanket.
Ideally, you'll have a lightweight tent and a good-quality light sleeping bag that's rated for cold temperatures, if necessary. Even if you're going to be sleeping indoors, a good rucksack kit should include a multipurpose tarp that could be used for ground cover or as a makeshift shelter in a pinch.

, If you're going to be relying on your own supplies and your own ingenuity to stay healthy and safe, it's important for any rucksack to include at least a basic first aid kit. If the occasion calls for it, more substantial products may also be called for to ensure you'll be prepared for anything. You may want to include some of the following materials:


Bandages
Antiseptic ointment or spray
Isopropyl alcohol
Pain medication
Iodine capsules, malaria treatment, or other preventative medication

, Even if you're going to a sunny warm climate, it's smart to pack assuming it's going to rain every day and that you're going to get wet and cold. You don't want to get caught in a flash flood without rain proofing your essential supplies. Using a rainproof rucksack is best, but it's also acceptable to purchase separate rainproof pouches to keep the most essential items in, like your phone, money, and passport.


Bring a lightweight raincoat, sturdy shoes, and plenty of socks to change out while you're out in the rain. It's important to stay as dry as possible.

, Prioritize the most versatile, durable, and spartan clothing items and leave the fashionable stuff at home. Again, if you're going to be hoofing it, make sure that you've got useful clothing that you won't mind living in for days at a time, and willing to get dirty. Rainproof gear is desirable, as well as lightweight warm layers that you'll be able to roll up tightly. Depending on your purposes, a good road wardrobe might look something like this:


Plenty of socks and underwear, at least four back-up pair of each and a patch kit to make little repairs. These are the most essential things to change in and out each day to stay healthy.
A thermal shirt and underwear that you can use in cold conditions, as well as two or three t-shirts and a lightweight rain jacket.
At least two pair of long pants and one pair of athletic shorts or swim-trunks. Alternatively, you might be able to get away with a single pair of jeans and a back up for a long trip.
A stocking cap and wool gloves.
A heavy coat, if you're going to be traveling in cold conditions.

, Whether you're going to have food or not, it's a good idea to bring a few essentials that'll allow you to improvise on the fly. Try to make sure you have the necessary ingredients to cook up some food in an emergency, and at least enough stuff to start a fire.


Try to get a hold of a small kettle and a gas cooker, sometimes called a ""hobo stove,"" as well as a lighter and some waterproof matches. It may be a good idea to have a package of basic candles to keep a flame going for an extended period of time.
Bring only multipurpose tools. No garlic presses in a rucksack. Don't bring a plate and a bowl, just bring a bowl that you can use for anything that would require a plate. Don't bring a potato peeler, bring a sharp knife that you'll be able to use in a variety of situations.
Depending on how long you're going to be gone, you might want to bring a bag of granola and simple trail mix, or you may need some MREs, protein bars, and more substantial fare. Try to keep emergency rations on hand, at least enough to sustain you for 48 hours in an emergency.

, This approach helps to minimize the opportunity to leave out something important, and lets you evaluate whether or not everything you're trying to pack is absolutely essential. As a bonus, having everything in front of you at one time makes it easier to group like items together and pack them in the same compartment of the rucksack, helping to stay organized and efficient.


Again, consider your purpose. If you're going to the lake house and want to bring your ruck sack, it's probably not essential to bring the camp stove and the fold-up hatchet. Err on the side of keeping it as light as possible.

, Items that you will use throughout the day should be packed in a compartment that can be opened and closed with relatively little effort. Snacks, a swimsuit, your phone, or a change of clothing should be easily accessed without having to remove a number of items from any compartment.If you have a single big compartment in your rucksack, the things that you will use as soon as you arrive and continue using frequently should go on top and things you will rarely use should go at the bottom.
It's usually common, if you're heading out hiking or hitching, to keep your socks on the top of the bag for quick changes and easy access.

, Placing small items together in plastic bags with a reclosable top helps to prevent those items from settling during the day and being harder to find when they are needed. Use the bags for snacks, bottled water or other substances that could damage equipment or stain clothing if they were to puncture or otherwise come open.


It's usually common to keep soap, shampoo, toothpaste, and other toiletries in a plastic bag to avoid spillage and keep the easily accessible.

, Before you start jamming everything into your rucksack, check for ways you can start to save space by nesting things into one another. Keep your iPhone in your spare pair of shoes, or wrap up your passport in your jeans. If you're bringing a small foldable pot, keep the camp stove, matches, and other small items in the pot.


This can be a great way of padding breakable items and hiding valuables. If you've got some extra cash, hide it somewhere a thief would be unlikely to look, deep in the bag. Don't keep it in an external pocket if you can help it.

, Packing properly will allow the chest and waist straps to bear more of the load, and for the weight to sit on top of your shoulders, rather than pull straps down into them. It will also make it easier to turn and keep your feet as maneuverable as possible. Keep the weight toward the back of the pack, resting against your frame.


Some rucksacks have openings on the bottom that allow you to unzip and remove items quickly and easily from the base of the sack. These big backcountry-style rucksacks can hold a tremendous amount of weight, meaning that you'll need to play with weight distribution a little more carefully than with a smaller pack that sits higher on your frame., Set your rucksack upright while you pack the bag and keep weight dispersed over both sides evenly. Follow the same pattern with other items as they are placed in each compartment, taking care to balance the weight from left to right. Doing so helps to reduce fatigue and stress by distributing the load evenly between the shoulders.

, If you have an internal frame or frameless rucksack, place the flattest items against the panel that lies against your back. Avoid placing soft or bulky items here, since they can deform the shape of the bag, reducing the structural integrity. When you're hoofing around, this can cause uncomfortable bumps or protrusions that will irritate your back.

, Pack your clothes last, unless they make up the most substantial amount of material in your bag. Clothes are the easiest items to use as gap-fillers and jam into the remaining cracks. Plus, you can always get away with having one less pair of gym shorts in an emergency.


Roll clothing tightly rather than folding it. This will allow the clothes to take up less room while also reducing wrinkles from crushing. Make sure that only enough clothing for the excursion is taken along, as this will help to preserve room for other essentials.

, This is especially important if hiking or biking for long distances. Opinions vary on how much weight is considered reasonable, although most rucksacks should be less than half of your total body weight at the maximum.

, As a last resort, it's common to have some important items easily accessible by hanging them off the rucksack from carabiners. This helps to maximize the holding volume of the bag by hooking things onto it, as well as allowing you to quickly grab a hold of a bottle of water, your keys, a knife, or other essentials.


Most rucksacks are equipped with straps along the bottom that make it possible to secure bedrolls vertically, helping to distribute the weight and save space, as well.

, After everything has been packed, check to ensure that the pack sits comfortably and that you can access items without removing it when necessary. Always wear it for ten minutes minimum and walk around testing the feel of it, mimicking what you will do when wearing your rucksack.


Pay attention to where you feel the pressure of the straps, and whether or not the bag is throwing off your balance as you move. If so, you may need to reposition some of the items in the bag to distribute the weight more evenly.
Casual backpack wearers such as students often leave the straps loose and let the rucksack sag low over the rear. Wearing a heavy rucksack loose and low would be miserable on a long trip, so it's important to keep the straps tight and the bag as high on your frame as possible.

Casual clothing typically is not worth packing in a garment bag. Instead, fold it in a suitcase.;
, Garment bags can be bulky and are not always an efficient way to pack clothing. If your wardrobe can be folded in a carry-on or other suitcase, pack it there.


Dress shirts, ties and accessories do not need to be hung in a garment bag.
Business casual slacks, such as khakis, can generally be folded and stowed in a suitcase.
When possible, pack clothing that has been treated to be wrinkle-free.

, The best time to use a garment bag is for a short trip when most of the clothing you need will be for business.


The limited capacity of most garment bags makes them ideal for a trip that lasts only a few days and so does not require a great variety of clothes.
For an extended trip that mixes business and leisure, use both a garment bag and another suitcase to carry all your clothes.

, If you are traveling to a formal event such as a wedding or an award ceremony, your gown may be too bulky or ornate to use an ordinary garment bag. Bring a carry-on sized suitcase to the wedding dress company and have it packed professionally.


Using a carry-on will guarantee you can keep an eye on your special item.
Some airplanes have closets for flight attendants in which you may be able to hang your bag, but don’t count on it. A carry-on is a safer bet.
The dress may need to be steamed when you arrive at your destination.

, If appropriate, dry-clean items should be taken to the cleaners well in advance so you are assured they will be returned in time for your trip.


Starting off with clean, ironed items will help you to have less work when you arrive at your destination.
Test zippers and check for missing buttons before you pack so you will not have to try to repair things while you are away.

,


White tissue is preferable in the event that your bag gets wet. Colored tissue has dye that may bleed onto your garments.

, Referring to your itinerary of events, place items you will need later in your trip at the back of the garment bag, and items you will need sooner at the front.


This step will help prevent you needing to rummage past garments to find what you need, causing wrinkles.

, Some garment bags come with built-in hangers while other types of bags require separate hangers. If you use your own hangers, wire hangers are best because they are lightweight and take up less space than wooden or plastic hangers.


Save space by hanging several items on each hanger. For example, hang a shirt under a jacket or blazer, with the sleeves of the shirt placed in the sleeves of the jacket. Slide a belt or scarf over the hanger.
Use pant hangers to secure pants or skirts. The less items move, the less they will wrinkle., This prevents stretching from the weight of the clothing pulling against the shoulder straps. This is especially important for gowns with trains, beaded dresses or other heavy items.

, This is to keep the garments secure and prevent wrinkles. Zip the zippers, snap the snaps and button the buttons.

, Plastic prevents wrinkles caused by the friction of garments rubbing together., Pack underwear, cosmetics, handkerchiefs, and other small items in the garment bag's inside pockets.


If you are also using a carry-on or other suitcase, place smaller items in there.
This step prevents small objects from wrinkling the clothing on the hangers.

, Save space by packing socks inside the shoes. Stow the shoes in the bottom of the garment bag.


Putting shoes in a plastic bag is important to prevent dirt or shoe polish from getting on your clothes.

, Most garment bags are designed to be their own carry-on. Depending on the bag, carefully fold it in half or in thirds. Use provided zippers or snaps to secure the bag. It will look something like a briefcase.


Pay attention when you first open the bag to how it works so you can refold it smoothly when it is full.
Consider practicing folding the bag before you put clothes in. If folded or fastened incorrectly, you may create more wrinkles in your clothes.

, If you have a garment protector bag that hangs in your closet and is not designed as its own suitcase, you can still use it to travel. Zip the bag shut, then carefully fold it into thirds so that it fits neatly inside a suitcase.


Avoid using a duffel bag. A suitcase with firm sides will provide better protection and support.
Pack enough items in the suitcase to prevent the garment bag from shifting and bunching, but avoid stuffing it so full that clothing will be crushed.
Pack the garment bag last so that the weight of other clothing does create wrinkles in your suit or dress.

, As soon as you arrive at your destination, hang the garments in the closet, so any wrinkles have time to relax.

, Many hotels offer ironing boards and irons free of charge. If any items will need ironing, take the opportunity to do all of them at once so you will not have to try to remember later when you may be in a hurry.


Read the labels of your clothing carefully and set the iron temperature accordingly.
Begin ironing in an inconspicuous area, such as a shirt-tail in case you accidentally damage your clothes.
Avoid ironing irreplaceable items, such as an evening gown. These items are often difficult to iron or made of fragile fabrics.

, One way to remove wrinkles is to use warm steam. Hanging clothing in the bathroom and then taking a hot shower will relax the wrinkles in your clothes. Alternatively, you could dampen the item with a washcloth then use an electric hairdryer to generate steam.


Natural fibers absorb moisture, so this process will work with silk, wool, cotton or other natural materials.
Synthetic fabrics such as rayon or polyester do not absorb moisture, so steaming will not remove wrinkles., Use a small lint brush or roller to remove any dust or fuzz from your clothes.

Pack only what you need.,
Pack heavier items first.,
Pack to avoid wrinkling.,
Stuff lightweight clothing items inside your shoes.",How to Pack a Duffel Bag1," Make a list, and check off items as you pack them so that you know exactly what you do and do not have. Separate your list into categories: e.g. clothing, electronics, food, toiletries, documents, and gear. Consider the weather, the duration of the trip, and the range of expected activities. Make sure that you will be prepared for every situation that you will reasonably encounter – but be careful not to over-pack.If you're going somewhere outdoors, make a list of gear as well as clothing. Most sleep-away camps provide a list of what to bring. Use this as a checklist, and take it with you to make sure you don't forget anything when it's time to go home.
Remember that you can usually buy things at your destination, if you're going to a populated area. If you are taking your duffel to the woods, or to a less-populated area, then you'll want to lock down the absolute necessities. Nonetheless, try to keep perspective about how many things you truly need.;
, You'll want to carry and store your duffel bag zipper-side up, so it's important to keep the large objects on the bottom. If you pack light or fragile things into the bottom of the duffel compartment, they will be crushed by the weight of the items above them.


Place shoes and other flat non delicate items at the bottom of the bag.
Roll all articles of clothing besides jackets and place them tightly on top of the shoes.
Place the jackets on top of the rolled items and tuck it in on the sides.

, Duffel bags are especially prone to compressing and creasing loose clothing. If everything is jumbled together, it can easily leave its mark on your garments. Try to arrange things into compartments, and fold in a way that limits creasing.Roll your clothing. This is generally considered the most space-effective method, as well as the best way to reduce wrinkling. Put certain types of clothing into specific parts of your duffel so that you'll know where to find them: for instance, put all of your socks together, and all of your shirts together, and all of your pants together.Fold smaller items of clothing between the folds of larger items of clothing. On the inside, fold the clothes that are least likely to crease. Then, work outward until you have a small, neatly-folded bundle.
Try using ""packing cubes"" to partition the interior of your duffel. You can buy cubes with compression zippers to take down the bulk – and you can even vacuum-pack certain items that tend to spread out., This might include gloves, socks, undergarments, and other thin fabrics. In addition to saving space, this method should help your shoes hold their shape by reinforcing the walls. In general: for the sake of efficiency, pack anything light and compressible inside of anything heavy and hollow.Ladies: Put your bathing suit bottoms inside your bathing suit tops, and scrunch them up. For bikinis, hook the top around the bottom and compress it all together. For one pieces, just knead the thing into a bundle. You don't have to worry about bathing suits getting wrinkles, as they will straighten out when you swim.

"
Distance.,
Experience.,
What to pack.,
Go ride.",How to Pack a Backpack for a Bike Ride," Before you even start to think about what to pack, you need to know how far you're going. Obviously you're going to have different things in your bag riding across the country and to your friend's house. If you know you want to go for a ride but not sure where to, decide now. For shorter distances, you could still pack everything if you would like to but it's not necessary. The distance you are riding could determine what you have to pack so know where you're going before anything else.;
, Along with distance, your experience is another big factor. A less experienced rider may have a tendency to fall more, therefore breaking more lights and having to pack more spares. However, as the rider becomes more experienced, they will probably break less lights and not have to pack as many spares. Judge your experience by how long you've been riding and how often you break or lose equipment.

, Now you know the distance you're riding and your biking experience, it's time to finally pack your bag. This is where most bikers go wrong. They pack their bag with food and drink but forget to pack tools. Here's everything you'll need.


Food. Tinned food is often the best as it doesn't go bad. You could bring sandwiches but on a hot day, they'll probably go bad. However, you will need something like a sandwich so keep one in a cool airtight container. Alternatively, you could bring money for some food along the way.
Drinks. The amount of drinks you'll need to bring depend on the two factors discussed above. The best drinks are water or an energy drink such as powerade or lucozade. Avoid fizzy drinks, Energy drinks like Red Bull and alcohol. Fizzy drinks and energy drinks will give you a temporary buzz, but after the buzz comes the crash. This means you will be completely drained of energy. Alcohol will affect your sense of balance. Drinking and riding is as illegal, not to mention dangerous, as drinking and driving. Never do either of these two things.
Spare lights. In case one of your lights decides not to work or suddenly breaks, bring a few spares. Again, the amount of lights you’ll need depend on the two above factors. For a long distance ride, a good number would be three of each type. On your bike you should have one back light, one front light and one light clipped on to your backpack. If you do the math, you will see that you need nine spare lights. If the lights on your backpack and the lights on your bike are the same, there's no need to bring this many. Bring about five. However, if all your lights are different, you will need to bring the full amount. If you’re only making a short journey, it’s probably save to just bring three spare lights, one back light, one front light and one on your bag.
Spare batteries. Along with your spare lights, you will need spare batteries. If all of your batteries die, you are very unlucky. Never fear though, just pull out your spare batteries and you're all good to go again. Bring about three packets of good quality batteries like Duracell. If you're bring cheaper batteries, bring more packets.
Spare reflectors. Just in case one breaks off, bring some spare reflectors. You will want to bring two or three red reflectors and two or three white reflectors. Although your reflectors are not likely to break, you may tie your bike somewhere and a thief may steal one. Usually, your safe ride would be over but if you brought spare reflectors, you're all set to ride.
Cable lock. You will probably get hungry somewhere along the way. If you want to get off of your bike and buy some food, you will need to tie it up. If you don't, there is a good chance that somebody will come along and take it. To avoid this, buy a cable lock. You want one that comes with a lock, not combination. Experienced thieves will easily be able to hack the combination in a flash but by the time they pick that tiny lock, you'll probably be finished. This is the one thing that you definitely don't want to forget; along with food.
Tools. You can pick up some foldable tools that have allen keys, spanners, flathead screwdrivers and phillips screwdrivers. You will need all of these. If you can't find one of the foldable tools, bring loose ones. You will also want to bring a small first aid kit and a puncture kit. The first aid kit is for small injuries like cuts and scratches. Anything more serious and you can call an ambulance. The puncture kit is in case you hit a nail while riding, that's never fun. Although you've got to bring your bike to a shop as soon as this happens, the puncture kit will hold out until you get there. You also want to bring a bike tire pump for when you start to go flat.

, After you've packed your bag, checked your equipment and planned a route, you're all set to go. Get your bike and leave home. Tell some people you are leaving and that you'll call them if anything happens to you or you need a lift in an emergency. Have fun!

Face the zippered side up.,
Keep need-to-access belongings near the top.,
Repack when necessary.,
Compartmentalize.,
Bring a day-pack for day trips.",How to Pack a Duffel Bag2," This is especially important if you've packed the heaviest items on the bottom and the most fragile items in the center. The amorphous walls of the duffel will not provide much protection for the contents. Thus, you will need to need to handle your bag with particular care. Avoid stacking heavy items on top of the duffel, and try to keep it from taking too much wear.

, It can be a pain to dig through the depths of your duffel bag just to find one item – especially if you are using a particularly large bag. If you think that you might need to access anything over the course of a given day, take care to arrange that thing in an easily-accessible position near the zipper. On the other hand: items near the top of the bag will be easy picking for would-be duffel thieves. Pack your most important and sensitive belongings deep within the bag, ideally inside socks or other containers.

, Over the course of a trip, you may find that your belongings become jumbled and mussed from the day-to-day demands of living out of a duffel. Sometimes, you will need to take heavy items from the bottom of the bag, which can disturb the carefully-layered strata of clothing and travel necessities. Do not hesitate to take everything out of your bag and reorder it! It won't take long, and the belongings within will be much safer from the wear and tear of travel.


Consider taking everything out of your bag each evening when you arrive at your place of lodging. Then, take a few minutes to thoughtfully repack the bag in the morning before you leave. This way, you can ensure that the most important items for each day remain at the top of the bag.

, Consider using smaller, also-amorphous bags to divide up the space within your duffel. Use a bag for your toiletries, a bag for your food, and a bag for your dirty laundry. This way, you won't need to rifle through the main compartment each time you need something. You can take out the appropriate ""compartment bag,"" then quickly sort out the needed item., If you'll be staying in one place and heading out for day-trips, take along a smaller bag so that you don't need to lug your duffel everywhere. Stuff the day-pack into your duffel. Each day, leave the large duffel in your place of lodging, and fill the day-pack with only the essentials.


The day-pack can even function as a separate, modular ""compartment"" within the main duffel chamber. Store your toiletries, or your electronics, or your food in the day-pack to keep these items apart from the other contents of your duffel.
The day-pack may be easier to pack into the duffel if it, too, is amorphous rather than rigid in structure. This way, you can pack the day-bag within and around your other belongings – it won't take up a commanding space.

Buy a duffel bag of an appropriate size.,
Pick your pockets.,
Consider using a rolling duffel bag.",How to Pack a Duffel Bag3," Some duffels offer a huge capacity—as many as 130 liters (34.3 US gal) of space—while others are much smaller and more portable. Before you buy, consider what you'll be storing in this duffel bag, and where you'll be going. Check online and at local outdoor supply stores to track down the best bag for you.If you'll be using the bag mostly for quick weekend or overnight trips, then you may want a relatively small and portable model. If you'll be using your duffel to, say, transport two weeks' worth of garments and gear for an adventure trip, then consider looking into larger bags.Try checking thrift stores and used-gear websites for cheap, lightweight duffel bags. These bags are rugged and durable, so you should not need to splurge on a new model., Some duffel bags are very simple: just the one large main compartment, with no frills or extra features. Other bags feature various inner and outer pockets to more easily separate your things. Remember that more volume means more weight!

, If you're bringing a large volume of belongings, then your duffel might be too heavy to comfortably carry for any length of time. You can buy a duffel bag with wheels, or you can install wheels yourself with a bit of DIY craftsmanship. Be aware, however, that wheels will add up to several pounds of extra weight.Many travelers choose duffel bags exactly because they are so lightweight – and most airlines enforce a size limit on both checked and carry-on luggage. Consider whether ease of transport is worth less room for your things.

Only take carry-on luggage when you travel by air.,
Create a packing list.,
Get travel-sized versions of your favorite toiletries.,
Pack as many outfits as you think you need, then subtract one.,
Never take more than two pairs of shoes unless you want to.,
Leave whatever you can buy at your destination at home.,
Pack one jazzy accessory.",How to Pack1," If you can limit yourself to one carry-on bag and eliminate the need to check in any luggage, you will save yourself a world of time and hassle. It may sound daunting - but seasoned travelers swear that one small bag provides easily enough space for the travel essentials, you just need to cut-down on any non-essential items.Limiting yourself to carry-on luggage makes the process of traveling much easier - you will get in and out of any airports you use a lot faster, and enjoy the convenience of having all of your travel essentials directly on hand throughout your flight. You will also avoid the risk of incurring charges on overweight check-in bags, particularly on smaller local airlines.
Packing a single small bag also has its advantages once you reach your destination. You will be a lot more flexible when it comes to moving from place to place, making it easier to take advantage of any opportunities or adventures that come your way. You will also appear as less of an easy target to pick-pockets and con artists.;
, Create an extensive list of all the things you think you might possibly need for your trip. Consider clothes, toiletries, medicinal items, swimwear, business attire, outdoor equipment, entertainment, electronics and anything else you can think of. Then consider this list with a more critical eye and really think about which items are really essential for your trip and which are more ""just in case"". Cross off any non-essential items, as you won't be taking them with you.Remember - unless you're travelling to the Antarctic, a remote area, Ascension Island, the Sahara desert or other especially far flung place, you will almost certainly be able to buy any additional items you need at your destination, in case of an emergency.
Once you have whittled down your list to a bare minimum, you must promise to stick to it. If you deviate from your list at all, things may spiral out of control and you'll end up trying to pack the kitchen sink.
Even if you think you might be saving yourself a possible expense by packing your scuba gear, forget about it. The hassle of lugging a heavy case around won't be worth it.

, Airlines have pretty strict regulations on the volume of liquids each passenger is allowed to take with them on board. So if you're sticking with carry-on, it's best to invest in travel-size versions of your ""can't live without"" products. Shampoos, moisturizers, toothpaste and certain items of make-up all fall within this category. Place these items in a clear plastic toiletry bag or zip-lock bag so you can conveniently clear them through security.


Be aware that most airlines follow the 3-1-1 rule. The bottles containing the liquids must be 3.4 oz (100 ml) or less, they must all fit within one, 1 quart transparent plastic bag, and the total volume of liquids contained in the bag must not exceed 1 quart.It is also possible to buy empty travel-size plastic bottles relatively cheaply, into which you can squeeze your favorite products from their full size-containers at home. Just make sure to label each bottle so you don't get confused!

, People almost always pack more clothes than they end up wearing, so however many outfits you think you'll need, pack less.Think about how many days you'll be away for and what activities you plan on doing while you're there. Also consider what the weather will be like once you're there - if the weather has consistently been at 90 degrees for the last month, you're not going to need more than one sweater.


You'll definitely end up wearing some items more than once, so think about clothes that you can mix and match. For example - for every one pair of shorts you bring, pack two or more tops that will go with them, as you won't need to change your shorts everyday.
Pack clothes that can be adapted to suit the situation - try packing a simple dress that can be worn casually with flat sandals and a sun hat throughout the day, or dressed up with heels, a belt and some jewelry at night.
Find out whether there is a laundromat near your accommodation - if there's one within easy reach, you will be able to wash your clothes, thus increasing the number of times you can wear them!
Remember that it's not the end of the world if you end up needing to buy a couple of cheap t-shirts or a rain jacket while you're away - and chances are you won't need to. When travelling light, always pack for the best case scenario, not the worst case., It's reasonable to need hiking boots, trainers a day shoe and evening shoes. Shoes are the heaviest, bulkiest items that you will need to bring with you while travelling, so try to limit yourself to the absolute minimum. Women in particular may find this step difficult, given their love of having the perfect shoe for every occasion, but try to think about what's really necessary.If you're going on an action-packed sports holiday, you're hardly going to need a pair of high-heels. A small, light-weight pair of pretty flats will get you through any situations where you need to get slightly more dressed up, such as in a restaurant.
If you're going on a business trip, pack appropriate shoes for any meetings you have to take, along with comfier, more casual pair to wear while travelling or during down time. Don't forget your trainers if you want to hit the gym.
Don't pack your running shoes unless you are absolutely sure that you will be exercising while you're away. If you're going on a relaxing, indulgent holiday to a sunny destination, will you really get up at 7 am every morning for a 5 mile (8.0 km) run? Unless the answer is a resounding ""yes"", you're running shoes are taking up valuable space.

, Did you know that they have supermarkets in Europe, Australasia, North America, South American and Africa? And pharmacies? And fashionable clothes stores? As mentioned earlier, unless you are travelling to Outer Siberia, it's unlikely that there are many items you won't be able to find wherever you go. So unless you're particularly picky about the type of hair conditioner or shaving gel you need to use, leave these items at home and just pick them up when you get there.


Buying as you go may seem like an unnecessary expense, but it will help you to significantly cut down on weight and free up some extra space in your bag. It's all about priorities!
Remember that many large brands are universal - you should be able to find Gillette shaving cream, Colgate toothpaste and Pantene conditioner no matter where you are in world - or at least something very similar.Alternatively, you can see this as a chance to try something new!
If the worst comes to the worst and you can't find a particular product, ask yourself how the locals manage to live without it. Do they have some kind of alternative? Or is just an unnecessary comfort? Travelling light may require some sacrifices! Consider it an adventure.

, Packing just one versatile accessory can work wonders when it comes to packing light. Make sure that it will go with as many of your planned outfits as possible and that it serves a definite purpose. For example, a large, decorative scarf can serve as a funky accessory to wear around your neck, can be worn in place of a cardigan if draped around your arms and shoulder, can turn into a make-shift sarong at the beach, can be worn as a head-scarf to protect your head from the sun, or can serve as a pretty belt, if worn around your waist!

Check out the weather at your destination(s) before you go.,
Plan each day in advance.,
Put large or heavy clothing at the bottom.,
Pack several lightweight layers.,
Choose between rolling and folding your clothing.,
Use the inside of your shoes as storage space.,
Use folded tee shirts to separate and organize sections of your suitcase.,
Pack fragile items in the center of your case.,
Place dress shirts and other formal items on top.,
Put shoes in a plastic bag.,
Use creases and gaps to place underwear.",How to Pack a Bag or Suitcase Efficiently," Is it going to rain? Pack a rain suit or something that can get wet and dry quickly. If it is going to be hot, pack shorts. Don't forget a bathing suit if it's warm or if there's a pool.

, This will help you decide how many pieces of clothing to take. Too much and you will regret carrying everything. Remember you can always buy a cheap t-shirt or a pair of shorts at your destination. You will regret it if you pack too much, but if you pack too little you can always compensate for it. Remember probably every town you have ever been in has had a laundromat.


Over-packing will also leave less room in your suitcase for purchasing gifts and souvenirs.

, Always put heavier or larger items at the bottom of the suitcase. This will make it easier to find items in your suitcase.

, This will work well for both hot and cold weather, as you can add more if you're too cold, and take some off if you're too hot.

, If you need more space in your suitcase and aren't worried about the weight, roll your clothes (as this will take significantly less space than folding). If you do not need as much space and want to keep the weight down, fold your clothes.


Roll items as tightly as possible in order to achieve the space saving effect.
Rolling does not necessarily make your clothes more wrinkled, you simply need to be careful that when you roll clothes, you do not roll in any wrinkles. Roll the item as flat as possible. Folding the item along its natural seams first will help.
Elastic items will be easier to roll without introducing wrinkles.
If you aren't very good at rolling, avoid rolling items which wrinkle easily.
Rolled items will need to be packed tightly, which is why this method should only be used if space is at a premium. Rolled items not tightly packed will cause them to unroll and wrinkle.

, Stuff your socks inside your shoes if there is no other room for them (it will also keep the shoes shape). If you have any other small trinkets, you can put that in your shoes, too.

, This will help distribute the contents.

, This way, they are less likely to be broken. If possible, don't bring anything fragile.

, Put dress shirts on top so that you can remove them easily for hanging and ironing. This should also allow them to lie flatter.

, This is so that after you wear them, you can put them away without damaging any other items or making them dirty. You can use a grocery bag or a shower cap.

, Fit the underwear and socks down the sides once the case is full. This will make sure that you don't fill up valuable space in the middle.

Use compression bags.,
Learn to bundle.,
Do not stack.,
Use the space inside shoes for extra storage.,
Put heavier items on the bottom.,
Place fragile or easily-wrinkled items on top.",How to Pack2," Compression bags are fantastic if you just can't avoid taking bulkier items, like ski gear or heavy winter coats. Compression packing bags work by removing all of the air from the bag, so the items takes up a much smaller space than before. Many brands do their own version of the compression packing bag, including Spacepak bags from Flight 001 and Space bags from Ziploc., Bundling is the current packing method de rigueur which makes excellent use of space and prevents clothes from becoming overly wrinkles. It is done by wrapping several items of clothing tightly around a central object such as an organizer pouch (filled with more items - of course) to form a cylindrical shaped bundle. Several of these bundles can then be packed into a relatively small space, making for very economical packing.When using the bundling method, place the most wrinkle-resistant items like jeans and jackets on the inside of the bundle, and more delicate, wrinkle-prone items like linen trousers and fine knits on the outside.
Wrap each item individually, rather than all at once, making sure the fabric is pulled taut enough that it doesn't wrinkle, but not so tight that it stretches the material.Once you have reached the bottom of your pile of clothing, place the bundle into your bag or suitcase and pack tightly or secure tightly with the bags tie-down straps. If the bundle is not secured properly before travelling, it may unravel, causing your clothes to crease., Simply folding your clothes and stacking them one on top of the other is not the most efficient method of packing, regardless of how your mother used to do it. Folded clothes take up a lot of space and are more prone to becoming wrinkled during transit. Stick with the bundling method outlines above, or at the very least try to roll your clothes so they take up less room., Don't forget about all the empty space inside your shoes that you can use for storing smaller items like socks, underwear, jewelry or anything else you can think of. When packing efficiently it is important that you use up any and all available space.Once the shoes have been packed, place them at the bottom of your bag or along the edges of your suitcase.
If they're a little dirty and you don't want them touching your clothes, wrap each shoe tightly in a plastic bag first.

, Always put any heavier items like books, laptops, shoes or hair dryers (not that you should be bringing one if you're traveling light!) at the bottom of the bag or suitcase. This is because they are more secure at the bottom and less likely to move around during travel. In addition, putting heavier items at the top of your bag would increase the chance of wrinkling the clothes underneath.

, Item like suits or delicate, easily-creased dresses should be laid out flat at the top of your suitcase, in a protective garment bag, if possible. They should then be removed and hung-up as soon as you reach your destination.


If your items do happen to become wrinkled during travel, hang them up in the bathroom while you are having a shower. The steam from the hot shower should help gently work out any creases, eliminating the need to iron.

Pack layers rather than bulky single items.,
Put your toiletries in an outside pocket.,
Leave valuables at home.,
Look up the weather before you leave.,
Go neutral.,
Be aware of any prohibited items.,
Check the weight.",How to Pack3," If you are in anyway unsure about the weather conditions at your destination, consider packing layers rather than bulky ""just-in-case"" items like rain jackets or jeans. That way, you can layer up or down depending on whether it's hot or cold.For example, you can pack a combination of long-sleeved and and short-sleeved t-shirts which you can wear individually or layer up if it's cold.
Or instead of taking bulky jeans, try packing some light-weight but cozy leggings which you can wear underneath dresses and skirts.

, Most suitcases and bags have extra outside pockets which are ideal for storing the plastic bag containing your toiletries. Storing the bag here will make it easily accessible when you're going through security - which is important as you will need to remove it from your case for screening.


Keeping the bag here will also make your toiletries easier to reach while traveling, which is great if you need to freshen up during your flight.
In addition, having your liquids separate from the rest of your suitcase is a good idea in case any of them should spill or burst during transport. Opening your bag to find all of your clothes are covered in sticky shower gel is never fun!

, It may be tempting to take your expensive watch or diamond jewelry with you while traveling, especially if you plan on attending any fancy dinners or special events. However, it is very easy for such items to become lost, broken or stolen while traveling, so you should try to leave these things safely at home. It's just not worth the heartbreak of losing your engagement ring somewhere in the Mediterranean.


Consider buying a cheap (and perhaps waterproof) watch just for your holidays. Chunky, costume jewelry is a great option for embellishing your outfits without the need for expensive gold and silver., This step is pretty obvious, but make sure to look up the weather forecast in your destination are before you leave. If it's raining in London, you may want to pack a small, fold-up rain jacket and an umbrella for your arrival and leave the sunscreen lotion at home. And while certain weather conditions may be expected, if not guaranteed, in certain areas, you should always double check just in case that place is experiencing unseasonably hot or cold conditions.

, When planning outfits, try to stick with more neutral colored items that work well together, particularly if you're traveling for business. Blacks, browns and grays all work well, and you can never go wrong with a crisp white shirt or blouse. If you feel too boring going all neutral, you can add a pop of color with accessories or a bright tie., Look up your local airport regulations to get an exact list of what items you are forbidden from bringing in your carry-on luggage. Being aware of these restrictions will prevent you from accidentally packing anything like razor blades or gel candles which could trigger a security check during the screening process and cause you delays while traveling.

, Make sure that you weigh your bag before you leave the house to make sure it's not over the airline's weight restrictions. Although some airlines can be pretty flexible, others will happily hit you with exorbitant fees if your bag is even a pound overweight. Try to give yourself a couple of pounds leeway if possible, as you may want that extra weight to pack souvenirs or gifts on the way home.

Find all of these (these are the basics, and are absolutely necessary):


First Aid Kit - Have bandages, plasters of a variety of sizes, safety pins, antibacterial hand wash, antibacterial wipes, normal wipes, several mini - packs of tissues, a tub of petroleum jelly, a thermometer (it is handy to have both a rectal and oral thermometer, just in case one breaks), a packet of paracetamol, a packet of ibuprofen and a small bottle of Calpol or something similar, and any medicine particular to anyone travelling with you.,

, Before you apply for the program please make sure you meet all the requirements to become an Au pair in China.

, Fill out the application documents and provide them with all the needed documents, e.g. copy of your valid passport, photos, dear family letter, etc.

, Mostly it will be via Skype, so if you haven't got an account yet its the perfect time to get one. In the interview you have to convince the agency that you are a suitable candidate as an Au pair in China.

, Your agency will provide you with all the information you need to apply for your visa in China.

Take the right taxi when you arrive.,
Pay the correct amount.,
Get a telephone: Every Indian owns a mobile phone.,
Register at the FRRO.,
Get a residency permit.,
Get a PAN card: Your employer will pay taxes for you or you will pay your own taxes.,
Obtain health insurance: either you have taken up a private health insurance in your home country or your employer offers you a certain health insurance package with your contract.,
Learn about transport: If you are not lucky enough to live in one of the cities that has a metro, you will have to rely on the following methods of transport:


Bike rikshaw: slow, unreliable and usually the drivers do not know their way around.,
Experiment with eating out: Restaurants are quite cheap and usually the food is fine.,
Get an International Driving Permit from your home country.,
Buy food in a market.,
Wear appropriate clothing: This is especially important for women!,
Try out the nightlife: Mostly nightclubs are in expensive hotels and the prices are even higher than in Europe or the US.,
Observe state alcohol laws.,
Be prepared to see poverty: It is everywhere.,
Recognize that cows are considered holy by Hindus.,
Adjust to the manners: Remember that different people have different manners.

",How to Be a Foreign Resident (Expat) in India," Look for the pre-paid taxi stand. Do not let any person approach you and offer you a taxi. They are definitely overcharging by a very high amount (up to 300 percent!). Make a difference between A/C (airconditioning) and non-A/C cab. In the middle of the night and in the cooler period, A/C is not needed, it is just more expensive. 'Luxury cabs' do not exist, thus a higher amount for taking one is not justified.;
, When reaching your destination, your cab driver will do everything to charge you an extra amount. He might give you the following reasons: driver's charge, night charge, luxury charge, tip, waiting charge, parking fees, sick mother, grandmother, dog, cat, cow or sheep. None of this is true! Pre-paid taxis are called pre-paid taxis because they are pre-paid. Tipping cab drivers is not common and not advisable.

, Getting one takes some patience, but is quite easy. Identify the most reliable mobile provider in your region. Common ones are: Airtel, Hutch (now Vodafone), Idea. Usually you need your residency permit and passport as well as 1-2 passport pictures. You can use your European telephone or a U.S. one (although India providers are mostly using the GSM network -- same as AT&T and T-Mobile in USA). But simple mobile phones can be bought starting from 30 USD.

, Within the first 14 days of your arrival you need to register at the Foreigners' Regional Registration Office (FRRO). Usually, your employer helps you with that. If not, try to find a reliable Indian person, who can help you out with the language spoken in the area you live in, as nobody in the FRRO will speak enough English to understand you. Do not forget to fill the simple form with your address and other details. And take passport pictures. In India passport pictures are needed for everything, so make it a habit to carry at least 5 with you at all times.

, Once the FRRO has worked on your registration, you (or somebody in the company you work for) will be asked to pick up your 'residency permit' (stamped form). This paper is very important. Do not lose it and carry it with you when you are traveling, as it is proof that you are an Indian Resident and will give you discounts at many tourist sites (Humayun's Tomb in Delhi, Qutab Minar in Delhi, Amber Fort in Jaipur and many more). It also proofs that you are in India legally. The process for your permit to be approved can take anything between 5 days and 2 months.

, In any case you will receive a PAN card that shows that you are 1. an Indian Resident and 2. paying your taxes in India. This card you can carry with you instead of the residency permit, as it serves the same purpose and is accepted by most people and institutions as a means of identification.

, Bigger cities in India have good private hospitals and doctors at prices that are affordable.

, Not advisable after dark for single women. Price: bargain, bargain, bargain! It is cheaper than you think and foreign people pay a higher price than Indians in any case.
Auto rikshaw: They do have meters, but those never work. If they do, in many cities the drivers have lists that show the rates you have to pay according to the meter. If the meter does not work: bargain, bargain, bargain!
Taxis: same as for auto rikshaws. There are also taxis that have fixed prices which can be booked for a certain number of hours and kilometres with the driver. Ask your Indian colleagues for the local prices for these (and everything else). And usually, even though a fixed price had been agreed, the drivers will want more money. The only charge that really does apply is the night charge (usually from 11 PM)and parking charges (in Delhi between 10 and 20 RS). Do not pay anything they ask you without asking for proof.

, Indian food is very spicy and contains a lot of beans. In most of the bigger cities, there is a good variety of Western food available (at higher cost though). Hygiene is a very sensitive topic. Mostly the plates and cutlery are clean.It is only a myth that the food is not cooked in hygienic conditions. Today maximum Indian restaurants observe the hygiene standards laid down by the central board. Indian chefs work very hard to give you the right quality food. If your concern about hygiene is genuine we suggest you eat at a good restaurant and not at roadside. Nobody can assure healthy food at roadside whether in India or in New York.

, Indian transport authorities do not recognise a driving licence without an IDP. It is NOT recommended to drive yourself in India -- driving is chaotic and random, and rules are rarely followed in India. If you wish to drive, do so with caution, and remember that drivers in India will not extend the same courtesy as expected in Western countries.

, Fruit and vegetables are widely available on markets. They usually weigh what you buy, so if they don't, insist on it, otherwise they will definitely overcharge you. There are good supermarkets as well, which sell imported products at the same prices as in your home country or slightly more expensive.

, Do not wear short skirts, tight clothes or tank-tops.

, Clubbers are either rich expats or posh Indians. Music is mostly Indian Bollywood, Punjabi etc. or techno/house music.

, In some states, the minimum age for drinking is 18, in others, it is 21, and some, such as Maharashtra, it is 25 for hard liquor. Transporting liquor across state lines are often illegal -- eg Goa to Maharashtra, (because of high excise duties in Maharashtra); Maharashtra-Gujarat (because Gujarat is a dry state). In Maharashtra, to drink alcohol, you need to make a permit, although this rule is rarely enforced.

, And even the poor expect more money out of you than of their Indian people. So they might cling to your legs, grab your arms or in any other way with their whining voices try to get your attention. There is no solution for this.

, You will see them roaming the streets in some areas. Treat them with respect.

Prepare yourself beforehand.,
Learn the language.,
Beware of differences in nonverbal communication.,
Study the culture.,
Humble yourself and keep an open mind.,

Reflect on your experiences.",How to Assimilate," Learn as much about the foreign culture as possible before immersing yourself in it. Feeling prepared may reduce the anxiety you feel once you get there, thereby allowing you to assimilate at a more comfortable pace.


Don't expect to learn everything there is to know, though. Firsthand experience is almost always a better teacher than secondhand source material. Preparing yourself before you embark on the adventure can give you an advantage, but you'll still need to make considerable effort to assimilate into the culture once you arrive.;
, You don't need to become fluent, but you should at least learn enough of the language to ask for essential information and hold basic conversations with the locals.Note that many languages have both ""familiar"" and ""polite"" speech forms, and you'll need to know which is which to avoid offending others.
Do your best to learn as much as possible, but don't worry if you make a few mistakes. Most people will appreciate the effort you've made to learn the language even if you don't perfect it.

, Nonverbal communication can be just as important as verbal language. Gestures have different meanings in different cultures, and if you aren't careful, you could easily use the wrong one and cause a misunderstanding.


For example, creating a circle by touching your thumb and forefinger together would be considered an ""okay"" sign in the United States, but in Brazil, the same gesture is used as a profanity.
If you aren't able to master all of the nonverbal communication cues, at least try to learn which gestures are considered rude or profane so you can avoid using them.

, Spend time actually studying the culture itself. Read about it in books or online, watch informative videos, and talk to people who could tell you about the area you'll be visiting.


Pay special attention to the most common areas of cultural difference: religion, political structure, customs, and etiquette.
If you have any colleagues who have been there before, talk to them for firsthand knowledge. You could also contact the embassy or consulate of that country.

, No matter how different the other culture seems, try not to look down on it. You can disagree with the way certain things are done, but ultimately, you must be willing to accept things the way they are.Expect things to be different, but don't let those differences worry you too much. Some anxiety is only natural, but too much can ruin the experience.
Try to avoid letting other people get on your nerves. Even the most courteous countries have discourteous people living in them. Don't let rudeness ruin the experience for you or make you feel prejudiced to the overall country.

, Passively accepting the unfamiliar won't be enough to help you assimilate to the new culture. You also need to show an active curiosity about the country, its culture, and its population.


Look at the experience as an adventure and go from there. Instead of isolating yourself where it feels safe and comfortable, continually push yourself to experience more of the native culture and way of living.
Don't be afraid to ask people questions. Generally, most will be willing to address honest, polite questions since your inquiries demonstrate your willingness to learn and assimilate to their native culture., While an adventurous spirit is requisite to assimilation, healthy caution can be equally significant. Avoid putting yourself into positions that could result in physical harm or legal trouble.


You should also take some basic precautions to care for your needs while you're in this new country. Keep your legal documents (passports, visas, etc.) in a safe place at all times. Know who to contact in the event of a medical emergency or other difficult situation.

, Hearing and seeing are passive responses to environmental stimuli. Listening and observing, on the other hand, are active responses that will allow you to learn about the foreign culture more thoroughly.


Pay close attention to how native residents act in certain situations. Doing so will probably give you a better idea of how you're expected to behave than any study guide could.

, Making friends can ease your loneliness and allow you to assimilate more naturally and comfortably. Even if you don't get close enough to become “friends,” per se, you should at least find some trustworthy allies you can turn to for help.


Seek the support of other foreigners, even if they aren't members of your own native culture. When you need to vent or get a second opinion, these individuals can be of great assistance.
Your should look to the local population for friends and mentors. They can direct you more adequately about unfamiliar aspects of the culture. Additionally, becoming friends with people who are native to that country can help you feel as though you've actually woven your way into the community.

, If you travel to a foreign country and spend most of your time with others who share your culture, you aren't really immersing yourself into the culture of the country you've traveled to.Of course, that doesn't mean you need to avoid other foreigners completely. Making friends with others from your home country can help you deal with feelings of isolation and culture shock, and the group of you can cheer one another on during the adventure.
The idea is simply to avoid sinking too deeply into your comfort zone. If you make too many connections with people from your native culture, you may unconsciously use that as an excuse to avoid mingling with those native to the local culture.

, Depending on the circumstances, you may not be eligible to work or study in this new country. If you're allowed to do so, however, getting a job or taking classes at a local university can help you weave your way into the workings of that country's society.


If you aren't able to take classes at an official university, you might still be allowed to take classes at community centers and similar locations. For instance, a nearby market may offer cooking classes in authentic local cuisine.

, Find out if there are local interest clubs you could join or organizations you can volunteer your time with. There are usually fewer legal restrictions regarding these types of groups, so they should be easier to attend than jobs or colleges are.


If you're interested in sports, try joining an athletics club. If you have a passion for animals, find out if there are any community service organizations that care for animals, and ask if you can volunteer.
Visit local places of worship, too. If it's culturally appropriate, consider attending some type of service at a local place of worship. Find a place of worship that matches your own religion if you want to become part of it long-term, or attend a service at another type of worship center simply for the sake of cultural enrichment.

, Formal workplaces, academic institutions, and organizations will allow you to adapt to the structured side of the culture, but if you want to assimilate in a more well-rounded fashion, you'll also need to spend time at casual hangout spots.


Going out for drinks can be a good way to mingle with the locals since people of all cultures are generally less inhibited when they're around alcohol, but proceed with caution. Make sure that you're legally old enough to drink in that country and avoid getting drunk enough to lose control.

, Visit some of the major attractions, natural wonders, and historical sights. While this may seem like a stereotypically “tourist” thing to do, it can help gain some appreciation for the way the country's history developed.


If you don't know where to start, purchase a travel guide or locate a tourist agency. Consider going on group tours if you feel uneasy traveling to different parts of the country by yourself.
Once you start making friends with more of the local population, you can ask your new friends to show you some of their own favorite spots that may not be in any official travel guide.

, At the end of each day, set aside some time to reflect on the cultural experiences you had. Think about what went well and what went poorly, then alter your attitude accordingly before moving forward.


Keep a journal of your experiences and reflections. Doing so could make it easier to review the things you've learned and monitor your own progress."

, For example:


Switzerland is famous for its beautiful mountains. The temperate climate in Switzerland, varying from glacial mountaintops to pleasant Mediterranean climate at the southern tip. Summers tend to be warm and humid, with periodic rainfall, so they are ideal for pastures and grazing.




 The Greater Zürich Area, which has 1.5 million inhabitants and 150,000 companies, has taken top position in some life quality surveys.

Switzerland has one of the most stable economies in the world. The Swiss franc remains one of the world's strongest currencies with the lowest inflation rate.
Switzerland remains very open to foreigners and has a diverse population. Resident foreigners and temporary foreign workers make up about 22% of the population.Religious freedom: Switzerland has no official state religion. Christianity is the predominant religion of Switzerland, divided between the Catholic Church (41.8% of the population) and various Protestant denominations (35.3%). Islam (4.3%) and Eastern Orthodoxy (1.8%) are sizable minority religions.Greeley (2003) found that 27% of Swiss are atheists.Switzerland is particularly suited for skiing, snowboarding and mountaineering, which are enjoyed by both locals and tourists.

, Check out books from your local library or bookstore, search the internet, ask around people who have been to Switzerland or know about the country. Be familiar with the country's cultures, traditions, laws, religions, cost of living, climate, language, transportation, etc.

, Moving to another country is a big decision in your life, so be sure to take your time and consult with your friends and loved ones. You must be absolutely convinced that moving to Switzerland is better than staying where you are, and that it is the best country for you to move to.

, A passport is a must for Americans. You will probably require a passport to travel by plane to Switzerland wherever you travel from if you live in Europe already, a passport may not be required, you may be able to cross the border from another European country unchallenged. Remember Switzerland is not part of the European Union. Get all required legal documents, such as passports, visa and work permits. This is essential, or you cannot gain entry into Switzerland. Visit the Federal Office of Immigration, Integration and Emigration if it helps, for all questions pertaining to visas and regulations. It is very easy to follow and has detailed information in four languages.

, They will typically help you get a work permit. There are many internet resources that can help you find a job in Switzerland.Excellent job search tool, with many international positions including Switzerland.</ref> Most Swiss employers are great employers, and many of them are even willing to hire someone with the technical skills they need regardless of language proficiency. (The Swiss languages are German, French, and Italian, each spoken primarily in areas of the Switzerland neighboring the respective countries.) If you work for a company in the US that has an office in Switzerland, you may be able to apply for a transfer. If not, consider looking for such company.


Know that highly qualified specialists and top executives are awarded work and residence permits, in lieu of the above step. If that applies to you, you may apply for such permit. Be aware that this type of permit is extremely hard to obtain and even harder to get renewed.






Take advantage of the three month rule: you are allowed to stay in the country legally for up to three months. Ensure that you are entitled to work during the three months. Take small jobs such as babysitting or English teachers, while looking for permanent work during the three month period. If you fail to find permanent work, don't be discouraged, but simply try again. When the three month period is up, leave the country for a while, then return for another three month visit to resume the job search.

, Switzerland is the wealthiest country in the world, with an average per-capita income about £28,000 a year, and is one of the most expensive country to live in. If this does not deter you, you need to bring enough money to get a good start once you arrive, and be very conservative with spending every penny.

, For example:


From Britain: Flying is by far the easiest, cheapest, and most convenient way to get from Britain to Switzerland. Travelling by train is comfortable and scenic, but is more expensive and takes more than a day. Trains and buses are worth considering if you are interested in visiting other parts of Europe during the trip.
From North America: Several airlines fly direct from North America to Zürich; many other airlines offer flights to Zürich via other major European cities.
From Australia and New Zealand: Flying is the cheapest and easiest option. Fares vary significantly with the season: low season runs from mid-January to the end of February and during October and November; high season runs from mid-May to the end of August and from December to mid-January; the rest of the year is considered ""shoulder season"". So plan to travel during low season if possible. Find the best deal. Travel agents often offer better deals than buying direct from airlines.

, Note that the symbol for the Swiss franc is CHF, which stands for Confoederatio Helvetica Franc; the official name of Switzerland is Confoederatio Helvetica, or Swiss Confederation. Remember, the more money you bring, the better start that you will get in Switzerland. The rate of currency conversion may fluctuate, so keep a look out on the foreign exchange market, as you may be able to get a little bit extra money (especially if you are converting a lot of money)., For example:



Pets: You may freely import cats and dogs without a permit. Obtain a rabies vaccination certificate from a veterinarian. The certificate must be written in German, French, Italian, or English can contain name and address of animal owner, description of the animal (breed, sex, age, color), confirmation that the animal was submitted to a veterinary examination prior to vaccination and found in good health, date of rabies vaccination, type of vaccine used, name of manufacturer and batch number, & signature of the veterinarian. Certificates in other languages are accepted if accompanied by a legal translation. Guinea pigs, hamsters, rats, mice, aquarium fish, and canaries can be imported without a veterinary certificate. Domestic animals and dangerous animals require import permits from the Federal Veterinary Office.
Weapons: Obtain authorization from your place of origin to import weapons.
Cars: You must pay import duty (consisting of customs duties based on weight of the vehicle and engine capacity; 4% consumption tax; 7.5% Value added tax; and 15-Fr for the report) to import a car that you owned for less than six months. Contact is the customs authorityfor full details. Cars you owned for more than six months are exempt from import duty and will simply require filling out a clearance request form. Also consider selling your cars and buying a car in Switzerland, or use a bike or public transportation.

, Big items can be imported separately, so pack only what you can fit into a bag, such as books, clothes, personal care items and money.

, This is likely to be very emotional, so remember to bring tissues. Hug each other and tell them you love them, and invite them to come visit any time they want. Promise to keep in regular touch, and do so.

, Relax on the trip, and feel excited about starting a new life, in a new country. Do not worry too much about friends or family, as they will come and visit often, and you will make plenty of new friends.

, Visiting the country will offer you an opportunity to find a place. Real estate agents can help you in the process; alternatively, you can read books and search the internet.

, once you get there.

, Check out all the resources available to help you integrate into the community

xpatxchange.ch/ - A one-stop shop for English speaking ex-pats in Switzerland, full of advice, businesses, addresses. It is perhaps more useful once you have arrived in Switzerland.

, Not only will becoming a Swiss citizen help you integrate into the country permanently, you will also be able to start your own businesses, no longer need to re-apply for residence permits when changing jobs, no longer need special permission before purchasing residential property, and be able to move freely within the country. There are two ways to become a Swiss citizen:


By birth, if both parents are Swiss. Children born in Switzerland from non-Swiss parents do not automatically become Swiss.
By naturalization. Make your request to the Aliens Police in the municipality of residence. From there, it will then be sent to the Federal Department of Justice and Police, who will give a principle authorization if you meet the following conditions:

You have resided in Switzerland for at least twelve years, three of which are within the five years prior to the request. Time spent in Switzerland between the ages of 10 and 20 years counts double.
You are integrated in the Swiss community.
You are accustomed to Swiss way of life and practices.
You comply with the Swiss legal system.
You do not compromise the internal or external security of Switzerland.
You are able to afford it. Since Switzerland is a federal country, authorization must then be obtained from the canton and the municipality, which may add further conditions and set the cost of acquiring citizenship before approving it. Some municipalities apply rather open policies, while others will go as far as granting nationality by means of a local population vote. Cost varies according to municipality and canton.

, Write what it's name is, The capital(s), State or province names, Language(s). You can think about it.If possible make a custom National flag, song(s), anthem(s), symbol(s).

, As Bob Dylan said, ""to live outside the law you must be honest."" The same thought holds true for forming a micronation: to make your own rules you must follow established rules and conventions. Much of the basis for current nation building comes from the 1933 Convention on Rights and Duties of States, also known as the Montevideo Convention.These are the basic rules set out in Article 1 of the Convention:The state as a person of international law should possess the following qualifications:


A permanent population
A defined territory
Government
The capacity to enter into relations with the other states
The balance of the first ten Articles go on to explain that the existence of a state is independent of recognition by other states, and is free to act on its own behalf—and that no state is free to intervene in the affairs of another.
Note that these are not laws in the conventional sense. You are free to declare yourself a country, anytime, and anywhere. However, nobody will take you seriously, which translates to the simple truth that you will have no legitimacy as a nation.

, This is the hard part. With two exceptions, existing land has all been claimed by existing countries. The main exception is Antarctica. Even then, should you brave the weather and lack of ""population appeal,"" Antarctica is managed by the most powerful countries in the world, and it's unlikely they'll let you just plant a flag and say, ""Mine!"" Second, there is Bir Tawil, a tiny plot of land between Egypt and Sudan, which neither claim. However, there is very little appeal to this country, due to it being only a patch of sand. Also, it has been ""claimed"" by Jeremiah Heaton, and is referred to as North Sudan.Still, there are things to try, to get around this earth of available dirt:


Conquer an existing country. There are many small island nations dotting the Pacific, and it's unlikely they have much of a defense force. Sure, it's crazy—but crazy enough that it might just work! All you need is an army, a navy, and the support of the world community—many of whom protect these small nations from intruders. This has been attempted in the Comoros, Vanuatu, and the Maldives, but ultimately failed. However, this is not recommended due to the devastating impact colonization has had on numerous countries around the world today, as well as the fact it is unjust to take land from the indigenous rulers of the land without consent. It's much better to just make a treaty and take over that land with a fair and just agreement. Buy an existing country. If you're wealthy enough, you can buy an island, though it's unlikely that the host nation will just cede sovereignty to you. A more corrupt or destitute country might be more easily swayed, but even that is difficult: a pack of libertarians tried to buy Tortuga from impoverished Haiti, but were rejected. There are some things money just can't buy.
Find a loophole. The Republic of Indian Stream, for example, was founded on land between the U.S. and Canada that was poorly defined in the 1783 Treaty of Paris. It lasted from 1832 to 1835, when it was annexed by the U.S.
Look for regions that are otherwise unproductive for the local government. Chances are that the local authority won't have any interest in keeping a disputed, resource consuming territory that is otherwise economically/politically unproductive.
At this point, you might be thinking there's no hope, but we've saved the best for last. As land has become scarce, but the human need for new land continues apace, creative (and financially abundant) individuals have begun taking to the sea.

, The ocean, as they say, is the last great frontier. International waters are owned by no nation, and this has spurred interest and activity.



The Principality of Sealand. Sealand, initially created as a military base in the North Sea, off the coast of England during World War II, is a football-field-sized structure that housed troops and weapons to strike at German invaders. After the war it was abandoned until 1966, when a rogue DJ named Roy Bates—tired of battling the British government over his pirate radio station—moved there to set up shop. The station never went back on the air, but he declared the floating fortress the Principality of Sealand. He raised the flag, named himself Prince, and his wife Princess Joan. Sealand withstood court challenges, and remains an independent nation to this day.

Palm Island Group. While not a nation, the Palm Island Group off the coast of Dubai is indicative of the direction that holds the most promise for nation builders. Extending out into the Persian Gulf are 3 palm tree-shaped man-made islands that opulent living for the world's millionaires and billionaires.

The Seasteading Institute. Founded by the grandson of Milton Friedman and PayPal founder Peter Thiel, this would-be libertarian utopian foundation believes in bringing the free market to bear on government—a start-up for democracy. Their hope is that experimental, innovated governments will be able to generate new ideas of governance that will change the world. They are fostering the goal of building sea-based platforms with loose building requirements, no minimum wage, and limited restrictions on firearms. Proponents see this as a the key to the next generation of free enterprise. Critics suggest that loose building codes and low-wage workers with lots of weapons, being run by a bunch of would-be John Galts as a recipe for disaster. While the politics of the Seasteading Institute may or may not be your cup of tea, it's a fair bet that the ocean is truly the new frontier.

The Republic of Minerva. One millionaire activist piled sand onto a reef located in the Pacific Ocean south of Fiji and created an artificial island to start the Republic of Minerva.But if you're not rich enough to make land, then just make it up—some of the more lighthearted micronations claim land on imaginary continents or planets.
In addition to the traditional territory-based nation, there exists a largely untapped, unregulated, and unexplored territory that is virtually limitless—because it exists only virtually. Call it the cloud, call it the web, or borrow from William Gibson and call it cyberspace, people are spending more and more time connected emotionally and interactively with their friends and colleagues through the internet. Virtual worlds such as Second Life and Blue Mars create 3-dimensional habitats, have their own currency, and their own constitutions (aka ""Terms and Conditions""). Flatter worlds such as Facebook (aka Social Media) encourages groups of like-minded people around the world to work together for the common good—as defined by the particular group. Like the ocean, virtual nations will have a growing impact, and may result in very real, separate national identities within the next 100 years.

, One of the key requirements for a nation—aside from territories—will be a population. If the land you conquer or build doesn't come with an indigenous people, you will have to bring your own to the party. Invite your friends and family to join you in this venture, and you will have a small, but dedicated population.


These days, if you're serious about anything (and creating a micronation can be serious, indeed), then you will have a website. Use this to find like-minded people, and give them good reason to populate your new Republic. It could be for work and money, or the freedom to have many wives, or simply the opportunity to be part of the birth of a nation.
You will need to decide what you require of your citizens. Do they have to pass a citizenship test, or abide by certain laws? What form of identification will they need—a passport? Driver's license? Subcutaneous RFID?

, The success or failure of your venture will be determined, in large part, by your leadership in governance. Consider the success of the United States, rooted in a Constitution that is at once clear and defined, yet open to interpretation and growth. Without that, it may have fallen into disarray and dozens of small nation-states rather than an arguably united whole. Your government, and your constitution, should be guided by the principles you wish to establish from the start. Here are some examples of various micronations, and their founding principles:



Nova Roma, dedicated ""to the restoration of classical Roman religion, culture and virtues"".The American Empire, based on a strong sense of humor and a love of science fiction, fantasy, and games.Political simulations or political movements. These micronations tend to have strong political views and are often controversial. In the past, some of them have managed to attract media or political interest, although this is rare. Despite their relative obscurity, they are some of the most common types of micronations.

Cultural missions. These micronations, similar to historic projects, exist to promote a particular culture and tradition. There are many Germanic micronations such as Domanglia that attempt to recreate the culture and traditions of the former German Empire. Many of these also include nationalistic and patriotic projects.

Secessionist entities. By far the most serious form of micronation, secessionist entities are often much older then other forms of micronations. Notable secessionist micronations include Sealand, the Hutt River Province, and Freetown Christinia.

, Now that you have territory, a population, and a government with a constitution, it's time to declare yourself. One of three things will happen, depending on what you have prepared for the world:


A collective yawn. The world may look at your declaration of independence, and promptly go back to watching a rerun of Star Trek.
A welcome into the community of nations, an invitation to a seat at the UN, and requests for ambassadors and embassies.
An armed invasion. If your nation runs afoul of borders, existing treaties, human rights, or other legal protocols, you may receive anything from a knock at the door by Rent-a-Cop Officer Friendly informing you that the ""Independent Nation of 1234 N. Raynd Avenue"" is in a covenant-controlled community that does not recognize your sovereignty, and that you must to take your flag off the roof or be fined, to an all-out invasion by a United Nations coalition ordering you to stand down and please get into the bullet-proof Mercedes SUV, where you will be whisked off to The Hague to stand trial for crimes against humanity. Alternatively, your micronation could suffer the same fate as the Republic of Minerva: soon after libertarian millionaire and activist Michael Oliver created a landmass by pouring sand onto the Minerva Reefs south of Fiji, and subsequently proclaimed sovereignty, the island was invaded and annexed (with international support) by Tonga., If you're not trading in dollars, Euros, or other currency, you will need to create your own financial system. Will you base your nation's wealth on gold, on securities, or on a whim and a prayer? While your word may count among your friends, for national debt, you will need some serious collateral for that to be of any use. If you stick to established currencies, you will still need to determine how to fund your government, and the best way to do this may be anathema to the very reason you start your own country: taxes. Through taxation, your government will be able to provide essential services such as a power grid, water lines, a necessary bureaucracy (as minimal as you like), and an army.


It's a fundamental obligation for every state (small or large) to be able to defend its citizens from enemies. Whether this is a standing army, national guard, compulsory service, or some other defensive solution, this will be something to consider when creating your constitution.

, Barring any untoward issues resulting from the founding of your country (see above), you will want to become a player in the world. To do this, you will need other nations to recognize you. This will require you to become adept at international law, politics, and diplomacy. If these are not among your strongest skills, you would be wise to recruit a cabinet of skilled politicos to take on this task.


This is perhaps the most difficult step of all. Some nations, such as Palestine, Taiwan, and Northern Cyprus have all the checkboxes checked—but are still not recognized by many countries. There are no rules here—every country has their own standards by which they determine recognition. Things that could have an effect on the outcome are issues such as where you stand on Al Queda, or communism, or capitalism. They might hinge on your approach to human rights, or control of natural resources. In the United States, the decision to recognize a nation is made by the President. Your request will hinge on who occupies the White House at that time, and their policies and preferences may swing wildly every four years.
Also, membership to the UN requires that none of the five powers US, UK, China, Russia and France veto your membership. In other words, you will have to have neutral stands on controversial issues like Palestine, Taiwan, Crimea, etc.
If you live near or in Europe, try applying for membership to the European Union as well. This will ensure your sovereignty in world politics.

, Every country needs a flag, of course, and yours will be no different. This is the most prominent of national symbols, but there are other symbols that will help establish your identity as a nation:



Money. What will your currency look like? Will it have your profile boldly embossed on gold coins, and in 3D hologram on paper money, or will you use a symbolic icon such as Lady Liberty or Charlton Heston? Will you go full-tilt modern, or attempt to hearken back to a time when each piece was carved by hand?

State Seal. You can come up with a national motto and translate it into Latin. There are many free online translators. Add some florid graphics with a shield, all to suggest you're descended from royalty—or you can state your mission clearly in your own language, and have a graphic designer create a logo. A good logo can be worth more than the crown jewels of England!

Official correspondence. With all the letters you'll be writing to the President, the UN, the Prime Minister, and other heads of state, you'll want nice letterhead on high-quality paper, embossed with your seal.

National Anthem. You'll want a national anthem to play at important events.

, Every country must have some verbal language. You can:

Use an existing language (like English). You can also use ancient languages
Make your own language. If you do this make sure the citizens of your country understand it (in other words teach them the language).
Combine languages. Believe or not English started out that way.

, The world isn't getting any bigger, and governments aren't getting any smaller (no matter what they promise), so the sooner you get out there and stake your claim. The sooner you can declare yourself Prince, King, Emperor, Ayatollah, Supreme Ruler, and President for Life of .

Everything that you can prepare ahead of time will be that much less that you have to prepare when the time comes. Problems with your visa may cause delays in your ability to go.


Make sure your passport is current. If you need a new one, that is the first order of business. It can take several weeks to apply for and receive a new passport.;
, Before all else, draw up a plan that can be checked off as things are done. This plan needs to be thorough and it should include deadlines. Here are some other considerations:


Discussing the packing and shipping arrangements. Interview at least three different companies and get their quotes for the move. Find out what each company is prepared to do: specialized packing, dealing with your wine cellar (this can be problematic), helping with pets, timing guarantees, storage at the other end, etc. Also, discuss the possibility of storing possessions in your current country. If this move is short-term and you intend to return, it might be best to leave some—or even most—items behind.
Deciding what to do with your current home if you own it. Are you going to sell it or rent it out? If selling, talk to a real estate agent and tell them about your plans. Ask yourself if you have time to wait for the best offer, or you need to sell quickly to get the money. Be careful how you convey this to your agent—you still want the best price, whatever your hurry.

If renting it out, interview agents responsible for rental properties and be sure you are one hundred percent happy with their services. Ask for references and if possible, favor an agent used to renting out properties for overseas landlords—it's much harder to be an overseas landlord and much can go wrong in your absence if the agent fails to meet their basic obligations of checking the properly regularly and vetting tenants properly.


Dealing with mortgages, leases and loans. You will need to talk to your bank or other lenders about handling these financial obligations most effectively.
Talking to your children's schools about the upcoming change. You will need evidence of your children's current level of schooling, as well as a guarantee of willingness to be emailed or phoned by the school in your new country, if relevant. Ask the guidance counselor about any transition issues you might find useful.
Vaccinations and visas. Be sure that you are up-to-date with relevant vaccinations and obtain all visas. Sort out any accompanying documentation needed for a permanent or long-term move.

If you're planning on renouncing your citizenship of your current country and taking on new citizenship, this will take considerable time, so start working on this from the beginning of your planning.


Developing a timeline for packing. Follow this with dedication, as it can give you plenty of time to deal with things that go wrong—and they will!







, Some corporations and government entities that send their staffs overseas are quite happy to give anything from a few months to a few days notice that you are handpicked to move overseas. In this case, ask for as much help as they are willing to pay for—you will need it.


If you do have the luxury of your own timeline, give yourself at least six months. You will need every moment of this time to tie up many loose ends, including dealing with your property, car, pets, insurance, packing, and shipping, banking, educational transitions and more. In some cases, you may not have this luxury.
It is possible to move quickly, so if this has been thrust on you, try not to despair. However, do immediately spend time creating networks of helpers. You really need as many hands on deck as you can gather.

, Will you stay in hotel or serviced apartment accommodation while looking for a place to buy or rent?


It is not recommended that you buy a place over the internet. Unseen, you could buy something terrible. You need to be on location to get a sense of the neighborhood, to see the dry rot at the base of the house, to realize that it is overpriced!
One way around this is for you or one family member to do a forward visit, to check out real estate to see what's on offer and whether anything is a good deal. You may also know somebody in your new country who can be your eyes and ears.
Even if you want to buy a house or apartment in the new country, it is recommended that you begin by renting. Renting gives you a quick out if you choose the wrong location or you simply do not like being in the new country. After at least six months, you will have a better idea of wanting to stay or not, plus a much better understanding of the real estate and preferred areas to live. This means less pressure for you and a greater likelihood of making the right decision.
Be aware that you will initially be without your shipped goods. This makes living in a hotel or a serviced apartment initially a good choice.
Get a good lawyer when dealing with purchase of property in another country. You will need someone on your side who understands all the taxes, fees, liens, caveats, etc that the country you're moving to has in store. Your current attorney may be able to give you a recommendation for an attorney in your new country.

, It is becoming easier to transfer money between many countries without giving up too much in processing fees. Talk to your current bank to explore the options for setting up transfers—some banks even allow transfers to overseas accounts via cell phones, so look into all the options.


Unless you are planning to never return to your current country, it is advisable to keep at least one bank account open in your current country. The longer you have an account open, the better your credit standing. When you do return, it is easier to start where you left off than to have to open new accounts. Internet banking makes it easier for you to monitor the account in the country you have left.
In some countries, accessing money will be a lot harder than in others. Be sure to discuss the challenges and solutions with your bank and a reputable financial adviser with knowledgeable about the country that you are moving to.

, They can be an invaluable source of help if you need information, support, and connection. Let them know about your plans and it is likely that they will do what they can to ensure that you get the information you need.

, It is a reality that we need very little to live and yet our houses tend to be overstuffed with consumables we have accumulated over the years, much of which we do not use or need. Rather than dragging all this stuff with you, or paying to keep it in storage, do an honest appraisal of the need for keeping much of your belongings. Where possible, donate and give away the items you do not need. It is far better to travel light and not have to worry about items in storage than to burden yourself

, Use online auction sites ad-listing websites to get rid of your items. Even if you are pressed for time, this can be a great way to sell items in bulk, even whole roomfuls. Tell people that you are moving overseas and that it all has to go. People love to grab a bargain!


Be ruthless. Every thing added means greater costs in shipping.
Occasionally, shipping containers fall overboard, while damage can occur to goods at any stage of transit due to rough handling and other mishaps. Bear this in mind when lugging your antique collection of whatnots with you––it may be better to place in storage or to sell and have the cash. Become adequately insured for any mishaps during shipping.

, For some people, this means giving them to a friend or family member to care for. For others, it means taking them with you. If you are taking your pets with you, consider the following:


Is your pet allowed in the country you are headed to?
Will your pet undergo quarantine? For how long and at what cost?
How will your pet travel? Find out about safety, costs, and all requirements, such as pet passports.
How is your pet's health? Your pet needs to be thoroughly vaccinated and medically fit to travel. There may be other requirements of the country of destination too––check.






Consider your pet's frailty when making the decision. Taking an old or disabled pet with you may be too much trauma for the pet.

, Some countries are happy to accept your existing one from another country or to accept an international driver's license. Others want you to take their local tests after a set time. Avoid waiting to find out––it can be hard to be without your ability to drive in a new place.

, If you are not already traveling for the place you work at, you will need to abide with their policies on resignation. Be sure to plan in plenty of time to tell them. However, unless there is something obviously affecting your place of work because of the planning, it is not recommended to inform them until later in your planning. This is in case you change your mind or your place of work thinks about shifting you out earlier than what you might have counted on.

Stay safe.",How to Move to a Foreign Country2," Moving to a place, nothing like your home might give you a culture shock and make the move more difficult, but this will start to be overcome after a few months of immersion. People do things differently in different countries—which is why we call them ""foreign"" countries—and we are alien to their ways. Yet, this is the biggest and amazing opportunity you will have and to seek to understand a different culture. Once you let yourself into the thinking of people from another country, you will never go back; it is much harder to see the world as ""us and them"" once you know this experience.


If you are not familiar with the customs of the local people, do some research beforehand and get to know the ways as much as possible. It is better that you have a surface understanding than none at all—at least this gives you the opportunity to be understanding and to get more involved in cultural events and customs when you're in the new country. It will also help to ensure that you do not make mistakes that might cause affront.







, That favorite coffee drink you loved at home and that favorite place you used to visit can become glaringly obvious to you when they are missing from your life. It is important to acknowledge the sense of loss you feel but to remain open to finding favorite new experiences instead. The undiscovered may even herald favorite things you will learn to love more than what you were used to in your original home country.


If you move from a country with a lot of choice in consumables to one with a lot less choice, you may find life challenging. No longer do you have the aisle of breakfast cereals (it is now down to a small rack) or the amazing choice in cars (you have either the blue or the gray one now). Initially, this can be extremely frustrating. You have two choices—one, accept it and realize that a lack of choice frees up thinking time and spares planetary resources, or two, travel back to your home country and buy up (or have understanding family and friends send you care packages). While for many people the lack of choice does not really fade with time (you will find yourself reminiscing frequently about the days when you could get X item in X different styles) but you do get used to fewer choices!

, Initially, the first few months will feel like an amazing vacation and you will spend a lot of it discovering things and feeling excited. However, eventually you will realize that you are actually having a life there and it is not half as exciting as you thought. For some, this realization can hit sooner rather than later, as bureaucracy, household maintenance issues and minor crises interrupt the flow of settling in.


Early on, ask about decent tradespeople. Eventually, something is going to break. In addition, you are going to need someone reliable who turns up when they say, they will and who charges fairly. If you have not already lined up such people through asking others who do know, you are fair game for being taken advantage of, and overcharged. This can be a nightmare experience, and since you have the freedom to plan rather than wait for the ax to fall, plan.
Stay calm when dealing with bureaucratic procedures. Most countries have forms, most have queues, and most have the most insanely ridiculous reasons for filling out things and waiting. Yours is not to question why but to learn via locals and online sites how to manage these issues as best as possible. There is always a way, be sure to learn about the right way. If you do not ask, you will never know.

, Another form of culture shock is learning what you cannot do, even though you could do in your old country. You are not in a position to question it—reach an acceptance that this is how things are. Whether the society you have gone to is more or less permissive than what you are used to, be sure to do the right thing to fit in. If you wanted to create a ruckus or take a stand, then moving overseas is not the right way about it; stay home for that!

, Moving countries is right up there at the top of the stress scale. Some days it will be fun. Other days it will be the worst experience ever. Other days, it'll feel just like home, because it has become home.


Your rollercoaster of emotions deserves to be taken care of. If you suffer from anxiety, unabated fears, depression, etc., seek help with a mental health therapist. Do not suffer in silence—it will only be compounded by the foreignness of everything and everyone around you and you can end up feeling completely isolated and terrified.






Be sure to build a network of close friends, to talk openly with family and friends about feelings and to listen carefully to the concerns of your children (if relevant).






Mental health therapy can be obtained online if you would rather deal with someone from your old country. The beauty of the internet is that you can remain close if need be.






Use social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and email to keep in touch with friends and family you've left behind. Use Skype to have face-to-face talks: it's almost like being there! This can be reassuring and beneficial way to keep your feelings in check and to get support from people who know you well.






Invite your closest friends over to stay occasionally for a mini-break.







, Another issue related to culture shock is moving somewhere that is not as safe as where you came from. Ask locals for advice about where to stay away from and what issues are around the area.


Wear appropriate clothing for the place you are living in and try to blend in. Sometimes lack of safety happens because of criminals considering someone to be a tourist or to be inappropriately dressed.
Call in to the local police station to ask about safety issues. You might also ask about crime levels in areas you are researching for buying or renting a home in too.

Determine what country you are interested in moving to.,
Take a vacation to the country so you can experience it before calling it home.,
Learn all that you can about the country.,
Learn about the country's immigration laws and procedures.,
Be aware of language barriers.,
If you have children, moving overseas becomes more challenging.",How to Move to a Foreign Country3," Unless you do not have a choice in the matter, such as with business relocation, the decision is yours to figure out where you see yourself living best. To the beautiful rose city of Toulouse in southwest France? To Berlin in Germany? To the beautiful Nordic country of Iceland? To Mexico? Venezuela? Spain? Russia? China?


Imagine living in that new country. Watch videos online to get a sense of what it like there, during all seasons of the year. Consider weather, pollution levels, ease of access to food, transport, and medical attention. List what things there are to do there by way of work and activities.
Look online to find the stories of people who have already made this move. Ex-pats can be the best source of information; reading their experience will help you develop a wider sense of whether or not this is a sensible option or whether it is something that a majority find problems with. Give some credence to what they say, since they are experiencing it; however, also beware that individual experiences will vary considerably depending on the reasons for their move, their income levels, their job experiences, the area of the country they are living in, etc. Ask questions if the forums of the site permit.
Will you be able to work in the new country? Is there a demand for your profession? What hoops will you have to jump through for employment? Is there a possibility of getting a job there before moving so that you can be reassured of earning? Few people can afford to take the chance of not having a job in a new country unless they are already wealthy enough to cover the length of stay there. Also, find out about social insurance and what tests you'll need to meet to be eligible—be aware that you may not be eligible for months or years, or maybe never.

, Guidebooks are a good source of information, but do not rely on them completely. Try avoiding the touristy areas of the country and visit places ""off the beaten path,"" where you can interact with locals on a personal level. However, be warned: If you are enthused to move overseas as a result of having visited a place during a vacation, realize that having a vacation somewhere and living there are two completely different experiences. On vacation, you have no daily grind, no interactions with the daily bureaucracy and routine that locals do and generally not a care in the world. Once you live there, the realities of life in that country may be something quite different from the pampered experience of a tourist. Do not base your decision to move merely on having visited a place!

, This includes local customs (very important), language (even more important), and the areas that make up the cities and regions. It is vital to know whether you think you can handle living under different laws, customs and routines because these will affect your everyday life. For example, stricter regulations about what you can and cannot do in a country like Singapore (down to not chewing gum in public at the risk of being canned) may cause a freedom-loving US citizen to feel constricted.

, Can you even shift to the country you would like to live in? Some countries have very strict requirements for immigrants based on income, age, skill set, training or family connection. You may find that if you are not rich, not skilled, too old, or without family already living there that you do not have a chance to move to the country in question. Read the rules laid out for the particular country on its immigration website. Call the relevant immigration department and ask for more specific information in relation to yourself—no amount of printed information can ever be as clear as laying out your personal situation before someone who can advise on the specifics.


Contact the country's embassy as your first port of call. They often keep information packs for those wishing to emigrate.







, Do people speak a different language from your own in the country you are planning to move to? If so, do you speak that language? Be honest about your ability to pick up a new language—it is quite hard for some people to learn a new language, even when immersed in it. During the time that you do not know it, you will find yourself disconnected from a lot of what is happening around you. If you already lack confidence in yourself, this can be an extremely alienating experience.


Consider learning the language to a proficient level before leaving your own country.
Book lessons for language immersion the moment you arrive. Find a sympathetic tutor who understands both your language as well as the one they are teaching you. Ensure that this person can make the time for you to go to places together to help you learn the language in specific contexts, such as shopping, dealing with a landlord, banking, buying a car, registering for school/college, etc.

, For starters, think hard about whether you want to pull your children out of their current routine and friendships. This could be a devastating change for them. Is the schooling in the new country as good as or better than where you are now or is it less reliable? What options are there for decent schooling as a foreigner if the local schooling is not good? Find out about these things well in advance because they really matter!


Don't forget that depending on where you go, your children will likely have to learn a new language or a new dialect of a language (for example, they may need to become familiar with differences between Australian English and American English). While some parents see this as a good thing because their child has an opportunity to become multilingual, if your child has educational issues of any kind, this might really throw them through hoops.
This is especially true if the local language functions on a different alphabet than the child's first language.

Look for clues that can make questions easier.,
If all else fails, guess.",How to Attempt the Life in the UK Test," Attempting 24 multiple choice questions in 45 minutes is easy, so instead of wasting time worrying, read the questions carefully. This will help you to score better. You may even pass with flying colours.
, Depending on how you prepared and your study of the Life in the UK Test handbook, you should know the answers to at least 50% of the questions. So instead of losing time struggling with difficult questions, keep answering the easier ones first. You can always go back to the questions you've left unanswered later. Spending too much time on a question you're not sure of will just increase your stress and decrease your confidence and concentration. However, this doesn't mean you should answer the easy questions in a hurry. The 45-minute time limit is enough if used wisely to attempt all questions and even to do some double-checking at the end., After answering all the easy questions, you may still be worried about the ones you still haven't answered. Relax for a moment and take a deep breath. Then start tackling the remaining questions. Remember, you've already completed a major portion of the test., Read the difficult questions over again, slowly and carefully. Since these are multiple choice questions, you can probably find the right answer just by paying attention to the wording.

If after reading the question again, you still feel can't answer it, move on. Spending too much time on one question means you may end up not having enough time to complete other questions you might know the answers to. If you still have time at the end, return to those tough questions.

, If you guess, you at least have a chance of getting the answer correct. If you're lucky and do guess correctly, you'll improve your score. Not answering at all will not help your score."

Making a living.",How to Live Like a Rock Star (or Tango Star) in Buenos Aires," Argentina is the New Zealand of the western hemisphere. From tropical rain forests in the north to world-class skiing in Patagonia, it has it all. Check out rare tropical birds or watch penguins get eaten by killer whales — it’s your choice. The capital city of Buenos Aires (BsAs), sometimes referred to as ""The Paris of the South"", was created by immigrants from Spain, Italy, and Germany, so you get the best food, architecture, and culture from all three.;
, Airfare will run over $1200 USD round trip if you're coming from the US, so ensure that you’re staying for a while. Remember that summer in BsAs is from December-January, and consequently it will be very hot during those months. November or March-April are gorgeous, and summer time in the Northern Hemisphere is perfect for skiing in Bariloche or Las Leñas. Aerolíneas Argentinas often offers good prices, and you can sometimes get deals by flying into Rio or Sao Paulo, Brazil and then to BsAs on Gol or TAM. Check airfares immediately after 1am on Saturday nights (Sunday mornings), when many airlines lower prices based on “flight load” (ratio of sold-to-empty seats).

, Be careful — people will attempt to overcharge you. This will happen in any country with weak currency. You might find that it’s not worth the headache to deal with most Argentines and attempt to save a few hundred dollars, even if you speak fluent Argentine Spanish. If you keep running into dishonest or unreliable landlords, you might want to deal exclusively with non-Argentines. Use Craigslist or ba4u apartments. You’ll pay 3x more than an Argentine. A decent room in a good location can be found for $300 USD (~239 Euros), a great single bedroom apartment can be found for $700-800 USD (~537-613 Euros), but here’s one tip: if you can get a friend to come with you (or if you have a family), a two or three-bedroom apartment can be had for $1,200-1,300 (920-996 Euros), and it will be 10x more luxurious than the one-bedroom. Some great areas to live are, in descending order of preference: Recoleta (near Plaza Francia), Palermo, Barrio Norte, and San Telmo. Puerto Madero is the most expensive area and people fight for it, but there isn't much to do there unless it's a weekend evening.

, Spend an evening walking around one of the best hotels in BsAs, such as The Four Seasons, Sheraton, or Hotel Alvear, and make friends with one of the managers on call. They get VIP tables at all of the top clubs — Asia de Cuba, Opera Bay, Mint, Amerika, etc. — and can get you on the lists, so invite them for drinks and ask them for suggestions of where to meet. If not, just visit the clubs around 10pm on a Thursday or Friday and ask to meet the director of special events, or the manager (”gerente”). Tell him you’d like to bring some friends to the club and ask how to get on the list. Keep his card in your wallet to flash at bouncers. Worst case scenario, just spend $50 USD (or ~40 Euros) with a few friends and you can get a 6-person VIP table with unlimited champagne for the night.

, Some favorites are Gran Bar Danzonand La Bistecca, but don't underestimate the hole-in-the-wall parrillada (Argentine BBQ) restaurants. Just wander down Lavalle off of Avenida Florida and take your pick: the (very inexpensive!) beef sandwiches (use plenty of chimichurri) will blow your mind.

, Tango is a huge part of Argentine culture. Social tango is completely improvised (much like breakdancing). Chest to chest, strangers will embrace and get to know each other more in three minutes than 10 dates would accomplish. Every night of the week, tango rules, usually getting started around 1am. Here are some favorite milongas (tango dance halls):#*“New wave” (nueva onda) tango and 20-30-something crowd: “La Viruta” at Armenia and Cordoba, inside the Armenian Cultural Center. 1am+ on Wed, Sat, and Sunday are the best times to go.


Traditional and older crowd: “Sunderland” or “La Baldosa” — find “El Tangauta”magazine in any tango shop, or at La Viruta, for addresses and all the tango info you can handle.
If it is your first time in BsAs, have an Argentine friend call the tango teachers and ask for pricing for an unnamed “friend,” not mentioning that you’re a foreigner. Otherwise, you will be drastically overcharged. You should be able to get excellent private lessons for 50 pesos/hour. Good group lessons can be found at the Carlos Coppelo school in front of Shopping Abasto.

, It doesn't take much to live like a star in BsAs, but it does take a lot to steadily make what would in other cities in the world. Don't assume that you can just go down there and find a job. You'll need to secure a job in BsAs first, then move; or establish income that can be generated remotely (with an Internet connection). You may also be able to live off of retirement income, as well. If you plan on staying in BsAs permanently, get your finances in order so you can maintain your luxurious lifestyle.

Or you may want more international experiences without having decided on a particular place. Either way, these steps will help you evaluate the possibilities and pitfalls associated with each destination, preparing you for the challenges and excitement ahead.;
, If you have friends or family in a foreign country, that can make the transition much easier. Try asking your family members or friends who have traveled or hosted foreign guests whether they know anyone in the regions you are considering. Keep in mind


Does your family have a cultural attachment to a certain region? Even if you are not in contact with any family overseas, you may decide to narrow down your options to your ancestors' region of origin to learn more about family history and traditions.

, Are you up to the difficult and possibly isolating task of living in a country where you don't speak the language? Find out how many people speak English (or another language you understand) in the locations you are considering. Even if you have taken classes in a foreign language, be aware that regional accents, faster everyday conversation, and slang can make it tougher to understand than you expect.


Keep in mind that the language situation may vary within a country. For example, rural areas are more likely to be monolingual than cities.
Take language lessons from a book, recording, or teacher before you leave if possible, or practice your language skills in conversation.

, Some expats live just a train ride away from their home country, while other are on the other side of the globe. If you travel to another continent, realize you'll probably need to pay large sums of money and spend many hours on an airplane in order to visit home. If you are departing from or heading to an area with no airport, that trip could require days or weeks instead. How likely is it that you'll return home for a visit, and what kind of expense in time or money will you be willing to spend for that trip?

, If you are traveling to a city, you may find your destination in the annual Mercer expense ranking. However, you may need to search for online expat forums to get a more detailed understanding of a specific area. The cost of housing, food, electricity, heating, and transportation are all important to know, and one may be more expensive than you're used to even if the others are cheap.Relatively low costs of living may not help you if your new salary is low to match, or if your country's currency is weak.


Always translate costs and wages into the currency you are familiar with and keep your money in. Use an online exchange calculator to get the most up to date information, and to see whether the exchange rate is changing rapidly.

, Consider the weather at your destination carefully before you commit to a long term stay, especially if you enjoy outdoor activities. If you have hobbies or interests, find out how easy it would be to keep them while you're abroad. Geography, city size, crime levels, and ease of contact with the outside world may also influence your decision.If you wish to use specialized job skills abroad but do not yet have a job, finding a region where your job skills are in demand is especially important. Find an international professional organization if possible to find contacts who have worked abroad in your field, and ask them for advice about relocation.
Reading tourists' guides to individual cities or regions can be a good way to narrow down your search from a country down to the local level, where weather, attractions, and culture can vary greatly.

, If you have a family traveling with you, make sure they will be comfortable as well. Are there schools where your children will feel welcome and have their language use accommodated? Are there any concerns your spouse has about his or her own job prospects, comfort, or safety?


Other members of your family can use this same step-by-step guide to identify possible challenges.

, If you are still not sure where you want to live, and you have the time and money, you could travel to your possible destinations and see firsthand whether you would like to live there. Try to spend at least three or four weeks in each destination to get a more accurate idea of what life there is like.Also consider what standard of living you'd be able to maintain on a permanent basis: a stay in a hotel may not tell you much if you would actually be moving in with a local family. Try to interact with locals and see how they live their lives, and where they spend their time.

, This option is only available to students, or possibly to recent graduates. Study abroad programs are among the easiest ways to visit another country long-term, since your lodging will be arranged for you and you will meet people through enrollment in a foreign university. While the visit typically lasts a semester or an academic year, it can give you a thorough introduction to another country, and may teach you more about whether you want to become a permanent expatriate.


Study abroad options may be available through your university, secondary school or high school, or through third-party organizations. Financial aid may also be available. Ask a school counselor for more information.
If you are currently applying to universities, consider applying to foreign universities as well. Make sure they offer classes in a language you speak before applying.

, If you work for the military or a government institution, your nation may pay you for overseas assignments. If your country's diplomatic office is hiring, you could even enter a new overseas career – but be aware that this requires extensive training.


If you are a member of the U.S. military or a U.S. government employee, find more information through the the United States federal travel website.

, Most overseas teaching organizations require an undergraduate degree.However, this does not necessarily have to be in education. If you speak English fluently, that alone could make you high-demand without any foreign language experience required. Search for teaching abroad programs online, and ask them which teaching certification they require. Some programs may pay for your certification over the course of a few weeks or months, and then assist you in your travel plans.

, Many humanitarian organizations are constantly on the lookout for volunteers who are willing to travel and assist in all kinds of programs, from building schools to providing medical assistance. Many programs require physical labor and/or travel to dangerous areas, so be sure you know exactly what you are getting into before you apply. It's always a good idea to research this type of program thoroughly, since some of them may not offer the travel assistance or emergency medical help you need.If you are passionate about an issue, do your research thoroughly to determine how best you can contribute. Ask the volunteer organization questions about its practices: does it support local economies, or does it only use imported labor and materials? What percentage of their funds go to the humanitarian project versus administration and other costs?, If you work for a company with international ties, it's possible you can talk to Human Resources about applying for an overseas position. More commonly, you will need to start a job search from abroad, which can be difficult if you are not in a high-demand field. A contact at your destination who can vouch for you may make a tremendous difference.

, This option is not recommended for families, as there is no guarantee you will find a stable living place or employment in another country. However, if you want to travel for a while rather than settle in one place, this may be the option for you. Be aware that you risk running out of money or getting into dangerous situations. If possible, keep enough money in your bank account to transport yourself back home or to a location where you have friends or family who can support you in case of disaster.


Note that you will most likely have a tourist visa, which could make it illegal for you to work abroad, as well as limit the amount of time you can stay in a country to a few weeks or months (depending on the visa).

, For most trips outside of your country, especially long-term or permanent moves, you will need a passport issued by your country of citizenship. Check the expiration date and renew your passport if necessary. Begin the application or renewal process before you make travel plans, as the process may take several weeks or months.


If it is not possible to receive a passport from your country of citizenship, you may need to apply for a non-citizen travel document from the country you reside in. Contact a passport office for more information.
You may wish to renew your passport even if it will be valid on the date of your departure. Many expats return or visit their home country eventually, and it is usually easiest to renew your passport from within the country that issued it.

, Almost every country requires long-term visitors (and often short-term visitors as well) to apply and pay for a visa, or authorization document. The process involves varies greatly depending on your destination, your country of citizenship, and your purpose for traveling. Research which visa application fits your requirements best online, or contact the nearest embassy of the country you are traveling to.


If your application for a long-term visa is rejected, consider applying for a shorter-term visa instead. Once you are in the country, you may be able to find a job and apply for a work visa.
Research the relevant visa regulations carefully to discover all your options. Some countries may allow you to stay indefinitely as long as you briefly exit the country every once in a while and pay for a new visitor's visa.

, Research disease and health concerns at your destination. Serious health concerns can be avoided or mitigated by safety practices, often as simple as boiling water before drinking it. Protect yourself from other diseases found at your destination by getting vaccinated before your departure. If you don't have health insurance, look for walk-in clinics in your area that provide vaccination services.

, If you plan to earn money while living overseas, understand how you will be taxed by your country of citizenship and/or your country of residency. You may wish to consult a tax preparer or lawyer for advice, or ask your new employers whether they provide tax assistance for foreign employees.


If you are a citizen of the United States, you could be fined for failing to report a foreign bank account containing $10,000 or more.You must also file tax forms, although you may be able to use this form on the irs website to declare your income un-taxable.

, If you know someone in your destination country, or if you can find traveler's advice forums online, have a long conversation about life there and how to prepare for it. If you can't find anyone to talk to in person, research your destination thoroughly from up to date online and printed sources (preferably published no more than five years ago). It is impossible to cover every situation worldwide, but here are a few things to consider before you travel:


How easy is it to get around by public transportation, versus by car? If renting or buying a car is a good idea, will your current driver's license be valid in that country, or will you need to take a test?
Does your bank have branches in your destination country, or a ""sister bank"" you can access your account from? If you decide to open a new bank account overseas, what documents will you need to do so?
In case of a medical emergency, where can you receive medical treatment from professional doctors? Will you share a language with them, and if not, where can you find an interpreter on short notice?

, Once you've made your decision and have all the logistics worked out, book your travel. Keep in mind that tickets tend to be cheaper the earlier you book them. A return ticket may be a wise investment and back up plan, and may be reasonably priced even compared to one-way tickets. One-way plane tickets can have strange pricing depending on the airline, so use several ticket-finder websites to avoid getting charged four times as much as you should., Having a backup plan is a good idea, even if you think you'll be away permanently. Ideally, you could rent out your old house or apartment, and have a family member or friend act as a local property manager on your behalf.

, Unless you are already familiar with the area you're moving to, it's not a good idea to purchase a property or sign a year-long lease without seeing the building or neighborhood.A much safer plan is to find a location you can rent on a month to month basis while you investigate long term options.


For an even more comfortable transition, although an expensive one, stay in a hotel for the first week or two after you move while you investigate the rental options in person. It is still a good idea to research possibilities beforehand and let the landlords know when you'll make a decision.

, When packing clothes, consider what the weather is like at your destination, and find out what locals wear if possible. It's a good idea to pack some non-flashy, conservative clothing, since foreign countries may have more formal dress requirements than your own.If you are moving from an area with mild winters to an area with severe winters, the winter clothing at your destination may be more suitable than what you can purchase in your area. However, if you are traveling in winter, remember to pack one set of winter clothes to wear on arrival.

, Regulations and availability can make acquiring medical supplies difficult in foreign countries. If you have any medical issues that require medicine, emergency inhalers, or other products, pack several months' worth if possible.This gives you a comfortable stretch of time before you have to find another source.


Note that you may be required to pack medicine in a clear plastic bag if traveling by plane, or pack non-vital medicine in your shipped luggage. Exact regulations vary by country.

, Even if you tend to pack light, a long term or permanent move could call for more packing than you're used to. Favorite books in your native language, a sentimental object, or some other reminder of home may make it easier to fight off homesickness.

, Even if you have a job waiting for you at your new location, have enough money in your bank account to support you for at least a month of meager living.Ideally, save enough money for three or more months by creating a budget, cutting expenses, and cancelling your credit card.


Make sure you have cancelled any recurring bills, or had them redirected to your new address.

, Different countries may have different outlets, and your electric and electronic equipment may not work on them. Find out which outlets are used at your destination and buy several connectors that will fit your gadgets to the foreign outlets.

, Get rid of as much stuff as you can, or have friends and family members store your excess possessions. International shipping can be expensive, especially if you are moving overseas. In many cases, it may be cheaper to purchase a new item at your destination.


Pack a few boxes or pieces of furniture that you are unsure about, and store them in a rented storage space or at a friend's. Label them clearly and ask a friend to ship these boxes once you've settled in, if you decide you need the contents of a particular box after all.

, When you first arrive in a foreign country, you might feel hypersensitive to every difference. Even something you've never thought about might be called into question, such as the time of day people eat meals, or the tone of voice that is considered polite when talking to a stranger. All of this can cause you to feel extra tired, react irritably in conversation, cry unexpectedly, or even make you feel physically ill.If you're honest about your reaction and do your best to think about and come to terms with these differences, you will have a better chance at recovering quickly.


Culture shock can happen even in a country where people speak your native language. Be prepared for it even if you think you'll be in a similar country to your own.

, Whenever you experience something that makes you feel disgust, anger, or confusion, try to figure out why. Do locals react the same way, and if not, why is this considered more ""normal"" here? You don't need to throw away your moral compass, but you will be happier if you spend less time judging other people and more time trying to understand their motivations and cultural pressures.

, If you intend to stay in a country long term, putting in the effort to learn the language of everyday activity is worth it. This can feel slow and painful, even if you've studied the language before, but it is also an exciting opportunity. You are surrounded by fluent speakers, and while language lessons, books, and recordings are still excellent resources, you can also practice your language by going shopping, attending a concert, or introducing yourself to your neighbors.

, There's only so much you can figure out on your own. Making friends with people who grew up in the area and have lived there many years can help greatly. If you accidentally offend someone, or if you go through a confusing experience, a local friend can explain the situation and teach you how to deal with it in future. Talk openly and honestly once you have gotten to know someone, and he or she will be able to make your transition to this culture smoother., Living abroad can be a difficult balance between immersing yourself in a new language and culture, and maintaining your ties with home. Making friends with other expats and visitors can be an excellent way to vent about your frustrations, bond over shared experiences, and reminisce about your times back home.Just be sure to balance this out with time spent among locals as well, or you might find it tempting to stay in an expat ""bubble"" and stop interacting with the local culture.

, Maintain contact with friends and family back home with regular phone conversations, letters, or emails. Have a few mementos from home, such as goodbye cards or a favorite book, and look at them when you're feeling down. If you can't shake the homesickness, or you are shutting yourself in your room at every opportunity, you may wish to seek counseling, or ask a friend to pull you out of your rut and take you to a hike, dance, or other activity you would enjoy.

, If you have family or friends back home, ask them to ship you snacks, a new book that just came out in your country, or other treats you aren't able to purchase in your adopted country.If you do not, order yourself these treats online, saving up for international shipping if you need to. These can be a great way to cheer up after feeling homesick or overwhelmed.

, Ideally, this routine should include exercise, sleep, and an adequate, healthy diet, but while most of us know this reduces stress, it isn't always easy to follow a rigorous plan like this. Finding a stable habit you can return to each day can be enough to make a difference, even if it's as simple as eating the same, comforting breakfast or walking through a park after your workday., After fighting homesickness, dealing with culture shock, or grappling with bureaucracies to get your visa renewed, it's understandable to feel strong emotions. You will probably feel intense anger or sadness at different points in your life abroad. You might feel that you hate your adopted country or regret traveling, but in most situations, these feeling will pass. If they don't, and you end up bitter or sad on a daily basis, it may be time to move back home.

Always speak positively about the change.,
Be patient.,
Pack a ""ready-to-be-home"" box.,
Learn about the new culture as quickly as possible.,
Learn the language.,
Look around for new learning opportunities you can do as a family.,
Have faith in your children's own strength.,
Help them keep in touch with old friends.,
Enjoy the transition as a family.",How to Assist Children With Cultural Adjustment," Children will quickly pick up from you that you find change exhilarating or terrifying. Make it easier on them by being positive about it. There is nothing wrong with making comparisons but do this in an educational way, not a ""I wish things were like home"" way. This will help the children to see the change as an adventure and something to be excited about.;
, Your new environment is not going to be your old environment and even restoring the family dynamics will take some time. Even if you get a new home and move in, it doesn't automatically bring back the lifestyle that you enjoyed in your previous country. If you can accept this, you will not be battling the feelings of nostalgia - embrace the nostalgia (for it will wash over you) but also be open to wonderful newness of all that is around you and look for all the positive elements of the new country and living arrangements. Encourage the children to look for all the good aspects as well and share your ideas together.

, This should be the last box on the removal truck and the first one out. Have each child place a favourite toy, book, bed item and wall decoration in this box. Add any other elements that you feel say ""our home"" the moment that you put them on the wall or in the house somewhere. The moment your goods arrive, take this box and remove all the contents immediately. Each child can put their special home items in their rooms and you can decorate the remaining areas of the house. Although it will take a while for it to be your home, these little reminders of the last place together from your home country will ease some of the strangeness of it all.

, Be open to the new customs and traditions. Help your children to learn the new customs and do your best to have them observe these customs. It is important to explain differences in behaviour that might cause problems if the children behave in ways that are frowned upon. Make sure that they learn new rules that will help them in social contexts, such as using the correct hand to eat food or bringing gifts for special occasions. Some local customs may bother them too, such as children being patted on the head a lot; help them to understand that this is an expression of love for children but if it gets intolerable for a toddler, lift her up and carry her until she gets used to it.

, If you are not in an English speaking country, it is important to immerse yourself in the new language as quickly as possible. This tends to be easier for children and there are many fun ways that they can begin to learn a new language - through reading children's books, TV, DVDs, visiting the park and making friends, attending shows and the cinema, joining hobby groups etc. Even if they attend an English-speaking school, they will still need the other language for outside school hours and to really gain an appreciation of their time in the new culture. It also broadens their employment opportunities as they grow older.

, If you all go to an activity together, like an art class, they can practise their language skills, but in an environment where you are near by and ready to help them.

, Children tend to be more accepting and more resilient than adults about differences. They learn quickly, they adapt quickly and they find their own ways to cope with new ways of doing things. And it doesn't help to try to hide the harsher side of life from your children, such as poverty and homelessness; the children will eventually see it and for many who do notice it, they become very aware of the need to give, share and be of some help, especially when they see other children in distress.

, Send postcards, letters and e-mails to friends from home. This is a good opportunity to have the children explain their new life in a positive light to someone who doesn't know it - in the process, this often helps them to realise all the wonderful experiences that they are having. If possible, arrange a visit from your child's closest friend when you are settled in. And sometimes you will need to comfort the children when the friends taper off as does happen - it takes a lot of effort to keep in touch and as time moves on, ties don't always hold.

, Often living in a new culture is something that brings a family closer together, as you all adjust and seek reassurance from those who care about you most. This is a special experience that you may not have had if you had stayed in your own country; cherish the closeness and the shared journey of learning and support. Do things together that get you out of the house and discovering your new place together; share your fears, joys and concerns together and help one another make this transition gently.

Ask yourself the following:


Do I have a nice, big lawn? It will be more difficult to spend your staycation outdoors if you're limited to just a small patch of grass off the back door. In that case, research local parks where you can spend time. If you happen to have a large backyard with plenty of open space, you won't even have to venture off your property.

Where is the nearest public swimming pool? Skip this question if you're fortunate to have your own private pool to use at your leisure. Even if you don't, you can fill up a baby pool to splash around in, get wet with the garden hose, or run through a sprinkler head. Check out parks, community centers, and apartment complexes that have full-size swimming pools you may be able to use for a small fee (or free).

Determine your budget.,
Figure out what type of experience you want.,
Choose a destination with price and flexibility in mind.,
Pick your approximate dates.",How to Save Money on Vacation1," Figuring out how much money you realistically have to work with is critical, or you’ll feel the pinch right before Christmas. Your budget will help determine where and how far you go, by what mode of transportation, where you'll stay, how you'll eat and what you'll do once there. Knowing tricks-to-the-vacation trade will make creating and sticking to a budget easier, and your vacation more enjoyable.When thinking about your budget, always consider currency exchange rates. What can your dollar get you in different places? Will you get a nicer hotel or the opposite? Check out XE.com for exchange rates, currency converters and travel-expense calculators.;
, Is your vacation meant to be a solitary retreat, but to where you’re still not sure? Will it be a family beach adventure? Do you want to be active and always on the run, or do you want to relax a lot? Are you fine around large crowds? Thinking about what you want and do not want will make your vacation much more enjoyable., Traveling during what is called the “shoulder seasons,” just before and after the peak seasons, is often the best time to take a vacation. For one, the prices are lower. Yet because these times are just off a peak season, the weather is still nice, there are fewer tourists and crowds and locals are happy for your business. For instance, April through May and mid-August through October are the shoulder seasons for most of Europe.


Also be flexible about the precise location of, say, the family beach adventure. You want to go to the Bahamas, but there’s an amazing package deal to Key West. Would going to Key West give another area of your budget that was a little lean the boost it needed?Another thing to think about: Many cities are considered “jump-off cities.” For instance, if you fly to Las Vegas, you can spend a few days there and drive to the Grand Canyon., Being flexible on dates is greatly to your pocketbook’s advantage, so pick a 2-week time frame (say, in next September) for your vacation. You'll search for and compare prices on travel, lodging, food and entertainment rates during this time frame. You’ll also be looking at the specials and deals. If you aren’t able to give yourself this window, you can still save money in comparison shopping and snatching up specials.

Identify any perks and rewards you have.,
Know the cheapest times to fly.,
Start by looking on travel search sites.,
Look at package deals.,
Avoid certain nonstop flights and most round-trip tickets.,
Look at neighboring cities.,
Watch the fares.",How to Save Money on Vacation2," First, if you fly frequently on one airline, look at how many frequent flyer miles you’ve accumulated. Next, call your credit card companies and see what travel perks your specific cards have or if any are available to you. You may already have free points toward travel. Another consideration, taken with care, is to sign up for a travel-related credit card through either a financial institution or an airline. They often give new members thousands of air points upon signing. Some allow you to add multiple users, avoid currency transaction fees and luggage fees.


All U.S. airlines, for example, offer a travel-related credit card that gives you 30,000-50,000 bonus miles upon signing and making one purchase, which is one ticket right there., Knowing when to fly can you save you hundreds of dollars on one ticket, thousands for a family. If you can avoid it, don’t travel during the holidays or Spring Break because ticket prices will be very high even when booked in advance. If you are planning a vacation over Thanksgiving or Christmas, fly on Thanksgiving day and in the early morning and late evening on Christmas. In general, tickets are cheaper if you fly midweek, on a Tuesday or Wednesday, or on a Saturday. You also want to fly in the early morning or late evenings.


Saturday are less expensive because businessmen, who account for a lot of air travel, want to be home before Saturday to spend time with their families on the weekends., Buying tickets directly from airlines is almost always more expensive than using airline search sites like Priceline.com, Kayak.com and Expedia.com. These sites scour hundreds of sources and airlines to find good rates. Because you’ve chosen a 2-week window, start plugging in dates. Most sites will allow you to select an option for them to check flights a few days prior to and after the date you enter. Whichbudget.com is a great site to get affordable, international flights because it accesses local, budget airlines you had no clue existed. Here are some additional points.If your international vacation includes at least two countries, and you have to change planes in one of these countries, check with the airline to see if you can stay a few days before changing planes. Sometimes they’ll let you do it, and you’ll save a heap of money.Don’t forget to ask about age, student and other discounts that may be available.
Make sure you factor in luggage. Find out how many bags each person can check for free, if any. How much does each bag and/or each additional bag cost? What about oversized luggage? Each airline will have a different policy. Luggage fees can add up fast.

, While on these sites, also check out the flight and hotel package deals. Sometimes you can even haggle and bid on prices. There are a few downsides, though: a) you may not always know which hotel you might get, b) renting rooms separately by using discounts and special deals found elsewhere might be cheaper and c) a hotel might not be the best option in the first place. Buying the package might be easier, but it might not be cheaper nor the most suitable option for your needs.

, Nonstop flights are much more expensive in almost every case. While connecting flights can be a hassle, they can save you a lot of money. Also, round-trip tickets are almost always more expensive than buying two low-priced, one-way tickets – one to get you there and one to get you back. However, Kayak.com has a feature called “Hacker Fares” that pieces together a round-trip ticket from one-way flights on multiple airlines. They aren’t available for all trips, but you should definitely look., Many sites also have an option that allows you to select neighboring airports to fly from or into, which can drastically reduce the cost of your flight. For instance, if you’re going to NYC but the fare is awfully high, check out the Newark, N.J., airport next door. In many cases, it won’t increase your cost of getting to your lodging by much, if anything, especially if you’re already planning to rent a car. Many airports will also have shuttles.


You can check the neighboring airports yourself, too. Do an online search similar to “airports in southern California” or “airports near Orlando, Florida/central Florida.”Consider starting your flight at a regional airport. Many cheaper airlines (some you’ve never heard of) service these airports. While getting to them may not be as convenient, you can save a lot of money.
Another option is to drive to your first connecting flight and park in long-term parking. If, for instance, the first leg of your trip is a one-hour flight that costs you $200 per ticket and you can drive to that location in two hours, seriously consider driving, especially if this is a family vacation., Continue to look for the best deals through the major search sites. But also look for deals elsewhere. Airfarewatchdog.com sends out alerts when airlines post sales. Sign up for your favorite travel companies’ email notifications, “like” them on Facebook and follow them on Twitter to get promotion codes and specials that are only announced through these channels.Also, once you’ve booked your flight, use Yapta.com to track price changes on 9 of the major carriers. Many will refund you the difference or give you a travel credit if they’re undersold.

Take the train.,
Drive in a personal vehicle or motor coach.,
Ride the bus.",How to Save Money on Vacation3," Riding a train, such as the primary carrier Amtrak, to your vacation depends a lot upon the length of your vacation. Train travel is much slower than flying. It has its perks, though – you get to see a lot along the way, you have more elbow room, the seats are designed to recline back pretty far with a kick-up leg rest for a good night’s sleep and many trains have sleeping cars. Amtrak has a variety of vacation packages, but if you’re riding it to travel to your destination alone you can also take advantage of certain deals.


You typically get the best rates if you book your ticket 1-2 weeks in advance. With that said, you can save 25% on Amtrak tickets by using its SmartFares deal. The downside is that you must use the ticket within 1-2 weeks of purchasing.Other 10-20% everyday discounts include those for children, seniors, veterans, military personnel and their families and AAA members., Driving to your vacation spot is also largely dependent upon where you intend to go. But it also may be that your vacation is a road trip with stops along the way. Either way, driving can become expensive, though there are some tricks to keep down costs. Your best bet for cheap gas is at truck stops or travel center chains, like Petro, Flying J and Love’s. Another option is getting a credit card from a major gas station chain, which will give you discounts on gas.


When driving, the slower the better in terms of gas mileage on the highway. Gas mileage rapidly declines over 55 mph.
Make sure your tires are always properly inflated to prevent blowouts and to increase gas mileage.
Try to avoid buying food and drinks every time you stop for gas or to go to the bathroom. Buying fast food adds up quickly, too. Instead buy and pack food and beverages., Again, deciding to take a bus to your vacation is greatly impacted by how far you’re going. It’s also a decision often based upon how much money you have. Riding the bus is pretty cheap. While buses haven't had the best reputation for awhile, many bus lines have taken steps to upgrade, adding Wi-Fi, more legroom and larger and better-reclining seats. You can get the best rates for all by booking your tickets online.Check their websites for student, military and senior discounts or for discounts by signing up for discount cards. Some of the big companies are Greyhound, Chinatown Bus, Megabus and Boltbus."

Think about your needs and budget.,
Start looking for hotels.,
Be flexible about location.,
Pay attention to the amenities.,
Look for hotel deals.,
Consider bidding for rooms.",How to Save Money on Vacation4," Lodging is a big expense on a vacation, so think about what you really need to still have an awesome time. Are you going alone, with your family, a group of people? Do you want to be close to the attractions and not rent a car? What types of amenities do you want? How much money have you budgeted for lodging? While chain hotels are the traditional way to go, there are other options, especially if you want to cut corners. Here are some examples and sites to visit for each.


House-swapping with another family or individual (HomeExchange.com); staying for mere pennies in one of over 50,000 hostels around the world (Hostelz.com); renting a condo, apartment or home with all the amenities to share with your family or a group (HomeAway.com); going to a Bed & Breakfast with home-cooked meals and a local's scoop on the area (BedandBreakfast.com); camping, which itself might be the vacation; or staying with a friend or family member.Finally, staying at a resort hotel is often the best option for certain vacations beyond the traditional “island resort” vacation, even if it's not cheaper. Sometimes, for instance, staying at one of the hotels at Disney World, right on the tram, just makes sense.

, If you’ve decided to stay at a chain hotel, the best way to start is to a) know that booking in advance will save you money, b) explore within your 2-week time frame and c) begin your comparison searching on either TripAdvisor.com or Hotel.com. TripAdvisor doesn’t sell rooms or offer deals, but instead finds rooms based upon criteria you select, such as your budget, parking preferences, if there are free breakfasts and Wi-Fi, if you want to be downtown, etc. It also provides reviews of guests’ experiences. Hotels.com, on the other hand, books rooms by linking with chains and travel sites.


Remember: As with all online reviews, there will be fakes so watch out for the extreme reviews.
Hotels.com has a Welcome Rewards program where you get a free night for every 10 nights you book., Consider staying in a suburb or the town next door, where the room rates can be considerably less. Also think about staying in a business district. Since businessmen go home on the weekends, hotels there often have discounted rates on nice rooms and suites on Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights. Another way to trim expenses is by switching hotels mid stay. If the hotel you’re staying in is more expensive on Saturday and Sunday nights than the three nights you’d be there before or after, book the other three nights at a different hotel.Look at the rates for suites and compare them against getting separate rooms if you're traveling with your family. A 2-bedroom suite may be cheaper and still afford you privacy., When you’re choosing a room, look closely at the amenities. If you have a pet with you, do they allow pets? If so, do they charge extra? Do they have free Wi-Fi for your computer? Is there a refrigerator and microwave, which can save you a lot of money in eating out if you buy groceries. Is there a pool? If so, is it indoor or outdoor and will that align with the timing of your vacation? If you have kids, the pool can be a free feature of the vacation.


Some of the “budget hotels,” like the Hampton Inns, have upgraded and added things like oversized tubs, sitting areas, kitchenettes and separate bedrooms., Many chain hotels have reward programs that help you get free nights and room upgrades. Many also have best-rate guarantees, meaning if you find a better rate for the same hotel and type of room at a better price from a third-party site, they’ll beat the rate or lower yours. Ask about family deals, such as discounted meals for children or room upgrades.


Start collecting coupons and special deal offers in tourist and travel brochures, magazines and booklets, on the backs of supermarket receipts, on hotel and local tourist board websites, etc., You may get it, you may not. But plenty have, so it could be worth a try. Go to BetterBidding.com, which will show you what other people paid for comparable rooms through sites like Priceline.com and Hotwire.com. Then enter a similar or lower bid and see if it’s accepted."

Make a holiday budget.,
Pare down your list if things are escalating out of control.,
Have a potluck get-together during the holidays in lieu of gifts.,
Start your holiday shopping early.,
Take advantage of price breaks by doing part of your holiday shopping on line, but always take the cost of shipping into consideration.,
Use cash or a debit cards as much as possible, and reduce your holiday spending by leaving your tempting credit cards at home.

,
Consider gift cards, especially for family and friends who don't live nearby.,
Be extra careful if you apply for store credit cards.,
Look for after-holiday sales.,
Gift creative, thoughtful gifts of your time.",How to Reduce Your Holiday Spending," Write a list that includes everybody you plan to buy for, then decide how much you can reasonably spend on each person. Include the cost of small gifts such as stocking stuffers or gifts for your hairdresser or your child's teacher, as small gifts can nickel and dime your budget through the roof.;
, Send a card or make a batch of cookies instead, or talk to your family members and suggest a ""kids only"" holiday. Have a gift exchange with a reasonable limit, as buying one gift is cheaper and easier than buying several. Chances are, your family members are in the same boat and will appreciate the opportunity to cut back.

, Provide a main dish and ask your guests to bring the extras. Consider throwing a holiday white elephant party, which are loads of fun but don't have to cost a single penny.

, Waiting until the last minute is stressful and doesn't allow time for shopping the sales or comparison shopping. Harried shoppers tend to buy nearly anything just to get the job done.

, Sometimes, a good deal may not be as good as it seems after shipping is factored in. Watch for businesses who offer free shipping during the holidays.

,, Gift cards for books, sporting goods, a movie or a favorite restaurant are nearly always appreciated, and you save gas, time and shipping costs, which mount up quickly.

, While a 10 or 20 percent discount on today's purchase might sound good, store cards charge high interest that will be very painful if you can't pay the balance immediately. If you get carried away and can't pay the balance on the high-interest store credit card, transfer the balance to one of your credit cards.

, Stock up on cards and decorations for next year. Don't forget to include after holiday expenses in your holiday budget. You may even score some inexpensive gifts for next year, or for gift giving throughout the year.

, Present your loved ones with a coupon for a lawn mowing, dog walking, babysitting, a car wash or a back rub. Gifts of your time are especially appreciated by your elderly friends and family.

Buy groceries and make food.,
Eat brunch.,
Go for a large lunch.,
Dine away from other tourists.,
Collect restaurant discounts.",How to Save Money on Vacation5," Eating out every meal can eat up half of your vacation budget if you don’t watch it.If you have a refrigerator or a cooler that you can keep stocked with ice (a microwave is a plus), get easy-to-fix foods like cereal, oatmeal, stuff for sandwiches, fruits and cold veggies, etc. Pick up drinks, too. You can eat before you leave for the day, and you can pack lunch, snacks and cold drinks to go.


Bring along a blanket and Frisbee for a picnic or BBQ in a park, making that a cheap part of your vacation experience.Save the leftovers from meals out and reheat them in the microwave for a late-night snack or for lunch the next day.
Also, if you’re a drinker, buy a bottle of wine, for instance. Have a glass in your room before you head downstairs to dinner instead of buying each glass at $9.50 in the restaurant. Take advantage of happy hours as well.

, If your hotel’s breakfast is quite expensive, if it doesn’t have a free continental breakfast, or if it’s not to your liking, combine breakfast and lunch to have a nice brunch. Now you’re only paying for two meals that day instead of three.If you did that every day over the course of a 7-day vacation, estimating you saved a conservative $12 per day, you would have saved $84 for one person. For a family of 5, that’s $420, or a plane ticket.

, Alternatively, you could make lunch, rather than dinner, your main meal of the day. Not only will you spend less on expensive alcoholic beverages but you’ll also spend less on the food. The price of lunch entrees is about 30% less than the same dinner entrees in most cities. If you find yourself wanting a snack in the late eve, pull out your lunch leftovers or grab something from your trip to the grocery store. Also, eating a nice breakfast and lunch and a light dinner is healthier., The cost of food and beverages in and around tourist areas is always inflated. Typically you only have to walk a couple of blocks to find food that is cheaper, often more fresh and that gives you a better idea of what the city or town and its people are really like. Here’s where you find authentic food and avoid the crowds in the process. It’s a win-win trek off the tourist path., Go to sites like Mamapedia.com, Groupon.com and Livingsocial.com to get discounts for restaurants, plus attractions. Apps like Foursquare and Scoutmob help you find one-time discounts also. Happy Hour Finder lists happy hours in the area. You can save up to 90% on meals when you buy Restaurant.com gift certificates online, print them and then eat using them."

Do your research.,
Talk to the concierge and locals.,
Rent a car.,
Get cheap or free transportation.,
Do the free stuff.,
Cut down on shopping expenses.",How to Save Money on Vacation6," By researching in advance, you'll save yourself a lot of time and frustration once you arrive. You’ll also be saving yourself a lot of money. Figure out what the area offers culturally and naturally. Look at the area or city’s tourism and cultural boards’ and governmental websites, read articles online, determine the best way to get around in the area and figure out what’s free or discounted and when.Find out if you have member perks on any cards or memberships, such as free access to museums across the country.
Collect coupons to attractions, theme parks and events.
Make sure you’re on Groupon.com, LivingSocial.com and Mamapedia.com for more deals.

, As soon as you’re unpacked, talk with the concierge about the best restaurants to eat at on a budget and for recommendations about parking and entertainment. You’ll find out a bunch this way, including a lot you didn’t think to ask. The same goes with talking to locals. They’ll know all the best spots, and talking with them is a chance to experience the place you’re visiting.

, Like with hotels and planes, you’ll save money if you make your reservation early. If you plan on driving a lot, get the unlimited mileage plan. Try to rent a car from a rental agency that’s not in the airport terminal. Those at airports typically charge higher rates. Book the smallest car you need and upgrade if you want once you get to the rental agency. Before getting the insurance coverage through them, check to see if your car insurance policy or even a credit card covers the car in case of an accident.


Make sure you compare daily and weekly rates. Sometimes renting it for a full week, even if you only need it 5 days, will be cheaper.
Packing your own GPS can also save you money. You won't have to rent one if the car doesn’t come equipped with one, as many won’t.
Look for coupons in travel magazines, the travel section in your newspaper, on rental car websites, etc.
Also call and ask them about special rates and discounts they offer or will be offering in the future., The cheapest form of transportation on your vacation will be walking. It's also an excellent opportunity to talk with the locals and to see the city and take photos. Most cities also have some form of rapid transit system like the subway or metro. You can get maps at the stations, or print them from the city’s transit website before you leave. Print the bus routes, too, if you plan to use the bus, which you may need to do to connect from one rapid transit line to another.


Public transportation is an excellent way to travel once at your destination. It’s easy and inexpensive. You'll save a lot of money in cab fares (and tips) and in renting a car. Most cities offer discounts for students and seniors, too.
It's also safe, contrary to what you may have heard.

, Take free walking tours through parks, arboretums, museums, homes, art exhibits and so forth. Go to a street fair or concert. See free movie screenings in parks or cafes. Swim in the ocean, at the lake or in the river. Take a bike ride through the forest. Get lost wandering the streets of a new city. There’s even a website called Couchsurfing.com that will connect you with locals who will show visitors around the area for free, just for the fun of it!, There are a couple of ways to do this, one being easy and the other hard. We’ll start with the hard way. Don’t take your debit card with you when you go shopping. Instead, buy a pre-paid credit card or travel card that has only the money on it that was factored into the budget for shopping. Or, because the other option includes sometimes needing cash, only take the cash that you can spend. Just like with eating off the tourist path, shop off it, too. Hit the back streets, the local shops, the street markets.


And remember that in many countries, you’re supposed to bargain for the price, which is one reason you need cash. Have fun haggling!

Find out what your bank charges for foreign transactions.,
Know the currency exchange rate.,
Use your credit or debit card as much as possible.,
Plan your budget while traveling.,
Take out cash only as you need it, and try to plan your expenditures toward the end of your stay in any country.,
Avoid the exchange companies and Cambio booths that you will see in most train stations and airports.,
Haggle.,
Compare rates.,
Know the ""real"" rate.",How to Get the Best Exchange Rate when Traveling in a Foreign Country," Most of the time, you'll get the best possible exchange rate when you use your credit or debit card, either to make purchases or to withdraw cash from an ATM. By doing so, you get the same exchange rates that the banks offer to each other, with no middleman adding extra fees for the exchange. Some banks and credit card companies, however, will charge you a fee of as much as 3 percent on foreign transactions, so you need to do some research before you leave home. Call your bank and ask them what they charge. If they charge a fee, call around and ask other banks what they're charging. You may be able to find a better deal, but you'll need to plan well ahead.;
, Before you set off for your trip, find out what the current exchange rate is. You can easily find this in many newspapers or online. Knowing the exchange rate is your most powerful defense against getting a bad deal, so find it out before you go, and periodically check on it while you're traveling. When you are abroad, don't just trust the signs at street kiosks. Verify the exchange rate online if at all possible.

, As mentioned, you're likely to get the best rate this way. Use your card for purchases as much as possible to avoid ATM fees. When you do use an ATM, be sure to check how much it will charge you--some foreign ATMs charge $5 or more. If the fee is more than a couple dollars, try to find another ATM.

, You don't want to carry a ton of cash with you (see step 5), but you also should try to have enough cash so that you don't get stuck having to make a currency exchange at high rates. You're more likely to get a good rate in large cities than in small towns--in some countries, you won't even be able to exchange money outside the city.

, This will help you to minimize the risk of robbery or pickpockets and avoid getting stuck with excess cash when you leave.

, They are convenient, and sometimes (especially in an emergency after banking hours) indispensable, but they frequently charge very high prices in return for the convenience. If you need to get cash, and you can't find an ATM, your best bet is to go to a large bank, post office or American Express office.

, While you won't be able to negotiate the rate at a bank, if you do get stuck changing money at a small vendor you may be able to haggle to get a better rate. It's critical to know the exchange rate before you do this, and sometimes it won't work, but it's worth a try, especially if there are many vendors in a small area.

, It's especially important to shop around if you're using the exchange kiosks, but the rate you get can vary even from bank to bank. Try at least two or three different places before you settle on one.

, Sometimes the low rate posted will be the ""sell"" rate--you'll be charged the ""buy"" rate--or will only be applicable on very large or very small transactions. There may also be flat fees added to each transaction or extra commissions based on the amount of the exchange. You've got to watch out for these tricks and find out in advance the net amount you will receive from an exchange.

Use available buses.,
Consider the available Los Angeles Metro rail system.,
Set up a carpooling system.,
Live near your work.,
Keep your car costs down.",How to Get Around Los Angeles on the Cheap," The L.A./Orange County bus system is an intricate network of lines that runs all over the city and surrounding areas. It's usually possible to find a bus that will take you to nearly any Los Angeles neighborhood. Despite the time required to ride, bus travel can save Los Angeles residents or visitors a lot of money.


Make use of available metro bus discounts. The Los Angeles Metro bus system offers discounts to seniors and others, as well as a ""metro to muni transfer"" ticket and a Metro Day pass for under $10.

Evaluate the different possible destinations for the Los Angeles Metro rail system. For example, the Metrorail line will take you up through Hollywood and out to various parts of the San Fernando Valley. In the southern part of the city, a lateral line runs all the way from Redondo Beach in the west to Norwalk in the east.

, Another strategy for Los Angeles, where the sprawling metropolitan area makes it hard to get around, is simply to live in the communities where you usually go for work or errands. Living within your suburb or community is a popular way to cut down your overall costs and free yourself up for a less hectic daily lifestyle.


Research a local L.A. community. Those who look into practical living in auxiliary Los Angeles areas are often surprised by how well some of these neighborhoods and municipalities are set up. Many of the smaller Los Angeles communities are perfect for this kind of local strategy, and those who live in picturesque spots like Pasadena or other canyon areas often end making their rounds in their own immediate areas, rather than trekking all over the city regularly.

, If you do need a personal car for all the travel that you do around Los Angeles, buy a safe and reliable but inexpensive older model. This helps to keep insurance costs down. Also look for a fuel-efficient vehicle to save you money at the pump.

Meet potential companions in a public place for the first time.,
Do not exchange your home address with a travel companion.,
Ask to see an I.D.,
Use your common sense.",How to Find People to Travel with and Share Transport Costs3," You don't want to agree to travel with someone without meeting them first. For your safety, meet in a public place first. See if you click with the person and feel comfortable with them. Meet them a few more times before planning an official trip.Send someone an email or message saying something like, ""Hey, can we meet in person to talk before committing to plans? Let's try to get to another a bit before planning a trip together.""
Ask questions. Ask things like, ""Have you ever travelled with someone you met online before?"" and ""What kind of things do you hope to do on this trip?""

, In general, it's a bad idea to exchange your home address with a travel companion right away. If a companion asks you for your home address for any reason, do not give it out unless you've met in person.Once you've taken a trip with someone, and the two of you know each other, it's perfect acceptable to exchange addresses so you can write each other letters and send each other mail.

, Make sure your companion is who they say they are. Everyone traveling together should share things like driver's licenses and passports. Do not be shy about asking your potential companion for identification. They will probably want to see your I.D. as well., The adage ""go with your gut"" comes in handy here. If you don't feel comfortable with someone, you should not travel with them. If someone sends you any red flags, such as being withholding about personal information, look for another travel companion.If someone seems deceptive about their personal life, or tells conflicting stories about things like their work, living situation, and so on, this person may not be a great travel companion.
A good travel companion should not have a lot to hide, and should understand your need for some transparency.

Use your cellphone to call for help.,
Bang on the doors for help.",How to Stay Safe in a Stranded Elevator1," Most elevators are secure when they are stuck or stranded. They will not go into a state of free fall and are secure even when stopped. The elevator is also not airtight so you will have more than enough oxygen to stay in the elevator safely. Remember all of this when you are in the elevator so you do not panic.You should also not worry about being trapped in the dark in the elevator, as most elevators will still have working lights even when stopped. There is also likely emergency lighting that will come on in the elevator if the power goes out.
If for some reason there is smoke in the elevator, you may try to pry open the door to let in fresh air or to try to escape. But this can lead to injury, so unless the smoke is overwhelming and severe, you should avoid tampering with the elevator doors in any way.;

Protect yourself against retaliation.",How to Report Safety Violations to OSHA," When filling an OSHA complaint you are legally protected from retaliation and should have the option to remain anonymous. Sometimes, however, those rights are violated. There are some types of representatives who can approach OSHA on your behalf. Discuss the situation with one if they are at your disposal.


A union representative or similar representative of an authorized employee bargaining unit can legally represent you.
You can also approach an attorney. Lawyers are legally allowed to act on your behalf in OSHA complaints.
Other potential representatives include clergy members, social workers, family members, government officials, and nonprofit groups.;
, You should file a complaint whenever you know that an unsafe workplace exists. However, it helps if you can cite a specific regulation that your employer is violating. A comprehensive list of regulation is available here.

, You need to provide enough information for OSHA to take some form of action. Most essentially, you will need to describe the type of hazard, how many people are exposed to it, and where it can be found.


If you can, include photos of the hazard, or make a drawing. If it is available, include documented evidence from your employer that the hazard exists. Provide as much detail as possible.
Be very specific about where the hazard is. If it is in a large factory, draw a map to illustrate its location or provide very precise directions. Explain when the hazard occurs and how long it has been going on.
Indicate if you know that your employer is aware of the situation. He will be subject to additional fines if he is. Provide any possible evidence that he or any government officials know about the hazard., If you file a written and signed statement, OSHA is obligated to investigate the situation. If you make a phone call, or do not sign your name, OSHA is not obligated to investigate. Your anonymity will be better preserved if you make a phone call, however, it should be safe even if you make a signed statement.


Even when you do sign a statement, you can indicate that you want your name hidden from your employer. Your identity should not be revealed., You can file your complaint online here. The form is short and easy to submit. It does not provide space for additional documentation but that can be provided in follow up conversations with OSHA.

, A standard form can be downloaded online and printed out. After completing it, you should send it to the local OSHA office, which can also be found online.


A Spanish language form is also available.

, Calling is the quickest way to reach OSHA and so OSHA encourages you to follow this course when you believe that the situation is an urgent threat to someone’s wellbeing. You can find a number for the closest regional office online or call 1-800-321-OSHA.

, Certain hazards will result in an immediate investigation. In other cases, OSHA will contact your employer about the complaint. If the employer denies the charge or claims that the hazard is fixed OSHA should contact you and allow you to dispute this charge. OSHA will use its discretion as to whether to further investigate the situation., If OSHA decides not to investigate, you can write a signed complaint to the regional office. If the hazard is a violation of OSHA regulations, the agency should investigate. , You should be able to keep your identity secret when filing an OSHA complaint. However, if your employer does find out that you are responsible and you believe they have retaliated against you, there is legal recourse. You must notify OSHA within 30 days of the alleged act of retaliation, but are permitted to make your statement in any language.


To file an online complaint visit OSHA’s Whistleblower Complaint Form.
You can also download a Notice of Whistleblower Complaint Form and mail it or fax it to the local OSHA regional office. If you cannot download the form, you can already write a letter to the regional office detailing the incident in question.
To file a complaint via telephone, call the nearest OSHA regional office.

Monitor tourism websites.",How to Find Last Minute Travel Deals," These websites collect data on various prices and bargains offered by airports, car rental services, and hotels. Many of these websites also have special sections dedicated to providing last minute deals.;
, You are more likely to find travel deals during uncommon travel seasons. This is especially true for last minute deals, since fewer travelers generally means more open seats on planes and empty rooms in hotels. The more vacancies an airline or hotel has, the more desperate they will be to slash prices in order to fill them at the last minute.


Avoid traveling in the summer and around the holidays if you want to score better deals. Instead, plan on traveling during the winter, fall, and spring.

, The biggest bargains are usually for flights on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, especially in the early mornings and late nights. These flights are significantly less popular than weekend flights, so airports are more likely to price them lower.

, If you plan on traveling at the last minute, you need to be as flexible as possible about when you leave. Instead of setting an exact date for your departure, set a time-frame. That way, you have more travel deals available to you, and you might discover a better bargain a day or two after your initially proposed departure date.


For instance, instead of saying that you must leave on the first of the month, plan on leaving anytime during the first week of the month.

, If you simply want to get away but do not need to go anywhere in particular, keep your options open. Check with your local airport for last minute sale-price tickets, or visit a website that specializes in mapping out these discount flights.

, Some carriers work by leasing airplanes for specific flights that they predict will fill up. These flights usually occur during peak times and travel to popular destinations. If the company does not sell enough tickets to make a profit, however, they must cancel the flight. In an effort to prevent this, charter flights will significantly drop ticket prices immediately before a flight if they still need to sell a large number of tickets.

, Low-cost carriers usually offer the lowest prices during off seasons, but low-cost carriers that offer nonstop flights may actually have higher prices than legacy carriers during the holidays. During busy seasons, the demand for nonstop flights skyrockets, and low-cost carriers that offer nonstop flights can boost their prices and still attract plenty of customers.


Also note that low-cost carriers can only afford to drop their last minute prices so much. Legacy carriers typically have more flexibility, and may have better last minute bargains. Compare low-cost and legacy carriers no matter what time of year you travel.

, Look for travel search websites and airlines that allow you to sign up for an e-mail newsletter. These companies will often send subscribers information on the best last minute deals. Since you only have a limited time to act, receiving information about those deals in your e-mail in-box will speed up the process and increase your chances of benefiting from the deal.

, Many travel websites offer package deals that bundle your flight and hotel costs together. More often than not, a package deal saves you more money than booking a flight and hotel separately. This may not always be the case, however, especially if you can find a great last minute deal on a non-bundled flight, so you should always look into both options.

, Some travel websites have auction features that allow you to bid on travel expenses, including airfare, rental cars, and hotels. The rules governing these auctions vary from website to website, however, and you may not be able to specify all the details of your purchase, such as flight time or car model.

, A few travel websites also offer ""secret sales,"" such as secret hotels. You can purchase unpublished discounts through these sales, but you will not know who you are booking with until after you check out. A reputable travel website will guarantee that the hotels you book with are of a certain quality, but you should search for this guarantee prior to going through with your purchase.

, Hotels located in the thick of things generally cost more than those located away from tourism spots. These out-of-the-way hotels are also more likely to have more last minute vacancies.

, Major cities and tourist destinations occasionally attempt to draw visitors by advertising hotel, dining, and entertainment deals. You may have to find your own way there, but you can get a good deal on where to stay and what to do, even without planning ahead.

Press the ""up"" or ""down"" button.,
Allow any people to leave before entering.,
Make certain the elevator is going in your direction.,
Decide if the elevator has enough space.,
Enter and find an empty spot in the elevator.,
Select your floor.,
Secure all your belongings.,
Be courteous when traveling with children or pets.,
Control noise levels.,
Calm your nerves and anxieties.,
Pay attention to the stops.,
Excuse yourself as you walk through the elevator.,
Make sure the door opens on your floor.,
Ask someone to hold the door for you.,
Exit quickly.",How to Ride an Elevator," When you arrive to the elevator, decide which way you are going and be ready to wait. An elevator's arrival time can be affected by many factors such as elevators' popularity, the amount of floors, rush hours, and available elevators due to unforeseen maintenance or closures.;
, This etiquette is practiced in a lot of public situations such as subways or buses, and elevators are no different. Also, keep in mind elevators serve individuals who suffer handicaps or people handling large loads of cargo or furniture. Take a step aside and allow passengers enough space to make their way out of the elevator.

, Most elevators have signals to show if they are going down or up. In the case where you cannot find any signal, ask the passengers on the elevator which way they are headed.


Avoiding going in the wrong the direction, especially if the building has a lot of floors.

, When the elevator stops at your floor, it might not mean people will exit. If the doors open and passengers do not get out, assess what space remains. If you cannot see enough room for you, let the doors close and wait for another elevator.

, Elevators vary in size and available space. Locate a section where you will feel both comfort for the ride and convenience for your exit. The back of the elevator is the ideal location two-fold: it leaves room for other passengers to enter or exit, and it secures a good spot for longer rides.

, Elevators have buttons on either sides of the door. The majority of the floor buttons are numbered; basement, garage, street level, lobby, etc. may be represented by letters.


If someone is standing closer to the buttons than you, they might offer to select for you. If they do not, kindly ask them to select the floor., If you are riding with groceries, book bags, or any other items, be sure to hold on to them properly. If the elevator ride is empty, you may leave your items on the floor, especially for longer rides. However, holding on to your items ensures more space for potential passengers.

, Elevator rides can be crowded, and ensuring the safety and comfort of others should be on your mind. If you travel with a pet, be sure to secure it with a leash or carry it; not all people are comfortable with pets roaming freely. Also, be sure to have your children close to you. It is also good practice to have them be mindful of others' spaces.

, The most proper elevator etiquette would be to keep noise levels from silence to minimal. Conversations either in person or over the phone should cease when possible. Use headphones for listening to music instead of playing it out loud. If you are traveling with an infant, kindly refrain from riding while the child is crying.

, Riding an elevator may be difficult for some people with worries such as germs or confined spaces. If you know riding an elevator is a difficult but unavoidable task, prepare yourself for the ride by multiple means.


Choose portable, hand-held activities. Read a book, check your email, send text messages, check social media, create to do lists, or any small task that requires enough focus to ease your mind.Listen to soothing music. A nice pair of head phones and delicate tunes can ease your thoughts for a better ride.
Ride elevators more often. Practice makes perfect, and conquering a fear is no different. Taking more elevator rides will help you get use to the activity.
Think of a calm setting. Train yourself to create soothing settings that relax you, and enter that mental picture when you ride the elevator., As you ride, be aware of stops for two reasons. First, passengers need to enter and exit; you might have to give people space to help them slip in or out. Also, each stop brings you closer to your floor, and you may be able to move towards the door. However, in the event that you are not close to an exit, being ready will help you get to your floor without any issues., People on elevators have many distractions in their heads and often give you their backs as they face the elevator door. Saying excuse me or pardon me will signal your intentions of exiting, and they will move to help you leave.

, When the elevator stops at your exit, the doors should open either automatically or manually. Most elevators have a button to open the doors while some older models use latches. In the case when the door won't open, search for an intercom or alarm button. If the elevator is jammed, qualified assistants will be notified.

, Walking around people in a crowded elevator might not give you enough time to reach the doors before closing. Ask someone close enough to make sure the door will remain open for you.

, Using an elevator should be a convenience and a time saver. Missing your floor will only delay you. Also, be mindful that other passengers may need to exit as well. Being swift about your exit helps everyone.

Be alert to covert surveillance.,
Resist and report elicitation.,
Notice stockpiling.",How to Recognize Signs of Terrorist Activities1," Terrorists gather information about a potential target when planning an attack. Acts such as monitoring or recording a security apparatus should raise a red flag. If you notice someone who is not involved with a building using the camera on their phone, a camera, or binoculars, be alert. If you see that someone has been drawing diagrams, blueprints or detailed maps, be suspicious.If someone is trying to hide what they are doing, be especially suspicious. While there are many reasons a person might be taking a picture, drawing a floor plan, or using binoculars, there are few good reasons for a person to attempt to hide such activities. Unauthorised or staff not related to maintenance work trying to gain access to such plans and diagrams
Notice when someone is taking pictures of mundane objects, such as entrances, exits, or security cameras.
Report security tests. If you notice someone leaving a bag, then coming back to check on it (or surveying it from a distance), they might be running a check on the security operations of a place.;
, Elicitation is the use of ordinary communications methods in order to gain sensitive information. If you have any information about military operations, capabilities, security procedures, or vulnerabilities, report anyone who tries to engage you in conversation on any of those points. If you find yourself speaking of anything sensitive, beware of eavesdroppers.Any questions about security should be reported. Information about campus safety, mall guards, or transport police could all be exploited.

, If you notice someone you know, or someone who comes into a store you frequent, is purchasing (or stealing) explosives, weapons, ammunition, or bomb-making materials, you may be witnessing a potential terrorist. Bomb-making supplies can be as quotidian as fertilizer or beauty supplies.Purchasing small amounts of anything not immediately lethal is not in itself a sign of stockpiling. Stockpiling happens when large quantities are accrued.
Notice unusual forms of payment. If someone is buying supplies with a prepaid card that holds a large amount of money, they may have gotten that card from a larger terrorist organization.
Recognize a stockpile. If you come across a store of goods such as weapons, chemicals or fertilizer hidden in an unusual place, such as a field or an abandoned building, report it.

Keep an eye out for strangers who seem nervous and out of place.,
Recognize impersonators.,
Recognize the attire and posture of a suicide bomber.,
Notice chemical odor or burns.",How to Recognize Signs of Terrorist Activities2," In an ordinary situation, someone who is sweating, looking around anxiously, or otherwise acting panicked may have violent intent. Be especially suspicious of anyone who seems out of place, is wearing a uniform that does not match or otherwise isn't quite right, or who doesn't seem to know anyone in a social space.Be suspicious of anyone attempting to purchase military or police uniforms, decals, flight manuals, passes or badges, as these may be used to access secure locations.

, Aside from people who seem out of place, look out for people soliciting donations for charities you don't recognize, workers in incomplete uniforms or uniforms that don't fit, or anyone presenting false or incomplete documents. Report it if someone tries to access a building, perhaps where you work, if they cannot prove they are authorized to enter., An imminent suicide bomber might exhibit signs the US government refers to as ALERT.A – Alone and nervous. Report someone who is alone and seems nervous, sweating, eyes darting around, muttering.
L – Loose and bulky clothing not compatible with weather conditions. If you see someone strangely overdressed, or who looks like they have something hidden under their clothes, report them.
E – Exposed wires. Wires sticking out of clothing could indicate a bomb.
R – Rigid mid-section. Wearing an explosives belt or harness makes some terrorists sit very upright. If you see someone with unnatural posture who exhibits other signs of ALERT, alert the authorities.
T – Tightened hands. Someone with tightened hands may be holding a detonation device in place. Report someone in this posture immediately.

, People missing fingers, or who smell like chemicals, may be experimenting with explosives. Notice if someone is making frequent trips to remote places and returning with chemical burns or chemical odor.Three common chemical odor smells are a sweet burning smell, an acrid smell (like bleach), or a motor-oil smell."
"
Notice people who feel personally damaged by unrelated political developments.,
Recognize when a lone wolf is broadcasting their intent.,
Listen for people who claim affinity with extremist groups.,
Don't look away from a stockpile of weapons.,
Profile.",How to Recognize Signs of Terrorist Activities3," If you hear a friend, family member, or acquaintance complain that they have been personally wronged by political events that are remote, listen carefully. 80 percent of future lone wolves are known to take politics personally, and claim that they have been wronged enough that violence would be justified.An example of an irrational claim would be: ""Because we have a black president, a white man can't get a job in this country.""
This is not to be confused with someone who has been directly affected by a law and is rationally disappointed. For instance, a small business owner who has experienced a tax increase might say ""I'm angry that our senator did not fight harder to protect my ability to compete with the big box stores."" So long as this complaint is not followed by a threat, there is no sign of terrorist intent in this statement.

, Report any messages on social media, any personal messages, and anything that is said to you that suggests an individual is contemplating violence. This can include suicide threats as well as threats against others. Watch out for anyone espousing the belief that violence is rational or necessary.It is extremely common for a lone wolf to make public announcements when an attack is imminent.
Combinations of political and personal complaints that are followed by veiled threats should be reported immediately.
An example would be: ""My girlfriend left me because women these days are too free. They think they can just get an abortion or a divorce whenever they want! I think somebody needs to send a strong message and really put them all back in their place.""

, Many lone wolves speak admiringly of white supremacist groups, anti-abortion groups, foreign terrorist groups, or southern segregationist groups., If you know someone in your community has an illegal store of weaponry, report them. If someone you know has assault rifles and other weapons built to kill large groups of people, even if they came by all those weapons legally, keep an eye on them or file a report.Any signs of someone building or assembling explosives should be reported.

, Most lone wolf terrorists are single, unemployed white males with a criminal record. Signs of mental illness are also common, as is isolation from society. Not every lone wolf fits this profile: go on behavior before you go on these traits. However, if you do choose to report a suspicious individual for stockpiling weapons or broadcasting intent, make sure to mention if they fit the profile of a lone wolf terrorist."

Avoid storing valuables in your car.,
Pay attention to your surroundings as you return to your vehicle.,
Have your keys ready as you approach your vehicle.",How to Protect Yourself and Your Belongings in Hotels and Cars1," Be aware of your surroundings, and park in a well-lit, well-traveled area whenever possible.;
,


Familiarize yourself with your vehicle's safety features. When you unlock the car, some vehicles with remote-unlock systems will flash the lights a specific number of times to indicate someone tampered with the vehicle while you were away.

, If you have no choice in the matter, leave the valuables out of sight, either in the trunk, tucked under a seat or at least completely covered by something inconspicuous.


Tuck the items away before you get to your destination. Otherwise, would-be robbers could watch and take note of where you put your valuables.

,


Glance beneath the vehicle and in the backseat before you get in.
Be aware of potential hiding places for troublemakers near your vehicle, such as thick undergrowth or a van with a sliding door facing toward you.
Be alert to any suspicious behavior from others nearby. This includes following you--closely or at a distance--and paying an unusual amount of attention to you. Your intuition often puts together subconscious clues before your mind does, so if you get a gut feeling that something isn't right, act on it.

, This helps you get in faster in case of emergency, and sharp, pointy keys make good self-defense weapons in a pinch.


Your life is worth more than your car or your valuables, so if somebody threatens your welfare to steal your belongings or your car, let them have it.
If somebody attacks you with intent to harm you or abduct you, fight back. Kick, scream, bite and make a scene to attract others' attention. If they get you in the car, they could take you away from any possible help.
If you have a remote-unlock key fob for your car, it likely has a panic button that sets off the car's lights and horn to attract attention. Familiarize yourself with the panic button's operation so you can use it in case of emergency.

Always store valuables in a front pocket or a secret pocket.,
Avoid walking through large crowds.,
Touching or fiddling with the pocket where you carry your belongings tells the pickpocket where you carry your valuables.,
Refrain from rummaging through your wallet or counting money in public.,
Never hand money to panhandlers, unless you have loose change in your pocket.,
Shorten the strap on any purse or bag you carry.,
Pick up credit cards and other valuables as soon as the clerk returns them.,
Whenever you are going out to a public place, only take what you need.,
Use a money belt or an inside coat pocket.,
Consider making a mugger's wallet if you know you will go somewhere dangerous.,
Blend in.,
Leave nothing unattended.,
Wear backpacks on your front if you must wear one in a crowd.",How to Prevent Being Pickpocketed," Make sure it is not sticking out of your pocket(s) either. Keep nothing valuable in your back pocket, as this is a vulnerable place for pickpockets.;
, Pickpockets can easily blend in and snatch wallets without anyone noticing.

, This is a regrettable error and drops a huge hint of where you keep your things, not only to the pickpocket but also to the public.

, While you are looking through your wallet, it's easy for someone to snatch it out of your hands and make off with it. If you must use your wallet in any way, shape, or form, do so away from large crowds and in a safe place.


Count your money at home or in a hotel room. Never lay out money and credit cards on a table/phone booth/etc. in a public place, as somebody can snatch it. Counting money publicly also advertises its presence and its location.

, Taking your wallet out in front of a panhandler risks someone snatching it from you while you are looking through it.

, Don't dangle the purse loose below your waist. The strap should be short enough that you can keep the purse and its openings under your elbow. A purse strap of metal chain is very secure, because it cannot be easily cut. Also, try to find a purse that has the zipper within your eyesight - not one that's behind you. Having a purse with a zipper in the back will make it easier for someone behind you to unzip your purse and make off with its contents.


Carry your purse across your chest. If the strap is long enough, put it over your head so the strap runs diagonally across your chest, with the purse itself under your arm.
Carry no valuable items in outer purse pockets. Use any exposed pockets for your Kleenex, your makeup, or your map. Store your wallet and phone in a place where they will be harder to reach.
Close zippers and clasps on purses and backpacks.

, When you're done with the card, put it in your wallet right away. When eating out, never give the credit card to the waiter. Take the time to go with him/her, as waiters sometimes make copies of the credit cards.

, Leave behind in the hotel safe some money and any credit card(s), ID, etc. that you don't need to take. That way, if you do get pick pocketed, you don't lose everything.

, Concealment may not always protect you from muggers and sophisticated thieves, but it will make it much less convenient for the casual thief. This sort of defense is most effective if it is completely invisible, so avoid accessing such hiding places in public.

, A mugger's wallet is not your real wallet - it is merely a false copy to trick the mugger into thinking that it is your real wallet. Stuff a few receipts and expired credit cards or coupons into your mugger's wallet and keep your real wallet in a secret pocket. Put your mugger's wallet anywhere you like, but do not put it in a concealed pocket! By making this wallet, your real wallet will be safer.


If you're afraid the mugger will not fall for your fake wallet, put a few one dollar bills into your mugger's wallet.

, If you're tall and blonde, there may not be much you can do to blend in in Japan, but do what you can to avoid looking like a tourist. Dyeing your hair or wearing a cap to appear subtle will help. Wearing sunglasses will help as well. Don't wear brightly colored shirts or anything that makes you stand out of the crowd.

, Do not hang a bag or purse over the back of a chair (such as in a restaurant or Internet cafe), and certainly do not leave it behind while you walk off. If you have to go somewhere (ex: bathroom), bring it with you no matter what, or risk it being stolen!

, It's best not to have anything important in your backpack, at all.

, Include pain relief medications such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen for headaches, toothaches, muscle soreness, fever and any other minor conditions that may develop while you are traveling.

, Also bring medications and treatment options for allergies and sinus problems. Include anti-allergy medication, saline nasal spray, eye drops, decongestants, antihistamines and throat lozenges.

, Bandage wraps for sprains, disposable cold packs to bring down swelling and heat bandages for muscle aches can all come in handy if a minor muscle injury occurs.

, Include anti-malaria medications, anti-fungal medications, an anti-pollution or respiratory mask and water purification tablets.

, View their lists of recommended prophylactics for trips to specific areas of the world.

, Include items in the kit that are specific for each member. For example, if your teenage daughter suffers from migraine headaches, remember to include migraine medication and anything that may be used to offer migraine relief while traveling, such as disposable moist towelettes and fabric eye covers that block out light.

, The last thing you want to have to deal with while away from home is trying to replace a daily medication that was lost while traveling.

, Also ask for an additional prescription that you can carry with you and have filled while away, if necessary.

, For example, place only one bottle in your medical travel kit, and place the other in an entirely different spot, such as your handbag or laptop carrying case. This ensures that you still have your medications if one item of luggage is lost or misplaced during your trip.

, Don’t forget an extra bottle of contact lens solution as well.

, Visit your physician and ask for an extra prescription if you take birth control pills. Be sure to have the prescription filled before you leave rather than bringing the prescription with you to fill while you are away. It is better to have the pills on hand if you need them than to have to scramble to have a prescription filled, which might not be so easy to do depending on where you will be traveling to.

Store money in different places.,
Only carry as much as you need.,
Hold money where you can see it.,
Avoid drawing attention to your cash.,
Take precautionary steps with plastic.,
Keep loose cash, plastic, and contact info separate from each other.",How to Protect Yourself Against Pickpockets1," Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Divide your money and hide it in multiple places on your person. Ensure that you will still have cash on hand, even if you fall victim to pickpockets, by:


Separating your smallest bills into the wallet that you will use most frequently, since this will be on display the most often.Keeping larger bills in a more secure holder, like a money belt or a hidden pocket in your underwear or first layer of clothing.
Hiding emergency funds in an unlikely container of little apparent value, like a mint tin or a box of feminine hygiene products.Carrying a change purse for coins, to be kept in a separate pocket from your wallet.;
, Plan your day before heading out. Decide how much cash you will need to cover that outing, with perhaps a little extra to cover unforeseen expenses. Whether you’re taking cash from a larger money roll that you keep with you, or withdrawing money from an ATM for each outing, don’t bring more than you expect to spend.Use your plan for the day to decide how to divide and store your money on you, as well as which denominations to carry, if possible.
For example, say you plan on traveling by both bus and taxi throughout the day, with a stop at a crowded market for shopping, and dinner at a fancy restaurant afterward. In that case, consider keeping coins for your bus fare in your change purse, small bills for taxi fare in your wallet, and large bills for shopping and dinner in your money belt.

, Avoid using your back pockets.Keep your wallet, change purse, and any other holders front and center, where you are more likely to spot thieving hands. If the only other option is the side pockets to your pants, use those. Otherwise, favor:The inside pockets of your jacket or coat, preferably with your jacket/coat zipped or buttoned up for double protection.
Pockets that can be closed with zippers, straps, buttons, ties, or, even better, a combination of them for extra security.
“Smart” pockets sewn into the front of specially designed underwear, shirts, or other clothing worn close to the skin.Wallet chains for any money holders that you keep in easily accessible pockets.

, Whenever possible, refrain from counting it where others can see. When you divide and hide your money before heading out, memorize how much you have where. Keep a mental tally from then to minimize the need to recount what you have left as you spend it. Additionally:Fight the urge to touch your money holders in order to double-check that it’s still there. This may seem counter-intuitive, but continually touching your hidden wallet will show prying eyes exactly where to find it.
Use private moments like bathroom breaks to get money ready for your next transaction. For instance, if you just had lunch before heading to a museum with an entrance fee, transfer money from your money belt to your wallet now so you don’t draw attention to your belt later.
Check yourself out in the mirror before going out. Look for any obvious bumps through your clothing that might betray where your money is held. Do what you can to minimize or hide these, like using a thinner billfold or draping a scarf over your clothes to obscure it., Contact your bank and credit card companies before you go traveling. Inform them that you will be using your debit and/or credit cards in new location, just to make sure that your cards aren't denied when you use them yourself. Additionally:Also ask them how to report a stolen or lost card from that location, since their contact information in one area may differ from another.
Sign up for text and/or email alerts for your debit and credit cards. This way you’ll be notified about each purchase made with them, which is a good idea in case they're stolen without you realizing it.

, Remember: don't keep your all eggs in one basket. Hold your credit cards in a more secure holder (like your money belt or a separate wallet held close to you), rather than the wallet that you use the most often to handle small bills. Store your bank and credit card companies' contact information separately from the cards themselves. Ensure that you can report stolen cards as soon as possible.


If you expect to use plastic frequently, consider using store-bought pre-paid debit cards instead of your personal accounts. Keep these in the wallet that will be on display the most often, and your personal cards in a more secure holder. This will help minimize your loss if your wallet is stolen.
With personal cards, choose only one or two to bring with you. This will also reduce your losses in the event of theft. This could apply to each outing or even the whole trip itself.

Pack and wear bags smartly.,
Keep valuables to a minimum.,
Maintain physical contact.",How to Protect Yourself Against Pickpockets2," If you’re carrying any sort of bag on your way out, pack your belongings in a way that will keep the most valuable items the least accessible to prying hands. Wear your bag in a secure fashion so that it is difficult (or, even better, impossible) for pickpockets to snag the whole thing and run off with it. For example:


With purses and messenger-style bags, wear the strap around your neck, and hold the bag in front of you. Pack your most valuable items (like your wallet or phone) at the bottom, with lots of filler on top.With backpacks and other large bags, keep valuables in the main chamber, toward the bottom. Only use side pockets for incidentals. If it has two straps, wear them both. If it has a stomach strap, wear that too.Zip or fasten all pockets and chambers, even if they're empty. Use locks, safety pins, or other materials to create an extra barrier. Avoid coming across as an easy mark., Adopt the same attitude toward tech, jewelry, and other expensive items as you would with cash. Only bring what you intend to use. Even then, ask yourself if you really need to use them. Reduce the risk of attracting unwanted attention and losing precious items by carrying as few valuables as possible.Ideally, these should be few enough for you to keep an easy mental checklist. For example: wallet, money belt, phone, ID.
For technology, consider investing in cheaper models devoted to travel. For instance, load your contacts into a prepaid cellphone instead of bringing your smartphone, or use a basic Chromebook instead of your brand-new MacBook.

, Whenever you remove your bag or take out an expensive item, don’t let it go. Always keep some part of your body touching it directly so you can feel its presence and notice its absence immediately. For instance:


Keep your hand on your phone even if you only set it down momentarily on a table or other surface.Keep the strap of your bag looped around your leg or arm when you take it off.Wear your backpack backwards when taking a nap on a train, bus, or other form of transportation.Use cable locks to secure your belongings if you have to leave them alone for a short while."

Be on alert in crowds.,
Expect decoys.,
Dress simply.,
Act like you know where you’re going.,
Err on the side of caution with your hotel or hostel.",How to Protect Yourself Against Pickpockets3," The difference between a mugger and a pickpocket is that a mugger threatens the use of force to get what they want, thus making themselves known, while a pickpocket aims to pluck what they want without you ever knowing. Since this is much harder to do on an otherwise empty street, expect pickpockets to work in areas with lots of foot-traffic, where you are more likely to be bumped into without thinking much of it. This could include:Crowded tourist sites and public events, like urban squares, open markets, and parades.
ATMs, especially those that are poorly lit and/or directly on the street.Transportation hubs, like train and bus stations.
On board mass transit systems, like buses and subways.

, Some pickpockets may work individually, but many work in pairs or groups. Be on guard whenever you are approached by strangers. They may be perfectly innocent, but play it safe and assume they are trying to distract you. Pay attention to what’s going on around you, and especially behind you.If you haven’t already, bring any purses or bags that you’re carrying in front of you immediately.
Alter your position. Don’t stand in one place. Keep changing which way you face so your back isn’t facing any one direction for too long.
Use any reflective surfaces like mirrors or windows to keep tabs on who’s coming up behind you.

, Model yourself after the plainest folks you see on the street. Pickpockets target people who look like they have stuff worth stealing, so leave your designer clothes, logo-heavy articles, and jewelry at home. Dress simply and blend in with the common citizen.When shopping, avoid using branded bags provided by stores, which will announce to the world where you can afford to shop.Instead, carry your items out in your backpack or messenger bag, or bring a plain tote bag that could just as easily be carrying groceries.

, Pickpockets, especially those working in teams, rely on disorienting their victims with distractions so they won’t notice their pockets being picked. Because of this, they love to prey on people who appear lost since they’re already disoriented, so act like you know exactly where you are, even if it’s a bluff. If you become lost:Casually note a landmark or cross-street to get your bearings. Then keep walking until you find a less crowded place where you can sit down, like a cafe or a park bench.
Stroll on in as if this is exactly where you were headed in the first place. Order a coffee, take a seat, and wait a few minutes before checking your map, as if you’re just relaxing.
If you have a smartphone, use that to find a map, since you could be looking up anything. Otherwise, take your physical map out and study it casually, as if looking up something for later.
Once you know where you’re going, wait a little bit before heading on. Cement the idea that you were just double-checking something, not trying to figure out where you are.

, Leave your extra money, plastic, important paperwork, and any valuables you don’t need behind in your room before going out. At the same time, protect them against theft while you’re gone. Research customer reviews, police blotters, and other online news sources about your hotel and any crime they may have experienced. Depending on what you find, consider the following safety measures:Locking important paperwork, extra money and plastic, and other valuables in a hotel safe.
Repacking all your belongings, locking all compartments and pockets of your luggage, and then securing them with cable cords to fixed objects in the room.
Bringing your own lock for storage lockers rather than trusting those provided by the establishment.

Protect your money.,
Protect yourself.,
Dress like a native.,
Guard against pickpockets.,
Read the news before departing.",How to Protect Yourself While on Vacation," Medical assistance while abroad can be very expensive, difficult to find, of dubious quality — or all of the above. Purchasing travel insurance before you leave your home country can protect you if you should fall ill or have an accident while abroad. Coverage amounts and deductibles will vary, but it is an inexpensive way to prevent financial catastrophe. In addition, make sure that you have all the necessary and suggested vaccinations when traveling.;
, The best way to protect your valuables while traveling is not to take them in the first place. If you insist on traveling with jewelry or expensive items, carry them with you instead of packing them into luggage. Luggage can be stolen or searched; don't risk losing your valuables this way. Instead, put them in a purse or bag that you carry with you at all times. Leave unnecessary forms of ID and credit cards at home. When at a hotel, secure your valuables in the room safe.

, Rather than carry cash, purchase traveler's checks from your bank before you leave home. Traveler's checks are widely accepted, and most large hotels will exchange them for local currency. If stolen, traveler's checks can be canceled and replaced. The same can't be said for cash.

, Even though millions of people travel each year without any incidents, accidents can happen. The best way to protect yourself is to stay in groups when wandering around, and don't venture far from your hotel at night. Never go into unlit areas at night, and stay off beaches after dark. Always know how to contact the local police whenever you enter a foreign area. Never accept rides from civilians; stick with Taxis or public transport.


Most importantly, listen to your intuition. If a situation or area doesn't feel comfortable, move someplace else.

, One of the best ways to protect yourself and your belongings while traveling is to not dress like a tourist. Big, bulky cameras, beach bags, floppy hats and brightly colored clothing all advertise that you're a tourist. You'll draw much less attention to yourself if you dress more demurely, or even like the locals.

, Fanny packs and loose purses are a pickpocket's primary target. Their straps can easily be cut, and the culprit can be off into the crowd without a trace. Instead, wear purses that cross across the chest, and wallets kept in a breast pocket.

, Reading the news, or checking for travel advisories from the government, can help you avoid journeying into a potentially dangerous area. Civil strife, an upswing in crime or even natural disasters can happen at any time. Be aware of the conditions of the area into which you're traveling.

Don't panic.,
File a police report.,

Get it right every time.",How to Know What to Do if Your Passport Is Lost or Stolen,"


Did you put it somewhere else for safekeeping, such as the hotel safe, or a different part of your bag or room?
Did you leave it with a friend or the hotel concierge?;
, Try to remember when you last saw your passport and work back from that moment.


Where have you been since? Which shops, restaurants, offices, theaters, sites, etc., have you been to?
Track back to each of those sites and go to their manager or lost property bureau and ask whether a passport has been handed in.

, If you haven't found it yet, it's normal to start to feel worried. Panicking won't change the reality of the situation, however, and you still need to think clearly.

, This is usually required for both replacement purposes and for any insurance claims for any other items stolen or lost at the same time as your passport.


Take along a friend or someone whom you can trust to interpret for you if you don't speak the same language as the country in which you're filing the report.
Take along photocopies of the passport (yes, you should have these!) and any other identifying information you still have with you.
Always get a copy of the police report. If it looks half-baked (some countries don't have very official-looking reports), ask for the name of the station and phone number to be typed or written and initialed onto it, at a minimum. This is important if you are making an insurance claim.

, The rules on these will depend entirely on your country. Turn up to your country's embassy or commission (in some countries, you might need to go to another country's mission that holds the authority for your country). Explain what has happened and ask for a replacement passport.


Again, take along any identification and copies of originals that you do have on you.
Follow their instructions.
Let them know if you need any other assistance, such as financial, medical, etc. and follow their prompts.
Get a proper passport as soon as required. Emergency replacement passports tend not to have a long duration, so be sure to apply for a new, proper one as soon as it is convenient to do so.

, Ask your own embassy first, as they will probably know best. Then, visit the relevant immigration department of the country you are in, taking along anything that your own embassy has provided you with to substantiate your claim.

, Whenever you travel, always keep photocopies of important documents, traveler's check serial numbers, credit card numbers, etc., in a completely different part of your luggage from your real documentation and cards.


Make copies of your passport and visas, driver's license, any photo ID you're relying on, traveler's check serial numbers, credit card numbers, receipts and confirmations for all pre-booked services, contact details of people you travel and stay with, travel insurance, resume and any letters of referral if job-seeking, bank account numbers if relevant, phone numbers of people back home.
Make use of cloud computing or your email to store quickly retrievable copies too; this can be excellent for when you don't want to carry around photocopies but you do need internet access, so don't rely on this as the only method of making copies.
You can also leave copies of all these things in a folder at home with family or a best friend, who can email or fax through details if needed.

When overseas, avoid apparel such as white athletic shoes and clothing emblazoned with Western flag insignia, which may indicate to thieves that you're not a local and possess money to travel abroad.;
, In addition to keeping a wallet in your pocket, discreetly place money in a traveler's money belt or envelope worn around your waist, ankles or bra. If you get mugged and the mugger only takes one stash, at least you'll have additional funds immediately available.

, Whether you're male or female, you can help to avoid criminal activity abroad and domestically by traveling with a group.

, Watch for places you can go in case of an emergency.


If you suspect you're being followed, look for the nearest cafe, gas station or other gathering place with other people inside. If you can't quickly find one, briskly walk in the middle of the street until you do.

,


Be aware of your surroundings and other people in the vicinity. An entertainer may be working with a criminal partner who's attempting to lift your wallet. Don't allow street entertainers or passers-by to get close to you.

, Criminals may be less likely to harm you if they know you're aware of their movement.


When visiting a Western country, look the suspicious person in the eye. Eye contact is considered acceptable in Western societies.
While staying in an Eastern country, wear dark sunglasses. Criminals won't be able to tell if you're watching their activity. Avoid direct eye contact since most Eastern societies consider this practice aggressive and rude.
Don't underestimate the elderly lady or well-dressed business person sitting next to you, she or he may be working with a partner in a criminal ring targeting tourists.

Examine your hotel room for bedbugs.,
Get vaccinated if you're traveling internationally.,
Watch what you eat.,
Carry photocopies or electronic backups of your passport and other identifications.,
Pay attention to weather reports.",How to Protect Yourself when Traveling2," Don't assume that an expensive hotel won't be infested; bedbug infestations are found around the world in big cities and small towns.


Strip your bed down to the mattress and look for reddish bug droppings on the mattress as well as along the headboard and around baseboards.
Pack clothing in protective plastic bags and leave them there when in a hotel. Since bedbugs can infest closets and walls, you're better off not unpacking.

, Know which vaccinations are required or recommended for the countries you are visiting.


Call your local health department at least 2 months in advance of your journey to allow ample time for vaccination protocols.

, Avoid raw meats and fish in foreign countries with questionable sanitation practices.

, Copies will be helpful in case a natural disaster strikes your hotel or thieves steal your luggage.


Ask contacts in your home city to hold extra copies should you lose all of yours.

, Know what climatologists expect in your destination. If a damaging weather event is imminent, ask locals where to go for safety.

Fold a piece of paper into a triangle.,
Tape a straight drinking straw to the triangle's longest side.,
Punch a small hole next to the end of the straw.,
Attach a string through the hole.,
Tie a small weight to the bottom end of the string.",How to Make a Clinometer1," Fold the bottom right corner over to touch the left side of the paper, lining up the sides exactly to form a triangle. If you are using an ordinary rectangular sheet of paper, there will probably be an unfolded ""extra"" section above this triangle. Cut or tear this section off. What you are left with is an isosceles right triangle, with one 90º angle and two 45º angles.


Construction paper will make a more durable clinometer, but you can use any sheet of paper. You may want to tape or glue the triangle together to make it sturdier.;
, Position a drinking straw along the longest edge of the triangle, or hypotenuse, so that one end extends slightly out from the paper. Make sure the straw isn't bent or crushed, and runs straight along the hypotenuse. Use tape or glue to secure it to the paper. You will be looking through this straw when using the clinometer.

, Choose the end of the straw that is level with the corner, not the one where the straw extends beyond the paper. Use a hole punch or a sharp pen to make a hole in the triangle near this corner.

, Push a string through the hole, then tie a knot or tape it to keep it from slipping back out. Use enough string that you have at least a few inches (several centimeters) dangling at the bottom of the clinometer.

, Use a metal washer, a paper clip, or another small object. The weight should dangle 2 inches (5 cm) or more below the corner of the clinometer so that the string will swing freely.

"
"
Sight the top of a tall object through the straw.,
Move forward or backward until the string lines up with the triangle.,
Use a tape measure to find the distance between this position and the base of the tall object.,
Add your height at eye level to get the final answer.",How to Make a Clinometer2," Hold the longer end of the straw next to your eye and point it at the top of a tall object you want to measure, such as a tree. Most likely, you'll have to tilt the triangle in order to see the top of the object you're aiming for.

, In order to measure the tree, you need to find a spot to stand where you can hold the triangle completely flat and still see the top of the object through the straw. You can tell when the triangle is flat, because the weight will pull the string down exactly in line with one of the triangle's short sides.


When this happens, it means the angle of elevation between your eye and the top of the object is 45 degrees.
If you crouch or stand on an object to find a better position, you'll need to measure your height at eye level while in that position, instead of when standing normally as described in a later step.

, Just like the triangle you're holding, the giant triangle formed by you, the base of the tall object, and the top of the object has two 45º angles and one 90º angle. The two shorter sides of a 45-45-90 triangle are always the same length. Measure the distance between the position you were standing in at the end of the last step, and the base of the tall object you are measuring. The result is almost the height of the tall object, but there's one more step to get your final answer.


If you don't have a tape measure, walk normally towards the tall object and count how many steps it takes to get there. Later, when you have a ruler, measure the length of one step and multiply by the number of steps you took to find the total distance (and therefore the height of the object).

, Because you held the clinometer at eye level, you actually measured the height of the object starting at your eye's height above the ground.Use a tape measure to find out how tall you are from the ground to your eye level, add add the result to the number you measured in the last step. Now you know the full height of the object!

"
Find a 180º protractor.,
Tape a straw along the straight edge.,
Tie a string through the small hole on the straight edge.,
Attach a small weight to the dangling end of the string.",How to Make a Clinometer3," This type of protractor is shaped like half a circle, with angles marked all around the rim. You can buy them anywhere that sells school supplies. Ideally, choose a protractor with a small hole near the center of the protractor, along its straight base.


If you don't want to buy one, you can search online for a printable protractor. Print it out, cut it very carefully along its outline, and glue the paper protractor to something a little sturdier, such as construction paper or an index card.

, Tape a straight, plastic drinking straw on or near the straight edge of the protractor. Make sure the straw passes through the two 0º or zero marks on opposite ends of the straight edge.


If you don't have a straw, roll a piece of paper into a tight cylinder and use that instead.

, Many protractors come with a small hole directly between the 0º marks on the protractor, across from the 90º mark on the curved edge of the protractor. If your protractor does not have a small hole here, or if the hole is not situated correctly, tape or glue the string to the protractor where the hole should be. Make sure the string dangles a few inches (several centimeters) below the protractor.


If you are using a paper protractor, you can punch the hole yourself with a sharp pen or hole punch. Do not try to punch a hole in a plastic protractor, as it is probably made from weak plastic and could shatter.

, Tie a paper clip, metal washer, or other small weight to the end of the string. When you hold the clinometer so the string falls past the circular rim of the protractor, the weight will pull the string straight down past an angle mark on the protractor, such as 60º. This tells you what angle the clinometer is being held at, which can be used to find the heights of distant objects as described in the section below.

"
"
Sight the top of a tall object through the straw.,
Measure the angle using the protractor.,
Calculate the tangent of this angle.,
Measure your distance from the object.,
Use your measurements to calculate the height of the object.",How to Make a Clinometer4," Hold the clinometer so the curved rim of the protractor is facing downward. Tilt the clinometer until you can look through the straw or paper tube and see the top of a tall object you want to measure, such as a building. You can use this method to measure the angle between you and the top of that object, or the object's height.

, Keep the clinometer steady in that position, until the dangling string becomes still. Calculate the angle between the midpoint of the protractor (90º), and the point where the string crosses the rim by subtracting one from the other. For example, if the string crosses the rim at 60º, the angle of elevation between you and the top of the object is 90–60=30º. If the string crosses the rim at 150º, the angle of elevation is 150-90=60º.


The angle of elevation will always be less than 90º, since 90º is straight up in the sky.
The answer will always be positive (greater than 0º). If you subtract the larger number from the smaller and get a negative number, just cross out the minus sign to get the right answer. For example, if you calculate that 60-90=-30º, the actual angle of elevation is +30º.

, The tangent of an angle is defined as the side of a right triangle opposite the angle, divided by the side adjacent to the angle. In this case, the triangle is formed by three points: you, the base of the object, and the top of the object. The ""opposite"" side from this angle is the height of the object, and the adjacent side is the distance between you and the object's base.


You can use a scientific or graphing calculator, an online tangent calculator, or a chart listing tangents for various angles.
To calculate the tangent on a calculator, press TAN and enter the angle you found. If the answer is below 0 or above 1, set your calculator to degrees instead of radians and try again.

, If you want to find out how tall the object is, you'll need to know how far away you are from its base. Measure using a tape measure. If you don't have one, count the number of ordinary steps it takes to get to the object, then measure the length of one step once you find a ruler. The total distance is the length of one step multiplied by the number of steps you took.


Some protractors have rulers marked along the straight edge.

, Remember, the tangent of your angle is (object's height) / (distance between you and the object). Multiply the tangent by the distance you measured, and you'll be left with just the object's height!


For example, if the angle of elevation was 35º, and your distance from the object was 45 units, the object's height equals 45 x tangent(35º), or 31.5 units.
Add your own height at eye level to your answer, since that's how far your clinometer was above the ground.

Gather your materials.,
Map out the dimensions of the template on the graph paper.,
Use a pen and a ruler to draw the lines on graph paper.,
Cut out the shape from the graph paper.,
Prep the CD case by removing the unnecessary material.,
Trace the template on the plastic CD case.,
Cut out the templates from the plastic CD case.,
Tape or glue the templates together.,
Shape the figure.,
Display a simple video or moving image on your smartphone.,
Place your hologram projector on your smartphone screen.",How to Make a Holographic Illusion Pyramid," Most of the items you'll need will be laying around the house. For instance, you probably have some old CD cases around. You'll also need tape or glue, graph paper, a pen, a ruler and a smartphone.;
, The template you’re going to make is for your hologram projector. It will take a rhombus shape when all the pieces are put together, resembling a square with slanted sides.


A rhombus is a parallelogram. It has four equal sides that are parallel to each other and diagonals that bisect each other at right angles.You are going to make a template to form the side of this 2-D shape, which will be the projector screen for your hologram. The final shape of the projector will resemble a pyramid with a short flat top.

, Line up your ruler with lines on the graph paper. The dimensions of your shape are 1 centimeter (0.39 inches) on the top, 3.5 centimeters (1.37 inches) on the sides and 6 centimeters (2.36 inches) on the bottom. Then, draw your lines. Connect all of the lines to complete the outline of the shape.


The finished shape should look similar to an isosceles trapezoid.In other words, the template will show resemblance to a flat-topped pyramid.If you want to make your template bigger you can double or triple each of the sides. For instance, the dimensions should be 2 cm by 7 cm by 12 cm if you want to double it. If you’re wondering why it matters, it’s because increasing the size of the template increases the size of your hologram. You might get a better quality hologram with a smaller template, but how big you choose to make your hologram is ultimately your choice. Just use the same proportions of the provided dimensions when you’re increasing the size.

, Cut along the lines as precisely as possible, making sure that none of the edges are jagged or uneven. You can use scissors if you want, but you’ll get a more exact cut if you use a box cutter or an utility blade. Use the tool that you're the most comfortable using.

, Cut off the sides of the CD case with a utility blade. You only need the front plastic cover because it is going to be the source material for your projector screen, which will project the hologram. If your CD case is dusty, clean it off with some glass cleaner. The cleaner and clearer your plastic pieces are the more clarity your hologram will have.


Don’t worry if the plastic has some scratches on it. That doesn’t matter as much, but if you have a CD case with fewer scratches or none at all, it would be a better option.

, Try to orientate the template in such a way that you can fit it on the plastic four times. Flip it in the opposite direction, so you have one template upright and one upside down. You’ll need four of these pieces to construct the projector, and it’s easier to cut them out of the same piece of plastic -- especially if you don’t have several CD cases laying around. Then, with your pen, trace the template four times on the plastic if are able.


If you have increased the size of your template, you may not be able to cut out four templates from a single plastic CD case. If not, salvage a few more plastic CD cases to cut out your templates.

, With your utility blade, follow the line that you traced on the plastic. Use your ruler as a guide to help you cut straight. Line it up along the line that you traced, press firmly on the ruler so it doesn’t move. Then with your other hand, trace over your lines with your utility blade. Go over the lines with the blades several times until you have cut through the plastic. When you finish you should have four plastic pieces that look just like your template.If you have removed the sides of the plastic from the CD case, then cutting out the templates will be much easier because you’ll be able to press down.

, Line up two of the plastic template pieces side by side. Then put a piece of tape at the top and the bottom where their edges meet. Make sure the tape overlaps onto both sides of the template so that it holds them together well. Then, tape the remaining two pieces to each end in the same manner. All four of the plastic pieces should be taped together.


You can glue the pieces together instead of taping them. However, this will likely take longer because you have to hold the pieces together until they dry.

, Stand up the taped pieces on the bottom edge. Bend the pieces where you have applied the tape to create corners or creases at each edge. Then tape the two open ends together to close the shape. This is your hologram projector.It should now resemble a pyramid with a flat top.

, A single fish swimming or a flower moving back and forth works fine. Use a screensaver image or a video. Whatever image you display is the image that is going to be projected into a hologram., With the moving image still displayed on your smartphone, set your screen projector with the short end -- the 1-centimeter end-- down on your smartphone. The side facing up at you should be the 6-centimeter end, and it should now have the shape of the rhombus. If your image on your smartphone is still moving, you should now see a 3D hologram of it projected through your CD case projector.."

Use this to quickly make a temporary magnet.,
Find a strong magnet.,
Test the steel's reaction to the magnet.,
Stroke the magnet along half the steel, repeatedly.,
Stroke the opposite end of the magnet along the other half.",How to Magnetize Steel1," Keep a strong magnet around, and you can magnetize some types of steel with a couple minutes of work. This turns the steel into a weak magnet that loses its magnetism over time.This method is ideal for magnetizing a screwdriver, nail, or needle just before use. You can also use it to restore magnetism to an old compass needle or other weakened magnet., You can use any magnet to ""pass on"" the magnetism to the steel, but ordinary refrigerator magnets will have a very weak effect. Neodymium or other rare-earth magnets are good options, available at home improvement stores, hobby stores, or specialized online magnet stores.


You can also purchase a ""tool magnetizer"" designed for this purpose.

, If the steel doesn't respond to the magnet, it can't be turned into a magnet itself. Also note that this method is easiest to use on long, thin pieces of steel, such as screwdrivers or nails, but will work on any shape of steel.


If you're considering purchasing stainless steel and can't investigate it before buying, ask the manufacturer what type of steel it is. You'll want ""ferritic"" stainless steel, or stainless steel graded as part of the ""400 series.""Coincidentally, the varieties that can be magnetized tend to be cheaper, but that's not universally true.

, Hold the steel object in one hand. Stick the magnet to the steel about halfway along its length, then drag it to one tip. Repeat several times, stroking only in one direction, and only along half of the steel. The more you do this, the more magnetized the steel will become.


You can magnetize a ball bearing or other small, steel object by rubbing the steel along the magnet, instead of vice versa.

, Flip the magnet over so the other pole touches the steel. Place it against the steel at the midpoint again, but drag it the other way, toward the end of the steel that wasn't rubbed earlier.Repeat until the steel can pick up a paper clip, or continue to rub to increase the strength slightly.


If you're not sure where the two poles are located on the magnet, test them using a second magnet. One pole will attract a surface of the other magnet, and the opposite pole will repel the same surface.

Strip the insulation off both ends of a wire.,
Wrap the wire around the steel.,
Select a low-voltage battery.,
Use rubber gloves and rubber-handled tools.,
Connect the wire ends to the battery.,
Test the steel.",How to Magnetize Steel2," Using wire stripping pliers, strip about an inch (2.5cm) of insulation from each end of an insulated wire. You'll need enough wire to wrap around your steel object at least ten times.


""Enameled wire"" with thin insulation will have a stronger effect. Do not use bare wire without insulation, as this will interrupt the current and fail to work., Leaving a couple inches (several centimeters) of wire at each end, wrap the insulated portion around the steel. The steel will become more magnetic the more times you wrap the wire. Use at least ten loops for nails, and several dozen for larger objects.


Alternatively, wrap the wire around a heat-proof plastic tube large enough to insert your steel through.
If a regular magnet is not attracted to the steel, don't bother trying to magnetize it. Some types of stainless steel cannot be magnetized.

, An ordinary 1.5V or 3V battery will provide a safe, DC power source sufficient to magnetize nails or screws. Larger steel objects may require a higher voltage battery, but these will create more heat, and a more dangerous electrical shock if handled improperly. A 12V car battery can be used if it is removed from the vehicle and the safety precautions below are followed, but higher voltages are not recommended.



Never use an electrical outlet or other AC power supply, as the high voltage could blow your house fuse or create serious safety risks., These will prevent the electrical current from reaching you. Although low-voltage household batteries are harmless in this respect, you may want gloves anyway as the metal can get quite hot if left in the coil.

, Attach one of the stripped wire ends to the positive terminal of the battery. Attach the other wire end to the negative terminal of the battery. For small household batteries, wrapping the wire around a brass paper fastener will make it easier to keep them together. Place the fastener head on the battery so the wire makes contact, then use tape or rubber bands to attach the fastener arms to the side of the battery.An additional rubber band holding the fasteners in place lengthwise will make a more sturdy connection.


If using a higher-voltage battery, you may see sparks when the circuit is completed. Only hold the wire by the insulated portion.

, An electrical current flowing through the coil creates a magnetic field, which will magnetize any ferromagnetic metal placed inside it. If your variety of steel can be magnetized, it should be able to pick up small iron objects after a short time in the coil.


Putting magnetized steel through the coil a second time will demagnetize it again."
"
Find north.,
Arrange the steel so it points north.,
Hold the steel in place.,
Strike the steel with a hammer repeatedly.,
Understand why this works.",How to Magnetize Steel3," If you have a compass, the needle will point directly to magnetic north. Otherwise finding true north should be good enough for this method.

, Put the steel object down, so its longest dimension is laid out north-to-south.


This method will not work well for small objects or steel balls that cannot be arranged north-south.

, Tape the steel down or use a clamp or vise to hold it in place.

, Bash the end of the steel object repeatedly. The steel will gradually become a weak magnet, and get slightly stronger each time your strike it. Test this by holding a paper clip next to the steel periodically.


Some types of steel cannot be magnetized at home. Try a different steel object if you notice no magnetic effect at all, or switch to iron.

, The added energy from striking the metal allows the atomic-level magnetic domains to rearrange themselves in a magnetic field. Since the planet's iron core produces its own magnetic field, these miniature magnets rearrange themselves to point north. Once enough jostling has occurred, all these miniature magnets pointed in the same direction creates a magnetic effect strong enough for us to notice."

Check to see what security measures your airport uses.,
Know the facts about TSA body scanners.,
Know your rights.,
Remove certain items before passing through a scanning unit.,
Know where to voice any concerns you may have.",How to Prepare for a TSA Body Scan or Pat Down," As of Nov. 15, 2010, 68 airports across the nation use TSA advanced imaging technology and a total of 385 units are in place. The TSA keeps a list of all airports using the full-body image scanners, or you can call your airport ahead of time.;
, With misinformation spreading about the new TSA procedures, it is vital to know fact from fiction. The TSA uses two types of full-body image scanners, millimeter wave and backscatter units, to detect potential threats underneath clothing without using any physical contact.
Although there have not been any long term studies on their effects, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved both types of technology as safe for all passengers. The images are evaluated by a TSA officer separate from the one assisting passengers with the scanner, and those officers are prohibited from bringing cell-phones, cameras or any photo-enabled device into the viewing area. After the TSA officer clears the passenger, it is claimed that the image is immediately deleted from the system and cannot be saved, printed or transferred. The TSA estimates the entire process takes less than 1 minute.


Millimeter Wave Units: This type of scanner bounces electromagnetic waves off the body of passengers to create a 3-dimensional black and white image, similar to a photo negative.
Backscatter Units: This type of scanner uses low-level X-rays to generate a reflection of the passenger’s body that resembles a chalk etching. According to the TSA, the radiation exposure is equivalent to being in an airplane for about 2 minutes. However, radiation experts from the University of California, San Francisco, recently sent a letter warning President Obama's science assistant that the machines pose potentially serious health risks, particularly to children, the elderly, and women.

, The full-body image scanners are optional and if you choose not to use them, you will receive an alternate screening that includes a pat-down performed by an officer of the same gender as yourself. Previously, pat-downs were reserved for passengers who set off the metal detector, but now they are used for any passenger who opts out of the scanners or to resolve anomalies detected by the scan. The new pat-down procedure allows TSA officers to use fingers and palms to feel around genitals (including the groin) and breasts, over a passenger’s clothing. You can request that a pat-down be conducted in private and to have a travel partner be with you during the screening.

, Just like going through a metal detector, it is recommended you remove items from your pockets, jewelry, watches, belts, coins, and cell phones before entering the scanner. These items can be perceived as an irregularity by the officer evaluating the images and further screening would then need to take place.

, Whether or not you feel comfortable receiving a full-body image scan or a thorough pat-down, these are the new requirements and no one can board a plane without successfully passing through security. If you would like to voice concern, as many others have done, write to your congressional representative. Also, various online petitions have begun to remove or modify the new security procedures.

Choose your candles.For the best results, you want to use candles that are fairly large and haven’t yet been burned down.,
Set up your area.,
Decorate your area.,
Light your candle with matches or a lighter.Use whatever you feel comfortable using to light your candle, whether that is a lighter or matches.,
Allow the candle to burn.,
Blow out the candles.,

Experiment with heights.,
Add a flourish.If you want to present this experiment, as a magic trick, you want to provide a bit of a show to the audience of your friends and family.",How to Light a Candle Without Touching the Wick," It’s fine if they’ve been used slightly.


Candles are made from all different types of waxes and materials. Try choosing a few different types to compare your results and see which works best.
Gather soy, gelatin, paraffin, beeswax, bayberry, or soy candles.
Different types of wax have different rates of evaporation.;
, You want to place your candles on a clean, flat surface. Put your candles in candle holders, and lay newspaper on the table underneath them to catch any dripping wax.


Make sure that your candle area is free from any flammable items that could catch fire.
If you have long hair, pull it back, and don’t wear loose-fitting clothing.
Even though you’re just working with candles, you still want to take precautions around fire.

, If you want to light a candle without touching the wick as a magic trick for your friends, rather than just as an experiment, consider giving the space where you’ll present your trick a little bit of pizzazz.


Hang a black sheet or large piece of black poster board behind your candles. This will make the flame more prominent and visible. Just make sure that these are far enough from the flame that they aren’t a fire hazard.
Place a banner or poster with sayings about magic behind your hands.
You can also place nonflammable magical objects, like crystals, around your candles.,


Long matches or a grill lighter works well to protect your hand while lighting the candle.
If you don’t have a long lighter, you can use regular matches or a lighter to light the end of a spaghetti noodle, and then use this noodle to light the wick of your candle.
Initially, you will touch light the candle by touching the wick.

, You want the wick to char a bit. Allow it to turn slightly black. This will give you time to build up the vaporized fuel in the air and relight the candle.


Don’t leave the candle unattended.
You should burn it until you see a glowing red ember on the end., You want to blow out your candles, rather than using another method of extinguishing them.


Blowing out your candles will maximize the smoke above the wick.
Don’t blow out your candle until you are ready to do your trick, and reignite it, as this works best just after you’ve blown the candle out.

, You don’t want your lighter to touch the candle at all. However, it works best if you can move your flame within the column of smoke from your candle.


Light the candle smoke as soon after you blow out the candle as you can.
You can light any area around the candle that you see smoke, even if it isn’t directly above the wick.

, To make your trick more impressive, try relighting the smoke of the candle from different distances above the candle. This will help you understand how far away from the candle you can still light it.


Begin at about an inch above the candle.
Then, move farther upward, in small increments, until the candle no longer lights.

,


Talk through the trick. Try to catch their eyes. You want them to only focus on the candles when you’re about the relight them without touching the wick.
Talk in a booming voice, and project your confidence.

Understand how sedimentary rocks are made.,
Be aware of the different types of sedimentary rocks:

Coal - coal is formed from layers of dead vegetation, such as trees and plants that were laid down in a swamp, buried deeply where pressure and temperature concentrates the carbon in the plant cells forming coal.,
Recognise that this article provides only a very basic overview of sedimentary rocks.",How to Learn About Sedimentary Rocks," Existing rocks are eroded mainly by water or ice, deposited in rivers, lakes and oceans. When these particles are dropped they build up gradually in layer upon layer. Over millions of years these sediments are buried deeply and are exposed to pressure and temperature turning soft sediment to rock. Collisions of continents and other forces bring these rocks to surface; are exposed and the cycle begins again.;
,







A conglomerate - a conglomerate is a sedimentary rock that is composed of particles of varying size and shape, such as small, medium and large round pebbles mixed with small sand grains.







Limestone - limestone is composed of calcium carbonate derived from the exoskeletons of sea life such as corals and shelled animals, it can also be precipitated by sea grasses. Lime mud and lime debris are deposited along coastlines. These are buried and slowly recrystallize into limestone.






This image shows the sea creatures encrusted within limestone.







, The most important thing to remember about sedimentary rocks is that they record the long history of our planet.

While a single mineral can appear in different shapes or colors due to geological processes or trace amounts of impurities, generally every example of that mineral will have certain characteristics that can be tested for. Rocks, on the other hand, may be formed from a combination of minerals and don't have a crystal structure. They aren't always easy to tell apart, but if these tests produce different results on one part of an object than on another, the object is probably a rock.


You can try identifying rocks as well, or at least identifying which of the three types of rock they belong to.;
, There are thousands of minerals on Earth, but many of them are rare or only found deep underground. Sometimes, conducting two or three tests is all you need to narrow the unidentified substance down to a likely, common mineral listed in the next section. If your mineral's characteristics don't match any of those descriptions, try to find a mineral identification guide for your area. If you've conducted many tests and can't narrow a mineral down between two or more possibilities, search online for photographs of each possible mineral and for specific tips for telling those minerals apart.


It's best to include at least one test that involves an action, such as the hardness test or streak test. Tests that only involve looking at and describing the mineral may not be helpful by themselves, since different people describe the same mineral in different ways.

, The overall shape of each mineral crystal and the pattern of a group of crystals is called a habit.There are many technical terms geologists use to describe this, but a basic description is often enough. For instance, is the mineral bumpy or smooth? Is it a collection of rectangular crystals jumbled into each other, or thin spiky crystals pointed outward?

, Luster is the way a mineral reflects light, and while it's not a scientific test, it's often useful to include in descriptions. Most minerals have a shine that's either glassy (or vitreous) or metallic. You can also describe a shine as greasy, pearly (a whitish shine), earthy (dull, like unglazed pottery), or with any description that makes sense to you.Use multiple adjectives if you need to.

, For most people, this is one of the easiest tests to conduct, but it's not always useful. Small traces of other substances in the mineral can cause it to change color, so one mineral may appear in many different colors. However, if the mineral is an unusual color, such as purple, it might help you narrow down the possibilities.


When describing minerals, avoid hard-to-define color words such as ""salmon"" and ""puce."" Stick with simple terms such as ""red,"" ""black,"" and ""green.""

, This is a useful and easy test, as long as you have a piece of white, unglazed porcelain. The back of a kitchen of bathroom tile might work well; see if you can purchase one at a home improvement store. Once you have the porcelain, simply rub the mineral on the tile, and see what color ""streak"" it leaves behind. Often, this streak is a different color than the large piece of mineral.


Glaze is what gives porcelain and other ceramic objects their glassy shine. An unglazed piece of porcelain does not reflect light.
Keep in mind that some minerals have no streak, particularly the harder minerals (because they are harder than the streak plate).

, Geologists often use the Mohs hardness scale, names after its creator, to quickly estimate the hardness of a mineral. If you succeed with the ""4"" test but not with the ""5,"" the mineral's hardness is between 4 and 5, and you can stop testing. Try to leave a permanent scratch mark using these common materials (or minerals found in mineral hardness test kit), starting with the lowest numbers and working upward if the test succeeds:1 -- Easily scratched with fingernail, feels greasy and soft (or can be scratched with talc)
2 -- Can be scratched by a fingernail (gypsum)
3 -- Can be cut easily with a knife or a nail, scratched by a penny (calcite)
4 -- Can be scratched easily by a knife (fluorite)
5 -- Can be scratched by a knife with difficulty, scratched by a piece of glass (apatite)
6 -- Can be scratched by a steel file, scratches a piece of glass with difficulty (orthoclase)
7 -- Scratches a steel file, easily scratches a piece of glass (quartz)
8 -- Scratches quartz (topaz)
9 -- Scratches almost anything, cuts glass (corundum)
10 -- Scratches or cuts almost anything (diamond)

, Since each specific mineral has a certain structure to it, it should break in a certain way. If the break results in one ore more flat surfaces, it demonstrates cleavage. If there are no flat surfaces, just curves or irregular bumps, the broken mineral has fracture.Cleavage can be described in more detail by the number of flat surfaces that a break creates (usually between one and four), and whether the surface is perfect (smooth) or imperfect (rough).
Fracture comes in several types. Describe it as splintered (or fibrous), sharp and jagged (hackly), bowl-shaped (conchoidal), or none of the above (uneven).

, There are many other tests geologists conduct to identify a mineral. However, many of these are almost never useful for common minerals, or they may involve specialized equipment or dangerous materials. Here are brief descriptions of some tests you might be interested in conducting:


If your mineral sticks to a magnet, it is most likely magnetite, the only common strongly magnetic mineral. If the attraction is weak, or descriptions of magnetite don't match your mineral, it may be pyrrhotite, franklinite, or ilmenite instead.Some minerals melt easily in a candle or lighter flame, while others won't melt even in a blowtorch flame. Minerals that melt easily have a higher ""fusibility"" than minerals that are more difficult to melt.
If your mineral has a notable smell, try to describe it and search online for a mineral with that smell. Strong smelling minerals are not common, although the bright yellow mineral sulfur can react to produce the smell found in rotten eggs.

, The descriptions below use various terms or numbers to describe the mineral's shape, hardness, appearance after breaking, or other attributes. If you're not sure what these mean, refer to the section above on conducting tests for an explanation.

, Quartz is an extremely common mineral, and its glittering or crystalline appearance catches the eye of many collectors. Quartz has a hardness of 7 on the Mohs scale, and demonstrates any type of fracture when broken, never the flat surface of cleavage.It does not leave a noticeable streak on white porcelain. It has a glassy luster, or shine.



Milky quartz is translucent, rose quartz is pink, and amethyst is purple.

, All types of quartz are crystalline, but some varieties, called ""cryptocrystalline,"" are made of minuscule crystals not visible to the eye.If the mineral has a hardness of 7, fractures, and has a glassy luster, it may be a type of quartz called chert. This is most commonly brown or grey.

""Flint"" is one variety of chert, but it is categorized in many different ways. For instance, some people may refer to any black chert as flint, while others may only call it flint if it has a certain luster or was found among certain types of rock.

, Chalcedony is formed from a mixtures of quartz and another mineral, moganite. There are many beautiful varieties, typically forming striped bands of different colors. Here are two of the most common:


Onyx is a type of chalcedony that tends to have parallel bands. It is most often black or white, but can be many colors.
Agate has more curving or ""wiggly"" bands, and can show up in a wide variety of different colors. It can form from pure quartz, chalcedony, or similar minerals.

, Besides the many varieties of quartz, feldspar is the most common type of mineral found. It has a hardness of 6, leaves a white streak, and can appear with various colors or luster. It forms two flat cleavages when broken, with surfaces that are fairly smooth and nearly at right angles to each other.

, This mineral is easily identified because it peels into thin, flexible sheets when scratched by a fingernail or even rubbed with a finger. Muscovite mica or white mica is pale brown or colorless, while biotite mica or black mica is dark brown or black, with a brown-gray streak., Pyrite, also known as fool's gold, has a metallic yellow appearance, but several test can distinguish it from real gold. It has a hardness rating of 6 or more, while gold is much softer, with a rating between 2 and 3.It leaves a greenish-black streak, and can be crushed into powder if enough pressure is applied.



Marcasite is another common mineral similar to pyrite. While pyrite crystals are shaped like cubes, marcasite forms needles.

, Both of these minerals contain copper, among other minerals. The copper gives malachite its rich green color, while it causes azurite to appear bright blue. These often occur together, and both have a hardness between 3 and 4., A mineral guide specific to your area will cover other common types of mineral found in that region. If you are having difficulty identifying a mineral, some online resources such as minerals.net will let you search for the results of your tests and match them to possible minerals.

Study how science innovations grow in stages, and so that's how quantum theory of material and light were described beginning in approximately 1899: that was then formulated at the beginning of the 20th century as a result of experiments that were done in various areas of classical physics in which the classical laws of mechanics described by Issac Newton were not able to explain by the previously appropriate mathematical equations of physics/physical science.,
Read examples including the failure of Newton's Laws to mathematically measure or deal with the phenomenon of black body radiation (that failing motivated looking for new theories), since black bodies do not emit or reflect light.,
Realize that some phenomena related to bending of light (deflected by gravitational fields) around celestial bodies had not given satisfactory results in mathematical equations depicting them, including light around black bodies.,
Learn why the application of the concepts of quantization, the quanta of physical observables, seemed to work well with solving the mathematical problems that arose due to failures of Newton's laws to describe, model and satisfactorily allow for newly discovered phenomena.,
Evaluate the Schroedinger equation mathematically to depict types of wave forms.,
Learn about history and definitions:



Planck's constant h - physical constant of the sizes of quanta in quantum mechanics.,
Study the operative theory in mathematics which should be extensive to see whether this theory can continue to be valid in all circumstances (or may be valid only for certain limitations and parameters that might be specified).,
Realize that finding any discovery that may lead to weakening of the scientific credibility of a physics equation, as occurred with the theory of relativity, can have catastrophic (change) effects on describing such science: This is true, being applicable in general science and on all other fields of sciences that rely in their scientific development on the formulations of these fundamental equations when they are not all directly observable and so they are theoretically based (derived by describing them mathematically).

,
Be very cautious when building and formulating new theories in science because of pitfalls and defects in your theory can jeopardize its scientific credibility and could eventually lead to its invalidation (for example: inconsistency).

,
Apply similar discussion to other theories in physics and other testable sciences.",How to Learn and Understand Limitations of General Scientific Theories and Quantum Theory,";
, The existence of black holes in the universe is a theory now supported both theoretically and by observations of distant, astronomical phenomena that seem to indicate that a black hole may ""swallow"" stars, planetary systems and grow until it may collapse a galaxy, disappearing into the hole. Mathematics may model (describe/show) how to theoretically calculate physical properties of remote/distant stellar bodies (of or pertaining to the stars, or consisting of stars)in the universe such as the temperature of the surface of the stars and their atomic contents. Such information is usually obtained by interpreting the detected light spectrum (diffracted colors) emitted by the specific star and analyzing wavelengths for distance and temperature -- and status of a star in stages of stellar existence, such as quasar, supernova, red giant, white dwarf, collapsing to neutron star, such as pulsar, and finally to become a black hole.

, Light energy had always previously been assumed to travel through space in straight lines. Discoveries and related measurements were not available (since no one had made observations) when the classical physics, including Newtonian, had been written to describe laws of physics by ""philosophy"". This issue was not resolved until the 20th century, using quantum (new) mechanical concepts of quantifying the energy of light"" in the form of discrete (quantifiable) photons.
Photons - subatomic light particles, with no electrical charge, but having momentum and carrying electromagnetic force as the quantum measurable force of electromagnetic radiation. They are explained by specific equations (including Schroedinger's, Einstein's and Planck's) shown below in a basic form. Also, various experiments in physics at the atomic level led to similar problems when the black body radiation was discovered and described. These were also settled by using similar concepts of quantifying energy and other physical observable phenomena, such as the momentum of an atomic particle, which were totally unknown in Newton's times.

, The quantum theory was further explained by the development of the Schroedinger equation (see the image) which relies on the assumption of ""waves as particles"" in the duality of matter in nature:Ψ is the wave function and i the imaginary unit. The ""Hbar"" is the reduced Planck constant. The ""hhat"" is the Hamiltonian operator. The d/dt lowercase ""delta/delta t"" indicates calculus differentiation for t (time).
His equation in its various forms is very fundamental for the development of many areas of physics and chemistry. Schrödinger equation of motion can be examined and read about including Wikipedia: Schrödinger equation.

, This explains the name wave function, and gives rise to ""wave-particle duality"". The wave function is a probability amplitude in quantum mechanics describing the quantum state of a particle and how it behaves, typically for space and time. And, its values are complex numbers. The laws of quantum mechanics (the Schrödinger equation) describe how the wave function evolves over time. The wave function behaves qualitatively like other waves, like water waves or waves on a string., It is named after Max Planck, who received the 1918 Nobel Prize in Physics ""in recognition of the services he rendered to the advancement of Physics by his discovery of energy quanta"". He was one of the founders of quantum theory, who described it in 1899.Planck's constant - was first described as proportionality constant between the energy (E) of a photon and the frequency of its associated electromagnetic wave (ν) nu . The relation between energy and frequency is called the Planck relation or the Planck–Einstein equation:E = hν

Since the frequency ν, wavelength λ (Lambda), and speed of light c are related by λν = c, the Planck relation can also be expressed as:

E = hc/λ



constant - certain numeric value for example π (pi) is a well known constant




Hilbert's space - uses methods of vector-algebra and of calculus from two-dimensional Euclidean plane and beyond the three-dimensional space to theoretical spaces with any finite or arguably infinite number of dimensions. A Hilbert space is ""abstract vector space"" with the structure of an inner product that allows length and angle to be measured. Furthermore, Hilbert spaces are required to be complete, a property that stipulates the existence of enough limits (parameters) in the space to allow the techniques of calculus to be used in a region.

, Also, this theory should be examined against any possible defect in its mathematical applications and physical structures. Theories that depict natural/physical phenomena are not to be taken for granted and search must always be continued for alternative, better more complete theories.

,,, This should also include for example Newton's theory of motion of massive bodies which have already showed failure of accuracy, as on the atomic scale, involving knowledge that was not yet uncovered in Newton's era. The gravitational law area in the classical theory of motion needs to be studied further and to provide more adequate theory for its physical explanation as a unique phenomenon that is characteristic of every star and particle in the universe. The failure to formulate a theory of quantum gravity should give an alert signal as to whether these theories are precisely correct or not (as new data is recorded and analyzed).

Use a light colored container.,
Line the cooler or bucket with aluminum foil.,
Wrap the ice bucket in a towel.",How to Keep Ice from Melting1," Look for a light colored cooler or ice bucket that is made of reflective material. Light colors absorb less heat, and will help to keep your ice from melting.A cooler or ice bucket made from nylon or Styrofoam will keep the ice cool for at least the day. A plastic container will keep ice cool overnight, as long as it is not placed in direct sunlight. Avoid metal coolers and buckets, as they hold heat and will not keep your ice from melting for a long period of time.;
, The reflective surface of aluminum foil is scientifically proven to keep ice from melting longer than other materials.Before you put the ice for the party in the cooler or bucket, place one layer of aluminium foil in the container.

, If you don’t have access to a good cooler or ice bucket, put the ice in the container and then use a clean towel or blanket to wrap the container. This will keep the ice cold for longer and prevent your ice from melting within the first hour of the party."
"
Use boiled water, instead of tap water.,
Pour the boiled water in large ice trays.,
Place a towel in the bucket or container before putting in the ice cubes.",How to Keep Ice from Melting2," Boiling the water before putting them in the ice trays will reduce the amount of air bubbles in the ice. This will make the ice last longer and appear more clear and less hazy.


If you are using plastic ice trays, let the water cool slightly before pouring it in the trays so you don’t melt the trays.

, Go for bigger ice trays to make larger ice cubes, or use a muffin pan to make ice chunks. Pour the boiled water evenly over the tray or pan and place it in the freezer.In fact, crushed ice and small ice cubes melt a lot faster than larger ice cubes and a large block of ice. Large pieces of ice have a reduced surface area, relative to their mass (or density), so they are less exposed to the warm air around them and less prone to melting., This will insulate the ice and keep them cold. You can also use bubble wrap and then a towel in the container to keep the ice insulated and less prone to melting.You should also place a lid over the bucket or container, once it is full of ice, to prevent exposure to air and to keep the ice from melting.

Keep the ice in a cool room or area.,
Use frozen ice packs to keep the ice from melting.,
Fill up the ice often.",How to Keep Ice from Melting3," Choose a cooler spot in the room, by a fan or air conditioner, to keep the ice bucket during the party. Avoid spots in direct sunlight and place your cooler in a shady area under a tree or the covered area of your deck. Don’t put the piping hot macaroni and cheese dish next to the ice cooler or the flaming BBQ plate next to your ice bucket.The ice will absorb heat from the atmosphere around it, so make sure you put it in a spot where it will have minimal to no contact with heat or warmth.

, The ice packs will help to keep the container nice and cold, thereby ensuring your ice doesn’t melt until the end of the party.If you are using a large cooler, you can also use frozen plastic bottles of water or other drinks that are not carbonated, to act as ice packs. Place them among the ice to keep the cooler frosty.

, This will ensure there is always fresh ice in the container that is keeping the container cold and preventing the rest of the ice from getting too warm.If you use a good insulating container and larger ice cubes, you likely will not have to check on the ice very often as it will stay cool on its own.

Understand how igneous rock is made.,
Know what an intrusive igneous rock is.,
Know what an extrusive igneous rock is.,
Know what pyroclastic igneous rock is.",How to Learn About Igneous Rocks1," Igneous rock forms from magma (i.e. molten rock). Magma is a liquid that is under the earth. The magma moves to a cooler part of the earth, loses its heat, and crystallizes into an igneous rock.


Magma is thick and is composed of very hot elements and compounds.
Magma can cool both inside the earth and out onto the surface of the earth.;
, This is formed when magma cools beneath the surface of the earth. The magma is insulated by the surrounding rock, and cools slowly. This allows the rock to form large crystals.Another name for intrusive rock is plutonic rock.You can often see the crystals of intrusive rocks with your naked eye.
Examples of intrusive rock include diorite, gabbro, granite, pegmatite, and peridotite., When magma erupts onto the earth's surface, it becomes lava in a volcanic eruption. Lava cools and turns to rock relatively quickly. The crystals in the rock don't have much time to form, creating fine-grained rocks with small crystals.You can hardly see the crystals at all with the naked eye. You will need a microscope or a hand lens to see the crystals.
Another name for extrusive rock is volcanic rock.Examples of extrusive rock include andesite, basalt, obsidian, pumice, rhyolite, scoria, and tuff.Some extrusive rocks cool very quickly and do not form crystals at all. These rocks are considered volcanic glass. Obsidian and pumice are examples of volcanic glass., When there's an explosive volcanic eruption, ash is thrown high into the air. When this ash falls and turns into rock, it's called pyroclastic rock. The minerals are broken into small pieces in this type of rock by the explosive eruption.Examples of pyroclastic rock include serpentinite, diabase, spilite, greisen and skarns.

Know the dangers of handling dry ice.,
Protect yourself by dressing in a long-sleeved shirt, long pants, and closed-toed shoes.,
Pick up the dry ice with tongs.,
Use a chisel to break off smaller pieces from the block.,
Use the dry ice in a well-ventilated area.,
Store dry ice in an insulated container that is not airtight.,
Melt the ice when you are finished with it by pouring warm water over it.",How to Handle Dry Ice1," Handling dry ice is dangerous due to its extremely cold temperatures that can lead to frostbite and tissue injury. The carbon dioxide vapors in an unventilated area are also toxic.If prolonged contact with dry ice occurs, do not rub the affected area. Remove clothing that is not frozen to the skin and place the affected area in a warm water bath. Avoid direct dry heat.;
, Proper protection is essential while handling dry ice. The best protection is to cover all of the surfaces of your body that could be exposed. Gloves are and goggles are extremely important to protect your hands and eyes from injury.

, Never handle dry ice directly with your bare hands. If possible, use metal tongs when transferring chunks of dry ice to new locations. If you do not have tongs available, wear an oven mitt or towel while handling the dry ice.


Metal tongs with serrated edges work best.

, If you purchased a block of dry ice and need smaller pieces, use caution while chiseling them off. Break off pieces of the ice by setting a chisel to the desired point, and tapping it lightly with a mallet.


Always wear eye protection while chiseling to prevent chips from flying into your eyes.

, Dry ice is frozen carbon dioxide. As it warms, it sublimates (turns directly from a solid to gas, skipping the liquid phase) into its gaseous form. Exposure to large amounts of gaseous carbon dioxide is hazardous to your health and can cause you to lose consciousness.


Working in room with good ventilation or an open window can prevent a dangerous buildup of gas and keep you safe.

, Dry ice sublimates relatively quickly, but its shelf life can be extended by storing it an insulated container such as a Styrofoam cooler.Make sure the container is not airtight to prevent the buildup of carbon dioxide gas.


Too much gas in an airtight container can lead to an explosion.

, The warmer the dry ice gets, the faster it sublimates. To dispose of it, you can either leave it open to the air in a warm area or pour warm water over it until it is gone.Do not leave children unattended around dry ice.

Determine the color and texture.,
Compare your findings to an igneous rock chart.,
Visit a museum or park.",How to Learn About Igneous Rocks2," When you pick up a rock, examine the color of the rock. Is it light? Is it dark? Is it a mixture of colors? Once you identify the color, begin to examine the texture.


If you can see the crystals, you most likely have a coarse-grained/phaneritic rock.
If there are no crystals, you may have a glassy texture rock or a pyroclastic rock.
If you notice big crystals and small crystals, you may have a porphyritic texture.
Take notes as you examine the rock to help you identify it.

, There are many rock charts available online.Type ""igneous rock chart"" into your search engine to find one. Find the intersection on the chart where the texture and mineral composition meet.


For example, a light colored, coarse-grained rock may be granite.
A glassy looking, dark colored rock may be obsidian.
A dark, fine-grained rock may be basalt.

, The best way to learn about igneous rocks is to touch them in person. This will help you identify texture and color. Visit museums that have geology exhibits. Many national parks also provide opportunities to learn about rocks.


The National Park Service website maintains a list and allows you to find a park in your state.You can also order an igneous rock collection online or from a local science store.
If you are unable to visit a park or order a rock collection, look up pictures of the rocks online or in a book so that you can see the differences in color and texture.

Examine the texture of the rock.,
Examine the chemical composition.,
Know the four classifications of igneous rock.",How to Learn About Igneous Rocks3," Texture describes the way a rock looks. Grain size is the main texture you look for when classifying igneous rock. Grain size is the size of the individual mineral crystals in the rock.Coarse-grained (phaneritic) describes rocks with large crystals. Most intrusive rocks are considered coarse-grained because of their large crystals.
Fine-grained (aphanitic) describes rocks with crystals that are too small to see with the naked eye. Most extrusive rocks are considered fine-grained rocks.
Rocks that cool quickly may have trapped bubbles of gas called vesicles. The texture of these rocks is vesicular.
Porphyritic texture rocks have both fine-grained and coarse-grained crystals., You can examine the chemical composition of a rock just by looking at it. Minerals vary in color, and the color tells you what chemicals are in the rock. The most common chemicals are silica, iron, and magnesium.Light colored minerals (often called felsic) have more silica in them and are often white, gray, pink, or colorless.
Dark-colored minerals (often called mafic) have more iron and magnesium in them are usually black, brown, dark gray, or green.

, Igneous rock can be classified as felsic, intermediate, mafic, and ultramafic. These classifications apply to both extrusive and intrusive rocks.Felsic rocks are the lightest, and ultramafic rocks are the darkest.Felsic rocks have the highest silica content (65% +). Common examples of felsic rocks are rhyolite (extrusive rock) and granite (intrusive rock).
Intermediate rocks have about 55-65% silica content and are a little darker than felsic rocks. Common examples of intermediate rocks are andesite/dacite (extrusive rock) and diorite/granodiorite (intrusive rock).
Mafic rocks are low in silica (45-55%) and are dark in color. Common examples of mafic rocks are basalt (extrusive rock) and gabbro (intrusive rock).
Ultramafic rocks have the lowest silica content (less than 45%) and may have a green tint. Common examples of ultramafic rocks are peridotite (intrusive rock) and komatiite (extrusive rock).

Get your supplies.,
Heat the white and milk chocolate chips.,
Blend the melted chips.,
Pour the liquid onto the baking sheet.,
Break up the cooled chocolate.",How to Learn About Igneous Rocks4," You can use food to learn about how igneous rocks are formed. Remember that these rocks are formed when magma cools and forms crystals. You can use food items to simulate this process. You may need a parent to help you.The supplies you need include:A bag of white chocolate chips
A bag of milk chocolate chips
A piece of wax paper
A cookie sheet
A spoon
A microwave safe bowl
A microwave

, Place the chips in a microwave safe bowl and notice how different they look. Each of these pieces represents the individual minerals in a rock. Heat the chips until they melt.


The chips melting is similar to the earth melting the rock.

, Once the chips have been heated, use your spoon to blend the chips together. Stir until you cannot see the individual chips anymore. This liquid mixture represents magma.


When the earth melts the rock and forms magma, the individual minerals of the rock cannot be seen anymore. They blend together, just like the chocolate chips.

, Place a piece of wax paper on the cookie sheet, and pour the melted mixture onto the sheet. This represents that magma coming out of the earth as lava. As the meted chocolate cools, it will become hard. This is the same way that magma turns into igneous rock.When magma cools, it forms igneous rock.
Allow the chocolate to cool and do not touch it.

, Once the chocolate has cooled on the sheet, break it and notice what it has become. The white and milk chocolate chips have formed a new piece of chocolate that looks completely different from the original pieces of chocolate.When magma cools, the rock becomes a new igneous rock.

Wear protective gloves when handling dry ice.,
Use certified food grade dry ice.,
Put a piece of cardboard or newspaper between the dry ice and the food.,
Know the proper placement of dry ice in a freezer or refrigerator.,
Use containers with loose lids that are not airtight.",How to Handle Dry Ice2," Dry ice is very cold and should never be handled directly. Protective, insulated or leather gloves should be worn while handling the ice. An oven mitt or towel is also sufficient to protect your skin.Prolonged direct contact to dry ice can freeze your skin cells and cause an injury similar to a burn.If possible, use tongs to transfer the dry ice to different locations.

, Dry ice can be obtained in a pellet or block form. During production, the dry ice is in contact with many potential contaminants that can be hazardous to your health.For many applications, these contaminants are not hazardous as the items that are being kept cool will not be consumed.


If you are using the dry ice to keep your food cold, make sure that you get food grade dry ice that is contaminant free.
Food that comes in direct contact with the dry ice is perfectly safe and can be consumed without worry. As dry ice warms up, it turns directly in the gas carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is what gives the fizz to a sodaand is perfectly safe to consume in these small amounts.
Do not put dry ice directly into drinks or food that will be consumed as this can cause severe burns to the mouth and throat., Dry ice is much colder than the temperature of your freezer or refrigerator. If possible, avoid having the food in direct contact with the dry ice, particularly in the refrigerator. Wrapping the dry ice in newspaper also adds an extra layer of insulation that can make the block last longer.Dry ice will freeze any food it comes in direct contact with.

, If you lose power and you don’t want to lose all of the food in your refrigerator, dry ice is the best way to keep your food from spoiling. It is particularly useful if you know you will not have power for a few days. The placement of the dry ice is important: in a freezer, the dry ice should be placed above the food. When using dry ice in the refrigerator, place the block at the bottom of the freezer.Do not put dry ice in a functioning freezer or refrigerator. Because the dry ice is much colder than the temperature of the freezer, the freezer will turn off.Avoid placing dry ice near plastic or glass containers as the dry ice can freeze the container and cause them to crack or break., Frozen carbon dioxide sublimates into a gas, skipping the liquid phase. Dry ice must be contained in a cooler, fridge, or freezer that allows this gas to escape. Storing dry ice in an airtight container can lead to a hazardous buildup of gas and can be an explosion hazard."

, You can use this opportunity to talk with your children about thermal motion and thermal transport mechanisms in fluids and gases. Let them guess what is going on and encourage them to think deeper. Hint: a driving force in the universe is entropy - the tendency to disorder, everything to be dispersed and anti-crystalline.

,, Cut enough off to end up with about 12 in. of stem left. Ask the kids why you chose to cut the stem that way instead of straight across. Clue them in that florists and flower arrangers use this same cutting profile to help the flowers take up water better and, thereby, help their arrangements stay fresher longer.


You can use this opportunity to explain the generalities of the healing or scabbing action whereby a plant seals its wounds to prevent infiltration of disease and pests and loss of food and water. Look up callus, cutin and suberin with the kids if you want to delve into pathogen protection schema of plants.

, The water in the flower will continue to evaporate from the flower in a process called transpiration. As it does so, each water molecule moves to fill an adjacent lower pressure zone and pulls the nearby water molecules up the xylem (dead elongated cells that act like a bundle of drinking straws).

, After a while, you will see that the edges of the flower will change to the color of the food coloring being used.

, As you work your way up the classification system, you will begin to classify these names. The only name that you do not classify is the species name. You would capitalize the genus name, or any classification name above species.


For example, if you were discussing the human race, you would capitalize the genus name, Homo but not the species name, sapiens.







, You should include a species name when you want to be very specific about what you’re naming. No two species have the same official classification name, though a common name may be shared among species.

, Therefore, it’s best to refer to species by their official classification when writing scientific papers and the like.

Stick to one process at a time whenever possible.,
Break down the big picture into sub-processes.,
Decide whether the process is simple enough for a text document.,
Consider making a flowchart.,
Keep it short when possible.,
Include visuals if they help make the process easier to read.,
Refer to people by title, not name.,
Make it clear how processes connect to each other.,
Make documents editable and accessible.,
Label process documents carefully.",How to Document a Process1," Don't try to describe your entire job in one flowchart. A series of short documents that cover each task separately will be much easier to follow.


If you have to document a large-scale process, such as the creation of a company's product from conception to sale, only use simple names to refer to each task within that process. If necessary, use additional documents to explain each task in more detail.;
, Sub-processes are the key tasks that are performed during the process. If you are not intimately familiar with the process you are documenting, interview project managers or other experts in this process to get a good understanding of the tasks involved.


In general, if a step in your document includes more than one verb, or the word ""and,"" it can likely be broken down into two steps. For example, ""Place bun and meat patty on grill"" should be broken down into ""Place meat patty on grill"" and ""Place bun on grill.""

, If your process is similar every time, and involves only a couple of decisions or variations, you might want to simply write out the steps in a list. Use an electronic text document (such as a Microsoft Word file) or a sheet of lined paper.

, A simple flowchart is an easy way to display the process visually, as described in a later section on this page. There are ways to construct more complicated flowcharts as well, but these are not required for most processes. Consider following the instructions in the section on complex flowcharts only if your process has more than ten steps and you have more than three people performing different steps of the process.

, One page is ideal, but even for complicated processes, try to pare it down to 5 pages or fewer. Only specialized and complex tasks should require longer documents, and even then only if the document is being used by the actual people performing them.


For instance, if the document is intended to guide doctors diagnosing cancer, you will likely mention every diagnostic test that can be used. However, if the same process is being documented to present to executives, create a shorter document that leaves out the more detailed steps, such as deciding which setting to use on a particular machine.
Remove adjectives from the names of tasks. These titles should be clear and short. For instance, write ""Send bill to customer,"" not ""Send complete bill for all services to the customer that ordered the product.""

, Some people understand visual representations better than reading text, especially if they are executives, managers, or other people who may not have hands-on experience in the process you are documenting. These can be diagrams, photographs, or screenshots, but keep them simple and clear.


Include diagrams or images on the side only if it is necessary to understand a term in the process document. For example, if the process document requires the reader to identify the difference between two types of machines, provide clear diagrams or images of these machines.
Do not include clip art or other images that are only there for fun.

, The document may outlast an individual. Don't write ""Send meeting minutes to Carol."" Write ""Send meeting minutes to the chairman.""If you think the name is necessary so readers know who to contact, include both the name and the job title.

, For example, a process document for ""Arranging the Newsletter"" might end with a note ""The end result is sent to editing. See the document titled Editing the Newsletter."" The document titled Editing the Newsletter may begin with the note ""This is preceded by Arranging the Newsletter."" and end with ""This is now sent to publication. See the document titled Publishing the Newsletter.""

, Make copies available for people to read or study. Keep an electronic master document in an editable format so changes can be made if necessary.PDF documents are not editable. If you use specialized diagram-creation software, it may have a different, unique file format for saving editable files. Other people will probably need to download or purchase the same software before they can edit that document.
For text-only process documents, use a common file format such as .doc, .docx, .txt, or .rtf. If you anticipate the document changing frequently, use an online file hosting service such as Google Docs so people will always see the latest version.

, Write the date created and the date last edited in an obvious location on each document, such as the top of the page. If multiple people are editing the document, you may wish to put your name or initials next to the last edited date. Finally, include a title and file name that clearly communicates which process is documented.

Learn what “species” means.,
Look up the specific name.,
Use the common name to help you find the species name.",How to Include Species Names in Papers2," In the biological classification system, the classifications go from more general to more specific. “Species” is considered the most basic grouping of biology; members of the same species look like one another and are biologically similar. Also, they can reproduce with one another. For instance, humans belong the kingdom Animalia and more specifically, to the phylum Chordata.


From there, the classifications keeping going down: class Mammalia, subclass Theria, infraclass Eutheria, order Primates, suborder Anthropodia, family Hominidae, genus Homo, and species sapiens. Each category narrows down the members.






For instance, thousands of species belong in the Animalia kingdom, but currently only one living species belongs in the genus homo. Therefore, “genus” is broader than “species.”







, Find a high quality site to help you find the name of the species you are looking up. Sites like Britannica will have that kind of information. Search for the animal or plant by the common name it is normally referred to as.


For instance, to look up the species of your house cat, you’d search for domesticated cat, since they belong to the larger cat family. The species of a house cat is “catus,” while the genus is “Felis.”







, Sometimes, you will have to narrow down to the species name carefully. For instance, “crepe myrtle” refers to the genus Lagerstroemia. The genus has over 50 species in it, so you will have to choose the correct species. However, knowing the common name will help you find the species name.

Create a flowchart to easily explain simple tasks.,
Arrange the flowchart from left to right, or from top to bottom.,
Begin with a circle labeled ""start."",
Draw a rectangle with the name of the first task written inside it.,
Draw an arrow to the next task or question.,
Lead from decision diamonds to tasks depending on answer.",How to Document a Process2," Flowcharts are great for depicting basic information in an easy to read, visual style. They can be used to guide new workers through simple tasks during job training, or to assist a worker who is performing a task temporarily due to a coworker's absence.

, When making a flowchart, you'll write a box for each task within the process, and connect them with arrows to show which order you perform these tasks. Start at the left-hand side or the top of the page, just as you would when writing. Sequencing the steps in this order makes it easy to tell at a glance which to follow.


If you are working in a language with a different direction of writing than English, use that direction instead. For instance, a flowchart written in Arabic moves from right to left.
Use arrows to make the direction clear. Don't just draw lines without arrows between the tasks.

, If your flowchart is small enough to fit in one row or column, you may not need this circle. For more complicated flowcharts, having an obvious circle labeled ""start"" is useful.

, Draw an arrow pointing from the ""start"" circle to a box with the first task inside it. For instance, ""take customer's order.""

, This arrow points to the next box, with the second task written inside it. If there is a decision to make or a question to answer before the second task can be performed, write the question inside a diamond instead.


Use a different color for the diamond than the boxes, if possible.

, For example, say the box with the task ""Take customer's order"" leads to a diamond, with the question ""was water ordered?"" Draw two arrows leaving the diamond. On one arrow, write ""yes"" or ""y"" and lead to a box labeled ""give customer water."" On the second arrow, write ""no"" or ""n"" and lead to a box labeled ""give order to cook.""

Use this for complex processes that involve multiple people or departments.,
Consider using software.,
List each participant in a neat column on the left side of page.,
Start with the first task.,
Continue as you would a normal flowchart, but keep tasks moving to the right and placed in the appropriate row.,
Learn how to use diamonds and circles.,
Stay consistent.,
If necessary, move to another page.,
Edit the flowchart.",How to Document a Process3," If you are documenting a complicated process that involves several people, teams, or departments working independent, consider making a complex flowchart. The type of flowchart described here is called a ""swim lane chart"" or ""Rummler-Brache chart.""The chart makes it easy to see who is responsible for each task, and helps identify areas where the process could be improved.


The flowchart should describe the process as it is currently done, not how it should be done.

, The flowchart will probably end up looking tidier and more readable if you use software for creating diagrams. Having an electronic file also makes it easier to make changes to the flowchart as needed. Search online for ""process mapping software,"" making sure to download or purchase one that can create Rummler-Brache charts.

, Each row can be labeled with a department, team, or the job title of individual. Each participant is responsible for tasks located in his horizontal row, extending across the page. This is sometimes called that participant's ""swim lane.""


The lanes may be color-coded or not. They should always be divided by bold, black lines to make the chart easily readable by color-blind people.
Try to put groups that interact with each other adjacent to each other. This is not mandatory, however.

, Begin the process by placing the first task in a box near the left hand side of the page, just to the right of the participant responsible for that task. For example, if the Research division starts the process by creating a product idea, draw a box just to the right of the word ""Research"" and label it Create product idea.

, For example, if Research then sends its product idea to Marketing for focus testing, draw an arrow from Create product idea to a box in the Marketing row, to the right of the previous box. Label this box Focus testing.


Sometimes, a task might be repeated, for instance the product might later return for additional focus testing. If the process actually returns to the same earlier stage, draw an arrow back to the original box labeled Focus testing. If the process is actually different (for instance, this is a more advanced round of focus testing leading to different tasks), write a new box instead with a different name, such as Advanced Focus Testing.

, Most flow charts use boxes, diamonds, and circles, plus arrows between them. You've already encountered the box, which is labeled with the name of a task. Use a diamond when there are multiple possible results. Use circles when an end result has been achieved. Continuing the above example, draw an arrow from Focus testing to a diamond labeled Is product approved? Draw one arrow from the diamond, labeling it no, and connect it to a circle labeled End of process. A second arrow, labeled yes can lead to the next task in the process.


Place the diamond in the row or ""swim lane"" of the participant who is responsible for that decision.
The circle labeled End of process should be in its own row, with no associated participant.
There are many other specialized flowchart symbols, but they are rarely used and not typically necessary. Feel free to research them yourself if you feel your document would benefit from a greater variety., Use similar sized boxes and no more than two or three easily distinguished colors, to make the flowchart as readable as possible. For instance, all boxes (tasks) can have blue backgrounds, while all the diamonds (questions) can be yellow.


If possible, have the ""yes"" answer line always start from one side of the box (e.g. the right side, and the ""no"" always in another (e.g. the bottom side).This is not always possible or easy to achieve, so don't spend too much time on it.

, It's better to use multiple pages than to make the flowchart too small to read. Use clearly labeled tabs or arrows to make it clear how the flowchart continues. For instance, draw an arrow labeled A leading off the right-hand side of the page. On the next page, draw an arrow leading from the left-hand side of the page, also labeled A.

, Follow each possible ""route"" through the flowchart and see if it makes sense. Ideally, have someone else familiar with the process go through it with you to catch mistakes and identify missing steps. Once you have looked over it at least once and corrected any mistakes, the document is ready to present or send to other people involved. However, feel free to edit this flowchart if the process changes at a later date, sending the updated document to the people who use it.

Identify areas where quality overview might be useful.,
Look for duplicate tasks.,
Look for unnecessary movement between departments.",How to Document a Process4," Each time the process moves from one person or team to another, consider whether someone should examine the work in progress to see if it is ready to continue. Is quality often sub-par after a specific step, such as a step usually performed by an inexperienced team member? Which processes have the highest overall effect on quality, and might need extra attention?


If you do decide to recommend a quality review step in this process, make the criteria for ""advancement"" to the next stage clear. Don't leave people guessing what quality standards are in use.

, If your diagram or document contains two identical tasks, consider whether this is useful or inefficient. Sometimes, it's good to repeat a task for better quality control (for instance, two departments inspecting a product at different stages). However, simple tasks such as proofreading shouldn't occur more than once in the process. Suggest that one of the duplicate steps be removed from the process procedure.

, Your document might show that person A and person B transfers responsibility for the process back and forth several times. Is it possible to reduce the amount of unnecessary transfers? If you can reorganize the process, person A might be able to do several tasks in one period, then hand it to person B.

Define a scientific law.,
Provide examples of laws.,
Define a scientific theory.,
Provide an example of scientific theory.","How to Explain the Difference Between Theory, Law, and a Fact1"," Understanding law is fundamental to understanding scientific terminology: a scientific law is a statement, based on repeated long-term observation, which describes any phenomena of nature.Laws have never been refuted (hence their relatively small number) and are not explanations; they are descriptions and are often stated through relatively simple mathematical equations.
Scientific laws, despite their formality, can change or have exceptions as scientific understandings of phenomena evolve.;
, Helping someone understand scientific law—an admittedly abstract concept—will allow them to differentiate between theory and fact. In many ways, laws are a starting place; they are often observed and have never been refuted, but do not explain why something occurs.A common example is the Law of Evolution: this law describes a phenomenon that has been observed throughout nature, but the law does not explain why evolution occurs.
As another example, the Law of Gravity has been known in the scientific community since the late 17th century. The law describes the natural phenomenon of gravity, but does not provide an explanation as to how and why gravity functions.

, Scientifically speaking, a theory is a rational explanation of why an aspect of our world functions in a certain way. The definition of a theory will incorporate facts and laws, although the three are fundamentally separate.A theory builds from initial hypotheses (educated guesses) and can be revised in accordance with the development of a scientific understanding of a phenomena’s cause.
A theory is confirmed by all available evidence such that it can be used to predict new, as yet unobserved phenomena.

, This will help clarify your point and make a clearer explanation. The theory is used to explain an occurrence, while the law describes a phenomenon under specific circumstances in nature.


For example, the scientific Theory of Natural Selection corresponds with the Law of Evolution.While the law states an observed natural phenomena (life forms develop new characteristics based on external circumstances), the theory describes how and why this happens.

Understand science experiments.,
Create patterns in milk.,
Create a bouncing egg.,
Grow Salt Crystals.,
Make Oobleck.,
Get more ideas.",How to Do Science Experiments1," Any of the projects below can be used as fun demonstrations that can be explained by science. If you want to turn them into actual science experiments that test an idea, follow the included advice to try out several versions of them, record your results, and try to figure out how they work.


You can find out more about the process in the experiment section below.;
, Pour milk into a bowl. Squeeze a drop each of different colored food coloring onto the milk without stirring. Dip a cotton bud into liquid dishwashing soap, and touch the end of the cotton bud onto the surface of the milk. Watch what happens to the colors.


Turn this into an experiment by adding additional soap, one cotton bud at a time. At what point does the color become stable?

, Leave an egg in a jar of white vinegar for a full week. Put on gloves before handling it, then remove it and try bouncing it gently outside. To turn this into an experiment, soak a dozen eggs in separate jars of vinegar. Every day, take out one egg and try to bounce it outside. Drop it from one inch high (2.5 cm), then two inches (5 cm), and so on, until the egg breaks. Record how much ""bouncier"" the eggs get as they are left in vinegar.


For another experiment, boil the eggs for different amounts of time before letting them cool and putting them in vinegar. Label each jar with the number of seconds the egg inside was boiled.

, Mix salt or sugar into a jar of hot water, then suspend a string in the water by tying it to a pencil resting over the jar. Leave the jar alone for a couple days, and see what happens.


To turn this into an experiment, fill several jars, and use a different type of salt or sugar in each. Find out how table salt, sea salt, rock salt, Epsom salts, white sugar, powdered sugar, and brown sugar change the crystal growth pattern.

, Mix one spoonful of water into two spoonfuls of corn starch, then try to pick it up with your hands. This bizarre material, named after a Dr. Suess book, doesn't act like a liquid or a solid. Finding out more about these ""non-Newtonian fluids"" can require advanced math, but you might be able to figure out some of the ""rules"" that describe how it behaves.

, There are countless fun experiments you can do in your house or backyard. Look through wikiHow's Science for Kids category for a ton of ideas.

Define a scientific fact.,
Provide examples of scientific facts.,
Clarify the distinction between scientific laws and facts.,
Clear up any common misconceptions.","How to Explain the Difference Between Theory, Law, and a Fact2"," In scientific terminology, a fact is an observation that has been repeatedly observed and is accepted as practically functional and “correct.”While facts can be scientifically refuted or may not be consistent across time and place, they are held as true until they have been proven wrong.

, As you explain this concept, focus especially from separating fact from law, since both describe natural phenomena, albeit in different ways.


When explaining a scientific fact, start with a point of general observation.
For example, begin your explanation by saying something like, “it is always bright outside at noon.” This is a fact in that it describes a state of nature—however, this statement may not be true in Antarctica or Greenland, where darkness lasts throughout the day in certain seasons.
Explain how this will lead to a revision of the scientific fact: “within certain degrees of latitude, it is always bright outside at noon.”

, Facts are often the initial building blocks of scientific inquiry; they can generate curiosity and the hypotheses that come from inquiry and experimentation.Facts are less formal than laws, and are not seen as an “official” definition of a phenomenon that occurs or of the reason that something happens.
Facts are more localized and generalize less than laws. Explain that, if the Law of Evolution describes the way that species throughout the world evolve over time, a scientific fact related to evolution (and natural selection) could be: “giraffes with long necks can reach more leaves than giraffes with short necks.”

, Many students and adults hold to misunderstandings of scientific vocabulary and misunderstand the relationship of theories, laws, and facts.


For example, scientific theories do not develop into scientific laws. To explain the difference, focus on this distinction: laws describe phenomena, while theories explain phenomena.

Ask your students to define some scientific theories.,
Ask the students to name some scientific theories.,
Define a scientific fact for your students.,
Clarify that theories can never be transformed into a fact; the two are fundamentally different.,
Define a scientific law.,
Discuss how theories are made and evolve.","How to Explain the Difference Between Theory, Law, and a Fact3"," You can build from their own understandings to develop a more sophisticated definition of “theory.” A good definition should clarify that a scientific theory is a statement intending to explain natural phenomena. Clarify to your students:


A theory is worth very little if it doesn't correctly predict all known evidence.
Theories are subject to changes as new evidence becomes available. (Most theories that you will discuss in a high school science class are well-confirmed and are unlikely to be revised in any significant sense.)

, You will get some common answers like:


The theory of relativity: that the laws of physics are the same for all observers
The theory of evolution by natural selection: that the observed changes in species occur due to selection of well adapted specimens over less well adapted specimens.
Big Bang theory: that the universe began as an infinitely small point that underwent expansion to form the universe as we know it today.

, A fact is an objective, verifiable observation, which is the same everywhere. It can be, and has been, verified many times.


For example, we know that the germ theory of illness is a fact because we can take bacteria from someone suffering from an illness, look at that bacteria under a microscope, and then inject that bacteria into another individual, who will then get that same illness.
We know that the Earth is round because we can travel due west and eventually end up where we started from.

, Remember, a theory is a general statement intended to explain facts. As a useful example, present your students with the development of the theory of the heliocentric theory and the facts that inform the theory.


Ancient peoples noticed peculiar points of light that “wandered” among their background. (We now know these to be the planets.)
The planets moved through the sky because they, like the Earth, were orbiting around the sun, each at different speeds, different distances from the Sun.
Nicolaus Copernicus is generally considered to be the first to propose this theory, and supported his theory with hard evidence, but ancient cultures stumbled upon this through speculation.
We now consider this a fact because we have sent many craft to these planets and can predict their motions to a very high precision. Of course, our predictions come from the theory (and the laws underlying that theory).

, This is a complicated concept and tends to confuse students. Laws tend to be more mathematical in nature and are usually derived from simple statements about mathematical systems and their behaviors. Explain that, like a theory, a law can also be used to make predictions, but the primary purpose of a law is to describe natural phenomena. Some scientific laws include:


Newton's Law of heating and cooling: the change in temperature of two bodies in thermal contact is proportional to their difference in temperature.
Newton's Laws of motion: statements about how large objects made of atoms behave when moving at low speeds relative to each other.
The Laws of Thermodynamics: statements about entropy, temperature, and thermal equilibrium.
Ohm's Law: the voltage across a purely resistive element is equal to the current through the element times its resistance.

, First, a theory is constructed from facts; fact precede and inform a theory. Secondly, theories contain laws, but laws mean very little without supportive facts. Theories also contain logical inferences.


For example, one must infer that the derived laws actually predict the facts. Accumulating all of the previous forms of knowledge, a scientist makes a general statement to explain all the evidence.
Other scientists reaffirm the facts and use the theory to make predictions and obtain new facts.

Ask a scientific question.,

Write down what you think will happen.,
Stay safe.,
Set up the experiment.,
Set up a chart for data.,
Include a comments section.,
Conduct your test.,
Make a graph (optional).,
Think about the result.,
Write about problems or new ideas that came up.,
Turn it all into a display (optional).",How to Do Science Experiments2," Come up with a question that can be tested with a science experiment. Try to choose a topic related to the science you are learning in class, and that you're interested in. Your parents and teacher can help you choose a topic, or you can get ideas from the examples above. You could also try searching science experiment websites such as ScienceBob.


For the examples in this section, we'll start with the question ""How do earthworms respond to music?""

, The most important thing to remember is that you can only change one thing during your experiment. If you change more than one thing at a time, you won't know which change was responsible for your results. Choose something that you can control, not something that will change when you don't want it to.


For example, design an experiment where you keep earthworms in a box of dirt, and play several different kinds of music to them, such as classical music, jazz music, and rock music. Keep the container type, volume of the music, and type of dirt the same each time, so you are only testing one thing.

, This prediction is called a hypothesis. Make a prediction that will be tested by the experiment, and come up with a clear answer. Include the reasons you think your prediction is accurate.


Good example hypothesis: ""I think that more worms will come to the surface when rock music is played, than when classical music or jazz music is played. The rock music is louder, so more worms might try to get away from it.""
Bad example hypothesis: ""I think the worms will react more to the rock music."" This doesn't explain what ""react"" means, so it will be hard to see whether the hypothesis is correct. It also doesn't explain why the experimenter thinks this is true.

, If your experiment involves dangerous liquids, fire, electricity, or sharp objects, ask an adult for help. Safety goggles and gloves are recommended for some of these experiments.


You do not need any safety equipment for the example worm experiment.

, Gather all your materials and decide exactly how each step is going to happen. Write down all the details involved, even if they don't seem important.


For example, write down or sketch the position of the music source and the box, the volume setting, how many worms are in the box, and what exact music tracks you'll be using.

, You'll need to record your experiment in detail while it happens. Draw a grid and label each column with a different measurement. Here are some example columns for the worm experiment:


Test number (this just gives you an easy way to refer to each test)
Type of music played
Number of worms at the surface before music began
Number of worms at the surface after 10 seconds
Number of worms at the surface after 20 seconds (and so on up to 60 seconds)

, If you have enough paper, you can include a ""Comments"" section on your chart. You can also write this on a separate page. This just gives you a chance to mention anything unusual that affected your experiment, such as ""Five worms escaped the box after experiment four. I covered the hole in the box with cardboard, then put five new worms in the box.""

, Start the experiment, recording all the data in your chart as it happens. It's a good idea to repeat each test at least three times, so you get a more accurate idea of what's happening. For example:


Play classical music to the worms for 60 seconds, timing it with a stopwatch and recording your data. Repeat this experiment three times, waiting for five minutes of silence in between each experiment.
Repeat using jazz music and rock music three times each.

, Most science experiments end up with data that can be turned into a bar graph or line graph. This makes it easier to read your results, and is often required for school projects.


For instance, draw a line graph with ""# of Seconds Music was Played"" as the x-axis, and ""# of Worms at Surface"" as the y-axis. Draw one graph for each type of music, using three lines on each to represent the three trials with that music.

, Write a conclusion that answers these questions: Was your hypothesis correct? What happened that didn't match your hypothesis? Why do you think it might have happened?

, Scientists include information that would help the next experimenter do a better job, or discover a new question to answer. Identifying ""problems"" doesn't mean you failed. It just shows that your experiment taught you more about the project, and that you could do a better one now if you decided to try. For example:


If worms escaped your box, explain what type of container could be used instead.
If someone wanted to be able to tell whether worms were burrowing downward, he could use a clear, glass container.
Experimenting with one type of music at different volumes could help find out whether that's more important than the type of music.

, If you're doing a science fair project, you'll usually make a large display on a piece of poster board. Print or write the details of your experiment in large text, and include labeled images and charts.


Your science teacher might have special requirements not listed here, so be sure to ask her for details.

Find a quiet place to study.,
Study in blocks of time.,
Take clear, organized notes.,
Reread your notes after class.,
Refer to multiple sources.,
Learn the reasons behind the facts.,
Become familiar with the metric system.,
Think about teaching someone else.,
Learn your own best study skills.",How to Do Well in Science Class1," You’ll need to have a place where you can study that is free of disruptions and interruptions. This might be in your bedroom, in a library, or in another room. You’ll have to be honest with yourself about what your own needs are.For example, if you’re distracted by looking out the window, move your work area so that you can’t see outside from where you work.
Wear headphones over your ears if you need to to keep you from being distracted by ambient sound.
Some people benefit from using a fan facing the wall to generate white noise. This prevents distraction from random sounds.;
, Sitting and studying for unlimited lengths of time will lead to boredom and distractibility. Instead, study in blocks, interrupted by short breaks where you stand up and move around away from your study area.You might set a timer to help you remember to take a break after 45-60 minutes.
Then, set another timer to remind you to return to your desk. Usually a break of 10 minutes is a good break.

, The notes you take in class will help you know what to study between classes. Don’t try to write down everything that the teacher says. Instead, pay careful attention to any information your teacher suggests is likely to be included on tests.Having help with taking notes is an accommodation many schools are able to make for learning disabilities. If you need this accommodation, check with your school’s office of academic accessibility.
It may help you to record your lecture classes. Most smartphones have built-in voice recorders, or you can download a recording app. Recording a lecture will allow you to go back and hear it again.

, If there’s anything in your notes that confuses you, or which you feel might be wrong, check with your teacher or a classmate to ensure you have the right information.If you wait too long to read your notes, you may not remember enough of the class to make sense of them
It may help you to rewrite your notes in a more condensed way. This tests your comprehension of the material in a way that ensures you’ve really grasped the meaning.

, When you’re studying your notes, refer not only to the textbooks you’ve been given, but use internet searches to supplement your understanding. Sometimes your subject matter will be better explained by another source. For example, Khan Academy is a good source for many scientific topics.You can use these sources to supplement your work.
Using visual information, graphics, videos or other media can help you understand the lectures.
If the resources that you find provide information that contradicts the science you’ve learned in class, make careful notes and ask your teacher. This might provide the basis for additional discussion.

, Science might seem like a lot of facts, but each fact was found out by someone’s trying to answer the question “Why?” Learning how things fit together will help you make sense of the facts you’re learning in science class.For example, if you imagine a cannon firing, you may be able to better remember Newton’s Third Law: “For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.” But what does this mean?
A cannon, being larger than a cannonball, pushes the ball a great distance when it’s fired. But at the same time, the ball exerts its own force on the cannon, so the cannon will will also be pushed back few inches in the opposite direction. This is an example Newton’s Third Law.

, A lot of science is done using the metric system, since this is the system most commonly used internationally. The metric system is based on units of 10, and is used to measure length, mass and time.For instance, 10 millimeters make a centimeter, 10 centimeters make a decimeter, 10 decimeters make a meter, which is the base unit of length in the metric system.
The system that most Americans use is called the Imperial system, but even American scientists use the metric system at work.

, When you think you understand the material, try to explain it to someone else. Teaching another person is the best way of knowing for sure whether or not you really understand the material you’ve been studying. If you can test your knowledge on a friend or family member, this will help you assess your own knowledge.It can help to imagine the kinds of questions you might ask if you were the professor.
Try finding new examples for the information you’ve learned based in your own experience or knowledge.

, Each person has slightly different techniques for effective studying. Your own study skills might include using (and creating) flash cards, or making stories out of the information you’ve been given. You might write your own songs to help you remember salient facts and details.If you study best with a group, form a study group with others in your class. Be careful not to use this group for socializing, but as an effective learning time.
If you study best alone, make sure that you’re able to remain focused on your work without getting distracted by other activities.

Understand atoms.,
Understand molecules.,
Understand moles.,
Understand chemical compounds.,
Understand atomic mass.,
Understand molecular mass.,
List the elements in the compound.,
Write down the atomic mass of each individual element.,
Find the mass contribution of each element in your compound.,
Calculate the total molecular mass of your compound.,
Find the mass percent composition.",How to Find Mass Percent," Atoms are basic units of matter, composed of protons, neutrons, and electrons. These are the fundamental building blocks of everything around you.;
, Molecules are electrically neutral chemical groups of two or more atoms, which are held together by chemical bonds.


Water, for example, is made of the molecule H2O. Each water molecule is composed of two hydrogen atoms, which are chemically bonded to one oxygen atom.

, A mole is a unit of measurement used to express the amount of a chemical substance in a sample. It is defined as the amount of any substance that contains 6.02 x10^ 23 elementary entities. Use moles as a way to concisely express amounts of chemical substances.


6.02 x 10^23, which is approximately the number of carbon atoms in 12 grams (0.42 oz) of pure carbon, is also called “Avogadro’s Number.”

, Chemical compounds are pure chemical substances that consist of two or more chemical elements.


Water, made up of the molecule H2O, is a chemical compound.

, Atomic mass is the mass of an atomic particle, sub-atomic particle, or molecule. It is expressed in grams per mole (g/mol).


Note that atomic mass is different from atomic weight and specifically refers to the total mass of the particle, subatomic particle, or molecule at rest.

, Molecular mass is the mass of a single molecule. In other words, it is the total mass of all of the individual atoms that make up a given molecule.


As with atomic mass, molecular mass differs from molecular weight.

,


For example, say you need to calculate the mass percent of citric acid, C6H8O7, as shown in the picture. The elements of this compound are carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and oxygen (O).

, Use the periodic table to locate these numbers. It is usually located just below the atomic symbol, in the units of g/mol.


In the example above, you would note that the atomic mass of carbon is 12.01 g/mol, the atomic mass of hydrogen is 1.00 g/mol, and the atomic mass of oxygen is 15.99 g/mol.

, The mass contribution of an element in a compound is the atomic mass of the element multiplied by the number of atoms in the element in a single molecule of the compound. The numeric subscript after each atomic symbol signifies the number of atoms of that element in the compound.


In the example above, recall that each molecule of your compound is made up of 6 atoms of carbon, 8 atoms of hydrogen, and 7 atoms of oxygen. Therefore, you would calculate the mass contribution of the elements as shown in the picture.
Mass contribution of carbon: 6 x 12.01 g/mol = 72.06 g/mol
Mass contribution of hydrogen: 8 x 1.00 g/mol = 8.00 g/mol
Mass contribution of oxygen: 7 x 15.99 g/mol = 111.93 g/mol

, Total molecular mass of a compound is expressed as a sum of the mass contributions of the individual elements in the compound. It represents the mass of a single molecule.


In the example above, calculate your total molecular mass as follows:
Molecular mass of C6H8O7 = 72.06 g/mol + 8.00 g/mol + 111.93 g/mol = 191.99 g/mol

, The mass percent composition of an element is expressed as a ratio of mass contribution of the element and total molecular mass of the compound multiplied by 100%.


In the example above, calculate your mass percent of each element as shown in the photo. You can therefore conclude that C6H8O7 consists of 37.53% carbon, 4.16% hydrogen, and 58.29% oxygen.

Read the assigned material.,
Join in to the best of your ability.,
Pay attention to any recommended reading.,
Pay attention to demonstrations.,
Practice good test-taking skills.",How to Do Well in Science Class2," When your teacher assigns reading from a textbook or website, take time to read it before you come to class. If you don’t have time to read it well, it’s a good idea to scan it so that you have an idea what it’s about.Even if you don’t know exactly what the professor will talk about during the class, you can at least know the general discussion that’s likely to take place.
Many teachers will go over the same material you were assigned as the discussion in class. This means if you’ve read the assignment, you’ll be prepared to answer questions and engage in discussion.

, It’s likely that your grade will be based partially on your ability to participate in class. This means that even if you are a quiet introvert, it will be important to find ways to participate in the overall class activity.Rephrase what other people are saying to make sure that you’ve understood their meaning.
Ask questions when you don’t understand what’s being said.
When someone asks a question to which you know the answer, raise your hand to reply.
If you’re working within a small group, be an active listener. Pay attention to other students, and share your thoughts with them without dominating or demanding that they always do what you want.

, If your instructor makes materials available online, or recommends certain videos or websites, take advantage of these resources when you prepare for your labs. Many teachers provide online notes, review sheets, or other information for their students’ review.


Always read these notes prior to class. Bring them to class with you when you come, and refer to them during class discussions.
If your teacher uses a particular image multiple times, try to get a copy of that image and label it so that you can better understand it.

, Science classes often have demonstrations done by the teacher or other students which you’re expected to be able to replicate. If you’re going to do well in science, it’s a good idea to pay close attention to any demonstration that’s done in class.Make sure your view of the demonstration isn’t blocked by someone else. Adjust your seating if you can, in order to see. If you need to stand up or move to another seat, ask your teacher for permission.
Sometimes demonstrations can provoke laughter or excitement. Be careful not to get carried away in the thrill of a good demonstration.

, When you take a science test, you’ll want to make sure you’ve correctly interpreted each problem before solving it. Draw a picture or a diagram if you need to. Then, when you’ve answered the question, check to see if your answer makes sense given the parameters of the question. If not, reconsider your approach.It can help to restate the problem in your own words so that you can be sure you really understand what’s being asked.
Double-check your work for accuracy before you turn it in, and make sure your writing is legible.

Be prepared for the lab.,
Learn to write a report.,
Keep a laboratory notebook.,
Bring all necessary materials to your lab.,
Work effectively with others.",How to Do Well in Science Class3," Many science classes include labs, which are demonstrations of techniques you’ve learned about in your textbook or lectures. Your teacher will expect you to show up ready to start your lab.Labs are usually scheduled at a separate time from the course. They may be in a different room or building from the lecture portion of the course.
In the labs, you’ll be expected to do hands-on work to practice the material you’re expected to learn.

, Labs taught at the college level will usually require written reports. While the specific method of presentation may vary according to your teacher’s methodology, you can expect your report to include: title, abstract, introduction, materials and methods, results, discussion, references and literature cited.The report must be typed, using the citation format that your instructor requires.
The purpose of the report is to persuade others to accept or reject your own hypothesis. Your report will do this by showing the data you found through your research, and your interpretation of the data.

, This notebook should be a bound journal, not looseleaf, with numbered pages that are never removed or torn out. It is a permanent record of the observations you make in your lab. You’ll write your lab report based on records you’ve kept in your notebook.


Don’t use your lab notebook to keep notes of your classwork, lectures, or other study materials.
Your lab notebook should be marked with your name, phone number, email address or other contact information in case it’s ever lost. Make sure to mark this information on the front cover in permanent ink.

, In addition to your lab notebook, you’ll need sharp pencils, a blank pen, a calculator, and other materials as your instructor requests. Dressing appropriately will also be important for your success in labs. Wear clean, comfortable clothes. Because you’ll be standing during a lot of your lab class, it’s a good idea to wear comfortable shoes.Your lab may require safety goggles, gloves to cover your hands, acid-proof aprons or other safety clothing.
Closed-toe shoes might be required for certain labs. It’s usually a good idea to avoid sandals, flip-flops, and other open-toe shoes.
Wearing long pants might be required for some labs.

, Many times, lab experiments are meant to be done by a group of 2 or more students. This means that you probably won’t have time to do the whole experiment on your own, and will need to rely on the group’s efforts.


You’ll need to be aware of the results of what others have done in the process, even if you didn’t do it yourself.
Part of the learning process in a lab is to learn to work effectively in a group.

Gather your materials.,
Boil a pot of water.,
Place the spoons in the water.,
Place butter on the spoons.,
Wait a few minutes and check the butter.",How to Do a Simple Heat Conduction Experiment1," You’ll need a cooking pot, a stick of butter, and three types of spoons. The spoons you need are a wooden stirring spoon, a plastic cooking spoon, and a regular metal spoon. You need to get spoons that are relatively long. If you put the spoon in the pot the handle should be coming out of the pot by about three or four inches.
If you want a precise measurement for heat conduction you can also use thermometers. In that case you’ll need three thermometers and electrical tape.;
, Fill a regular cooking pot about halfway full with water and place it on a normal stove burner. Boil water the same way you would if you were going to make spaghetti or pasta.

, Take each of your three types of spoons and lay them in the water handle down. The bowl portion of the spoon should be comfortably out of the water. You can place the spoons next to each other or facing away from each other. The bowl portion of the spoon will be at a diagonal. Try to make that diagonal as close to horizontal as possible by leaning the end of the handle that is in the water up against the side of the pot.


If you are using thermometers to measure the heat conduction tape the thermometers to each of the spoons before you put them in the water.

, Cut three slices of butter. You should cut them about a quarter inch each, but it isn’t that important. Now place one slice in each of the spoons. Make sure they don’t slide into the water. Be careful not to touch the metal spoon as you place the butter on it.

, After about two minutes, come back and check the butter. You’ll notice that the butter on the metal spoon has melted significantly, the butter on the wooden spoon has melted a little bit, and the butter on the plastic spoon has barely melted at all.This is heat conduction at work.


Metal conducts heat better than wood, which conducts heat better than plastic.
If you are using thermometers, check your thermometer readings after a few minutes. The same results will appear with specific numbers.

Gather your materials.,
Hold a balloon over the candle flame.,
Fill a balloon with water.",How to Do a Simple Heat Conduction Experiment2," For this experiment you’ll need regular latex balloons, a candle, and some water. They are some pretty simple materials. Don’t get blown up balloons. Wait until you are doing the experience to put air inside them.

, Light your candle with a match or lighter and then blow up one of your balloons. Blow it up to a decent size, not too small or large. The size doesn’t particularly matter for this experiment. Hold the balloon an inch or two above the candle. Be sure to keep your fingers out of the way. Within ten seconds the balloon will pop.

, Take your second balloon and fill it halfway full with room temperature water. Hold the balloon over the candle flame again. This time you’ll notice that the balloon does not pop. You can even let the candle flame touch the balloon and it won’t pop.


The candle is warming the water rather than popping the balloon. That’s why water isn’t going flying everywhere. The balloon conducts heat and is able to transfer it to the water without damaging the balloon.If you hold the candle to the balloon long enough it will pop, but it will take much longer than a balloon filled without air.

"
"
Gather your materials.,
Use the wax to secure the tacks.,
Turn your Bunsen burner on and secure the rod.,
Watch as the tacks fall off.",How to Do a Simple Heat Conduction Experiment3," For this experiment you’ll need a Bunsen burner, a six inch metal rod, wax, and tacks. Heat resistant gloves might also be useful for this experiment.

, Mold the wax around the tacks so that they will stick to the metal rod. Put one tack every inch along the length of the metal rod. Make sure that they are all on the same side of the rod.


You should have six tacks connected to the metal rod in all.

, Light a match or a lighter and then turn the gas tap on the Bunsen burner to the left to allow gas to release from the spigot. Place the flame over the gas spigot and the Bunsen burner will light. Be careful. Once you’ve lit the Bunsen burner you can secure the metal rod over it. The whole rod doesn’t need to be over the burner, just the outermost inch or so.


If you have heat resistant gloves and no other way to secure the metal rod over the burner, you can hold the rod there. Keep a steady hand.

, As the metal rod conducts heat the tacks closest to the burner will start to fall off. The wax will melt and the tacks will drop off onto the table. Once the final tack falls off you can turn off the Bunsen burner. Be careful not to touch the rod with your bare hands.


This experiment illustrates how metal conducts heat. You can visualize how one end of the metal rod got hot rather than the entire rod heating up at an equal pace. This is based on where the Bunsen burner was placed. If you placed the burner in the middle of the rod, the heat would start in the middle and extend outwards in either direction. "

Make arrangements once a destination or destinations has been decided on.,
Build in some non-beer time.,
Spend some time apart from your friends.,
Take the time to partake in the specialty (beer or otherwise) of the area in which you are traveling.,
Research.",How to Plan a Beer Drinking Trip," Kidding aside, make sure that the individuals that you travel with are of a like spirit and are keen to make the trip one with a focus on beer tasting. It's no fun going on a beer drinking adventure with someone who prefers wine (and lets you know it all the time!).;
, If this trip is somewhere fairly local to you (another state if you are in the US, province if in Canada, or a bordering country in say Europe), try to give yourself at least a couple of months to work out the details. While trips can be taken at the spur of the moment, the chance of disaster or an unmemorable trip is much increased without proper planning.


If the trip is international, try to give yourself at least four months planning time. Between arranging the flight, hotels, brewery tours and incidentals, you will be quite busy and the extra couple of months give you flexibility. A few trip suggestions (these are made-up names, but you get the idea):
The Belgian Experience
Bavarian Highlights
American Hop Tour

, Any fewer and you may spend more time traveling than drinking and enjoying. Any longer and you will probably have had enough by day seven and the enjoyment goes down from there.

, Seek them out, compare what they offer, and decide if you want to be led around or would rather do this on your own.

, Here are a few suggestions:


Unless you can get a fantastic rate from an upscale hotel chain, look for something moderately priced that has breakfast included. Remember, you will only be sleeping there, with the rest of your time spent exploring the wide world of beer.
If you plan a brewery tour, make sure you check with the brewery just prior to your trip. Many breweries will shut down tours to do maintenance or such, but won't announce it openly.
Research any other transport needs at your destination. Whether it's taxicabs, buses or subways, make sure you are aware of their hours (run times) and their customs (how much taxis charge in different locations, for example). If you are traveling to your destination in your own vehicle, check on road closings, tolls, parking, and such.

, Make sure you have some down time in your schedule for non beer related events. Get to know the areas that you are visiting (it creates a more lasting memory) and try to take a little of that home (via photos or souvenirs).

, Always moving in a group can get tedious when not all of the group wants to move. Make sure you plan some days with time to do whatever anyone wants, with a meet-up for say lunch or dinner. A day apart ending with a dinner at a restaurant that specializes in beer-cooked foods is a great way to refresh. It also provides for lively conversation as to what the others did that day.

, A few examples, to help you get the idea:


Belgium - Trappist beer, Lambic beer, chocolate, waffles, and beer-infused dining
United States - Hopped up beers, barley wines, barbecues, hot wings, regional food favorites
Germany - Wheat beers, Bock beers, wursts, pork.

, By knowing as much about your destination as possible, it will make your trip easier and more memorable.

",How to Adopt a Traveling Lifestyle Broke," The territory you are about to embark on comes with its advantages and disadvantages. You will not, NOT, be totally and utterly free however. There is still the law to think about as police don't like homeless travelers. This brings you to your first step: you must have common sense and a decent aptitude to learn new things and know how to behave in social situations.;

, Only the strong at heart can survive this path in life but it ultimately brings peace to those who do it correctly. This brings you to the next step: you must ask yourself, are you running away? If so, what from? What are you tired of? What do you want to do with your life? These are the kind of questions you want to ask.

Start early.,
Create a list.,
Seek expert advice.,
Tie up loose ends.",How to Avoid Pre‐Trip Panic1," The sooner you being preparing for a trip, the less anxiety you should feel as the date draws near. Many people experience pre-trip panic because they want until the last minute to pack and finalize their travel plans. Begin brainstorming ways you can prepare for the trip several weeks or even months ahead (depending on the destination and any special processes you need to complete)., A solid list can help you feel more in control as you prepare for your trip. It’s a good idea to create several lists based on specific categories. You may want to develop a packing checklist to make sure you bring along all the necessities. This may include items like your clothing, toiletries, reading material, and a phone charger.You might also want to create a general to-do list of any tasks you need to complete before the trip like boarding your pet or applying for a passport.

, Hearing about the first-hand experiences of others and knowing what to expect on your trip can minimize any anxiety you experience. Try reading blogs, watching YouTube videos, or browsing books and magazines that relate to your trip.You might peruse topics that relate to the particular destination (e.g. Do you need a visa?) or more general subjects like packing and planning for the trip.

, Your chances of enjoying your trip improve when you depart with your to-do list complete. This is why it’s important to begin planning early on and make thorough lists. That way, you’ll have the extra time to handle any unforeseen responsibilities that arise.For example, if your trip is extended, you may need to pay your bills in advance or arrange for someone to come over and water your plants. If you are taking a work trip, you might need to communicate with your boss about any tasks that need doing during the trip or delegate any ongoing projects to another team member.
Loose ends may also apply to the trip itself, such as confirming reservations or paying deposits for excursions.

Nail down the details, but stay flexible.,
Devise backup plans.,
Figure out how to stay in contact with loved ones.,
Bring along a little bit of home.",How to Avoid Pre‐Trip Panic2," Your panic may be greatly reduced by developing a tentative itinerary for your trip. Knowing what you will be doing and when can help you feel more in control. Plus, having an idea about different events and attractions can help you prepare in terms of clothing choices and/or equipment, too.


Although it’s nice to have a tentative plan for your trip, trying to fill every waking hour can actually cause even more stress. Most trips always include a few surprises, whether bad or good, so it’s smart to remain flexible. Arrange for your travel and hotel, but try to keep everything else flexible to account for any changes you might have to make.
For example, you might lock in activities for the first one or two days to help you feel more in control. Leave your itinerary open for the remainder of the trip, though, to free up space for interesting opportunities that come up during your travels., You can’t possibly anticipate every unexpected element of your trip. However, if you plan for common problems, you’ll feel more at ease. Anticipate typical issues like being bored on the plane or getting sick. Have a plan in place to manage such situations.For instance, you might pack headphones and a tablet to watch movies on the plane. You might bring along over-the-counter meds to fend off minor illnesses, and identify a physician near your hotel for more serious issues.
If you are taking a business trip, you might need to figure out if your tech devices will work for a presentation, or try to rent or borrow a device from someone in your network.

, Feeling isolated from those you love can make a potentially wonderful trip an uphill struggle. Before you leave, pass along the contact info for your accommodations to your closest loved ones.Let family and friends know when you are due to arrive and depart. Arrange for regular calls or Skype meetings to ease any homesickness.

, In addition to keeping in touch with family and friends, it can be comforting to bring a small memento of home along for your trip. Having a little trinket with you can help minimize any anxiety you may feel in a foreign place.Pack something sentimental in your bag like a photograph or a hand-woven quilt that reminds you of home.

Label your fears.,
Focus on the benefits of your trip.,
Repeat a positive mantra.,
Practice deep breathing.,
Perform a visualization exercise.",How to Avoid Pre‐Trip Panic3," The best way to deal with travel anxiety is to pinpoint what it is that you're worried about. Take note of the situations or stimuli that worsen your anxiety symptoms and keep a log. You may be able to avoid certain situations by pre-planning, or you can relieve the anxiety with relaxation techniques.


To spot your triggers, observe your anxiety when you are traveling. Notice what gets you worked up. Is it flying? Traveling to sketchy areas? Or, having to communicate with foreigners?
Keep in mind that the more aware you are of your fears, the easier it will be to make a plan for dealing with the fear when it comes up. Try running your fears by a trusted friend or family member to get an outside perspective and come up with some ideas for dealing with your fears.

, The many details require to plan a successful trip can cause stress and anxiety. Don’t allow yourself to let the planning lessen your excitement about the trip. Regardless if you are traveling for business or pleasure, there are some positives associated with your upcoming trip. Identify these benefits and focus on them instead of all you have to do.For example, if you are preparing for a work conference, you might remind yourself of the wonderful opportunity to expand your professional network.
If planning the trip becomes too overwhelming, then take a break and come back to it. You do not need to plan it all in one sitting.

, Reciting affirmations has been shown to effectively help you manage anxiety. Determine what’s stressing you out about the impending trip and develop a positive mantra to counteract these thoughts.For instance, if you are worried about traveling alone, you might repeat the upsides of solo travel like “I will have the chance to plan all the activities I want to do” or “I will be free to connect with locals and other travelers.”
Your mantra may also be a travel quote that inspires you.
Remind yourself that feeling uncomfortable is a sign of growth. If you always feel comfortable, then this is a sign that you are not challenging yourself.

, Deep breathing helps kick start the body’s natural stress response. It may be helpful to start a deep breathing practice before your trip so that you can fall back on the technique during moments of anxiety before and during your travels.


To start, sit comfortably. Place one hand on your abdomen and the other on your chest. Inhale slowly through your nose for about 4 counts. You should feel your abdomen expanding while the hand on your chest stays relatively still. Hold the breath for 7 counts. Then, exhale from your mouth for 8 counts, feeling your abdomen deflate beneath your hand. Repeat for several minutes., Some people feel panic due to a fear of flying or worry about some other aspect of traveling. If this describes you, it can help to perform visualization exercises in which you imagine your trip going perfectly. Try this technique in the days leading up to your departure to reduce pre-trip panic.Envision your trip with all the details included. Connect to your senses by imagining the sights, sounds, smells, and sensations you will experience. For instance, if you are flying to a beach, you might imagine the waves crashing against the shore, a cool cocktail in your hand, the sun against your skin, and the smell of salt water.
Bring the details alive as vividly as you can. Take deep breaths. Visualize your trip being completely successful with you trying new foods, meeting new people, and engaging in interesting activities.
Keep in mind that your mind cannot tell the difference between something that is imagined and something that is real and will usually respond to imagined things as if they are real."

Take medications with you.",How to Travel as an American in Developing Countries,"


It's important to have your visa and passport to legally travel as an American in foreign countries to ensure that you're permitted entry into the country. Apply for your visa a few months before your trip, since the process can take up to 8 weeks to complete. Be sure to carry your visa and passport on you in case any luggage gets misplaced or lost so you have it with you for identification at all times.;
,


Get all the required vaccinations and immunizations prior to traveling in developing countries as an American. Check with the health department or Centers for Disease Control to determine what immunizations are required in specific parts of the world and what diseases are prevalent where you're traveling so you can safeguard against them.

,


Plan your travel itinerary after your immediate arrival and keep the name of your hostel, hotel or the person meeting you readily available. This will keep you from looking like easy prey to pickpockets and swindlers looking for unsure foreigners to rob or overcharge for a taxi.

,


Travel safely as an American in developing countries by educating yourself beforehand about the politics and cultures of the countries you visit. Be aware of any political or military current events that could cause certain areas of the country to be unsafe, as well as any cultural practices you should observe to avoid offending anyone.

,


There's always a chance of being the victim of theft or lost luggage when traveling abroad, so travel as light as possible and leave any valuable jewelry or other items you don't want to lose at home. Pack only the essentials and consider buying travel insurance to safeguard against theft.

,


Electrical outlets in developing countries are different than American ones, and finding electricity in certain areas could prove challenging. Be prepared to charge your cell phone or digital camera by investing in a universal adapter, available at most electronics stores, that will adapt foreign electrical outlets to be able to charge all your devices.

,


Take any prescription or over-the-counter medications with you to avoid the possibility of not being able to obtain them where you're traveling. Consider taking medications to prevent diarrhea or malaria and water-purification tablets, available at your pharmacy.

Research the standard of care for the country of your choice.,
Contact other people who have had similar procedures in other countries.,
Read reviews on the hospital or doctors.,
Search for hospitals that are partnered with respected U.S. hospitals.",How to Stay Safe when Trying Medical Tourism1," As you decide which country you are interested in travelling to for your procedure, you should research the standards for medical care and your particular procedure. Never travel to a country for medical tourism before you understand the standards of medical care for the country and their medical professionals.Every country has different standards for care, which include levels of education and certifications for the medical professionals, along with codes of ethics and legal practices.
To find this information, you can contact a medical tourism agency, who can help you find the information you are looking for. You can also search online for the individual country's standard of medical care, or find this information on a particular international hospital's website. You may also contact hospitals or healthcare agencies in the country.;
, You should try to talk to other people from your country who have had a similar procedure through medical tourism. You can talk to them about their experience, the quality of the care their received, and any problems they had with their procedure. They also may be able to recommend hospitals or doctors.Look online for others who have had your type of surgery. If possible, try to talk to these people in person or on the phone to make sure that you are hearing a legitimate experience.
You may be able to ask the doctors or medical-travel facilitator for help finding others in your area or country to contact about their procedure.
For example, you may say, ""Hi, I am thinking about getting a knee replacement/bariatric surgery/dental work done in another country. I see that you had a similar procedure done in that country. Would you mind telling me a little bit about your experience?""

, You may want to read patient reviews on the hospitals, clinics, and doctors before making any decisions. Websites such as Treatment Abroad or Patients Beyond Borders offer reviews of many different procedures, hospitals, and doctors from all over the world.Reading reviews can help you learn which hospitals, clinics, or doctors are generally well-known or respected for their procedures.

, Some international hospitals have connections with leading U.S. hospitals and medical systems due to their high safety standards. Look for hospitals that are connected to these respected domestic hospitals since they more than likely will have a higher standard of care.For example the Cleveland Clinic, Johns Hopkins, and the University of Pennsylvania have partnered with international hospitals.

Keep your valuables out of reach.,
Be careful with your money.,
Stay on top of things.,
Get a good seat.,
Pack what you'll need.,
Wear comfortable clothing.,
Keep track of your belongings.",How to Stay Safe and Comfortable While Traveling," Airports, especially big ones (Schiphol Amsterdam, Charles de Gaulle Paris, etc.) are prime territory for thieves looking to nick unsuspecting travelers. Pick-pocketers, for instance, look for places most people keep their belongings. Rear pant pockets and small compartments on backpacks are some examples of where pick-pocketers aim for. They can either very quickly steal things without you noticing, or they distract you in some way while they reach into your backpack or pant pocket and get what they need. To prevent your valuables from getting stolen, there are a few helpful tips everyone should know.


Avoid keeping your valuable documents like passports and boarding tickets near the outside of your bag. Thieves can easily reach them there. If you need to have them on you, try putting a TSA lock on your zipper. Another option is putting them into your jacket's INSIDE pocket and then zipping up your jacket.
Never leave your bags unattended. Not only will airport security dispose of any unattended luggage, but thieves will often grab them as their own.
Be careful not to leave passports and other documents around the airport or train/bus station. As you leave passport control or a duty free store or a lounge, quickly run through what you pulled out while you were there, and double check that you have it on you.;
, Don't run the risk of having some cash stolen, or worse, being a victim of fraud if your credit cards get stolen. Here are some more tips to make sure you stay safe.


If you are traveling internationally, exchange your money for some of the local currency before you go. This will help you avoid using international ATM machines. Although it happens very rarely, ATM machines sometimes swallow cards when you try to obtain some cash from your account. Getting them back takes ages, so it would be better not to run the risk.
Once again, keep your wallet and credit cards out of reach. If you use your card to buy something, put it back immediately to avoid unpleasant incidents.
Watch for suspicious activity. For example, if the cashier is swiping your card over and over and over, you may want to cancel your purchase. Cashiers sometimes do this to extract three or four times the money you are spending on the item off of your account. They also may hold your card and act like something is wrong with it for a long time to try to memorize your card number.

, Many people miss their flights or trains every day while traveling because of simply getting distracted with other things and forgetting to check the time and departure info. There are a few ways to prevent this.


Make sure to regularly check the Arrivals/Departures screen at the airport or train station. This may seem a bit unnecessary, but if your flight/trip information changes (delayed, cancelled, gate change, etc.), and you don't hear it over the intercom, the information will be updated on the departure screens.
Apart from checking the trip information, make sure to plan your day out. This depends on how long you have to stay before your next bout of travel. It would help to make a mental list of the things you need to do (eat, shop, etc.) while at the airport or station. Then just dedicate a certain amount of time to each task, and once you're finished, head to your departure gate/platform. Planning can be a very important tool. Once you've got the safety part of your travels down, you can get started on comfort.

, This is probably one of the most crucial steps in making sure your trip is enjoyable.


Understand the difference between the classes on airplanes and trains. On most airlines, there are usually three classes: First, Business/Premium economy, and Economy. Choosing between them usually depends on your budget. Economy is usually where most people choose there seats. Premium Economy is basically economy but with a few tweaks, but still not as comfy as First Class. Depending on the airline, the classes have varying levels of comfort. For instance, Alaska Airlines first class is completely different that Emirates first class. Same goes for economy and premium economy. If you are on a tight budget, then economy is your prime choice. If you are willing to spend a little more for more seat recline and slightly more legroom, then go for premium economy. And finally, if you want to travel in complete comfort, choose the pricy first class. Keep in mind, however, that on many airlines, a big percent of the passengers sitting in first class usually do not have to pay a fortune for it. They are just very very frequent flyers and the airline gives them a big discount on their ticket.
Choose the correct seat. This one partly has to do with personal preference. In economy for instance, try to avoid seats close to the bathrooms or onboard kitchen. Also, on a plane, sitting towards the rear can be noisy, and if you are in the last row on the plane, the seats can have limited or no recline due to the wall behind you. The seat you choose in your row depends on your personal preference (for example, aisle, window, or middle). One thing you cannot control, however, is the people sitting next to you. If you do happen to get stuck next to a person you do not wish to sit by, check if the plane/train/bus has any empty seats, or even better, an empty row.

, The way you pack for will mostly depend on the duration of your travel, so be sure to consider how long your flight or train/bus trip is. First of all, decide if you need to check in a bag. If you are planning to leave for a while, you may need to check in an extra bag. But no matter how long your trip is, you will almost always need a carry-on.


Carry-ons are one of your main priorities on a trip. When packing your carry-on, think light and compact, especially if your carry-on is a backpack. The amount of things you will have to bring depends, once again, on the duration of your flight or train/bus trip. It may not be necessary to bring every electronic gadget you own with you on a 2 or 3 hour trip. Also, you don't want to make the mistake of bringing too little, or you will be bored out of your mind, especially on long-haul trips. Once again, make sure the things you bring are light and compact, but are still enough to keep you entertained. Download some of the latest books, games and movies, as well as some music and games. You may not need a lot of material for short sections of travel, but for longer ones, getting a few movies and books can help a lot. Some airlines, trains, or buses have personal screens in each seat with their own wide selection of movies, TV shows and music. Make sure to check online or with a representative if your travel provider has this feature.

, This is another crucial step if you want to be as comfortable as possible on a trip. This may not be as crucial on short flights/trips, but this will help a lot on long ones. Avoid tight and uncomfortable clothing. You can always walk around the terminal in a pair of jeans and a sweater, but change into sweatpants on the plane if you're on a long flight. Also, find shoes that are comfortable, but ones that you can take off and put on quickly. This will help when going through security, particular at airports. And when going through security, please try to keep your jewelry down to a minimum. Not only will it hold up everyone in line, but when you remove it, you run the risk of getting it stolen from the bins.

, Lots of people forget things either in the terminal or on the plane/train/bus. Avoid leaving your things around the terminal and keep track of everything on you. Same rules apply in the plane or on a train/bus. If you want to put something away, put it somewhere where you won't forget it. And before you arrive at your destination, put everything away into whatever bag you have in your seat with you. Check the floor and seat pocket for any of your things. It only takes half a minute to check around you, and it will save you a lot of misery.

It also helps if each person coming along is able to and is willing to drive for some of the way, so that you can share the driving chore (with the obvious exception of children).


Read How to take a road trip for your family and How to take a road trip with a friend for more ideas.;
, Dinners and shopping trips are great ways to do so, but over a few cocktails is the best way for many to get their creative juices flowing. Planning the trip should be fun and get people excited. Don't stress about the details or you're completely defeating the purpose. Even a general idea of a direction can be sufficient, with maybe a much desired place or site to visit included as one must-do or a turn back point.


There are plenty of online planning sites that will help make it super easy for you to plan a rough itinerary and to get travel times, etc. Using these can speed up the decision-making process.

, The only thing that you need to bear in mind as you amble along on the road trip is the return date. It's not going to be very helpful to be in San Francisco when you need to be in New York City the next day or so. Some planning is essential to ensure that your road trip gets you back to where you came from on time! In addition, if there are particular must-do visits, find out times of opening, dates of special events, and the accommodation needs. If you're heading to a festival or similar event, accommodation may be booked out if it's popular, so you might need to be prepared to sleep in the car or rough it in bivouacs; at least know beforehand so that you can be prepared.

, If you're low on cash, make a pact to stay in cheap hotels and skimp on the dining out. Also pack well, so that you have towels, blankets, sleeping bags, food supplies, etc., that will help to keep down the costs if you need to rough it or you drive into town too late for a decent meal, etc. Some suggestions for things to pack are outlined in later steps. Have at least one credit card for emergencies, preferably one per person, as well as small amounts of cash for the cash-is-best deals such as cheap accommodation and meals.


Plan ahead for prices of fuel using sites such as gas prices.mapquest.com or roadtripamerica.com (both USA sites).
If you stop for a swim after roughing it for the night, use their showers to clean up. Other places to find showers include camping grounds and RV parks but usually you'll have to pay for the privilege of a shower in these places.
Stay in national parks and state/provincial parks (you'll need an annual pass). If you do this, it will cost very little each stay and you will get the benefit of a car space and a tent space (just be sure to take your tent), as well as basic hygiene facilities. And there is nothing like waking up to the sounds of nature in the early morning.
Avoid toll roads and big city stops and you'll avoid having to pay for road usage and parking. Take an up-to-date road atlas with you so you know how to avoid the tolls.
Read How to choose a camping spot on a road trip for more ideas.

, Your most important element of a road trip is your car, which needs to be both reliable, fuel efficient, and safe. Obviously, start with a car in top working order and have it serviced before leaving. Spending most of the road trip stuck in a garage won't be fun, so spare yourself such a nightmarish outcome by having the car checked first. Some things you might need to consider include wheel realignment, tire changes, fresh oil, fixing a chipped windshield, checking clutch and brakes, and general condition of the engine. Once you're satisfied the car's in great shape, you have one big weight off your mind.


Have the spare tire checked too. And if you don't have one, get one now, along with a jack. Ask the mechanic to show you how to change a tire if you don't know already; it's better to be slightly embarrassed now than to be frustrated in the middle of the desert with nobody for miles to help you.
Check that there are jumper cables in the car.
You'll also want to make copies of the car keys and give everyone one set. This will keep you from getting locked out, and will be more convenient when you switch drivers. It also helps should one person lose their set of keys; at lease one other person will have a back-up!
Be sure to sign up for roadside assistance, such as the AAA. As well as roadside assistance, often such companies can set you up with free maps and even directions to your final destination.
If possible, choose the most fuel-efficient car over any gas guzzlers.
Read How to check your car before a road trip for more information.

, Some planning for contingencies is important. Food, sleeping items, clothing, and water are essentials to add to your packing so that you're self-reliant. Be sure to wear and take comfortable clothing as you'll be sitting for long periods and time and you don't want to feel hot and constricted.


Include some sleeping gear. Have at least one sleeping bag, one pillow, and one polar fleece or cotton blanket per person traveling. Add a tarpaulin or two for all sorts of purposes and some dish cloths/hand towels or similar for quick makeshift curtains for the car windows if you have to sleep in it overnight.
Throw in some activity gear, like a soccer ball to kick at road stops, a Frisbee to throw, and a pack of cards for a game or two at a cafe.
Include paper towels, utensils, dish cleaning gear, storage and garbage bags, and spare toilet paper. All these ""just-in-case"" items can help save money and get your out of a tight spot.
Remember you may be traveling through the middle of nowhere pretty frequently and will need to pack a few safety things. Bring a gallon (3.7 liters) of water and a gallon (3.7 liters) of oil. Bring 50-100 feet (15 to 30 meters) of rope, duct tape, a first aid kit, a flashlight (the kind that doesn't use batteries is nice because you don't have to worry about batteries), bug spray, jumper cables, a pocket knife, a compass, an umbrella, and blanket(s). It can also be helpful to have an electricity converter for charging your music players, laptops, cell phones, etc.
If you plan on crossing country borders, have your passport and any visas needed, as well as checking that your passport has enough time left on it.

, Food is one of the most important aspects of the trip, especially if you're trying to drive cross-country in two days. If you want to cover the most ground, you can't stop to eat too often. If you're concerned about health, you shouldn't do drive-thrus all the time, either. Indeed, if you eat a poor diet while on the road you'll be sleepy and less aware, increasing the risk of accidents. Be prepared to pack things you may not like to eat, but must anyway. Snack or energy bars are a great choice, as well as fresh fruit, cereal, nuts, seeds, trail mix, etc. For cooking purposes, take along some seasoning, pasta, quick-cook rice, and camping style food packages, and you can pick up fresh fruit, veggies, fish, and meat as you travel, especially from local farmers and fishing operations – fresh is best and that's part of your discovery experience on a road trip. It's especially important to carry plentiful supplies of food if you have dietary restrictions, such as gluten intolerant, vegetarian, etc., as the roadside diners won't always have what you can eat.


Find a good, collapsible cooler that will not take up any more space than one seat and pack it full. Buy ice packs or seal-able bags and fill them with ice. Do not put ice directly in the cooler because when it melts it will be a pain, and you'll need to get more ice at every stop; always have it in a container. If you stay in overnight accommodation, an icepack can be refrozen in the bar fridge but remember to take it with you each time.
You can always bake cookies, eggs, or other food on your car engine if you bring along some aluminum foil and seasoning! See How to bake cookies on your car dashboard and How to cook food on your car's engine for inspiration.
Read How to keep food fresh on a road trip for more ideas.

, Always have paper maps or a map book with you, even if you have GPS. Something could go wrong with the GPS and you don't want to be stranded just because it's all you relied upon.

, For example, one with all music that reminds them of summer, music that was popular in junior high school, etc... Each person should bring items to the car that coincide with this theme, such as candy, tiaras, cheap sunglasses, tie-dye... you get the picture. It's funny if you keep these details a secret until you hit the road.

, A road trip is an awesome experience but don't mar it by driving dangerously or thoughtlessly. Try to drive during the cooler parts of the day (less air-conditioning and not so hot for all of you), and use cruise control where possible to enable a steady speed. There are a number of things to be very conscious of when driving a road trip:


Never pass or overtake on blind bends or hills, no matter how confident you start feeling as you keep on driving. Another car or truck coming the other way has nothing to do with your confidence!
If you feel as if you've done enough driving for the day, heed that feeling. Pushing yourself beyond your limits puts you into the danger zone of drowsiness, poor reaction time, and bad decision-making. Any drowsiness should be heeded; find the nearest rest stop, pull over and take a good 20 minute break that includes stretching, walking, and perhaps eating and drinking.
Heed the space needed for large vehicles such as trucks, RVs, buses, etc. when overtaking or passing them, as well as giving them wide berth when they're turning. Remember that if you can't see their mirrors, they cannot see you; pass by them quickly but safely, and don't cut in too soon when pulling back in.
Have one person sleep, and one person awake, if you happen to be traveling at night.
If you have to drive through the night and everyone is tired, take shifts that are 1 hour 45 minutes long. Everyone sleeps in cycles, and these cycles are typically 1.5 hours long. Adding the extra fifteen minutes allows for you to settle in and get to sleep. It's also best to begin waking the next person up a few minutes before you actually stop.
To stay awake: drink caffeine, eat crunchy things like apples, shine lights into your eyes, roll down the windows, turn the music up (unless this wakes up the others), bite your cheek, pinch yourself, or change lanes frequently. Read How to stay awake when driving for more details.

, If you choose to sleep in the car, take care with your choice of sleeping location. Look for areas that are well lit, out of the way of pedestrian or vehicle traffic, and that aren't likely to have traffic patrol knocking on your window!


The car park of the motel that told you they're all full might be a good location, especially if you're all really tired and fed up looking for somewhere to sleep. These are often well lit and out of the way of traffic; however, beware the possibility of thieves trying to break into cars that might be surprised by people in a car!

Camping grounds and RV parks can be a spot to park (for a cost) but not actually get out of your car. This will still cost you but can save time by not setting up a tent if you're in a hurry.
Well-lit truck stops are a good choice for sleeping. Many truck drivers use them, so it's a generally accepted habit in such places.

, There is nothing more frustrating (and somethings scary) than a free-as-a-bird road trip getting snagged in a traffic jam as you're transiting through an unknown city to get to the other side. Check the traffic flow (jams usually occur into big city centers in the early morning and away from them in the mid to late afternoon) and avoid going that way. Or, opt to transit through when the traffic is only non-peak.


If you do get caught up and you're feeling drained of energy, frightened by the traffic, or tired, take the first exit and wait it out. Use it as a chance to explore wherever you've turned off to, or to get a coffee.

, Once you've taken care of all the planning, checking, and you're fully aware of how to deal with any of the risks and problems that can crop up, it's time to head off on your road trip. The road trip will be as monumental, amazing, and memorable as you decide to make it, so don't be hung up by preconceived notions or unrealistic ideas. If things interest you along the way that you didn't expect to, give in to the whim and discover something completely new. You won't regret discovering and exploring new aspects of life around you and you may even meet the most incredible people.


If you're in a different part of the country, take the scenic route whenever you can. You may be surprised how different and beautiful your country can be.

Be spontaneous. If you see a billboard for some off-the-wall store or a crazy attraction, go. Don't get caught up in an itinerary or time schedule.
Wherever you go, make sure you go out on the town and mingle with the locals.
Do your best to avoid eating at chain restaurants. Local restaurants are much better 95 percent of the time and much more fun 100 percent of the time. Besides, you're more likely to meet some great characters at local diners and restaurants.

, Remember that conversation will likely be your number one source of entertainment, but you need to plan for those times during which you run out of things to talk about for the moment. It's a long time inside the car and you won't always be entertained by the scenery or conversation on board. If you can read in a car, books and magazines might work for you to pass some time. If not, explore the possibilities – listen to your iPod or the music in the CD player, watch DVDs on a portable DVD player, look for shapes in the clouds, count cars, etc. and play some car games:


Play the game ""I spy"": Pick an object everyone can see and say ""I spy with my little eye, something beginning with ; or something that is "". Whoever guesses correctly gets to go next.
Play ""Guess the license plate"": Spot where cars come from and work out the state or province, perhaps even country, that they're from. The winner is the person who has seen the most states/provinces by the end of the road trip. (It's probably a good idea to keep a record in a small notebook.) Or, vary the game by using the letters of each license plate to make a phrase, such as ""CBD"" could be ""cows in broad daylight"", etc.
Play ""Scavenger hunt"": Have someone draw up a list of items that have to be spotted during the set time. The first to check off all the items on the list wins.
Play ""Count the cows"": Count as many cows or other objects as possible within a defined period of the trip. Passing a cemetery loses you all your points and you have to start again. The winner is the one with the highest count.
Play the ""Alphabet game"": Search for each letter of the alphabet on your side of the road, in signs, storefronts, on vehicles, etc. The winner is the one to get the whole alphabet first.
Play ""Storytelling"": Simply relate a line, then the next person has to make up another line, and so forth until a whole tale is spun. The crazier, the better; have a good laugh!
Read How to choose kid's games for road trips for more ideas. And don't forget sing alongs!

, As you travel together, you'll get to know one another more than ever. If you and your fellow road trippers start arguing, falling in love, discovering deep and meaningful things about one another, etc., take the time needed to sort through your feelings and exchanges with each another. This is definitely a part of the road trip - bonding and learning more about one another, so don't simply ignore anything and let feelings get out of control. Stop and listen to one another!


Being in such close proximity for so long with certain friends can lead to the friendship reaching break point. If so, this can be especially awkward when you still have to drive 1,000 miles (1,600 km) back home with the guy, so be sure to take ""breathers"" every now-and-then so you don't get on each others' nerves.

, Finally, but not least, keep your memories of the road trip alive for the rest of your life by documenting it in digital and written form. At the very least, take pictures! No matter where you are or what you're doing, if you don't, you will regret not taking pictures of your experiences. As well, try to keep at least a bare bones daily record of the places you've visited and traveled through. If you also have the energy to write down your feelings, do that too. All of these memories will bring the trip back to you in years to come.


Digital is the way to go when taking travel photos. Just make sure you have plenty of fully-charged batteries and adequate storage capacity. If memory cards get full they can be downloaded to CDs at the photo departments at big box stores and pharmacies anywhere. Or, if staying with family or friends, just use their computers to backup to disc.
Don't be miserly with the photos; take many and there will be at least one gem per round of shots of the same monument, scenery, or feature!
Photograph such structures as a bridge crossing between states, border signs, motels where you slept and have a funny story to tell, interesting signs, etc.
Make a checklist of photos that must be taken by each person on the trip. For example, each day someone must take a picture with a random family, a garden gnome, a monument, a particular franchise, a church, etc. Take a picture of one person at each state or provincial line. While it may be tacky, you're guaranteed laughter and these photos will make great keepsakes later on.
Be sure to get lots of photos of your traveling companions. And if you can, get their daily or regular impressions of the trip too and write these down.

You may be able to gain a good amount of experience by being a cruise planner (like a travel agent for cruises) or a high-ranking employee aboard another cruise ship.


For example, working as a captain, entertainment coordinator, guest services manager, or another important position aboard another ship would be good preparation for starting your own line.;
, Each approach has its advantages and disadvantages, and it's a good idea to research each option thoroughly to ensure that the decision you reach is the right one given your expertise, financial flexibility, and previous experience.


Developing a cruise line on your own will require you to build your service offerings, buy or charter ships, create marketing strategies, and design operational structure on your own, which will be expensive and require trial and error.
Working with a syndicate can give you the benefit of having partners that share in your business and also share the risk and responsibility.

, Learn about the industry and your competitors so that you can outline an unfulfilled niche for your cruise line to fill. This is the only way you can be profitable, as they cruise industry is highly competitive. What will be different or unique about your cruise line that will attract paying customers? Think about offering very luxurious travel, unique experiences or entertainment, or going to unusual locations as a way to differentiate yourself.


Avoid taking on the large players, like Carnival and Royal Caribbean, directly, as these are powerful and established companies.
However, there are a number of smaller companies that serve under 10,000 passenger per year. You could compete against these companies more easily than you could against the larger ones., Think about what cruise routes you plan to use and what permissions you'll need to obtain to navigate them, or what competition you'll be up against on the same routes. You should also think about where you will be sailing from and what that means for your target customers. Market penetration for cruise lines is relatively low outside the United States, which could offer an opportunity for easy growth in an untapped market, like Asia or the Middle East.It would be more cost-effective to start a boat-charter service or mini-cruise ship line. This would also somewhat simplify your navigation restrictions and enhance your ability to access more remote locations.

, When starting a cruise line, your primary expense will be purchasing or building your ships. The cost will depend on what size cruise line you are considering. This can vary from a small fleet of one or two small cruise boats that can take just a small group right up to a full-size liner. For most people, a sensible beginning is a small cruise boat with room for a small group or family. This will allow you to build up your business over time and prove to yourself and others that it can work.


The cost of this type of small boat depends on its size and features, but even a small cruise ship with 100 berths will cost about $50 million.
A full-sized cruise ship, like those used by Royal Caribbean and Carnival, will cost you at least $150 million (for the smallest ship class).
The largest ships currently on the water cost a whopping $1.2 billion.
Your cost will also depend on your specific ship needs. Are you fine with customizing an existing one, or do you need to have a boat or ship built from scratch? Obviously customizing or buying a ready-made cruise boat will cost less than commissioning one from scratch.You will also need operating capital to buy fuel, pay dock fees, pay employees, stock the ship with supplies, and for other ongoing expenses.

, Chartering an existing cruise ship is a cheaper option (although still pricey). Chartering allows you to ""borrow"" or lease a ship for your own cruise to use as you see fit. For example, some organizations have chartered cruise ships for special interest events or poker tournaments. Chartering is still expensive, though. For example, a three-day charter for one of Royal Caribbean's ships can cost over $900,000. Longer trips may cost up to $6 million.To cover these costs, you will have to fill the boat with customers and find a way to earn back your charter fee, plus a profit for yourself, over the course of the trip.

, Before you even go to the bank or look for other sources of financing, it's vital to have a business plan drawn up and thoroughly ready. It's your source of convincing others that this project is a go-ahead. As part of developing your business plan, address all previous steps in this part, including your own experience, your competition, the state of the market, your funding needs, and your planned routes.You also need to spell out:


Your cruise line's name. This should differentiate you from your competition in the same way that your offerings do. Make sure that your name reflects the type of cruise line you are starting.
The activities you plan to provide on your cruise. For example, whale-sighting cruising, on-board activities, visiting cities or islands, etc.
Your pricing structure. Remember that cruise lines profit primarily from on-board purchases like food and alcohol, rather than from the ticket sales. For a starting point, the average price of a cruise ticket in 2015 was $1,350, while customers spent an average of $429 on on-board purchases. However, much of the ticket price is eaten up by overhead expenses, like crew and fuel costs.Earnings and growth projections.

, Find out what licenses you'll need. Registration restrictions and paperwork tend to be less complicated in developing countries, so consider registering there rather than in the United States.


US Regulations specific to cruise ships can be found at http://www.uscg.mil/hq/cg5/csncoe/codeandcfr.asp.

, Decide what sort of financing will be best for your venture. Sources of financing include the bank, other major lenders (including cooperatives and credit unions), venture capitalists, angel investors, partnerships, and crowdfunding.


The easiest way to finance a business is to do it yourself using your savings. However, coming up with this type of money this way is not feasible for most people.
Taking out a small business loan can be an effective solution for funding your business, assuming you qualify for one. To do so, you will need experience, a sound business plan, and good personal credit. The Small Business Administration, SBA, offers guarantees on small business loans that can help you get the loan you need.
The limit for an SBA-guaranteed loan is $5 million, through an International Trade and Export Working Capital loan. Most of the other SBA programs offer less and are subject to strict underwriting. In addition, you must find a lender who is familiar enough with the industry and willing to make loans, as the SBA program is a guarantee, not a source of capital itself.
Angel investors are more difficult to obtain but can be a great source for both capital and advice, as the angel is usually an experience businessperson. Angels offer start up funds in exchange for equity (partial ownership) in your company., When you have financing in place, you'll need to purchase or charter your ships. Search online at sites like YachtWorld or Ships4Ever.com to find listings then contact the shipbroker in charge of a ship you want to negotiate a price and go through with the sale. If you are buying a smaller boat, or several, there are many other sites offering listings for smaller yachts and cruisers.

, If you find a good deal on a used ship, that probably means that you will have to make repairs to make the ship ready for passengers. Hire an engineer to make sure that the boat is structurally sound and seaworthy, and that the engines are functioning properly. In addition, you may want to make modifications to your ship to add more amenities, cabin features, shops, or communal spaces. Buy appliances and furniture for cabins as needed.

, Depending on the size of your cruise ship and overall operation, you will need a variety of crew and employees to make your cruise line run smoothly. For example, you will certainly need crewmen for the ship to run the engines and repair anything that breaks. You will also probably need administrative assistants to handle bookings and billing. Then, you will need to hire food service personnel and maids to handle the cooking and cleaning. Finally, you will need employees to provide entertainment, such as musicians or tour guides for outings.


If you run a very small operation, you may be able to fill many of these roles yourself.

, One of the primary types of insurance you will need is general liability insurance. This will cover your legal expenses, court fees, and settlements in the event that you are sued by a customer who was injured on one of your cruises. This can help you avoid being financially ruined by one bad experience.You may also need insurance to cover potential losses of property in case of a fire or shipwreck. Contact major insurers to inquire about this type of coverage.


Customers can sue for any number of reasons, so it's best to get the highest insurance coverage amount that you can afford. Passengers can even sue over rough seas.

, You will need licenses to operate as a business and as a cruise line. The specific licenses will depend on where you are registered and also where you go stop along your routes. You will need to gain clearance from a part authority or local government anywhere you plan to stop. Because of the complex nature of these permits and dealing with local authorities, it may be wise to hire a consultant who can help you with this.


You will also need to obtain liquor licenses for the relevant regions if you are not cruising in international waters.
In all case, contact the relevant authority (ports, the coast guard, local governments, etc.) to inquire about specific permit and license requirements.
You must adhere to the CDC's twice-annual required health inspections, due to the outbreaks of various intestinal diseases on cruise ships. This is also a form of liability.

, Now that you're ready to sail, you'll have to attract customers to fill your first voyage. Set a date and begin creating a marketing plan to reach the right customers. Be sure to consider first exactly who you want to attract. Are you looking for elderly retirees or young people? Do you want families, couples, or single people onboard? Your answers to these questions depend on the nature of the cruise you are offering and will inform your advertising strategies and media choices.


For example, many cruise lines are now seeking to attract millennials by offering cruises focused more on adventure and destinations than on on gambling and shopping., Before you depart, run a check of all your ship's systems, crew members, and services. Make sure everything is running smoothly and efficiently. Your first voyage will need to go through without problems if you hope to keep running your cruise line for very long, so make sure to be absolutely ready before departing.

Check the medical professional and facilities have proper accreditation.,
Choose a board-certified medical professional.,
Request safety data from the hospital.",How to Stay Safe when Trying Medical Tourism2," Before choosing a medical facility or doctor, you should research them to make sure they have the proper accreditation. Don’t just see that the facility or professional has accreditation. Check to make sure the accreditation comes from a reliable organization.Try looking up the hospital or medical professional in the Joint Commission International. This is the international division of the same agency that provides accreditation to US hospitals.
The International Society for Quality in Health Care is one of the best organizations that gives out accreditations. Check the facility, medical professional, or accreditation organization with ISQua when researching., When choosing a doctor to perform your procedure, you should find a specialist in your area who is board certified. Research the doctor before choosing them. Don’t be shy to ask for information about their medical schooling, their certifications, or their licenses.Contact or research the organizations the doctors have their board-certifications or licenses through to determine what kind of qualifications the doctor has to have or the certification process they have to go through.
Make sure the doctor you are choosing has experience performing the procedure.

, Before choosing a hospital, research their safety data to get a better idea about the safety and quality of the facility. When looking at these statistics, compare them to your local hospitals or look for low rates. For example, infection rates should be less than three percent.Ask about infection rates, such as catheter-associated infections, surgical--site infections, or bloodstream infections.
Ask about the hospital’s sterilization methods, such as their hand hygiene program.

Organize the trip through a medical-travel facilitator.,
Consider getting medical travel insurance.,
See a medical travel doctor before you travel.,
Schedule follow-up care at home.,
Request all the details of the agreement in writing.,
Take someone with you when you travel.",How to Stay Safe when Trying Medical Tourism3," You may choose to enlist the help of a third party medical-travel facilitator. Medical-travel agencies can help you connect with hospitals and medical professionals, help make appointments, and set up travel plans like plane and hotel reservations.Make sure to research the medical-travel agency before choosing one. Some may receive referral fees when getting patients to use certain doctors or hospitals.
Medical-travel agencies should not give you any medical advice or read your x-rays or test results.

, Though medical tourism is an increasing industry that more people are using, complications can still arise. Suining international hospitals is very difficult and can take years. Getting medical travel insurance may be a good idea just in case something goes wrong.This type of insurance can cover any malpractice, follow-up care for a death, or disability.
Medical insurance can range from $350 to $600.

, There are risks associated with travelling after medical procedures. Flying for too long increases the risk of deep vein thrombosis, and you shouldn’t fly for around 10 days after chest, abdominal, or cosmetic surgery. Talking to the travel doctor before you travel can help you know what you should do to make sure you experience safe travel.This may include knowing how long you should wait before flying back or what kind of follow-up care you will need.
You should also discuss what recreational activities you can do after your procedure. Sunbathing, drinking alcohol, sight-seeing, or swimming may not be appropriate after your surgery.

, For some surgeries, you may need extended follow-up care after you return home. You should talk to your local doctor about the kind of care you will need when you return. Set up appointments and postoperative visits before you get the surgery.You should also determine if your insurance pays for follow up or if you will have to pay for that out of your pocket.

, When you figure out what doctor or hospital you want to use, request that you get all the details of your procedure in writing. This helps to make sure everyone is on the same page and ensures there are no surprises or changes for you when you arrive.The agreement should outline the treatment you are receiving, supplies that will be needed, the care you will receive, and any extras that are included in the price of the procedure.

, If it is possible, take a trusted friend or family member with you. This adds in an extra layer of safety in case something goes wrong. You can have the security knowing that medical professionals can talk to your friend or family member about your medical history or preferences.Having someone with you can also help you feel less nervous or stressed out. Any medical procedure is stressful, and going to another country for one can be an extra layer of stress.

, Destination travel photos will always be most popular. They remind people of having been there themselves or that this is somewhere they dream of going. Usually a destination is symbolic for a deeper value, such as a mental association with adventure, love & romance, perhaps some sweet friendships, experiences we have not remembered for years.


Some feel that simple candid, non-posed people and portrait photographs remind them of their relationships with each other and the love that was shared. These travel photos should leave one with a sense of longing. Perhaps some sadness. Perhaps joy.

Jot down the most important points of the story rather than trying to chronicle all the details during your travels.You can also take photos or video of your experiences to help you remember them, or you can even integrate them into the telling of your story.;
, A natural way to start telling a story is to relate it to your current experience. For instance, if you're at a Mexican restaurant with your friends, you can talk about your travel experience in Mexico. Relating it to what you're currently doing and making it relevant will cause people to be more interested.It will also help create banter between the people that you're sharing the story with.

, The more out of the ordinary your story is, the more memorable and entertaining it will be for people. Avoid mundane stories with no moral or point. Instead, choose a story that is unique in order to pique their interest. Don't be afraid to slightly exaggerate to make your story more interesting.If your story isn't extraordinary in any way, you can weave humor into it to keep it interesting.

, When you are telling a story, make sure that it's one that's fresh in your memory. If you have to stop to try to remember details or large plot points in the story, it can break up the story's flow, and people could lose interest. Choose a story about a recent trip or something that was so memorable that you could never forget the details.

Catch up on movies.,
Learn another language.,
Get lots of sleep.,
Look out through the windows and enjoy the scenery.,
Strike up a conversation.,
Take along a few books or magazines to read.,
Take notes or write a diary.,
Bring along an MP3 player or iPod and listen to your favorite songs.,
Bring some games along.",How to Spend Time While Travelling for Long Hours," Get your phone/laptop ready with all of the movies you like. We all have a long list of movies that we want to watch, but the only reason we are unable to is less free time. And so, long journeys are the perfect moments to catch up on movies falling under your ‘must-see’ category. Whether it is about watching your favorite movie 100th time or watching that documentary movie after a month, you can easily pass a couple of hours with the movie.

Always use your own headsets, instead of asking for them during the flight.



 

;
, When you travel across cities, states and countries, it definitely implies that wherever you are heading to, is a place that has different language and communication styles. Your journey is a chance to read and understand a few phrases that you would be greeted with. If you are not an alien to the language, then you can also opt to polish your language skills, and ready yourself for the local people and lifestyle. On the other hand, if you can carry your iPod, MP3, or CD player, then you can also bring your audio phrasebook. You can also transfer the audio lessons on your MP3 player and then get along with the studies again.

, One of the best way to pass time on long journeys is to catch up on your sleep. If you do not feel sleepy, taking a sleep aid or pill can help loosen up your body, make you lethargic, and take you into complete sleep mode. You always have a choice to carry a pillow (or can ask for them when in the flight), sleeping mask, and earplugs if you need them while you sleep.

, At regular intervals of time, get up from your place and take a stroll in the cabin so as to keep the body moving and blood flowing perfectly. This will keep you off from all problems rising from immobility. When in flight, the back area of the plane also has a spot for stretching as well.

, This wholly depends on- whom are you sitting next to. You can commence by discussing about such a long journey that you both are in and then continue talking on what you plan to do at the destination. What are your areas of interest on journeys and how do you find travelling by several modes of transport. And if the other person is some big shot and a corporate traveler, you might also end up getting a new job with a hike. You might also bump into your next travel buddy like your next career opportunity.

, If you are an avid reader, then a book and a long journey is what all you need. Plus, there are also tons of first-rate travel books narrating travel stories from writers such as Pico Iyer, Ted Conover, and Bill Bryson. You can read their interesting works not only to pass away the time but also to build up the knowledge on travel industry and several destinations. Travel stories are the most intrinsic way to keep the spirits high and help you explore the destination as well as the journey to the core.

, Long journeys offer you a great opportunity to pen down your feelings and observation on the way and later share it with the world. You can end up in completing your long unfinished sketches, your journal entries and begin the draft of your article. Usually carrying a pen with paper and sketching out ideas turn out to be the paintings later on.

, On crowded and long journeys, the best way to avoid the background noise and go to sleep or read a book is to listen to music.

, Crossword puzzles and Sudoku are the most sought after distractions from a long journey. A deck of cards might also serve as a treat if you find a freaky seatmate. Based on your packing plans, you could also bring along handheld electronic gaming devices such as portable Sony Playstations or Nintendo.

Make sure you have all the documents you need.,
Apply for your visa upon arriving at an Egyptian airport.",How to Get a Tourist Visa for Egypt2," While Egypt grants visas on arrival to visitors from many countries, it is best to find out ahead of time if this service is available to you.

Check with your local consulate or embassy to find out if you may need any other documents., Travelers from many countries can obtain visas upon arrival from bank kiosks located in the airport arrival halls.Visas obtained on arrival typically cost US $25, or US $35 for a multiple entry visa.Be sure to buy your visa from an official bank kiosk. You may encounter agents who will attempt to sell you overpriced visas.Most tourist visas that can be obtained on arrival are valid for 30 days.
Travelers from some countries, such as the UK, may obtain free entry permits valid for up to 15 days when traveling directly to resorts at Sharm el Sheikh, Dahab, Nuweiba, and Taba."

Have your documents ready.,
Go to the nearest passport office to renew your visa.,
Be prepared to pay a fine if you do not renew your visa.",How to Get a Tourist Visa for Egypt3," If you plan to stay in Egypt beyond 30 days, you will need to renew your tourist visa. To renew the visa, you will need the same basic documents required for an initial visa application:Your passport

If you fail to renew your visa within this grace period, you may have to pay a fine at the airport before you can leave the country.If you find yourself in this situation, try to find out ahead of time how much the fine will be so that you can be sure of having enough Egyptian currency on hand when you go to the airport.

Create a hook for the introduction.,
Talk about the circumstances leading up to your hook.,
Keep a natural momentum with the story.,
Reflect on the overall meaning of the story.",How to Tell an Interesting Travel Story2," Introduce the story with something shocking or mysterious that can help pull your audience in. Start off your story with one of the most exciting or interesting aspects of the story, instead of boring details. Telling a story like this will keep your audience's attention.Avoid cliche story introductions like ""Once upon a time"" or ""It was a sunny Tuesday morning when...""
A good hook would be something like, ""Yeah, well, I've eaten wild boar before, on one of the islands of Hawaii.""

, Once you've drawn them into your story, they will pay closer attention to what you have to say. Start explaining the events that led to your hook, but don't get bogged down in detail. Talk about larger actions or events and how they made you feel. Create imagery for the scenario and try to get your listeners to understand the unique aspects of the situation as well as the cultural differences you may have experienced.

, Keeping a natural story arch to your story will help keep listeners engaged. For more boring or mundane parts of the story, make sure to inject humor so that it feels like the story is progressing. Recite the story like you are heading on a distinct path with a well-defined destination. The more mysterious you make the hook, the more the listener will want to know about the circumstances that caused it., Ensure that your story has an overall point or a core moral or value. This doesn't always have to be something with significant meaning. Your story can be an anecdote or a humorous story about a relevant situation. Regardless of what kind of story you're telling, you want it to spark conversation after you tell it.To emphasize the moral of the story you could say something like ""So at the end of the day, while there are alligators down the Nile, sometimes people can be more dangerous than wild beasts.""

"
"
Relate the story to the people.,
Be excited and energetic when telling the story.,
Use photos to enhance the story's imagery.,
Keep the story simple.",How to Tell an Interesting Travel Story3," Choose a story that enables you to connect to your listeners on a human level. The more that they envision themselves in your shoes, the more engrossed they will get in your story. Think about the audience that you have and what they are interested in. If your experience was in a different country with distinct customs, you could relate to people on an emotional level. Talk about feelings of fear, triumph, joy, anxiety, and sadness. Put an emphasis on how you felt during the experience.For instance, if your audience are foodies, you can tell them a story about a unique dining experience in another country.
Find commonalities that you share with the people you're with, like being in a new unknown place, not understanding a language or your confusion with foreign customs.
Even when you are in a unique experience, try to translate the experience to something that your listeners or readers can relate to and understand.

, Your audience will mirror your energy and excitement level. Maintain a healthy level of enthusiasm and excitement in your voice, but don't force it or you may come off as inauthentic. Change the levels in your voice as the story goes on depending on the mood that you want to create.For instance, you can use a lower, spookier voice for scary portions of the story.
Speak louder during portions of the story where you were frustrated or angry.

, You can show off photos or images that you took during your travels with a cell phone. Make sure that you organize the photos so that you don't have to fumble with your phone looking for them when the time comes. Pull up images to help explain the scenery or situation that you were in., Getting bogged down in the details or adding too much superfluous information will not only confuse people, but it can also cause your audience to lose their attention on the story. Instead, try to create a story that's easy for everyone to understand and doesn't require a high level of comprehension.


For instance, if you were in a country with different customs, don't list all of the customs that differ from yours. Instead, select the most interesting and relevant customs to the story.

Make sure you are eligible.,
Review your nonimmigrant category.,
Gather the requested documentation.,
Have the application’s fee ready.,
File your I-539.",How to Extend Your U.S. Visa While in the U.S.," As of a couple of years ago, nonimmigrant travelers to America no longer receive paper I-94’s when they arrive. Instead, an electronic copy is made and the relevant dates will have been stamped on your travel documents upon arrival.There should be three items stamped to your incoming travel documents: the date of your arrival, the class of your admission (the sort of visa you’ll receive), and the date you’re admitted until (the expiration date, essentially)
If you have misplaced these travel documents, you can find your I-94 with the relevant details online at the website of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.;
, USCIS (Citizenship and Immigration Services) strongly recommends submitting your I-539 no less than 45 days before the date of expiration listed on your I-94. Your situation will need to be looked at by a USCIS agent if it has been less than 45 days; if the delay was for causes out of your control, your tardiness will be overlooked., There are a number of categories into which nonimmigrant visitors to the United States are divided. All of these will be allowed to submit an extension using I-539 save for a few. If you were admitted as one of the categories below, you will be unable to file an extension.


Admitted as part of a visa waiver exemption.
As a crew member, with a D nonimmigrant visa.
In transit through the U.S. either with (C nonimmigrant visa) or without a visa (TWOV).
As a fiance of a U.S. citizen or dependant of a fiance (K nonimmigrant visa).
As an informant (or accompanying family) on terrorism or organized crime (S nonimmigrant visa).

, Depending on the class of your admission as stated on your I-94 or the relevant travel documents, your submission process may differ. These categories are numerous, and vary greatly. Look at the I-539 instructions found at https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/files/form/i-539instr.pdf for the full list of eligible nonimmigrant categories, and the differences in the submission process for each.


You are permitted to include your spouse and any unmarried children under 21 as applicants under the same I-539. Note, however, you will all be granted the same amount in time extended; they may not vary between family members.

, Depending on your class of admission (i.e., the sort of nonimmigrant you are classified as), the documentation you’ll need to submit will vary greatly. You’ll need to visit the I-539 instructions linked above to discover just what is asked of you document-wise depending on your class of admissions.For the most part, this will probably include evidence of certain relationships, whether personal or business-related.
Unless otherwise requested, you should send copies of documents requested. If you send the original, know that there is a chance it will not be returned unless you specifically request it.
Any document you submit in a foreign language must be accompanied by a translation in English. You must also include proof of your translator’s qualifications.

, Regardless of the class of your admission (save for one or two exceptions) or the documents involved with your I-539 submission, there is a $290 fee required to submit your I-539. The USCIS requests that this $290 is submitted by check or money order.


When writing your check or money order, you’ll need to write as payable to U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Do not abbreviate it when writing your check.
Certain applicants will be required to make a biometrics service appointment (the USCIS will notify you if this is the case, as well as when and where to attend). For those required to do this, there is an $85 fee included. Submit this in the same way you would the $290 fee.

, Depending on your location, where you file your I-539 will vary. Call 1-800-375-5283 or visit www.uscis.gov/I-539 to figure out where to file your I-539 form. Remember to include all of the documentation requested when filing your I-539.Some I-539 filings are eligible to file online. Check the website www.uscis.gov and look under “FORMS,” and again under “E-Filing and Online Service” to see if you are able to e-file your I-539.

Wait for a decision.",How to Establish Residency," Most states have their own rules for determining residency, and most colleges and universities will only consider you a resident if you meet the rules set by the state the school is in.Residency requirements are usually stated within the state statute. Look for the statute online. If you are unable to find it, the university registrar should be able to tell you what the residency requirements are.
Note that most requirements for residency are the same from state to state, so following the generic guidelines will typically be enough. You should still find out if there are any differences for your state, though.;
, The burden of proof will either lie with the applicant or the applicant's parent based on whether or not the applicant is still legally dependent on that parent.


Dependents must still be under the age of 24 before the end of the calendar year arrives.
Additionally, the student must rely on the parent financially to be considered a dependent of that parent, but that parent does not necessarily need to claim the student as a dependent on his or her taxes.
Students who are independent must prove presence, intent, and financial independence by themselves. Students who are dependent will need to prove the presence and intent of the parents they reside with. When a student's parents are divorced, residency must be proven for the parent who resides with and financially supports that student.

, You or the parent you are dependent upon must reside within the state for a full calendar year before residency can be granted.Some states have a different time requirement. For instance, Alaska requires proof of physical presence for two full calendar years, while Arkansas only requires physical presence within the state for six months.
This time requirement may also vary based on whether you are dependent or independent. For example, Nebraska does not have a minimum time for dependent students, but independent students must prove that they have been physically present in the state for at least one year.

, You or your parents must also demonstrate your intention to remain in the state on a long-term basis.


Essentially, you need to prove that you intend to remain in the state as a resident throughout and beyond the school year.
This requirement may vary based on your dependency status. In some cases, a student who intends to remain in the state may still qualify for residency even if the parent moves out of state.

, Many states require independent students to provide proof of their financial independence.


This is not a requirement that dependent students need to worry about.
Note that none of the proof you provide indicating financial independence may conflict with your proof of presence or intent.

, In addition to proving residency in the state of your university, you must also have no residential ties to any other state.As a general rule, any type of document that can be used to prove residency in the state of your university can also be used to prove residency in another state. Any record indicating that you have recently applied for residency in another state will also work against you.

, Even though some private documents may show that you have been present in the state for the past year, the most effective documents will be those that are tied to the state or federal government.


The most common forms of government-issued proof include:

A voter registration card
Registration with Selective Service in the state.
A filed ""Declaration of Domicile"" form with the county clerk
State and federal income tax returns
High school diploma from a school within the state


Activities showing that you are regularly present within the state might help as supporting evidence but should not be relied upon completely. Such evidence most often includes memberships to local organizations and club

, Proof of intent is less objective, but in general, any document showing that you are establishing a life within the state can be used to help prove your intent.Common examples include:

State driver's license
Vehicle registration within the state
State hunting and/or fishing license
Local bank account
Local library card
License of marriage or divorce within the state
Utility bills from within the state
Proof of state-aided health or welfare


Owning a home or renting an apartment within the state may help, but since many people own vacation homes out of state, some colleges won't accept this as proof. Only provide this proof if it somehow demonstrates that the home you own in the state is your principal home.Similarly, proof of employment within the state may also help, but some people work in a state they do not live in. Some universities may accept records of full-time employment, but others will not.

, If you need to prove financial independence when establishing residency, you will need to satisfy at least one requirement demonstrating your independence.


In most states, you can be considered independent if you are at least 24 years old by the end of the calendar year.
If you are a single undergraduate student who has not been claimed as a dependent by anyone for at least two years, and can demonstrate self-sufficiency through lease agreements or similar documents, you can usually be considered independent, as well.
You may also be considered financially independent if you are married, a veteran of the U.S. military, a ward of the court, a legal orphan, or responsible for legal dependents other than a spouse., If you have legal documents to prove that you are a resident within another state, they may cause your university to reject your claim of residency for the university's state.


Evidence that can be particularly damaging includes:Failure to pay state income tax
Failure to obey any law that applies to permanent residents of the state
Employment in another state, especially a non-bordering state
Ownership of a home in another state
Extended absence from the state, excluding absences required of military members



, In most states, residency status will be granted or denied by the university. As such, you will need to complete the university's residency application.


Fill out the form accurately and completely. Missing or inaccurate information will delay the process and may prevent your claim of residency from being accepted.
In some cases, both you and your parents (or custodial parent) may need to sign the application.
Make sure that you submit the form before the due date established by your university.

, You'll need at least two government-issued documents establishing residency, and at least one of these documents must satisfy any time limit established by the state.


There is no such thing as having too many documents proving residency. Submit all of the proof you have, just in case one document gets rejected.

, Some of these documents might be government-issued, while others won't be.


Regardless of who issued the document, it is recommended that you provide every possible document proving your intent. Since intent is more subjective than physical presence, you will need even more proof to defend this claim.

, If you are an independent student, you will also need to provide at least one document proving your financial independence when you submit your application.


Even if you proved financial independence on your admissions application or on previously submitted financial aid forms, you should still submit your proof again when attempting to establish residency.

, After submitting your application and proof, you must wait for the tuition classification officer to make a decision. Most colleges and universities will inform you of their decision when it has been made.


The decision is only binding at that particular university. If one university denies your claim of residency, it is possible that another university within the same state may grant your claim.
In some cases, you might be able to appeal the decision with that college or university. There usually won't be a way to appeal the decision to a power beyond that educational institution, however.

Knowing the purpose of your travel is very important because if you know your purpose of travel, you will be able to determine what visa category applies to you and will, therefore, be able to file for the correct visa. Equally important is knowing that you should never try to file for a visa category that does not match the purpose of your travel (e.g. do not file for a visitor visa if you are intending to travel for work or study).;
, Are you visiting a foreign country for a holiday? If yes, then you need a visitor visa (a limited-term, non-immigrant visa) unless the country to which you are travelling does not require a tourist visa for persons who hold your nationality. E.g. Americans traveling for tourism do not need a visitor visa to travel to Finland for stays under 90 daysor to travel to Canada for stays under 180 days., Are you traveling to a foreign country to study? If yes, then you need a student visa unless the country to which you are traveling does not require student visas of persons who hold your nationality. For example, if you hold the nationality of a country that is a member of the European Union, then you do not need a student visa to study in another member state of the European Union.On the other hand, if you hold an American passport and wish to study in the United Kingdom for a period greater than 6 months, you do need a student visa., Did you just get a job in a foreign country? If yes, then you need a work visa, unless the country to which you are traveling does not require work visas of persons holding your nationality. E.g. If you are a citizen of a European Union member state, you may work in another member state without a work visa.On the other hand, if you are an American citizen wishing to work in, for example, Belgium, you will need a work visa, also known as a “work permit.”, Will you only be spending a very short period of time in Country A en route to Country B? If so, then you will need what is known as a transit visa unless Country A does not require a transit visa for persons holding the nationality that you hold and you meet certain requirements.


For example, if you hold American citizenship (and, therefore, an American passport), you can transit through Australia without a transit visa if you enter Australia by aircraft, hold a confirmed onward booking to leave Australia within 8 hours of arrival by the same or another aircraft, you do not leave the airport transit lounge except to continue your journey, and you hold the documentation necessary to enter your country of destination.On the other hand, you may hold a passport that does not belong to the list of exempt nationalities, in which case you will need a transit visa even if you meet the above criteria. Note that a transit visa is inappropriate if your transit period lasts greater than a few days, and in those cases, you will normally require a visitor or tourist visa.

, Are you traveling to a foreign country in order to settle there? If so, then you need to apply for an immigrant visa. Unlike non-immigrant visas, such as visitor, student, or temporary work visas, an immigrant visa requires the intention of permanently settling in the foreign country in question. You may be eligible for an immigrant visa, for example, if you have married a citizen of the foreign state in question or because you qualify on the basis of financial investment. If your purpose of travel is to immigrate to the foreign country in question, then the application process will generally be lengthier and will have more stringent requirements in terms of the documentation required.

, Once you have identified your purpose of travel, locate an online visa wizard at a consular website. These wizards can help you determine whether or not you require a visa, and what type of visa you require, when travelling to the foreign country in question. The wizard asks you certain questions (e.g. which country issued your passport and what your purpose of travel is) and guides you to the correct visa application based on your answers. You can locate a visa wizard by typing in a search engine the name of the country to which you are traveling followed by the words “embassy” or “consulate”. This should take you to the official website of the country’s embassy or consulate. On this website, you can check to see if that country’s consular website provides an online visa wizard.

Similar visa wizards may be available for other countries. Check by typing in the name of the country to which you are traveling in a search engine to locate that country’s consular website to determine if that website offers a visa wizard. If it does not, you may use the contact information provided on that website for questions about visas. These websites generally answer the most common questions you might have about visas and provide detailed guidance on how to file for a visa and what visa categories, if any, apply to you.

, Now that you have located the consular website of the country to which you are traveling, you are in the position to find out detailed guidance on what visa category applies to you and how to file for that visa. If you are using a visa wizard, that wizard will generally ask you the following (or similarly worded) questions:What passport or travel document do you have? Depending on your answer, the wizard will take you to the next step. The next step may be the final step if the wizard determines that you do not need a visa for any reason to enter that country. E.g. if you enter “France” as the answer to this question in the UK Government’s visa wizard, you will be told in the next step that you do not need a visa for any reason to come to the UK because both states are members of the European Union.What are you coming to (name of country) to do? If you need a visa to come to the country in question, the visa wizard will then ask you this or a similarly worded question, designed to determine your purpose of travel. E.g. in the UK Government’s visa wizard, if you entered the answer to the question “What passport or travel document do you have” as “USA”, then the wizard will ask you the purpose of your travel.Click on the purpose of travel that applies to you.
Once you choose the purpose for which you are coming to the country in question, the visa wizard will tell you whether or not you need a visa, and, if so, what type of visa you require.
If you are travelling to a country whose consular website does not have a visa wizard, this information should still be available on the website. A visa wizard simply makes that same information easier to find.

, Once you have determined what visa category applies to you, fill out a visa application online. A visa application is normally available from the consular website of the country to which you intend to travel.


E.g. a non-immigrant visa application to the United States is available at https://ceac.state.gov/genniv/ while visa applications to the United Kingdom are available at https://www.visa4uk.fco.gov.uk/account/register.
These websites normally require registration, which means you provide your name, email, contact information, and you set up a username and password. Doing so helps you retrieve your application at a later date if you need to complete an incomplete application or need to check the status of a pending application.

, Most visa applications will require gathering supporting documentation, which will be used as evidence to determine your eligibility of the visa category for which you are applying.


For example, if you are applying for a student visa, you will generally require a letter from your university confirming that you have been offered a place to study there.
If you are applying for a work visa, you will normally require a letter from your employer confirming that you have been offered a job.
If you are applying for an immigrant visa based on marriage, you will have to provide evidence of your marriage, such as a certified marriage license.
If you are applying for a tourist visa, you may be asked to provide the address of where you will be staying (e.g. a hotel or relative's residence).
If you are applying for a business investment visa, you may be asked questions that seek to prove the bona fide nature of your business and to prove that your funds can be traced to a legitimate source (i.e. are not from a criminal or other illegitimate source).Check the visa wizard or information provided elsewhere on the consular website for information about the supporting documentation requirements that apply to you.

, After you have filled out your visa application, you must submit that application along with the application fee. You may submit an application and supporting documentation in person at an embassy or consulate. Alternatively, you may be expected to submit your application online and submit your supporting documentation separately by mail or in person. Follow the directions provided on the consular website carefully as to what the process is of submitting your application and supporting documentation.

, In some cases, you may be required to attend an interview with a consular officer at an embassy or consulate. At this interview, you will bring your supporting documentation, and the officer will ask you questions about the purpose of your visit and any other pertinent questions. After the interview, the officer may approve or reject your application based on your answers and supporting documentation.

, If your visa is rejected, you may be able to appeal the decision. Check the consular website of the country in question for information on the appeals process.

Try to bring food that won't make a mess in the car! Avoid jams and other sticky condiments, or any crumbly pastries or crackers.


If you're drinking anything sugary or sweet, be careful of spilling; if you can opt for a bottle with a sports top, do!;
, If you're a passenger of the car, and you have been stuffed in a serious traffic jam where the cars aren't moving at all, just roll down the window or even open the door (if you're not moving at all, and it's safe to do so), and take a breath beside your car for a second. This should help you in the following.


This can help you feel better if you're carsick, and give you a literal breath of fresh air. Making you feel better if you were car sick. If it's safe to get out, it also gives you an opportunity to stretch your legs. Keep safety in mind, though, and don't attempt to get out unless traffic is at a total standstill and has been for a long time.

, Playing a road game is a great way to get rid of the boredom. If you haven't played any road games before below are some pretty popular road games that are fun and enjoyable for everyone!



Punch Buggy is a fun and very popular road game. Where you punch (lightly) your friends/family in the arm when you see a punch buggy car, while yelling out ""punch buggy"" or ""slug bug!""

I Spy is another very popular road game where you say ""I spy with my little eye something that is..."" and you say the color of the object you've chosen, and the others have to guess what it is.
Name that tune is not really popular, but really fun to play! The way you play this is, the ""Chosen one"" starts to sing or hum to a song and the others have to guess, and the first one to guess the name of the song wins!

, Do you like to read, crochet, knit, color, or do any other hobbies with materials that are easy to transport? Bring them along and get some done while you're waiting.

, There are plenty of other things you can do while being stuck in a traffic jam! Some of the ones below are not just fun, but productive too!


Ask the driver to go to a good radio station and start calling in and get involved, or call all the radio stations and dedicate some songs to people.
No matter who’s watching you, sing along to the song on the radio at the top of your voice and dance around in your seat to the song! (Let's face it, you’re never going to see people in the jam again are you?)
Strike up a conversation with the person in the car next to you! (Pretend you know them and start by saying: “I haven’t’ seen you ages!”)
Take selfies.
Work on your to-do list.
Read a book.
Go on social media sites.

"
"
Don't get frustrated!,
Consider alternative routes.,

Talk to your passengers.",How to Handle Being Stuck in a Traffic Jam2," As the driver, you have the unique responsibility of getting you and/or the passengers to your destination safely.

, If you know that an there is a traffic jam on a road you're going to use or it's rush hour, try to find an alternative route using a G.P.S or a map. If you can avoid the jam altogether.

, Take your mind off the stress of the traffic jam by listening to something you enjoy. The more engaged you are in the listening material, the faster it'll seem like time passes.

, Just keep in mind that switching lanes only for the sake of it is likely to make the traffic jam worse; only switch if you have a real reason to or there is some kind of obstruction in your lane.

, If the traffic is extremely bad most people recommend just waiting until the next exit lane, and finding the nearest fast food restaurant and just eating there until traffic gets better.

, It's easy to get frustrated as a driver in a traffic jam. Deep breathing can help you stay calm and feel more focused.

, If the traffic is really at a standstill, it's fairly safe to let your mind wander, just a little. It's a good time to get your creative juices flowing; make your mental to-do list or start brainstorming solutions to the problems you've got at work or home. Just be ready to jump back into action when traffic starts moving.

, If you're not driving solo, strike up a conversation or participate in a road game with them. Again, just be ready to focus on driving once you get rolling."

, If your dog has never been microchipped, you may want to have your vet insert one in your dog. It is a quick and relatively painless procedure, usually administered into the shoulder, that could end up saving your dog's life. If your dog already has a microchip, contact the microchip registry and ensure that your address and contact information are all up to date.Microchips protect your dog in case she slips out of her collar. In the event that your dog gets lost, any veterinarian or dog pound employee who scans your dog will be able to tell her unique registration number and a phone number for the registry where your dog is registered.Dogs microchipped in the last few years will have received a universal microchip, which can be detected on any scanner in any state. Older microchips were brand-specific to a certain type of scanner. Ask your veterinarian or the microchip registry company about the type of chip used on your dog to ensure it is a universal chip.

, If you've moved, changed phone numbers, or changed your name (through marriage or legal re-naming), you'll need to update the tag on your dog's collar. You can have tags made at most pet stores, or find a service online.


Be sure your dog's collar includes a county rabies registration tag.
Use your cell phone number on your dog's tag instead of your home phone number. If you're traveling, it will be much easier for anyone who finds your dog to get in touch with you through your cell phone number., Depending on which states you will be traveling through, you and your pet may be subjected to certain rules and restrictions. You can learn about these rules by checking the Road Traffic Authority Road Rules, or the equivalent agency in the states you will be traveling through.If you are driving across international borders, check with the Department of Agriculture or a similar government agency in the country you will be entering. There may be additional rules and requirements, including forms or records required for entry/re-entry.

, Before you hit the road, it's important to plan out your route in advance. Look for places along the way where your dog will be able to relieve herself, like rest stops or dog parks. If you'll be spending the night at any hotels along the way, call ahead to ensure that dogs are permitted in your room.Many hotels have dog-friendly rooms, but not every room will be dog-friendly. These are often set aside in a block for travelers with dogs, and may fill up fast around big travel holidays. Be sure to call in advance and reserve a dog-friendly room so you know you won't be left without accommodations.

, If your dog is not used to traveling by car, or has never been on a long road trip beyond local travel, she may need some exposure to car travel. Start out with short trips if she's never been in a car before and gradually increase the length and duration of your drives in the weeks leading up to your actual road trip., Your dog will need food and water just as she normally does at home. Be sure to bring enough food for the duration of the trip, numerous bottles of clean drinking water, and bowls for your dog to eat/drink out of.Consider bringing your dog's bowls from home so that she recognizes the familiar artifact from home.

, If your dog is currently taking any medications, be sure to pack enough medicine for the trip. If your dog is taking heart worm and flea medicines and you will be traveling around the day you usually administer these medications, you'll want to bring those as well., Even if your dog has traveled extensively, she may get anxious being away from home. You can alleviate your dog's anxiety by bringing some of her favorite comforts from home. Pack your dog's favorite toy, pillow, and any blankets or bedding she sleeps on, and make sure she has access to these items in the car.Whether your dog is in a crate or in the backseat, be sure she has access to a blanket to curl up under. It may help calm your dog's nerves if she gets upset or uneasy during travel., You'll need a leash to walk your dog during rest stops, but that may not be enough to secure your dog safely during the actual travel portions of your trip. Some pet experts recommend using a travel harness/seatbelt built for dogs to prevent your pet from sliding around in the backseat or trying to climb up into your lap. Ask your vet or a qualified dog trainer what would be ideal for your dog on the road.Don't forget to bring plastic waste bags and/or a waste scoop to pick up after your pet during rest stops., Your dog will need regular bathroom breaks - in fact, she may need to stop more often than she goes at home due to stress and/or motion. Keep your dog on-leash during all breaks and make sure she has sufficient time, as an exciting or unfamiliar environment may make it difficult for her to pass waste., If you make stops along the way, do not under any circumstances leave your dog alone in the vehicle. Even in mild weather, a dog can experience severe health problems and even death as a result of being left unattended in a vehicle.Even if you open the windows during warm weather, your dog can still develop a heat stroke over a relatively short period of time.Cold weather can be just as dangerous as hot weather. Leaving your dog alone in a cold car during winter can cause hypothermia and may lead to death.

, Many dogs instinctively want to stick their heads out the window, but this can cause injury if any rocks or debris go flying up off the road. The increased airflow can also harm a dog's lungs if she's allowed to keep her head out the window. Instead, keep your dog safely secured in the backseat, and if you open the windows be sure they're not open enough that your dog can fit her head outside."

Know your providers.,
Search through online travel sites.,
Join rental car loyalty programs.,
Look for discount or referral codes.",How to Get the Best Deal on a Rental Car," Not all rental car companies are created equal and it is important to understand how each is unique and how they can serve you best. Things to consider before deciding on a particular car rental company includes prices, car types available, service fees, and locations. All of these can drastically change your car rental experience. Consider which factors are most important to you, if it is price, you may need to sacrifice luxury. If it is convenience, you may need to sacrifice price. If it is car model, you may need to sacrifice convenience of rental location. Certain companies are famous for adhering to particular requests, such as:


National and Budget allow you to rent one-way while most others charge an extra fee.
Hertz and Enterprise are known for offering an extra level of service which picks you up before and drops you off after your rental which none of the other companies do. They have many locations in urban and suburban areas, which is extremely convenient for people who do not have a car.;
, This includes Orbitz, Expedia, Kayak, TravelAuto and others. The major online agencies negotiate with the car rental companies to offer competitive rates. Since they are always competing for your business, you can often get better deals than in person or over the phone. Keep in mind, like airfare, the further in advance you book the more your will save yourself money. Also, try using flexible dates to get better pricing. This also allows you to compare rates of dozens of car companies without much effort, such as:


Orbitz is particularly good because they allow you to add discount codes to your search and get even lower rates.
The meta-search engines like Kayak and Mobissimo may help you to figure out which agent or company has the best deal in one-step.
Travelauto allows car renters to directly interact with the service provider, which helps you in getting any other additional information required. In addition, Travelauto lists the car rental hot deal worldwide to avail better rates and discounts.

, By joining Nationals Emerald Club or Alamo’s Quicksilver Club you can earn free days or, as an alternative, points or miles. The car rental's programs sometimes give preferred deals that are not available through other channels. The more you use this card, the more discounts you will get. However, this means you may be missing competitive rates to build up points for later. So consider the average car rental pricing before deciding to commit to a particular car rental company.

, These discount codes are often available to you through your rewards programs, credit card services, and car associations. Most of them have either discounts, miles or points that you can earn. These companies and associations work hard for you to keep you loyal and they always have a steady stream of new offers, discounts and rewards to save you money. Often times they make a small percentage on the deals you take through them so they are always incentivized to negotiate good deals for you.


If do not want to go to these sites individually, DealMine.com has many of them searchable all in one site so you can compare the best deal for you based on where you belong.
American Express, for example, will cover the insurance on any car you rent. This means you don't need to buy insurance through your car rental company. They also offer deals for customers through their rewards programs.

Hold onto it, as you will need to submit a copy with your application to change your status.However, paper I-94 forms are not issued if you enter the country by air or sea port. Instead, you will have to print off a copy by visiting the U.S. Customs and Border Protection website.At the website, you can enter your name, date of birth, passport number, and the name of the country that issued your passport.;
, Not everyone can change their status, In particular, you cannot change your status if you’ve done something wrong while in the country. For example, the following may disqualify you:You entered the country unlawfully. If you snuck in and then got your tourist visa, you aren’t eligible to change your status.
You committed a crime inside the United States.
You did something other than act as a tourist. For example, if you already started working on a tourist visa, then USCIS will not change your status.

, You can change from a B-2 tourist visa to many different visa categories. A complete list is available from USCIS. However, the most common visas are the following:


Work visas. There are many categories of work visas. Some are for temporary workers, intracompany transferees, or for athletes and entertainers.Student visas. If you want to study at a vocational school or a college or university, then you will need either an M visa (vocational) or F visa (academic).

, In order to work in the U.S., there has to be a visa available in your worker category. For example, the U.S. government allots only so many H-1B visas in a year. The employer also has to complete paperwork in order to get permission to hire a foreign worker. You should talk with the employer about getting the visa.If you are approved for a work visa, then you will need to complete Form I-539 if you have children or a spouse who want to stay with you in the U.S. as you work.

, You must complete Form I-539, “Application to Change Nonimmigrant Status.” This form is available online. You should download the form and its instructions.You can also order a form by calling USCIS at 1-800-870-3676.

the country that issued your passport
any travel document numbers
your I-94 record number
the date you want your change of status to be effective
details about prior applications to USCIS
details about your criminal background
your signature under penalty of perjury (required)

, You need to provide background information to USCIS so that they will feel confident that you are not trying to stay in the U.S. permanently. You should draft an “affidavit,” which is a statement signed under penalty of perjury.You can set the affidavit up like a business letter.

, You need to tell USCIS why you want a change from a tourist visa to your new status, as a worker, student, or something else. Go into as much detail as possible.


For example, you might have suddenly been offered a job in the U.S. because of a contact you made at a social gathering. You should provide the person’s name, details about the job, and when it would start.

, Also provide details about your departure.USCIS will feel reassured that you aren’t intending to stay in the U.S. indefinitely if you can point to the date you intend to leave.


You don’t have to book a flight home. However, you should provide a date and show that you know flights leave your city for your home country on that date.

, You also need to explain how you will support yourself financially while in the U.S.The U.S. government doesn’t want you in the country if you need to use public assistance or other welfare programs. Accordingly, identify your income:


your savings
student loans or grants (if you are changing to student status)
proposed salary (if you are trying to get a work visa)
family support

, Let USCIS know why you will be returning to your home country even if your visa status is changed. For example, you could tell them that your family is back in your home country living in your house and that your job is only temporary so that you can learn new skills.


If you are young and applying for a student visa, then it can be difficult to establish strong ties with your home country. USCIS is aware of this. Nevertheless, you should explain that your family lives in your home country and that you intend to return there., You should support statements made in your affidavit with documents, if possible. For example, you should look for the following, which you could submit with your application:Bank accounts or pay stubs to show that you have enough money to support yourself in the U.S.
An affidavit from friends or relatives stating that they will support you while you are in the U.S.
Property records showing you have a home in your home country.
A letter from a foreign employer, stating you have a job waiting for you when you return to your home country.

, Just above your signature line, you should include the words “I certify under penalty of perjury under United States law that I know the contents of this affidavit and that the information contained within it is true and correct.”, When you applied for your tourist visa, you may have told the U.S. Embassy that you were interested in becoming a student. If you did, then a special notation should have been entered on your visa.You can still apply to change your status even if you don’t have the notation. However, you should explain in your affidavit how and why you suddenly became interested in becoming a student while in the U.S.

, You should gain admission to a college or vocational school first. Most educational institutions have offices for international students. You should stop in. Someone in the office can guide you through the process.

diploma
standardized test scores
your admission letter to the U.S. college, university, or vocational school

, Ideally, you apply for a change of status before your visa expires. However, unforeseen circumstances might have prevented you. In this situation, you will need to get evidence of these circumstances, which could include:A medical emergency. If you fell sick or were in an accident, then your visa might have expired before you could apply for a change of status. In this case, get proof of the medical injury—doctor and hospital records, as well as medical bills.
Theft. You might have had your passport and other documents stolen from you. If so, get a copy of the police report that you filed.
Error in your application. You might have filed a timely application to change your status. However, the application might have been inadequate in some way and been returned to you (e.g., for forgetting the filing fee).

, There is a $290 application fee. You can pay by check or money order, payable to “U.S. Department of Homeland Security.” Do not use abbreviations like “DHS” or “USDHS”., Take your completed I-539, supporting documents, and I-94 and make a complete copy of your packet. This copy will be for your records. Then slide the complete application into a sturdy envelope.

, The address sometimes changes, so you should call USCIS 1-800-375-5283 to get the current address to send your completed application.Unfortunately, electronic submission is currently unavailable.You should mail using certified mail, return receipt requested, or by using a courier service such as UPS or FedEx., You have to wait for your visa to be approved before you can either accept a job or enroll in a college or vocational school. If you don’t wait, then you are breaking the law and your change of visa status will be denied., USCIS might need additional documents, or they might want to talk with you, so they may schedule an interview. Provide all requested information as promptly as possible., After submitting your application, you should have received a receipt from USCIS. This receipt should have included an estimate of when USCIS would make a decision.USCIS should send you its decision in the mail.


Your I-94 might expire before USCIS has made a decision. Technically, you are now considered “out of status” and in the country illegally. However, USCIS will not start any removal proceedings until it has made a decision on your application.If your change of status is denied, then your current visa may be immediately cancelled and you will have to return home.

Watch movies.,
Listen to music.,
Read books.

,
If you have trouble reading books, watching movies or playing games in the car, try blocking the motion outside by cupping your hands over your eyes before feeling ill, so you see only the inside of the car but no motion outside the car.,
Play games.",How to Enjoy a Car Trip," A lot of people buy fancy DVD players for their cars, and end up using them once a year! But you don't need a DVD player for watching movies, all you need is a laptop (that plays DVD's), a laptop charger, and a DC-AC Converter. A DC-AC converter takes the power from your cigarette lighter to a normal AC Power outlet. So on the trip, your laptop will have full battery. Plug the DC-AC Converter into the cigarette lighter, plug your laptop charger into the DC-AC converter, then plug the Laptop charger to the Laptop and viola! You have a DVD player!;
, Who doesn't like music? A nice way to listen to music without continually switching CDs is to buy a car cassette adapter for an iPod. All you do is plug it in to the headphone jack and put the cassette into your cassette player and you will have music filling your car. If you have a car with no cassette player, you can use an FM transmitter. An FM transmitter is a device you plug into your MP3 player and all you do is set a radio station on the device and any radio a few yards away can hear the music coming from your MP3 Player to the desired radio station. Or if you want to listen privately you can do so very easily by listening via headphones.

,, Make sure to keep the motion fully out of site, as even a little motion can cause car sickness. This can also be accomplished with motion sickness eyewear, which blocks motion flashing by outside the car from your field of vision.

, Some car games are addictive and some can be quite boring. Take your pick:



The Name Game: Someone thinks of a letter and you go in a circle, saying a name that begins with that letter. The one who can't find a name first loses.

Scavenger Hunt: Each passenger makes a list of things to find during a trip, such as a red house or a certain type of car. They switch lists and look for everything on each of them. The game can be challenging if you make it that way!

Ghost: Someone starts with naming a letter, the next person has to name a letter also, but it has to be in the order of a real word. The one who finishes the word loses. If you think someone is just saying random letters, you can challenge them. Once you do that, if the person says a real word they were spelling, the person who challenged them would be out. If the challenging was successful, the person who got challenged would be out.

The License Plate Game: A group of people try to find abbreviations for the 3 letters on a license plate. Such as a license plate that had the letters BFH: you could say ""Big Fat Hippo!""

The License Plate Game #2: This is another version of The License Plate Game. You find a license plate and make a word out of the 3 letters by adding letters in-between the letters. The letters have to be in order! So if you see a license plate that goes CMA you can say, ""Camera!"" or ""Coma!""

The License Plate Game #3: This is also another version of The License Plate Game. When someone sees a license that is from another state they say the state and punch the other person playing. (Remember not to punch too hard!)

20 Questions: One person thinks of a noun and another person tries to guess it in under 20 ""Yes or No"" questions.

Yes and No: Simple- one person tries to make another person say yes or no.

Casserole: A game where a person tells a story, and during the story they have to say ""casserole!"" Once the person says casserole, all the people listening have to say ""casserole."" The first one to say it gets to start another story.

Three Words: You first pick a category, like animals or sports. All the people playing have to choose a subject from that category, like soccer, or football. Then you pick a person to be ""It"". The person being ""It"" must say someone else's subject three times before the other person says their subject. If the ""It"" person says the subject 3 times before the person with that subject says it, then the person will be ""It"". However if the ""It"" person says the subject 3 times during the person with that subject saying their subject, the ""It"" person remains ""It"".

I Spy: One person looks for an object inside or outside the car. After they find an object they say ""I spy with my little eye something that begins with..."". Then you have to say the first letter of the object. The first person who finds out the object is ""It"".

Honey If You Love Me... : In this game one person is supposed to ask another person in the funniest way ""Honey, I love you, won't you please, please smile?"" And the other person without smiling or laughing must say : ""Honey, I love you, but I just can't smile"". As easy at it seems, it is really hard to not laugh, especially if you play with a group of the same gender as you.

Sign Game: All you have to do is find the letters of your name, one by one by looking at billboards, signs, or posters. First to find all the letters in their name wins! You must find them in order of your name! So, if your name is Colin you must find them like C-O-L-I-N not L-I-C-O-N.

Alphabet Signs: Look at signs or licence plates on the way and try to find the letters A-Z. The first person to get there wins, and the once a letter has been found somewhere, it can't be used from that location again

Picnic Game: The first player starts off by saying ""I'm bringing A____ (a word that starts with the letter A, most likely a food product but not necessarily) to the picnic"". The second player then repeats the A word and adds something that starts with B that they will bring to the picnic. The next player repeats both A and B, and adds a C. The game continues until the letter Z is reached and each player repeats the entire list correctly!

Alphabet Conversation Alphabet conversation is a game that involves improvisation, which means thinking on the spot. The first player will start a conversation by starting a sentence with the beginning word the first letter of the alphabet. Then the 2nd player would respond to that with a sentence that starts with a word that starts with the 2nd letter of the alphabet and so on. No saying Ummmm... Or Hmmm.

Words that Relate: This is usually played in internet forums as well. Someone chooses a word, and then someone next to them has to say another word that relates to that word. The next person has to say a word that relates to that word, and so on and so forth. To make it more challenging, you can make it so that you can't say the same word twice.
The Guessing Game:"" One player has to think about a thing, holiday, or something else, and you have to say you're thinking about (the subject of which you're thinking of). For example, if your thinking about cake, say ""I'm thinking about a dessert"" and they have to guess what it is. You can play easy or hard. To play easy, you play the same, but each person gets 2-5 hints. To play hard, play the same, but the players only get 0-1 hints.

For example, if you are a U.S. citizen, you are eligible to apply for a working holiday visa to Singapore, New Zealand, Australia, South Korea, and Ireland. You cannot apply for a working holiday visa to any other countries as a U.S. citizen.The eligibility will vary depending on which country you are a citizen of. For example, if you have an EU passport, you are likely eligible to work in many European countries without a working holiday visa.
You can find a list of countries and the citizenships eligible for a working visa online.;
, Most countries will have an age restriction attached to their working holiday visas, usually around 18-30 years of age. Check the government website for a specific country to see if they have age restrictions on working holiday visas.For example, Australia, New Zealand, and South Korea only allow U.S. citizens between the ages of 18-30 to apply for the visa. Ireland, however, has no age restrictions for U.S. citizens applying for a working holiday visa to Ireland.

, To apply for a working holiday visa to most countries, you will need to show you have the funds to live in the country without work for several months. This requirement ensures that you will be able to do support yourself while you are in the country, even as you look for work. The amount of money you will need to have in your account before you apply for the visa can vary from $5,000-$10,000 USD, depending on the country’s requirements.Keep in mind that though you are required to have a certain amount of money saved before you apply for the working holiday visa, not all countries will check that you have this. You may or may not be required to show proof of your finances, depending on which country you are applying to for the visa.
It is a good idea to have a sufficient amount of savings set aside before you apply for the visa. Even if it is not a requirement to be in good financial standing as part of your application, having savings set aside can make living in a foreign country much more feasible.

, Most countries do not require you to have a job already lined up in order to qualify for a working holiday visa. However, you should be prepared to find a job quickly once you arrive in the country. Prepare a resume focused on the field you are interested in and send out resumes to potential employers in the country. Visit employers in your area and hand out resumes in person after you have arrived.Many travellers will apply to teach English, do hospitality work, or work as au pairs. Do a search of the more popular positions for foreigners on a working holiday visa in the country you want to go to. This will give you an idea of the types of jobs you can apply for once you are in the country.

, Many countries will require you to have proof of your student status as a recent graduate or a current student at an accredited university. You will also need a current, valid passport to your home country.You will need to be in good standing at your university or college, especially if you are a current student. Having good grades at your former or current university or college will improve your chances of getting a visa.

, The most affordable and least competitive working holiday visas you can apply for as a U.S. citizen are to Australia and New Zealand. They have a thriving job market, which may make it easier for you to find work once you get to the country. Some countries are ideal if your skills are in specific areas, such as tech or communications, as there are usually more open positions in this area.For example, New Zealand may be a good option if you are interested in working in the agricultural or horticultural sector, as they offer extensions on working holiday visas if you get a job in this area.
Working holiday visas to Singapore are more competitive to get, but you may pursue the visa if you are interested in traveling to this country and feel you have a strong application.
Keep in mind some countries will have restrictions around the sectors you can work in. In South Korea, for example, you cannot work in law, medicine, or journalism with a working holiday visa.

, Depending on the country you are applying to for the visa, you may be able to do the application online. Search online to find the online application for your chosen country, often on their government website. Many countries will allow you to save your application online and return to it later or edit it before you submit it.If you are required to complete the application by hand and mail it in, make sure you write clearly and legibly. Use block print, write in pen, and correct any mistakes with white-out to ensure the application is easy to read.

, Many applications for a working holiday visa will require background information from you, such as your full name, date of birth, home address, and contact information. You may need to provide copies of your passport and your citizenship card.The application may also require you to show proof of your finances, including proof that you have a certain amount of money in your bank account. Provide bank statements as proof of this information.
You will also need to have travel insurance before you travel to the country. Some countries, like Australia or New Zealand, may not require proof that you have travel insurance as part of your application. You should have travel insurance anyway to make sure you are protected when you travel abroad.

, The fee for processing the application can vary from $150-$500 USD. Make sure you budget for the application fee and pay it in full to ensure your application can be processed.Keep in mind that this is a non-refundable fee. If for some reason your application for the working holiday visa is not approved, you do not get the fee back.

, The working holiday visa for Australia and New Zealand can be sent in online and are often processed within days or hours. Singapore and other countries can be sent in online but have a longer processing time.Check if there is a note on the application that you can send it in online. Often, this is done to help speed up the process, especially for countries like Australia and New Zealand, which are popular places to apply.

, Some countries require you to mail in your application or submit it in person to a country’s consulate or embassy. If so, make sure you mail in the application in as soon as you graduate from school or within six months of doing so. This way, your application gets submitted within the required time and you can get your work visa sooner than later.Make sure you have the correct address and postage on the application before you put it in the mail.

, If you submitted your application online, you will likely find out if your application has been approved within a month. If you send your application in by mail or by submitting it in person, it may take longer than a month to process. Call the embassy or consulate within a few weeks to check on the status of your application if you do not hear back from them.If you are approved for the visa for Australia or New Zealand, you will receive the visa electronically. You can then present a printed out copy as you go through customs.
For other countries, you may need to pick up your visa in the form of a pass once you are in the country.

Bring disposable pre-moistened body wipes.,
Reduce stress with deep-breathing exercises.Travelling long distances in a car can be stressful for both your body and mind.",How to Be Comfortable on a Long Car Ride As a Passenger1," The other passengers may want the car to be colder or warmer than you find comfortable, so bring a few layers with you, too. This will allow you to adjust to any temperature. For instance, you can dress in a comfortable cotton t-shirt, but bring a long-sleeved button up or loose-fitting hoodie with you, as well. Wear soft socks and shoes you can slide off easily.


If you get hot easily, consider wearing a tank top beneath your t-shirt – that way you can lose a layer, if need be. Consider packing a handheld fan, also.
If you’re travelling in winter or to a much colder climate, be sure to bring your mittens, coat and a warm hat with you.;
, A small travel pillow can be a great comfort on a road trip. You can prop it up against the window and lean on it, put it behind your head or put it between your lower back and the seat to support your spine and prevent back pain.Take along a light blanket or two, as well. Choose blankets that can fit easily in the car and be folded up and put away easily.


Avoid bringing huge, fluffy blankets. They take up too much room and could end up making you feel claustrophobic.

, Riding in a car for hours on end can make you feel sticky and in need of a shower. Some trips may even be so long that you won’t have access to a shower for a day or two. You can freshen up easily while you’re on the go with pre-moistened body wipes. Buy disposable wipes that are alcohol-free – they are kinder to your skin. Look for travel wipes that come in resealable packaging for ease of use.Keep the wipes nearby, in your bag or backpack, so you can reach for them at any time. Always dispose of them after one use.
Bring the wipes in with you at rest stops so that you can wipe yourself down more thoroughly in the privacy of the bathroom.

, Simple deep-breathing exercises can help and they’re easy to do any time you want. Inhale slowly through your nose as you count to five. Then exhale slowly through your mouth as you count to five. Repeat. Do this for a few minutes at a time, whenever you’re feeling anxious or tense.


Make sure to take deep breaths from your belly – this expands your diaphragm and allows for the greatest oxygen intake.
If you’ve meditated in the past, you can pair the deep breathing exercises with mini-meditation breaks.

Your sketches don’t have to be masterpieces – just have fun with them. You’ll be inside a moving vehicle anyway, which could interfere, so keep that in mind.
If you’re journaling, be sure to put your notebook away in your bag or backpack after you write in it, so the content stays private.

, Travelling with multiple passengers on a long car trip can present a challenge because they probably aren't going to agree on everything, especially when it comes to what's playing on the car stereo.

Bring sunglasses and sunscreen.,
Take water and healthy snacks on the road.,
Alternate driving duties.",How to Be Comfortable on a Long Car Ride As a Passenger3," Anti-nausea medication is a must if you get motion sickness. Even if you typically don’t experience nausea while traveling, pack some anti-nausea medication just in case. Keep in mind that many brands will make you drowsy, so check the label first. Reading or listening to music for long periods of time can cause headaches – take breaks every few hours and have headache mediation like aspirin or ibuprofen on hand.

A basic first-aid kit is also helpful to have with you on road trips., It’s important to stop every few hours while you’re travelling to use the restroom, stretch your legs and walk around a bit, which will get your blood circulating normally.

Get out of the car and walk around briefly. Do some light stretching.

, While you’re sitting in the car, remember to move around periodically and switch positions occasionally. Even adjusting the position of your seat every now and then can help to prevent aches and pains. Get the blood flowing in your legs by pumping your ankles and move your arms around to improve blood flow and circulation., Remember to sit up straight in your seat and make sure you have lower back support. Use a small travel pillow between your lower back and the seat if you need extra lumbar support. If you have your head bent down in order to read, make sure to stop periodically and stretch your neck.

, Not all cars have tinted windows, and long hours of day-travelling can lead to a lot of squinting in bright sunlight and sun exposure. If you’re travelling in areas with a lot of snow, the bright light and glare can be even worse, which can result in discomfort, headaches and even sun burns. Be sure to pack a pair of comfortable sunglasses. If you catch yourself squinting, put them on.


Bring sunscreen and apply it to your arms, face and any other areas of exposed skin while travelling., If you leave for a road trip with no water or snacks in the car, you will end up stopping for fast food, soda and other unhealthy fare along the way. Bring a small, portable cooler with you and pack it with water and healthy snacks to keep your energy up while you’re travelling.Avoid drinking alcohol while travelling, which can lead to fatigue, nausea and dehydration.

, If you are traveling with a group, share the driving duties with the other passengers. That way, one person doesn't have to shoulder the entire responsibility. Come up with a system of rotation and switch out every few hundred miles. Since you're stopping to switch drivers periodically, this also gives everyone a chance to get out and stretch their legs.

Hang up clothes when reaching destination.",How to Fold Clothes for Travel1," This method can reduce wrinkles and save space. The U.S. military uses this for their soldiers. It's a great way to fit more things into your bag, especially if you're trying to lighten your load.








This method works especially well for shorts, socks, synthetic T-shirts and tank tops, some pajamas and sweats.

For nice shirts, smooth and fold so that shoulders are almost touching. Fold up bottom third, fold top down so that it overlaps with bottom. Flip over and smooth out. place hand between fold and smooth bunched fabric, if any. Roll up by starting at the hem.

, Make sure to avoid bunching and wrinkles by smoothing them beforehand and as you're rolling. These are good to put on the bottom of your case because they will be more secure (and they are usually bigger than t-shirts and undergarments).









For nice trousers, place them on the flat surface and smooth so it's free of wrinkles. Fold one leg over the other, fold in half from the cuffs up. Smooth again. Begin to roll up from the folded knee.
Place non-trouser clothing (skirts or dresses) face-down on a flat surface. Smooth to avoid any bunching of the fabric. Fold the clothing lengthwise so that one half is covering the other half. Smooth again. Fold from the bottom, so hem touches the neckline. Begin to roll from the bottom.
For winter jacket, zip it and lay it flat. Fold each sleeve backward and fold the jacket in half vertically. Roll it from the edge to the collar, trying to squeeze air out of it. You can secure it with a string or large rubber band.

, If you hang up your clothes (or at least hang up the nice ones) it will ensure that they stay wrinkle-free. Typically the clothes in this method get wrinkly because you end up rooting around in your bag and messing everything up. Hanging up the clothes will avoid this problem.

Break out your favorite CDs from childhood.,
Tackle a tough read with an audiobook.,
Give podcasts a try.,
Browse the local radio stations.",How to Be Entertained While on a Long Drive1," While your taste in music has probably changed since you were a kid, you may still have those old CDs stashed somewhere. A long drive can be a great time for a walk down memory lane. Grab a handful of CDs you haven’t listened to in years and see if you can still sing along to all of the words.


You can also take some of your current favorites, borrow new music from a friend, or check out something random from the library.
If you prefer an MP3 player over CDs, consider playing it on shuffle and see if you are surprised by some of the music you forgot you had on there.
When travelling with kids, bring some CDs of silly songs kids like to sing along to. Or if they are older, let them play some of the music they like.;
, If you love to read, you probably have that one book you know you should read but have been avoiding. A long trip can be a great time to listen to an audiobook, especially of a book you can’t make yourself read. You get to experience the story without the potential boredom of hours of reading.Most public libraries have a large assortment of audiobooks on CD, which you could check out. You can also download from sites like Audible. Some libraries may even have digital audiobooks for streaming or download.
There are all kinds of audiobooks that are kid-friendly, so consider finding a story kids and adults both could enjoy.
You don’t have to just choose a difficult book. You could check out the latest best-seller or something a friend has recommended that you’ve put off for too long already.

, Although podcasts have been around for years, many people are still unfamiliar with them. These are scripted or unscripted audio recordings. Podcasts often have celebrity interviews but can also be done by people who are not otherwise famous. Searching in iTunes or the Google Play Store will give you nearly unlimited options.You can download podcasts that discuss the latest in sports, music podcasts that include full songs or clips, or serialized podcasts that tell a narrative in each episode. If you have a hobby or interest, there is most likely a podcast that will suit your taste.

, If you are far from home, check out what music stations are playing in the locale you’re driving through. You might assume that radio is basically the same everywhere, but you might be surprised by what you find being played. Even if you don’t settle on a station, or if none have good enough reception, it’s a fun way to take a break from whatever else you’re listening to."

Layer clothing around a core element to create a bundle.,
Form a pillow shape with the pouch.,
Begin piling clothes to surround the filled pouch.,
Layer skirts or dresses on top of the jacket.,
Add the pouch to the center of the clothing pile.,
Wrap and tuck the trouser legs around the bundle.,
Place the bundle of clothes in your suitcase.",How to Fold Clothes for Travel2," A rectangular, flat organizer pouch can work as this core element. Its size and centered position in the bundle depends on the amount of clothes you are packing.








The organizer pouch is basically just a rectangular shaped pouch with different organizing pockets. It's a great place to store things like smaller items that can get lost in your bag., Put soft items, such as underwear, socks, a swimsuit and a laundry bag, into the pouch to form a pillow shape. Do not stuff the pouch with items, because this will make it too bulky.








, Start with a heavier item, such as a jacket, laid out on a bed or other flat surface. Smooth out wrinkles in the clothes as you go.









Most garments will lie face up. Only tailored jackets should lie face down with the sleeves positioned as naturally as possible. This is because of the tailoring in the shoulders of jackets, which if you do it face-up will cause them to wrinkle.

, Fold skirts in half lengthwise. They should alternately be oriented left and right as they are added.








Follow with (buttoned) long-sleeved shirts and T-shirts that alternate pointing up and down. The shirt collars should line up with the armpits of the next shirt.
Add pants (trousers) or slacks, alternately oriented left and right.
Include any sweaters or knit garments, alternating up or down in orientation. Place any shorts on top.

, Try to align its edges with the shirt collars and waistbands of skirts. This is ensure that the bundle doesn't fall apart when you try to place it in your case.








, Wrap clothing tightly to avoid wrinkles but do not stretch out the clothes. Wrap both sleeves and the bottom of each shirt or sweater around the pouch. Tuck in long sleeves around and under the pouch.








, Secure the bundle in place with tie-down straps for your luggage. Your bundle and your suitcase is ready to go and should be wrinkle free.









The only irritating thing about this method is that you have to unpack the entire bundle to get the things you need. Best thing to do is hang up your clothes when you get to your destination.

Wear your heaviest pair.,
Use a shoe bag.,
Stuff with them with socks.,
Tie the shoes to the outside of your case.",How to Fold Clothes for Travel3," Your heaviest and biggest shoes are the ones that are going to cause the most problems. Either leave them at home (unless you're going somewhere really cold or wet) or wear them while you're traveling.








, A shoe bag can keep shoes away from your clothes so that they don't dirty your clothes up. If you put the shoes in the bottom of your case, then they'll be more likely to stay secure and to not be as irritating.








, Do not waste the space inside of your shoes. Fill them with socks, or place your fragile items in there. A lot of people forget that the insides of their shoes are just wasted space.









You can also bring shoes that you're not that fond of, or that are on their last legs. Then you can leave them behind when you're packing to return home.

, This doesn't work as well if you have to check them for a flight, but it's a great space saver if you're going with a carry-on or taking some other mode of transportation.









try to tie them so that they don't hit you constantly, or hit other people.

Create a story one sentence at a time.,
Make your trip a scavenger hunt.,
Play the alphabet game with kids.,
Put each passenger in the “hot seat.” Take turns going around and asking each other questions that have to be answered.,
Play license plate baseball.",How to Be Entertained While on a Long Drive2," Start with the driver giving the first line of a story they make up. Then go clockwise through the passengers and have each person say the next sentence of the story. You can try working together to follow a logical pattern, or some players may think of something crazy to challenge the person after them.The idea is to think quickly and keep the story moving, so have a reasonable time limit on how long each player gets to say their sentence.
If you play multiple times, rotate who starts the story, or let people jump in with their sentence in a random order.
This is a great game for kids because they can make the story extra silly. It gives them a chance to engage their minds when the drive gets boring.

, Before your trip, come up with a list of things you hope you will see along the way. Take the list with you, maybe even a copy for each passenger, and mark things off as you see them. You can even have a disposable camera with you to take pictures as you see the thing. If you have time, you can stop and stand by the things for the picture.Examples might be a round barn, a windmill, a rock formation, an RV, animals, towns in other states with the same name as your hometown, or a courthouse. You can come up with wild things that you’d never expect like a lion or a robot.
You can make the items as general or specific as you want. For example you might say “a cow” or you might say “a brown cow.” You could say “a park” or “a park with a playground.” This makes some items harder to find.
You could also put the items on a bingo grid and have everyone try to get bingo with the items.
If kids are playing, the prize for getting the most items or a bingo might be letting them pick the restaurant when you stop to eat. Or you could have an actual prize for them like a candy bar or a small toy.

, Starting with A, look around at signs, buildings, license plates, and anything with letters, and find each letter in the alphabet. Whoever gets to Z first wins that round.A good way to make the game harder is to say that the letter has to be at the beginning of the word. So you could use the B from Boat but not from Stable.

, Each passenger is allowed one skip during the game. Depending on how well you know each other, you can make them very personal questions to tease each other, or more general to get to know each other better.A personal question might be, “Who in this car would you want to kiss?” Or “What is something embarrassing that happened to you this week?”
Good questions to get to know each other might be “What hobbies do you have?” “What is your dream job?” or “Where are some places you have travelled to before now?”
This can be a risky game if some people want to push the limits with their questions. It might be good to agree not to ask questions that are going to make the rest of the drive uncomfortable.

, Before you start the game, every person chooses a number 0-9. You play nine innings, and each inning is a vehicle that you pass on the highway. Look at the license plates as you pass and if your number is on it, you get 1 point. If the number is there twice, or more, you get that many points. Whoever has the most after you pass 9 cars wins.


You can adjust the rules, as you wish. You can make it any car you see and play for a certain time limit. Or you can make it only cars that pass you.
Be sure everyone says out loud what their number is going to be so that no one tries to cheat.

Use voice-to-text software to start writing something.,
Take a scenic route when you have the time.,
Make spontaneous stops.,
Get to know the other passengers.",How to Be Entertained While on a Long Drive3," Maybe you have an idea for a blog that you have been meaning to start, or you want to write a book but can’t find time. Use software your phone already has or download some and start speaking what you want to write. You could also use this option to write a letter or email to friends and family.This type of software does not always catch your words exactly right, so you will have to proofread what you write before doing anything with it. But this is a good way to get a start and get a lot of content down quickly.
Make sure you are being safe anytime you handle your phone while driving. Start the software at a point when you are not driving.

, Long drives often end up being mostly highways and interstates, which are faster but can often become very boring. If you don’t mind taking a longer drive, consider using smaller roads that offer more scenery. You may drive a bit farther and take longer, but the drive will be more enjoyable than faster routes.This is probably best done if you are a very good navigator or have GPS handy so that you make sure you still get where you are going without getting lost. You don’t want to get stuck on back country roads with no idea how to get back to the highway.
If you have kids who are old enough to read a map, you can let them choose the route you take. Make sure you double check to be sure you are still going in the right direction.

, If you have some time to spare, or you just need a quick break from driving, stop at some attraction you see signs for along the roadway. There might be a local museum, a state or national park, or a unique attraction like the giant ball of yarn or Carhenge. Almost anywhere you drive will have something interesting you can stop and look at.


This doesn’t necessarily have to be completely spontaneous. You could look ahead at your basic route and see if there is anything interesting to stop and see along the way.
Even if you don’t see a sign advertising anything, you could choose an exit to take and just see if there is anything interesting in the area around the exit.
Allow kids to point out attractions they see that look interesting and stop at them. You could say that each kid gets to pick out one stop along way.

, If you are on a long trip with a couple people you don’t know very well, take the opportunity to find out more about them. You may have to push the conversation forward at the beginning if they are shy, but don’t be afraid to. Ask good questions and let them talk while you listen to their answers.You can always ask the standard questions like what they do for work, what they are studying if they’re in college, or what their hobbies are.
When you want to dig a little deeper, you can ask them what social issues they care about, what they would do with their time if they didn’t have to work, or just ask them to tell a story about something that happened to them in the past.
You can ask kids a lot of different questions to keep them entertained. Ask what kind of jobs they might enjoy someday. Ask what places they would like to travel when they have the chance. You can often keep kids talking for a while without too much work.

Try to leave before or after rush hour to avoid traffic and cut down on driving time.Usually, the morning commute is difficult in major cities. Therefore, opt to leave an hour earlier than usual. It may take awhile to adjust to the change in your sleeping patterns, but it will be worth it to make it work on time and avoid the rush. Coming out of your neighborhood, a change of 15 minutes in your departure time may make a huge difference in your commute.
You should also plan to avoid rush hour. As many people tend to get off work around 5, you can expect a lot of traffic from 5 to 6. If you want to make evening plans, plan to make them for later at night to avoid getting stuck in rush hour. In Washington, an enormous number of people work for the Federal government. The Feds have Flex Time and some folks who get in extra early may be leaving at 2:30 or 3:00. Rush hour starts earlier and ends later. Construction workers also start early and leave early as well. This could be a local or neighborhood problem.;
, Popular highways, like I-95 and I-70, may be packed during certain times of the day in DC. Instead of going on those highways, there are alternative routes you can take that may get you to your destinationfaster. Be flexible. Use several alternates as more people are using alternative routes.Many people must drive from I-270 to I-70 west to I-68 west to catch one of the exits on I-68. As traffic can get bad here, instead try to take Route 44 and Alternate 40. This should get you in roughly the same area, and much of the road is historically preserved. Not only is there less traffic, you'll get a good view as you drive.
If you're trying to get to DC's Chesapeake Expressway/I-464/Route 17, there is an alternative route you can take instead of going through major highways. Try taking route 17 south at Exit 126 and take it to I-64. This will keep you from the major highway congestion.
You can also try taking main roads over the highways on days where traffic is particularly congested.

, On Fridays, the roads will be particularly packed as drivers are getting off work. People who commute from the suburbs may clog the highway after work. From 5 to 6PM, it's a bad idea to take any major highways in DC. If you do need to meet someone around 6 or 7 on a Friday, take public transportation or choose a route that does not require driving on the highways. Better yet, leave late on a Thursday. Around major holidays, people arrange their schedule to leave earlier and earlier. If you're up to it, late night driving can be the best although you may have to contend with folks who are leaving the bars to go home.

, In major cities, like LA, New York, and DC, Tuesday morning commutes tend to be the worst. Therefore, leave earlier than usual on Tuesdays for work or other obligations. You should also strive to stay off major highways if possible on Tuesdays. You may find that the heaviest traffic may occur on other days for your route or neighborhood. Federal flex time and working at home helps the traffic somewhat but unless more businesses allow working from home, the situation will continue to worsen., Sometimes, traffic patterns are unpredictable. While things like rush hour and morning traffic have some pattern, things like accidents and construction can delay traffic in unexpected ways. It's a good idea to tune to a traffic radio station in your area.WTOP in DC offers traffic reports and updates on accidents and construction. You can tune into their radio station while driving, and you can also quickly check the website's traffic section before going out the door in the morning.In the event unusual circumstances, like a car accident, are delaying traffic, you'll be able to quickly plan an alternative route to avoid traffic. Be attentive to special events - sports games, political events - even the smallest of protests can have a major effect on traffic. Waze. Waze is a smart phone application that alerts you to traffic build ups. It can reroute your journey in the event that bad traffic will cause you delays.Waze usually alerts you where a traffic buildup is located. It also marks unusual traffic by placing red bands over patches of highway that are congested by cars. It will then tell you how much the delay will be, and offer you an alternative route if necessary.
In addition to alerting you about traffic, Waze can also know where you're likely to find police officers en route. This can help you avoid speed traps and tickets.

, Google Maps also provides time estimates based on traffic. Usually, when you punch in your destination, Google Maps offers several different routes. The time estimates for this route are based on the current traffic. Using Google Maps, you can see where you're likely to encounter traffic and adjust your trip accordingly.

, You won't have to wait for ""Traffic on the fives.""

, In DC, there are metros that may be faster than driving on some days. Metros run on a train line, so they will not be affected by traffic delays. You can look up metro routes online, or find routes using GPS apps like Google Maps. If a metro can get you to your destination quicker than driving, you may want to opt for public transportation that day. Update: For Metro bus, this may be true although I've never found the bus any faster. Due to safety concerns, Metrorail is and will become a mess as repair work will continue throughout the next year. And the fares and parking at stations have increased to the point where it is certainly cheaper to drive. Even with traffic, using the train may not save any time at all. Experiment. Be flexible. Your mileage my vary. In addition to saving you time, taking the metro can also save you money. You'll only pay a small fee to board, and you'll end up stocking up on gas less often.
You can also try taking a bus, but keep in mind busses will generally be as affected by traffic as cars.

, If you can manage to walk, this may be quicker. You will be able to use sidewalks, which are unclogged by cars. If the distance is reasonable, and you're a seasoned walker, it may be quicker to walk most days.


DC can be a high stress city. In addition to saving you time, getting in some walking regularly can help you manage stress.
If you're not in shape, take it slow. Do not start walking 2 miles (3.2 km) to and from work every day. Spend a week or so taking small walks around your neighborhood before attempting to walk to work instead of driving.

, Washington DC is home to a lot of bike trails. If you enjoy biking, see if a bike trail can take you reasonably close to where you need to be. If you can make it by bicycle, this may sometimes be quicker than driving due to traffic. Much like walking, biking is a form of exercise, so it can reduce stress as well.Be careful when biking in or near the street. You should always wear a helmet and other protective gear.
Check out Capital Bikeshare. For local, in town trips, this may be a great option if bike stations are close by. Be extra careful of the cars though. Full of frustrated drivers. Obey all traffic laws. Blowing through a red light or stop sign will easily get you a trip to the hospital and a traffic ticket. Please stay safe! Wear a helmet. A reflective vest would be a great idea.

, Even with proper planning, everyone gets caught in traffic on occasion. In a big city like DC, a delay due to traffic is inevitable. In the event you're caught in traffic, remain calm. Getting upset or anxious will only make the situation worse.


Try to take a few deep, calming breaths. When driving, you want to be relaxed enough to focus on the road. Stress or anger over traffic can cause anger.
Find a way to take your mind off the situation. Play a song you like or a podcast over the car's radio. Listen to a book on tape. Turn on the radio and find a calm, relaxing station. Resist the temptation to text, email or play games on your phone. Remember, hands free calling only. It's the law.

, You do not want to make a traffic jam worse for yourself or other cars. Maintain an equal distance between the car behind you and the car ahead. Make sure to drive at the same speed as the cars behind you. Try not to accelerate to catch up to the car behind you, as this may force other drivers to slow down suddenly. This will make the traffic jam worse., Traffic delays among the most common reasons for tardiness in urban areas. If you're going to be late, call and let people know ahead of time. Be careful when dialing a number when driving, however, Make sure to wait until cars are paused on the highway.


Do not make tardiness due to traffic a habit. While it's understandable that this will happen on occasion, at a certain point your boss or your associates will expect you to work around traffic delays.

This is especially important if you're just getting used to a commute and need to know which roads to avoid.There are many online tools you can use to find tolls. There are websites that allow you to enter your planned route that can show you any tolls.
Be aware, toll prices do change. Tolls may be more expensive than posted online. On the chance you find a toll you cannot avoid, make sure to carry more cash than you need in case the toll has increased.;

The Manhattan Bridge
The Williamsburg Bridge
The Queens Bridge

, If you commute into the city and use the New Jersey Turnpike, tolls can be quite high. This can be easily avoided by taking Routes 1 and 1/9, which are toll free.


Account for time, however. Taking Routes 1 and 1/9 may take longer than the turnpike depending on traffic. Get a time estimate using a GPS device prior to leaving your home.

, This is among the best ways to avoid tolls. If you can find a back road to take, or a road free of tolls, this is a great way to avoid paying hefty tolls.You may be able to avoid tolls by foregoing the highway. If you can get where you're going by driving through main streets and residential areas, this may be a great way to avoid tolls.

, If you're unsure of an alternative route, make use of technology. GPS maps can help you find a toll free route, or a route with limited tolls.Google Maps can be used to find a toll free routes in your area. You can select the option of finding a route without tolls.
Wave, another GPS app, can also be used to avoid tolls. You would simply go to ""Settings,"" then ""Navigation"" and select the option ""Avoid Toll Roads.""

, While skipping toll roads can save you money, always check traffic. Routes that are toll free often run through residential areas. Traffic may be heavy, and you may hit a lot of lights.

Some people pick up hitchhikers to avoid tolls. You should refrain from doing so, as toll workers may get suspicious and this can also be dangerous.

, This is an electronic toll payment that sometimes offers cheaper rates than paying tolls directly. For example, crossing the Verrazano Bridge without an EZ pass costs $16. Crossing it with an E-Z Pass is only $11.08.There are usually not specific requirements to sign up for an E-Z Pass. However, your car needs to be registered in New York.
E-Z pass has a variety of plans to choose from. Browse plans before settling on one to find a plan that's cost effective for you.

, Tolls do increase all the time. Even with an E-Z Pass box, and when taking the carpool lane, you could be in for a sudden increase in price. Make sure to be vigilant when going through a toll road. Listen to how much you're being charged. If tolls go up suddenly, consider looking for an alternative route with cheaper tolls or no tolls., If you can take a metro, train, or bus to your destination, this will usually be cheaper than taking a toll. Use Google Maps or a similar application to see how your route would look taking public transportation.You usually have to get some kind of pass to take public transportation, so look into rates. Even if passes are expensive, they're usually cheaper than paying a toll every day.
Make sure to account for time. Public transportation usually takes longer than driving, so make sure to leave earlier than normal. Give yourself extra time in case you miss a train or a bus.

, It may be dangerous to bike to your destination. However, if you can bike through side streets and residential areas, this can be a great alternative to driving. In addition to saving you money, biking is eco friendly and can give you some exercise.

, There's a good chance you're driving more than you need to. Look into ways you can avoid driving every day, as this will result in you paying less tolls.Try ordering more online. Use sites like Amazon to order items instead of driving out to a store.
Ask your work about telecommuting. In many jobs, you don't necessarily need to be present in the office every day. If you can telecommute some days, this will cut down on money spent on tolls.

Coats.,
Rain.",How to Dress in Malaysia,";
, Shorts are the most comfortable and cotton is probably the coolest fabric.But if you prefer long pants stay away from heavy denim. Since the humidity can be quite high evaporation cooling doesn't really work here. So the synthetic materials that are supposed to keep one cool and dry...don't.

, Short sleeves are the most commonly worn, and again loose cotton is the most comfortable choice. However if you're sensitive to the sun loose long sleeves may be a better option.

, As with any travel destination wear something comfortable. Here sandals or slip on shoes are king, because as in most Asian countries people remove their shoes when entering a home or religious place and these types are the most convenient.

, As with the other items mentioned a light breathable material is practical.

, You may need a light coat, sweater, or wrap for some indoor places like malls and theaters which can get quite cold. Other places are the highlands i.e. Cameron, Genting and Bukit Tinggi where it's a lot cooler and gets chilly (by local standards) in the evening.

, Being a tropical continent it rains frequently especially November to January. The most practical protection is an umbrella, rain gear can be too hot as the humidity rises dramatically just before it rains and can stay high while raining. You may end up just as wet from perspiration as the rain. One good thing is the rain rarely last longer than an hour and there are many covered shelters when there aren't any buildings to duck into.

Learn to pack efficiently.,
Consider the size of the luggage.,
Don't over think it.",How to Buy Luggage for Travel," If you are traveling by car, you can take more than what you need. If you are taking an airplane or other public forms of transportation, you may be forced to travel lighter to deal with limited space and to avoid any extra baggage fees.;
, Identify your “must haves” in a piece of luggage. For instance, if you need something lightweight and easy to handle for a weekend getaway, duffel bags make more sense than large, heavier rolling cases that are better suited for longer trips.

, While it is nice to have options, packing one outfit a day instead of a variety of clothes will save you time when dressing and also help you in narrowing your items down to fit in one case. Keep this helpful hint in mind: many hotels offer laundry services, so you can save space by packing fewer clothing items and telephoning the front desk for laundry services.

, The size of the luggage should match the length of the trip. Choose a smaller case if you are only going to be gone for only a few days and similarly a larger case if your trip will be lengthy.

, Don't over think the packing process. Make a list of items you really need- visualize your daily routine and make a list of all the things you need. This will help you in making sure you pack all of your required items and that they are organized and not just thrown together.

Plan breaks.,
Get lots of rest before your trip.,
Dress for comfort.",How to Be Comfortable on a Long Car Trip1," Map the route your trip will take ahead of time, being sure to build in stops every couple of hours. Taking a break gives you the opportunity to stretch and walk around. It will also keep your legs from cramping up!You should plan your stops at places with bathrooms, so you don’t have to frantically search for one when you need one.;
, How often did you fall asleep in the car as a kid? The same things that made you fall asleep then – the swaying of the car, the same landscape flashing by the windows – can make you sleepy as an adult. Make sure you get plenty of rest the night before you leave - at least 8 hours - so you can avoid getting too drowsy., Dressing comfortably for a long road trip will mean something different to everyone, but in general you should wear loose pants and a comfy t-shirt that you can move easily in. Don’t wear something too tight or that is not easily adjustable in case you need to make an adjustment while the car is in motion.


It’s also helpful to dress in layers. If you have a lot of sun coming in the car, you might get a little warm, but once the sun goes behind a cloud, you might want something more to cover up with.
Wear shoes that are comfortable, as well. Some people recommend slip-on shoes, which you can easily take off and put back on in case you want to give your feet a breather during one of your stops."

Drinking soda can actually increase your dehydration, so try to avoid packing it.


To keep water colder longer during your trip, try freezing a few bottles the night before. They should thaw out during your trip, giving you a good supply of cool to cold water to drink.

, If you're a passenger, sometimes the best way to occupy yourself on a long drive is to sleep through it! Bringing a pillow, blanket, and some ear plugs can help you nap in comfort.


A neck pillow that supports your neck and gives your head some place to rest is probably the most comfortable pillow option for a long car ride. It can be hard to get a regular pillow to stay in a comfortable position, especially if you're sharing the backseat.
Don't bring a blanket that's too heavy - you don't want to end up too sweaty, which is definitely uncomfortable.

, A good way to stay comfortable during a long car ride is to make sure you have something to do. The more you can take your mind off of being in the car for a long time, the more comfortable you'll be.


If you're the driver, pack a few audio books or your favorite CDs. You can also load up your mp3 player with a driving playlist if you car allows you to sync the player with your stereo.

, If you get carsick easily, you might want to pack some medicine to help with your symptoms.

Sit in a comfortable position.,
Adjust your seatbelt.,
Make sure you have enough leg room.",How to Be Comfortable on a Long Car Trip3," Before you hit the road, make sure that you are seated in a way that's going to be comfortable for a few hours. You won't necessarily have the chance to take a break right away and you can only make so many adjustments while the car is moving.


If you're the driver, this means positioning your mirrors, seat, and steering wheel correctly.The driver's seat should be high enough that your hips are at the same level as your knees and moved forward enough so you can depress the brake and gas pedal without lifting your back. The steering wheel should be close enough that you don't have to fully extend your arms to reach it.If you suffer from motion sickness, try to choose a seat that experiences the least amount of motion. This is usually the front seat., A big source of discomfort during long car rides is the way a seatbelt can dig into your neck and stomach. Your seatbelt should be snug against your body, but not so tight that it causes you pain.


Some cars come equipped with seat belts with adjustable height. Adjust the height of your seat belt so that it passes over your shoulder, between the edge of your shoulder and the base of your neck.If you find that your seatbelt cuts into your neck, try using a seatbelt cover or pad. They come in a variety of materials, from sheepskin to memory foam, and they can really help you feel more comfortable on your drive.

, This is particularly important for passengers. You might have to compromise on leg room, especially if you're seated in the back seat and there's someone in front of you.


If you're sitting in the backseat, wait to get in until after the person sitting in front of you adjusts their seat. This way you can see how much leg room you're starting with and decide if you need to ask your co-passenger to move their seat up. Doing it this way also prevents the chair in front of you from slamming into your knees once your co-passenger gets in.

Roll your neck and shoulders.,
Twist in your seat.,
Roll your wrists and ankles.",How to Be Comfortable on a Long Car Trip4," It's easy for your shoulders and neck to cramp up during a long ride, especially if you get stuck in the middle of the backseat with no headrest!To roll your neck, inhale and lengthen your spine as you move your right ear down toward your right shoulder. Exhale as you as you lower your chin to your chest. Inhale again as you lengthen your spine and move your left ear down to your left shoulder.
To roll your shoulders, inhale and your roll your shoulders forward and up to ears. Exhale. Then inhale as your roll your shoulders back and up to your ears.
Keeping your eyes closed during shoulder and neck rolls can help calm and relax you, too!

, To twist in your seat, exhale and twist your body so that your left hand moves to the outside of your right leg. Make sure your head follows the movement of your body. Exhale as you come back to center and then repeat on the left side., Stretching out your ankles and wrists is especially important during a long car ride if you've been leaning on one hand or sitting with your feet in the same position for too long.Make sure you roll your wrists a few times in both backward and forward motions.
If you have space, place your ankle on top of the opposite knee to roll it. This will also help stretch out your hips. If you don't have the space, simply lift your foot a little off the floor and roll in both directions.

,
Attach a luggage tag to your bag with your contact information on it.",How to Buy a Carry On Bag," Most airlines restrict total bag size to 45 inches (114.3 cm). This is the sum of the height, width and length of the bag. Keep in mind that when you place items in pockets and stuff the bag full, the size might exceed that limitation in bags that meet the restriction without being fully packed.;
, A bag that has many pockets allows you to stow away many smaller items that might get lost inside a bag with no pockets. These pockets should be zippered, especially if they are on the outside. Outside pockets are good for items you wish to easily access in the airport or on the plane.

, A neatly folded change of clothes should fit into your bag.

, The shoulder strap should be comfortable for carrying purposes. The bag should also include a handle to grasp with your hand like a duffel bag.

, Your carry-on bag should hook onto or attach to your larger, wheeled bag for easier transportation to and in the airport.

, For instance, if your other luggage is soft-sided, the carry-on bag should be, too. Or, if you have hard-sided luggage, look for a similar carry-on. Purchase a carry-on bag that either matches or complements that colors or patterns of your other luggage.

Think of how you travel.,
Next, look at other pieces of luggage for ideas of what features you want.,
Learn to pack and travel light.,
Next consider the normal and over packed dimensions.,
Don’t try to plan for every situation.,
As you shop online or in stores use your list to narrow down your choices.,
Finally, once you decide on the piece consider what you can do to tweak it a little by adding tie down loops, extra attached cords, a waist strap if you have a backpack type with wheels, a stitch on exterior pocket for bottled water, or other things you might want.

",How to Buy a Suitcase,"


If you almost always take planes you might want to avoid the new charges for checked baggage and go with a carry on and extra bag. If you travel otherwise, you might want something like a backpack with wheels.
How and when will you need to reach for documents? How easy is it to get travel items (things you want while you’re in transit like food, water, napkins, computer, book, documents, etc.)? Do you need a special compartment size for an oversize item? Do you want a pocket inside to secure things to make them difficult to get to by others? Will you be traveling where roll-arounds don’t roll easily and it will be easier to “backpack” it with shoulder straps?
Consider the physical make up of the luggage. Will it have to be watertight, hard shelled to protect something inside, or foldable down to a small flat size for transport or placement in another bag, box or for shipping.;
, An ideal way is to do window shopping on the Internet. You’re here already, take advantage of the ease of research, lack of time consuming travel and dealing with sales people. Here are a few keywords to use singly or in any combination: “luggage, roll around, reviews, features”.


Look at the different features they have, the placement of exterior openings like zippers, flaps, attachment loops, pockets, wheels, type of handle, etc. Think about each feature from the standpoint of how you travel. Mentally pack for a normal trip given the ideal features you would have and their ease of access.

, The reason most people have over sized luggage is because they take too much with them. The less you take, the easier the luggage will be.

, You want to make sure it will fit the airline requirements and take full advantage of their dimensions. You may have to wear your coat while boarding, but want to tie it on when you roll around the airport. Can you easily and securely put your extra bag on it?


Here are two things to make sure of.

First, the extended handle must be high enough for me to grasp comfortably without having to bend over while I’m pulling it.


Second, you want something VERY sturdy from the handle to the wheels that I can sit on as a seat when waiting in long lines at airports, customs, and other stops I’m forced to endure.

, Travel is a sequence of “adventures”. Be flexible. Make sure you have a written list of the features you want in the order of their importance.

, As you get to final selections consider cost, appearance, weight, and consumer ratings. Metal zippers are far better than plastic ones (metal is almost always better than plastic in all parts). An odd color may not look chic but it is easier to identify as yours or track down if lost of snatched. Make sure the wheels are NOT too small. There will be times you roll over a crevice or door jamb or platform gap and don’t want trouble getting across. Try to get good quality, but understand that price is not always a good indicator of quality.

List of places that you want to visit

, If the weather is hot (places like desert), go for cotton and light coloured clothes. If you are traveling to a hill station, the weather would be cold, go for clothes that will keep you warm. Make sure you cover your ears and head with a scarf when you are traveling in such places.

, Get the help of the tourist guides. Check out for the places to visit from your friend if someone is living there. Keep a map in hand (Google map will be of great help but also paper maps in case you lose network connection.)

, It is always good to have a water bottle. Keep refilling it on your journey. Take packaged food if possible. (You can have food in the hotels on the way too.)

, Listen to the behaviour of the people. If the people are too hospitable, don't take advantage of that. Don't be a ""opportunist"". Respond to people when they talk and laugh along with them.

Avoid fighting back. You don't know them and the places. Most importantly, avoid spending too much time with strangers.

, When you need information, reach out to the people who are more likely to give the correct suggestion. If you are searching for an address, ask the near by taxi drivers .They might have quite good knowledge about the area. Asking for information from every passerby may confuse you.

, Avoid places that have frequent occurrences of crime, natural disaster, or any other crisis. If you are bound to go to such a place, take the necessary precautions. (You may get the details of a nearby police station or who to be contacted if something goes wrong)

, It is better to check the price range of things being sold. When you search the prices on the internet make sure you search the most recent information like the testimonies or news within month.But nothing beats when you choose a place that does fit with your latest income.

, Fees on logistics and baggage laboring will add to your expenses.

, The piles that you're going to make will consist of:


Clothes to take on the trip
Clothes to donate (to friends, family, the charity store, etc.)
Clothes you're not sure about yet (the undecided pile)
Seasonal pile divisions (this is optional but can be useful if you've allowed a mess of different season clothes to mount up or if you're in one season and traveling to a different season)
Mending pile
Keep but in need of washing pile (or take on trip but need washing)
Clothes to keep that are clean and don't need mending.

, Which clothes do you want to take with you? Drop those into the suitcase. Don't worry about how many for now, you'll start sorting that shortly.

, Try things on, make it a real event because you're going away, so let yourself spend spend a bit of time doing this. You'll come home to a tidy bedroom and you'll know you've tried on everything you'd like to wear for the trip too!

, Start by halving the pile that has mounted up on your suitcase. Be ruthless, remembering that it's simple enough to make many outfits from just a few combinations of simple basics. Once you've halved the amount of clothes originally selected for travel, see whether it's appropriate to halve it again, then again. This will depend on how many clothes you added to this pile to begin with. Then pack.

, Put them away nice and clean for after you return from the trip, or add them to the suitcase, as appropriate.

, If you need the mending to be done before you leave, get on with it now.

, Does anything leap out at you to go in the donation pile? If so, pull it out before putting this pile to one side.

, Rest easy knowing that you've packed what you really wanted to travel with and you will come back to some wonderfully sorted clothes.

Some people fly as if they may never see their luggage again – and that has some merit. Keep in your carry-on the minimum of what you need to survive should you lose your luggage.


Make sure to take all your medication and everything you need to be comfortable. Prescription and non-prescription medication are allowed. It’s easier to get extra liquids through security if they’re medically needed, like with saline solution.






In order to cut down on the amount of clothes to pack, choose items that are interchangeable. Stick to a few items that all go together, rather than completely separate outfits. Use accessories to spice up an outfit. For example, scarves are small and easy to pack, and can be used as a scarf, headband, or even a belt.
Take your swimsuit if you are travelling by air, put it with in your vacation gear, especially if you are a woman. If your bags are lost when travelling by air, most items (such as shorts or T-shirts) can usually be purchased at your destination. However, if your bags are lost, swimsuits for women can be hard to shop for. If you do not have your swimsuit you may miss out on the beach, hot tub, or other vacation fun.





;
, Anything valuable should come with you in your carry-on. On the off-chance your luggage gets lost or damaged, your carry on should not leave your possession. If you'd be heartbroken if you lost it, take it in your carry-on if you take it at all.

Pack large electronics last, so they are easily accessible. You will not need to go digging around when time is of the essence.

,
The TSA requires electronics to be screened – when they are all in the same place and easy for the agents to see, you won’t be the one holding up the line at security.

, In order to get on the plane, you need identification, such as a passport or driver’s license. Do not forget your ATM card and credit card or AAA card. However, it is probably a good idea NOT to take every piece of plastic you own because you run the risk of losing the cards.


In an easily accessible pocket of your carry-on luggage, store your flight information: the airline, the flight number, your confirmation code, and the flight details. This comes in handy at the self-service check-in kiosks that so many airlines provide now at the airport.

, You may not need to pack much, if any. Your Aunt Maria probably has shampoo, for instance, and Peru will likely have toothpaste. It may take an extra stop at a store on your travels, but by avoiding tons of bottles, lotions, and tubes, you save space for other, more important things.


If you do bring toiletries, in the United States the 3-1-1 TSA regulations still applies. You can fill as many 3 oz bottles of toiletries (100 ml) as you want into ‘’one’’ quart-size plastic ziplock bag (limit one per flyer), but you have to take out the bag at security screening.Go to www.tsa.gov for the full rules and regulations.

, Sometimes flights can cause headaches, so have a pack ready just in case this happens to be that one. A few things you may want to pack:


Painkillers
Bandages
A sedative (if you are a nervous traveler)
Anti-nausea medication
Chewing gum (for air pressure changes)
Tissues
Earplugs (good for travel in general)
Medication for anything you are prone to, such as allergies.

, Remember you are not charged for the clothes you wear traveling, so dress with that in mind. Dress in layers so you can bring more with you. Instead of a T-shirt and jacket, wear a T-shirt under a long sleeved top under a sweatshirt, for example. Wear your hiking shoes and pack your flip-flops, especially when you are travelling for business., You can manage, which err n traveling by air, for a three month work trip, without checking any bags if you really want to. Checking luggage, for some, is a pain in the rear. You have to worry about packing it, dragging it with you, meeting weight requirements, likely paying extra fees that you did not know about, and then hoping the airlines do not lose it. If you are traveling for less than two weeks, consider it. It may be a challenge, but it is doable.


Flight attendants and crew do it all the time. They can go over a week with just a carry on.If they can do it, so can you. You can then use the extra $50, if applicable, for whatever you please.

, In addition to meeting the weight requirements, it’s just easier to pack lighter – fewer things may get lost (via flying or when you leave them in your hotel room), it is a lighter bag to tote around, and you'll have plenty of room for souvenirs and impulse buys. And it'll take less time to repack.


Though you should hold off on bringing too many shoes, you have to bring some. Shoe should be packed in plastic bags to avoid soiling your others goods unless they are brand new. Also, consider packing socks in your shoes rather than waste space.

, Just in case something were to happen to your carry on, you forget to pack your carry-on correctly, or something unfortunate happens on your trip, put copies of important documents in your checked luggage. Scan your passport, visa, and anything else that you may need in the worst of circumstances. If you do it, you won’t need it. But if you don’t, you may.

, If you are bringing toiletries with you, it is likely something will leak. Each item should be wrapped separately and stored in bags to make sure none of it gets on your clothes. Keep these in a separate area in your bag, too.


Take the lid off of each bottle and plastic wrap the top; then put the lid back on. This means that even if the lid opens, you should still be fine., If you are not already rolling your clothes, get on the bandwagon. It prevents awkward square-shaped wrinkles and it saves room, so hop to it. Start with the heavier ones on bottom as lighter ones are generally more moldable to the shape of the top of your bag.


The tighter the roll, the more room you save. Even a little more compression here and there goes a long way.

, Some airports are courteous enough to provide plastic bags for you, but if yours is not one of those, take them yourself. They are always useful, especially if you are traveling in a group – someone always forgets. And this way if your first round bags get soiled, you have a backup.


The zipper kind – the kind that literally has a zipper on it. The resealable ones are better than the non-sealable kind, but the zipper kind are best – the resealable kind can open when force is applied.
High-quality zip-lock bags can also be used to pack your bag tighter. You can sometimes get to 1/3 more room if your clothing is put in zip-lock bags, the air forced out, then sealed. It can also protect clothing from getting soaked in outdoor adventures and keep your dirty underwear away from your clean clothes.

, To get the most out of your bag, you’ve gotta pack it according to shape and size of your items. Start with the biggest, heaviest items on bottom and work your way up to the light items – this will make it easier to close your bag when all is said and done. If something is an odd shape, pack clothes around it – make it a point to never pack air.


In general, it's easier to back long, cylindrical items than odd shaped bottles and containers. In the future, to streamline your packing look for items that are of more basic shapes and sizes. They take up less room overall.

, If you are planning to shop at fashionable Parisian boutiques on your travels, do not stuff your suitcase full of ordinary clothes. Leave room for your purchases in your bags., In some cases, it may be easier to ship your items by mail or by a service like FedEx or UPS. This may be very important if you are going on an extended trip or need special equipment, like winter camping gear., Your trip destination will determine the kinds of things to pack, and the length will determine how much of each item is to be packed. What days do you have special events planned? How can you use the same pieces over and over?


If you can, try to avoid needing a checked bag. More and more airlines are charging for that first checked bag, and a cheap flight can turn into an expensive one in a matter of no time. If flight attendants can live out of a carry-on for over a week at a time, so can you.

, Checking before packing can help pinpoint what you really need. For example, Vermont typically has mild summers, but also has ""heat waves"" that can make it semi-tropical. Checking the weather will let you know if you really need to pack that tank top or that umbrella.


Take a small amount of multipurpose items to deal with the climate of your vacation destination. For instance, one waterproof windbreaker takes less space than a raincoat and a jacket.

, If you’re going to a different country or overseas, odds are certain things will be different. Will you need an electronics adapter?

, You may not be able to bring your Saudi host a bottle of wine, for example. Or take certain kinds of plant seeds to Australia."

Choose the right bag.,
Determine which items are really necessary.,
Pack with a technique that uses as little space as possible:


The bundle method.,
Manage toiletries.,
Try to leave electronics at home.,
Mail home or give away items not necessary for traveling, such as finished books or souvenirs.",How to Travel With One Bag," Your choice will evolve as you consider what you need to put in it, but consider:


Size: The largest that airlines will allow as a carry-on is a good starting point. Consider a bigger bag if you need to carry extra items such as winter clothes, gifts, a computer, or a fancy camera. Go for a smaller one if you want to carry the bag long distances.
Weight: Some airlines weigh carry-on bags before you board, so try to make sure that most of the weight comes from what's inside, and not from the bag itself. Avoid the need for expensive extra-light materials (such as the ridiculously priced titanium luggage) by choosing a simple tough, floppy nylon bag. Avoid heavy and bulky extending handles and wheels and opt instead for a bag with a strap, or, preferably, much more comfortable and unrestrictive, one with backpack-type straps.

Big, easy to carry, durable and modestly priced bags are especially important to soldiers. Try a ""giant duffle backpack"" from a ""tactical"" store for checked baggage (the cylindrical girth and somewhat bigger length maximizes permitted volume, and the stowable backpack straps preserve mobility); or a maximum-carryon-sized boxy-shaped backpack. The color selection may be limited, but black is generally available and may helpfully avoid a military appearance in travel out of of one's own country.


Storage: Multiple pockets help keep things organized. Pockets accessible from the outside provide convenient access to travel paraphernalia such as an inflatable neck pillow or other sleeping aids and snacks, without unpacking or rummaging through everything else.
Extra space: Your choice of bag may evolve with your choices for its contents. It should have just a little room for extras, not so much that the carefully packed contents shift around in transit.

A nylon or light synthetic canvas shoulder bag that folds into a little pouch is a great backup to have on hand in case you decide or happen to accumulate souvenirs. If you have at least some self-control, size it to avoid an airline bag fee by being, say, a modestly sized ""personal item"" to complement your carryon. (The previous personal item like a purse or laptop bag could go in it.)
If you must have two bags, try a relatively light rolling duffel and a carry-on sized backpack to maximize mobility and weight 'off' your back. An airplane ""personal item"" such as a purse or laptop bag, or even the backpack, can ride on the roller's handle.



, Ask yourself what you need to function day-to-day, or which items will dramatically improve your traveling experience. At the relevant destination, could any item be feasibly rented, borrowed or bought (and not kept to bring back)? Gather only the absolute essentials. Here's a short list of items that you might need to bring:


Three changes of clothing (at most). Perhaps more socks, underwear and shirts than pants. (Consider packing synthetic fabrics, which are lighter, fold up smaller, slide past each other readily rather than distorting piles, and dry faster––especially for pants, where any difference in feel is less noticeable.)
Toiletries, such as a toothbrush, floss, soap, shampoo, razors, and anything else you need for grooming. See below for more information about packing toiletries.
Medical items that you currently require, such as medication, bandages or eyeglasses.
Any charge cords or other accessories you need for your phone, laptop, or other electronic items.
Shoes, if you'll need a pair besides your traveling shoes.
Empty water container. A bottle will do. A flexible ""hydration pack"" can expand to hold more and is more convenient to carry when in use, but if the main bag is a backpack, check that the hydration pack can be comfortably carried when full along with it.
Empty plastic bags. You can put dirty clothes in them until washing to keep them from contaminating the clean ones. They should be clear so they aren't confused with trash and thrown away. Try produce bags.
Laundry detergent for washing by hand. Put a few scoops of powdered detergent in a plastic sandwich bag if you're going on an airplane. An inexpensive, lightweight, and long-lasting alternative is to carry a bar of laundry soap.
A portable clothesline (available at any camping or travel goods store).
A universal sink stopper (a flat rubber disk, available at any hardware store). A rubber ball can be an alternative, but check that it doesn't tend to float and is large enough so as to not risk falling in.

, Wrap clothes around large and/or semi-delicate objects (such as bags of toiletries, pairs of shoes, or electronics), rather than folding or rolling clothes. Stuff underwear and socks into shoes to save space and to prevent crushing shoes. The bundle method saves space and also reduces wrinkling.

The rolling method. Pack only those things that you really need and use rolling method to pack clothes; it saves a lot of space. Roll each item of clothing into a tight cylinder. This saves space and minimizes wrinkles. See how to roll clothes for details.

, Buy toiletries in miniature sizes, or transfer liquid contents like shampoo into smaller travel bottles. You can buy travel-size toiletries at most big-box stores, or simply save the small ones you get at hotels.


Put toiletries that could leak (shampoo, gel, etc.) in plastic bags to avoid the hassle of having your clothes covered in liquid soap. If you use bar soap (which can substitute for other forms of soap such as shampoo and shaving cream), get a ventilated holder for it so it doesn't turn to mush through use and storage.
For quicker trips through airport security, try to use solids rather than liquids. Shampoo is available in solid soap-block form and even single-use sheets. Check at a backpacking or outdoor store for more options.
Alternatively, purchase toiletries at your destination to avoid security issues. They may even be cheaper, depending on the currency.

, Minimize the number of items in your bag that require electricity, especially those that need to be plugged in continually rather than briefly to recharge, as converters can be costly and space-consuming.

, Trading books is a great free way to keep your travel library fresh and can net you some interesting new friends as a result of the exchange.

Pack travel soap.,
Pack 2 to 3 changes of clothing to get you through the first few days.,
Pack clothing and undergarments in your checked luggage that you aren't afraid to leave at your destination.,
Avoid planning to buy all clothing items while you are traveling.,
Research products that are a specialty in the area.",How to Buy Clothes While Traveling1," This will reduce the amount of money you have to spend on clothes while traveling. Many travel stores sell small laundry soap sheets that dissolve and lather when placed in a sink full of water, so you don't have to carry extra liquids.;
, Even if you plan on checking luggage, it is a good idea to carry a few clothing changes with you, in case your luggage is lost or delayed. Focus on packing comfortable shoes, neutral colors, wrinkle resistant clothing, shirts and pants with pockets and anything stain resistant.

, There's always a risk that an airline could lose your bag. Cut out that risk by carrying clothes you plan to replace.

, Women should not buy bras or swimsuits since they are hard to buy using the local sizing conventions. Shoes should be bought before a trip and adequately broken in, to avoid foot injuries or blisters.

, For example, Australia is known for their sheepskin boots, like Uggs, and Peru is known for its alpaca knits. You can buy and wear your souvenirs while traveling.

Go early and come back late.,
Look at flying with a connecting stop.,
Consider flying out of a different city.,
Fly into a different city.,
Fly on the actual holiday.",How to Find Cheap Ways to Get Home for the Holidays1," Since airplane tickets get expensive during the holidays, you might try planning your itinerary so that you leave before the holiday rush and return after it. If you are self-employed, this may be a good option. If you have a lot of flexibility at your workplace, this could also be an option.Avoid flying on a Sunday.See if you can work remotely. You might consider asking your boss if it is possible to work remotely for a few days. If you get approval, you can stay a few extra days and take advantage of cheaper flying days.;
, By booking a connecting flight, you may be able to save some money. However, you should weigh the cost savings against the higher risk of getting delayed or stuck at the connecting airport. Consider how much savings are worth the extra risk of getting delayed and potentially missing your flight because of an issue at the connecting airport.Prior to searching for your flight, write down a dollar amount representing the cost savings that would be worth it for you to purchase a connecting as opposed to a direct flight. Use this dollar amount to inform your decision making.

, You can sometimes find cheaper flights leaving from airports in another city. If you find a cheaper flight leaving from an alternate city, you should also add up the cost of ground transportation to the other airport. If the cost of ground transportation plus the cost of the cheaper flight is more expensive than a flight from your local airport, perhaps you should just fly out of your local airport. If it is cheaper and you have the time, it can be a good way to save money.If you live in Toronto, for example, you might be able to find a cheaper flight to an American destination by searching for flights that leave from Buffalo.

, Consider whether your itinerary would allow you to fly into a different city and whether this option would be cheaper. You can sometimes find cheaper flights to alternate cities that are still close enough to your final destination.See if the savings are significant enough to warrant additional ground transportation to your final destination.


If you have a friend in a city that is cheaper to fly to and close enough to your final destination, you could fly there first and then make your way to your final destination.

, If your holiday itinerary allows for it, you could fly on the actual holiday. Typically, people avoid flying on Thanksgiving or Christmas Day. As a result, flights on these days tend to be cheaper. If your family plans allow for it, you may as well fly on the holiday itself and save a little money."

Figure out the equivalent local size in your country.,
Try on clothing before buying it.,
Avoid buying clothing from street side vendors.,
Prepare to barter, if that is acceptable in the country you are visiting.,
Choose cotton undergarments and synthetic outerwear.,
Replace your clothing slowly.,
Buy large jackets or rain coats if you need them.",How to Buy Clothes While Traveling2," Many countries size shoes and clothing differently than others. Ask a store clerk what sizes are small, medium or large, to get a good idea what sizes will fit you.

, Unless you are certain something will fit you, or you are buying underwear, make sure you can try it on. Travel clothing needs to breathe and move easily, or it is not worth the purchase.

, You cannot adequately try on most street vendor clothing. There is a good chance it is not well made, if it is being sold for an extremely cheap price.

, Guide books should be able to tell you what the appropriate bartering customs are.

, Cotton is breathable, but easily wrinkled, so it should go under your clothing. Synthetic fabrics are usually wrinkle resistant and flexible.

, Travel can be very tough on clothes, because you are moving more than usual. Buy a shirt or pair of pants as your other pants wear out, or get too dirty to clean in a hotel room.

, Buying clothes while traveling means that you don't have to pack for contingencies.

Get flight alerts.,
Talk to a representative about using your points.",How to Find Cheap Ways to Get Home for the Holidays2," The easiest way to save money is to book your flight early. You should try to book your flight two or three months ahead of time. This is when the cheapest tickets are available, and prices typically rise approximately thirty days in advance of your flight.If you keep waiting because of the high prices, you may simply be adding money to your ticket for every day of procrastination.If you are booking for fall or winter holiday seasons, you may be adding $5 per day for every day you wait.Avoid last minute booking. If you book a day or even a week in advance, you will be paying significantly more than if you had booked at least one month in advance., Although many websites will claim to be the ultimate hub for flight searches, there is no magic website that will save you money. Rather, it is best to shop around using a few of the big search engine websites and then compare results. Some websites, such as FareCompare, will allow you to search across a few websites at once and compare results in different browsers., Since airlines may use cookies to survey the flights you are looking for and may adjust prices accordingly, you may want to search in incognito mode. If you don’t want to use incognito mode, you can also clear your cookies before making a purchase which should get rid of your search history.If you are using the Chrome web browser, choose ‘new incognito window’ under the file menu.
If you are using the Firefox web browser, choose ‘new private window’ under the file menu.

, Budget tickets go on sale at the beginning of the week and the price wars typically start on Tuesday, so this is the time to book your flight.One strategist recommends booking your flight on the phone between midnight on Tuesday and Wednesday at 1AM. Apparently, the budget flights that weren’t sold are re-entered in airline systems at this time, which makes it an opportune time to purchase. You need to follow the time zone for the specific airline and call them directly.Try calling Delta Air Lines, JetBlue Airways or Spirit Airlines on Wednesday at 1AM Eastern Standard Time.Try calling AirTran, American Airlines, American Eagle Airlines, Southwest Airlines, and United Airlines on Wednesday at 1AM Central Time Zone.Call Alaska Airlines, Allegiant Air, and Virgin America on Wednesday at 1AM Pacific Time Zone.Call Hawaiian Airlines on Wednesday at 1AM Hawaii-Aluetian Time Zone., When you search online for cheap flights, click on the ‘flexible days’ search option. If there is no option on the search website you are using, try inputting different days into the search system. Typically, most people will travel on particular days during the holiday season. To save money, you can travel on cheaper days when fewer people are travelling.For example, try flying back from the thanksgiving on the Monday instead of the Sunday.

, You can save money by choosing early morning or late evening flights, since the highest demand is typically for flights during normal commuting hours.If you travel early or late, you should also consider whether you will end up spending more money on ground transportation.


Check to see if the public buses are running when you need them for an early morning or late evening flight. If they are not, consider how much you could end up spending on a taxi or other means of ground transportation.

, Sign up to receive flight alerts for cheap flights to your destination. You can sign up for flight alerts from your local airline, a travel agent, or booking website. These flight alerts will typically be sent via email or text message. You will have to sign up at one of the sites and then set up your preferences. You will get alerts when prices drop for your preferred flights.FareCompare, Airfarewatchdog, and Yapta websites all offer free flight alerts., If you have a mileage reward ticket that you want to use for your holiday ticket, you might want to talk to a human representative at your local airline. They may be able to check your options quicker than if you were to do it yourself online.If you are part of airline points or frequent flier miles system, you may want to look into using your miles for the holiday season. However, you should note that you may have to use double or triple the usual amount of points needed to get to your destination. Nonetheless, if you are willing to part with the miles or points, this approach could save you money."

Get on the train.,
Take the bus.,
Drive.",How to Find Cheap Ways to Get Home for the Holidays3," The train can be a relaxing way to travel and can save you money if fares are lower than for flights in your region. Taking the train might be a nice way to give yourself some time alone before the festivities of the holiday season. You should book your holiday train tickets early in order to avoid the holiday rush. Although train travel is slower than flying, it can be relaxing, comfortable, and affordable.


Book your train tickets at least two weeks in advance., You can save substantial amounts of money by taking the bus home for the holidays, since bus fares are typically cheaper than airline fares. There are many discount bus services that run between different cities, so you should look into the competitors in your region.


If you take the bus, remember to bring a pillow and some entertainment for the ride such as a novel or some portable music.

, You can save money by driving home for the holidays. You should calculate the cost of fuel for your trip home as well as road trip expenses such as eating out, coffee, and pit stops. If your anticipated fuel and trip costs look lower than airline fares and you have the time to drive, this could be an enjoyable way to save money during the holiday season.


If you have a friend or a sibling who is also going home for the season, you could ask if they want to drive together. This will cut your road trip costs in half.

Search for chartered flights.,
Book separate flights.,
Check out Flying Blue.,
Time your trip.,
Book a round-the-world ticket.",How to Find Cheap Flights to Kenya," Many companies offer holiday packages including accommodation and/or tours to Kenya, and sometimes the entire package is cheaper than a separate flight. You aren’t obliged to stay in their accommodation, of course. Some of these fly to Mombasa (Moi Int’l Airport) instead of Nairobi (Jomo Kenyatta Int’l Airport). If your destination is Nairobi, you can change planes in Mombasa. Cheap but not extremely comfortable are the night train or the bus between Mombasa and Nairobi.;
, From the USA and Canada, you’ll have to change planes in Europe to get to Kenya. It’s often cheaper to book a separate ticket to Europe and from there a ticket to Kenya. The same goes for flights from Australia and New Zealand: you’ll have to change planes in the Gulf region or the southern part of Africa.

, Both Kenya Airways and KLM offer daily flights from many international destinations to Kenya, and are part in the Flying Blue network with Continental Airlines, Northwest Airlines, Air France, KLM, Delta Airlines, Korean Air and Aeroméxico. Flying with any of them earns you Flying Blue points that you can use for extra tickets, free upgrades, etc.

, December-January and July-August are tourist high seasons in Kenya. Prices outside these months are lower. The general rule that flying on strange days and times is cheaper, is also valid here. If you don’t include a weekend in your itinerary, air lines assume you’re a business traveller, and bill you accordingly.

, If you plan to include Kenya in a longer journey, then research a round-the-world-ticket. You’ll pay one price for a string of flights then. Various airline alliances offer them, most importantly the Star Alliance, all with different rules and limitations. Some are based on mileage, others on a number of flights, usually within a fixed time period.

Place the bundle in your bag.,
Hold it in place.,
Open the bundle before wearing the clothes.",How to Bundle," Bundling is a packing method used to greatly reduce wrinkles and creases. You'll wrap each garment around a core object, creating a snug bundle in the process.Since this method requires you to wrap your clothes, you won't actually do any folding. The lack of folding results in a lack of creases.
Wrapping items of clothing around a core and around each other also creates tension. This tension minimizes wrinkling.;
, Find an organizer pouch with surface dimensions that are approximately 11 inches by 16 inches (30 cm by 40 cm).


The best dimensions can vary slightly depending on how many clothes you plan to pack and how wide your suitcase is. This size works well for most circumstances, though.
You can technically use any small object with fixed dimensions like these. Since you can fill the pouch with other necessities, however, it is typically your best option.

, Roll or fold the socks and undergarments you plan to pack and carefully arrange them inside the pouch.


Similar items, like swimsuits, can also be packed in your pouch.
Place soft items in this pouch, and fill the pouch with enough of these items to create a firm pillow. The idea is to make a firm core, but it should not be a rigid one.
Do not put anything in your pouch that you need quick access to.

, Take the time to iron out any major creases or wrinkles before you pack any of your garments. Correct bundling should prevent additional wrinkles from forming, but it will not remove any wrinkles currently in your clothes.

, Secure all fasteners on all garments. Button your shirts and jackets, zipper any trousers or skirts, and snap up any pockets.


Closed surfaces will be easier to wrap than wide, open surfaces.

, Clear your bed or a large area on a table or floor. It will be easiest to create your bundle in a flat spot with little clutter.


Another option is to open your suitcase wrap the bundle directly inside. Doing so is more difficult and not ideal, but it can work in situations where wide space is not an option.

, Large wrinkle-prone garments will need to be placed on the outside of the bundle, while smaller wrinkle-resistant garments are placed closer to the core.


Clothing near the outer layers of your bundle will be wrapped at a gentler curve, so the risk of creasing and wrinkling is reduced even more significantly there.
The exact arrangement will vary based on the clothes you have, but the outer layer usually consists of suit jackets and other jackets, followed immediately by long skirts and dresses. Long-sleeved shirts are next, followed by short-sleeved shirts, trousers, jeans, sweaters, and knit fabrics, in that order. Shorts and cotton pajamas are usually closest to the core.

, Usually, this will be a jacket, long skirt, or long dress. Lay it out flat and smooth out any folds and light wrinkles with your hands.


Most clothes should be placed face up.
Tailored jackets, however, should be placed face down. Arrange the sleeves so that they lie naturally.

, One edge of each clothing item will need to line up with one edge of your core organizer.


The direction of each consecutive layer will vary, but as you place each layer down, one edge of all existing layers (including the newest one) will need to be able to line up with one edge of the core.
Each garment will line up with a different edge of the core, however. The garments do not need to line up with the same edge.

, Long-sleeve shirts and short-sleeve shirts are usually next in your bundle. These items should be placed vertically in your pile.


Alternate the direction of your shirts to maintain an even shape. If the first shirt is upright, the second shirt must be upside-down, the third must be upright, the fourth must be upside-down, and so on.
The collar edges should be aligned to the top and bottom of the core. Even though the core has not been placed down yet, keep that in mind as you position the shirts.

, Trousers, jeans, and other pants are usually placed on top of the shirt layers and further in toward the center of the bundle. All pants should be oriented horizontally.


Alternate the direction of your pants, too. If the waist is to the left on your first pair, the waist of your second pair should be to the right. That of the third pair should be to the left, that of the fourth should be to the right, and so on.
The waist edges of each pair of pants should be aligned to the anticipated right and left edges of your core organizer.

, Gradually layer the rest of your clothes on top of the others, working from the most wrinkle-prone to the most wrinkle-resistant.


As a general rule, shorter items are oriented vertically while longer items are oriented horizontally.
Note that wide skirts may need to be folded lengthwise before you wrap them, but you should avoid folds as often as possible.
Smooth out each garment with your hands before spreading a new layer on top.

, Position your organizer pouch (or other core object) on top of your assembled pile of clothing.


Remember that one edge of your core must align with one edge of each garment.

, The last garment you placed should be the one closest to your core object. Wrap the three hanging sides over the edges of the core.


The entire clothing item must be wrapped around the core. Do not leave any excess material hanging off the sides.
Wrap the item firmly so that the fabric remains taut, but do not stretch the garment out of shape.

, Wrap each consecutive garment around the core, leaving no excess material hanging off the sides of your bundle. Work with one garment at a time, continuing through the final outer piece.If necessary, rearrange the position of the bundle so that it lines up with the correct edge of the garment layer you are currently working with.
When working with pants, long skirts, and other long items that run from side to side, wrap the material completely over and under the bundle as much as needed to keep all of the material contained.
When working with a long-sleeved shirt, wrap one sleeve straight across the bundle as far as possible, wrapping it across and underneath the bundle itself. Repeat that for the other sleeve, then wrap over the bottom of the garment as far as possible.
Jacket sleeves will need to be wrapped diagonally across to keep to the natural positioning of the sleeve. As a result, they will form an ""X"" over the top of the bundle.

, Carefully pick up your bundle and place it in your suitcase.


Place the ""seam"" side of your bundle face down. In other words, the top-most loose edge of your bundle should face the inside of your suitcase.
Move the bundle carefully to prevent it from unraveling. If you wound it correctly, though, the bundle should be snug enough to resist unraveling.

, Use the interior straps of your suitcase to tie the bundle down.


If the bundle remains loose inside the suitcase, it can move around and may start coming undone.
The straps should be snug and secure over your bundle, but do not adjust them so tightly that they begin digging into the clothes. Excessively tight straps can cause wrinkles to form in your outer bundle layers.
If your suitcase does not have straps, consider sewing some inside before using it. Alternatively, you can fill the sides of your suitcase with other objects to prevent the bundle from shifting as you carry the bag. This may include shoes and toiletries, among other items.

, When you arrive at your destination, you should open the bundle and shake out the clothes to remove any light wrinkles that may have formed.


Unwrap your bundle carefully. Start with the outermost garment and work layer by layer until you reach the garment nearest the core.
Ideally, you should hang each unpacked item of clothing after removing it from your bundle.
It is easiest to unwrap and hang up the entire bundle at once, but you can remove individual garments from your bundle one at a time, if desired. Simply unwrap the bundle until you reach the garment you want and remove that layer. Then, re-wrap the outer layers around the remaining bundle in their previous order and tuck the bundle away again.

Enroll in a frequent flyer program that makes sense for you.,
Assess how you're most likely to earn rewards.,
Plan according to specific goals.,
Get the credit card that corresponds with your frequent flyer program.,
Keep track of your rewards’ expiration dates.",How to Double Dip Travel Rewards1," The most common type of travel rewards are airline miles. In order to earn the most miles, including in double-dip scenarios, you’ll need to join a a frequent flyer program that you will be most able to use. For many people, this is simply the program affiliated with whatever airline they fly with most often.One factor is proximity to an airline’s hub. For instance, if you live in a city where a certain airline is based, it likely makes sense to join their program, as you are likely to fly with them most often.;
, If you anticipate earning miles or other points through purchases other than flights, choose a program that gives the most miles for whatever types of purchases you most often make. For instance, if you drive more often then fly when you travel, default to a program oriented more towards lodging.Furthermore, different programs accrue miles or points at different rates, but these rewards may be worth more in certain programs. Don’t assume that the program where you can rack up miles or points the quickest is the best, because it may be much harder to actually use those rewards.

, Even within certain types of travel rewards programs, the actual rewards you can earn can vary widely. For instance, some miles rewards programs will award you with actual flights, while others will award you access to nicer seats on the flights you buy or access to airport lounges.As such, before you start trying to accumulate points or miles, you need to take the time to figure out exactly what you’re hoping to earn and join the programs that offer those rewards.
Further, even within programs, some points or miles can only be used for certain program rewards, even if the program offers multiple types of rewards.

, Most frequent flyer programs offer members access to an affiliated credit card. These cards have hotel and retail partners. When you make purchases at these partners, you can earn miles for your frequent flyer program. These provide the easiest and most common ways to double dip travel rewards.For instance, you can book a room that rewards you with 500 miles in your frequent flyer program. When you pay for the room and use the credit card affiliated with your frequent flyer program, you’ll also earn miles on the purchase itself, thus “doubling” your rewards.
Whenever you make a large purchase, use this credit card to do so unless you have a specific reason to pay with a different method (such as a lower cost for cash).

, Many rewards, including miles, expire if you do not use them. Some have special rules you must follow to keep rewards in good standing. In short, familiarize yourself with the small print regarding your rewards programs, especially your frequent flier program.


For instance, you may have to make regular purchases with an affiliated credit card in order to keep your miles current.

"
"
Shop in online shopping portals.,
Register other rewards cards with your preferred loyalty program.,
Take advantage of other credit card bonuses.",How to Double Dip Travel Rewards2," There are online marketplaces that work by helping you search for something and referring you to the actual online merchant when you’re ready to make a purchase. These websites are called online shopping portals, or OSPs. The merchant provides a kickback to the OSP, and the OSP provides you with an incentive - such as travel rewards - for using their portal. Often, frequent flyer programs or hotel rewards programs have their own OSPs. This means you can shop through their website to earn extra rewards on any purchases you make.
If you also use an rewards program-affiliated credit card to complete the purchase, you’ll be earning points on the transaction itself too - thus double dipping on your rewards.

, Some credit cards offer certain rewards for certain types of purchases. If, for instance, you like to eat out, it’s likely worth getting a rewards card that gives you double points on restaurant purchases. Within the card's rewards network, you can often specify a preferred loyalty program. In fact, your rewards program may even reward you for linking the card to their program.As such, you can make “double” rewards by using the credit card where it earns double points and assigning them to a frequent flier program.
Further, the frequent flier program may reward you with extra points if it is affiliated with the place you made the purchase. In this sense, you can even triple your rewards!

, Often, you can earn extra rewards towards the program your credit card is affiliated with by spending a certain amount within a certain time frame. In these instances, it’s not the type of purchase you make or where you make a purchase, it’s simply the amount that matters.The most common example is a welcome bonus, for which you might receive a certain amount of bonus rewards for spending a certain amount on your card within your first month.

Earn Starpoints and SkyMiles simultaneously.,
Try RewardsPlus if you fly United or stay Marriott.,
Join Hilton HHonors.,
Find more specific information online.",How to Double Dip Travel Rewards3," Delta’s SkyMiles frequent flier programs and the Starwood Preferred Guest program have joined forces in the Crossover Rewards program. If you have elite status in either program, you can earn points in both rewards programs for purchases made with either company. Importantly, you must link your rewards accounts to receive these benefits.For instance, when you purchase a Delta flight, you can earn both SkyMiles as well as Starpoints for the purchase.
Furthermore, If you’re a Delta Medallion member, you’re eligible for special perks at SPG properties, and Starwood Elite members get perks when flying Delta.

, Status in one of these company’s rewards programs can translate into perks from the other as well. The RewardsPlus program is especially slanted towards membership in one another’s “elite” status programs. For instance, If you’ve achieved at least a Premier Gold status with United, you’ll automatically be Gold Elite in the Marriott Rewards programs. Similarly, if you’re Marriott Platinum, you’re automatically MileagePlus Premier Silver status in United’s eyes.You’ll need to register for both rewards programs and link them in order to receive these benefits.

, Simply by joining the Hilton HHonors program, you’ll effectively begin earning double rewards. You’ll earn HHonors rewards points per dollar you spend at Hilton properties, as well as an additional reward that’s up to you. Your options are either additional HHonors points or airline miles (1 per dollar spent, with multiple airline options)., If you catch the travel-rewards bug, you may be itching for even more ways to maximize the rewards you’re earning. Fortunately, there are some extremely helpful websites on the topic. In addition to thepointsguy.com, check out frugaltravelguy.com.The latter even includes a “Rookie Guide” to doubling and tripling your rewards. In it, you’ll find more specific information on how to determine your goals, other partnership programs, and how to help keep track of all the rewards you’re earning!

Plan ahead.,
Go during an off season.,
Depart and return in the middle of the week.,
Fly to London first.,
Shop around, but focus on travel websites that make their money through advertising.,
Search through a wide range of booking websites, especially international ones.,
Check out an airline's European websites.,
Try a charter flight.,
Buy a consolidator ticket.,
Book with secondary airports.,
Consider a frequent flier program.,
Sign up for e-newsletters and mailing lists to find last minute deals.",How to Find Cheap Airfare to Europe," At minimum, you should try booking your flight two to three weeks before you plan on leaving to lock in the best price, but booking between six to eight weeks in advance is ideal. Rising oil prices mean that airlines are also raising their fees, and ticket prices are more likely to go up than down as more time passes.;
, Major holidays are busy travel seasons, and August tends to be the busiest vacation month for Europeans. As a result, airline tickets increase in price around these dates. The cheapest prices to Europe tend to fall out in the middle of winter, excluding the gap of time between Christmas and New Years, with moderate prices falling out in the spring and fall.

, Most people fly over the weekend, so weekend tickets cost a lot more than tickets with departure dates set in the middle of the week. The lowest prices generally fall out on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays.

, From London, fly to your final destination. Flights to London are cheaper than flights to other European cities and countries, and flights from London to another European destination are also significantly cheaper than flights to that destination from the United States or Canada. You can usually save money by making these two separate flights instead of flying direct to your final European destination.

, Travel websites that allow you to compare airline prices can help you find the lowest price relatively quickly, but some search websites are better than others.


Some websites have an affiliation with certain airlines, making their results biased.
Travel websites that make their money via bookings charge airlines a booking commission to display results from their company. As a result, these websites may not display budget carriers that refuse to pay such a fee.
Websites that make their money through advertising have no reason to filter out results and generally offer the most reliable, honest search results.

, Booking websites based in the United States do not often have listings for all the small airlines scattered across Europe. International booking websites will probably include more of these airlines, especially websites based in the region of Europe you plan on visiting.

, Prices for the same flight can vary depending on where you book it, and you can book a flight from another country's website. If your favorite airline has a website based in your destination country, start there. Otherwise, you can simply search British versions of an airline website and plan on making two separate flights.

, A charter airline leases an airplane for a specific date and route. They charge a low price, which often dips even lower as the flight date gets closer, but the flight can be cancelled at the last moment if they do not sell enough seats to make a profit.


Since flights rely on a large number of passengers, this option works best if you plan on flying to a major destination, like London, Paris, or Rome. You may not be able to find a charter flight to a less common European destination.

, Wholesalers sometimes purchase large sums of tickets for flights predicted to sell out. In turn, they usually sell these consolidator tickets to travelers at a reduced price and still manage to make a profit doing so.


Like charter flights, consolidator tickets are easier to find for popular European destinations but harder to find for smaller locations that do not attract much tourism.

, Secondary airports are smaller than primary airports and charge smaller landing fees. As a result, low-cost carriers are more likely to fly from a secondary airport.

, Even if you do not fly ""frequently,"" joining an airline rewards program is a good idea as long as you plan on flying more than once in your life. You earn points with each flight involved in the program, and with enough points, you can earn discounts and free tickets. Many of these programs can be used with international carriers, as well, including many European ones.

, Airlines and travel search engines that have e-mail mailing lists often send their subscribers information on last-minute travel deals. Many of the available discounts are only offered for a limited time, and individuals not subscribed to the mailing list risk not hearing about them in time.

Buy the individual legs of your ticket separately.,
Take the scenic route.,
Sign up for alerts.",How to Choose Cheap Train Travel1," When people order train tickets, they tend to purchase a ticket on a straight shot to wherever they’re going. But strangely, buying tickets for every step along the journey could save you money. Look for opportunities to engage in so-called “ticket-splitting” where possible.For instance, suppose you’re taking a train from Washington, D.C. to New York City. The train will also pass through Baltimore and Philadelphia. If you buy three tickets – one from D.C. to Baltimore, another from Baltimore to Philadelphia, and a third from Philly to New York – you could save money when comparing the cost to buying a single ticket for a trip from D.C. to New York.
Check the prices on the split tickets to ensure that they total less than what you’d pay for the single ticket.;
, Popular routes are direct and travel quickly to their destination. But they are also the most expensive tickets. Look for less popular routes which are less direct. It might take you longer to arrive at your destination, but you might save on ticket fare., Some railway ticket retailers offer customers the opportunity to get alerts sent to their phone or email. Trainline, for instance, will ping your email when tickets go on sale to a location you’ve confirmed an interest in. Other train ticket retailers offer similar alert systems. Contact the rail line of your choice to find out how you can get alerted when tickets for destinations you’re interested in are on discount."

, If you’re traveling to a destination and back again, and if you know exactly when you want to return, you might be tempted to book a round-trip fare. However, round-trip tickets can be more expensive than two one-way tickets bought at different times.Waiting to buy your return trip ticked is a gamble. You might end up paying more for the second ticket than for the first. You might also not be able to get a return fare if you wait too long to obtain it.

, When booking online or over the phone, you’ll have to pay an additional fee – the booking fee – to reserve your ticket. These fees range from modest to exorbitant, depending on which rail company you’re dealing with. If you don’t see the booking fees automatically represented when you’re going to check out, contact the rail line directly to find out what the full cost of the tickets you want will be., If you travel often by rail, you might qualify for the train equivalent of the “frequent flyer” card. Many rail companies offer discounted fare for repeat customers who have a frequent passenger card. Contact your rail company of choice to see if any such offer is available."

Avoid peak travel times.,
Buy your tickets early.,
Buy your tickets at the last minute.,
Be flexible in your travel arrangements.",How to Choose Cheap Train Travel3," Tickets are often priced according to the time of day when the train runs. Most people want to travel by train between 4:00 and 7:00 in the evening, or any time in the morning prior to 10:00. Therefore, tickets for trips that operate during those times are often priced more expensively than off-peak times. If you’re in no particular rush to arrive at your destination, look for tickets at different times of day to locate off-peak tickets that can save you money.Sundays and Fridays are also peak travel times, since the rail lines tend to attract people traveling somewhere or other for the weekend on Friday, then returning Sunday from wherever they went.

, Railway companies tend to jack their prices up as the date of departure draws closer. In order to avoid getting gouged, book your tickets as soon as you know when you want to leave and where you want to go.Buying early is especially important when shopping for deals around holidays. When lots of people are traveling, ticket prices rise dramatically.

, While it is good practice to buy your tickets early, you might, paradoxically, be able to get your tickets cheap if you buy them at the last possible moment. This is because when the train departs the station with empty seats, the rail company has no way to recoup the costs of the unsold tickets. Therefore, they attract late-coming customers by steeply discounting unsold tickets.However, if you choose to buy your tickets at the last minute, there’s a good chance that the tickets will all be sold out. Therefore, it is best to plan ahead and buy your train tickets well in advance of your planned date of departure.

, Rail companies often price their tickets in seemingly inexplicable ways. For instance, tickets to Detroit might cost $50 for a Wednesday trip, but $30 for a Thursday trip. If you do not urgently need to get to Detroit on Wednesday, check for tickets on adjacent days. If you have the good luck to find cheaper tickets on a different day, think about pushing your schedule back to take advantage of the lower rates."

You can click on ""Name Your Own Price"" for hotel rooms, airplane tickets, or rental cars.
You can also search the basic travel information to get an idea of prices before you bid. You can name your price from the results screen as well.;
, To start bidding, enter your travel information. This includes city you want to travel to, the airport you will be leaving from, and the airport you will be flying into. You also have to provide travel dates and the number of passengers.

, The ""Name Your Own Price"" tool comes with specific terms and conditions. Make sure you read them carefully before bidding. The terms and conditions include:


Your air travel could begin anywhere between 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. for domestic flights on the given day, and midnight to midnight on an international flight.
Your flight might be non-stop, but it could also have up to 1 connection.
You won't see specific hotel, flight, and car rental information until you confirm the purchase.

, After you have entered your travel information, click the ""Bid Now"" button. It will take you to a screen with travel options.

, Priceline allows you to choose specifics, like which airport you'd like to fly into, which section of a city you would like a hotel room in, or how many stars you'd like in the hotel.


Many of the options will have ""best deal"" beside them.
You also have to add the name of the traveler or the name for the reservation.
You can also choose to have trip protection added for a fee.

, After you choose your specifications, enter the lowest amount you would like to pay. Then hit ""preview offer.""


Start low to guarantee you can get the best deal.

, As soon as your bid is accepted by Priceline, your credit card will be charged. Before you can search and see the results, you must enter your credit card information. Then hit ""buy my ticket.""

, After you bid, Priceline will search and see if they will accept your bid or reject it.


If accepted, your credit card will be automatically charged. Your travel details will be displayed. There are no cancellations or refunds.
If rejected, you cannot bid for another 24 hours at the same specifications. If you change something, you can bid again.

, Before bidding on anything on Priceline, you need to know what the going rates for hotels are. Check other third party sites, like Expedia, Orbitz, and Travelocity. You want to pay lower than those sites. You will base your bid on knowing what the sites are charging so you can get the lowest possible price.


You can also see how much the hotels are charging for the night's room to make sure you aren't overpaying., Before bidding on Priceline, go to sites like BetterBidding.com and BiddingForTravel.com and read the forums posts by users who have used Priceline recently. The users post both their winning and losing bids on the site. They also post their travel dates, names of hotels, star classes, and airlines. These sites also offer a list of hotels that have been confirmed bids within a certain zone at a specific star rating.


This can help you get a sense of how much you will have to pay for certain hotels, airlines, and cars.
Priceline doesn't offer this info on their website, so it can help you bid more strategically.

, The bid you place does not factor in fees and taxes. These fees and taxes may end up getting pricey. Make sure you think about that added cost before placing your bid.The fees and taxes will show up on the bid screen, added to your proposed bid. For example, if you offer $50 for 2 nights in a hotel room, you may see a total of $125, which includes fees and taxes.

, If you are travelling with someone, split the bids. If your bid is rejected, the other person can place a slightly higher bid.


Make sure that the person is travelling with you because they will have to show their ID and credit card when you check in., You can rebid if you change something in your search, like the travel dates, hotel stars, or zone. If your travel dates are non-negotiable, try changing zones. If that doesn't work, lower the hotel stars until you find a hotel. Just make sure you are okay with staying at a lower star hotel., If your bid is rejected, you will have to wait 24 hours before bidding again. A way to go around this and be able to re-bid that day is to alter your specification options. You will have to alter the star level, travel dates, or geographic zones in order to bid again. This only works with hotel rooms.


A way to do this is to figure out which zones have what star hotels. Click each zone on the specification pages, and the stars will gray out if they don't offer those kind of hotels in that zone. To get your 4-star hotel in the area you want, re-bid with a bid higher by a few dollars and add in one zone that doesn't offer 4-star hotels. This way, if you book the hotel, it will automatically be in your desired zone because the other zone doesn't offer 4-star hotels.If the highest star hotel is in every zone, the free re-bid technique won't work.
Make sure to use your back button to go back to the page with the specifications. Don't go to the page Priceline wants you to click to after they reject your bid.
For rental cars, you can start with luxury cars and go down to economy and compact with subsequent bids.

Say thank you and leave.

, Make sure you have no other money in that pocket and the exact amount you want to spend. Go back to the shop about an hour later so they don't recognize you straight away. Pick out the 5 shirts you want and ask the price. Pull out the 1,000 note and act sad that you only have that much. Do this when they have the shirts there and ready to be sold, not before you pick them out. Then say you are sorry but this is all you have.

, If they say no, say you are sorry and turn to leave. Very rarely will they let you leave when you are flashing money at them.

, Haggling in Southeast Asiaand Thailand specifically relies heavily on the idea of walking away.

NOTE: Don't walk away until AFTER you have been haggling for a bit so they know you are interested in their merchandise.

Stay calm.,

If there's no answer, try calling for help.,
Press the ""door open"" button.,
If you can't call for help, try to get the attention of the people outside the elevator.,
Wait it out.",How to Escape a Stranded Elevator," As soon as you realize you're stranded, you may feel a natural urge to panic. However, you have to tell yourself to put mind over matter, and to stay as calm as possible. If you start panicking, your body will start to feel the effects, and you'll only be making it more difficult for yourself to think clearly, and therefore making it harder for you to find a way to escape.


Take a deep breath and relax your body. It is hard for your mind to be in panic when your body is relaxed.






If you're not alone in the elevator, then panicking is more likely to make the people around you panic. And having multiple people freaking out in an elevator is not the way to safety. Instead, do your best to be a calming presence to the people around you.





;
, If the elevator is dark, you can create some light by using a key chain flash light or opening your cell phone or PDA. Try your best not to keep the device on for so long that battery power is drained. Creating light will help you see the buttons and get a better sense of your situation. If you're not reading this while stranded in an elevator, then check out your cell phone to see if it has a special ""flashlight"" feature. If so, this can come in handy -- as long as you make sure it doesn't drain your battery!


It's also important to quickly get a sense of how many people are stuck in the elevator with you.







, If it's dark, use the light source to find the call button. Then, press the call button to contact a technician to help you. This will alert maintenance personnel there is a problem with the elevator. This is the quickest and best way to get help -- much better and safer than trying to take the DIY approach.

, If there is no response to pressing the call button, check your cell phone for reception. If you have any reception, call your local emergency services number e.g. 911 for the United States, Canada, etc. 911 may unofficially work in other countries, but cannot be relied on where it isn't officially used. The EU has officially adopted 112 for emergencies, so that is the number to try first if you are in Europe.


If there is still no response, press the alarm button a few times.







, Sometimes, this button can just get jammed, and if you press it, it'll open the elevator right up. You may be laughing, but you'd be surprised by how many people call for help to escape a stranded elevator only to find that they just have to press the ""door open"" button again.


You can also try the ""door close"" button, which may have gotten jammed as well.






You can also try pressing the button of a floor below where the elevator is currently resting.







, If you've tried the call button or tried calling for help and have gotten no answer, then your next bet can be to try to shout or call for help. You can try to bang on the door of the elevator with shoes or other objects and yell to alert passersby. Depending on the sound transmittance of the door, tapping firmly with a key on the door may make a loud sound throughout the elevator shaft. Shouting can help alert people who are outside the elevator to your situation, but you should know that shouting or yelling excessively can also cause you to panic more, so make sure you try to stay reasonably calm when you are calling for help.

, If you are not in an extreme life-or-death situation, just wait it out. In a best case scenario, people will notice the elevator is not working in minutes and you'll be out in no time. People frequently use the elevator and people in the building, especially building personnel, should quickly notice that something is off. Though shouting for help can also help, if it hasn't gotten you anywhere after a while, it's better to stop and wait than to use all of your energy.


If you've successfully made contact with emergency services, just remember that they'll be on their way as quickly as possible; entrapment calls are taken seriously and you could be freed in thirty minutes or less.






Though it may be hard to create ice breakers or conversation starters when you're trapped in an elevator with a bunch of strangers, just keep the conversation going. Have people talk about who they are, what they do, where they were going, how many children they have, or really anything at all to keep the conversation going. Silence is much more likely to make people panic or to drop into despair. Do all the talking, if you have to, making sure to stick to the lighthearted topics.






If you're by yourself, waiting may be a little more difficult, but try to occupy yourself. If you have a magazine or book on hand, consider yourself lucky. Don't waste your phone power by playing with your phone. Instead, try to think of ordinary things to calm yourself down, such as making a list of all of the things you did today, or trying to remember everything you had for dinner for the last week. Stay optimistic by thinking of all of the things you have to look forward to in the upcoming weeks.






Pull or push the ""stop"" button to ensure the elevator doesn't move while you're attempting to crawl out.

Search for singles deals.",How to Avoid Single Occupancy Supplements when Traveling Alone1," The earlier you book your travel, the more likely you are to avoid single occupancy supplements. This will help you find a cheaper hotel room if you are planning your own travel. If you want to join a cruise or tour, you may find that some will waive the supplement for those who book a certain number of months in advance., You will have better luck with rates if you travel alone during the off or shoulder season. The hotels may lower or waive their single occupancy supplement. Look at your plans, and consider if you can change your dates.The off-season is when hotels are the least busy. For example, the summer is the off-season in the Mediterranean while winter is the off-season in Scotland.
The shoulder season is at the end of the tourist season and the beginning of the off-season. The weather may still be nice, but the hotels have lower rates.

, If you’ve tried searching for deals in vain, you may want to set up a search alert for yourself. To do this, make a search term alert for the type of travel that you want to do. Sites like Google will email the top results of this search term to you daily.To set up a Google alert, go the Alert page of your Google account. In the form, write what search terms you are looking for and how often you want them emailed to you.

Talkwalker Alerts and IFTTT are good alternatives to Google Alerts.
The words “no single supplement” or “single supplement waived” should be in your alert. You should also put the destination. For example, your Google Alert may read “Paris no single supplement.”

, Hotels are more likely to charge you a single occupancy supplement as they charge by room, but hostels charge by person. While many hostels have dorms, you may still be able to find a hostel that offers private rooms at a reduced rate.You can search for safe, highly rated hostels at Hostels.com, Hostel World, and Hostel Bookers.
Some hostels will offer single-sex dorms or rooms for those who don’t mind having roommates of the same sex.

, While it may be harder to find a hotel without a single supplement, you can find tour operators or cruise lines that do not charge it. Some companies waive this fee entirely while others will offer significantly reduced supplements.



HFHolidays, Exodus Travels, Overseas Adventure Travel and Intrepid Travel all offer tours without charging a single supplement.

Norwegian Cruise Line, Grand Circle Travel, and Avalon Waterways all waive or reduce single supplements on certain cruises.

, Some travel companies may offer special deals for people traveling alone. These may be advertised as “solo travel,” “singles only,” or “singles specials.”When looking for such deals, read the descriptions carefully. Some may be tailored for single, unmarried travelers looking for romance while others are catered towards people traveling alone.

Plan your trip away from peak times (8am-11am and 5pm-8pm)
Bring an English map as all signs are in Russian
Buying a multi-ride ticket saves you lining up every time;
, Almost every street in Moscow is serviced by a bus or tram route. Some streets have overhead wires to accommodate electric trolleybuses, while others are fitted with tram tracks.


One trip costs 28R ($1USD) making buses, trolleys and trams a super inexpensive way to see the city.
The #7 trolleybus route is the most convenient to explore the major sites of Moscow. It runs from the Victory Park (Park Pobedy) to the Stone Bridge (Kamennyï Most) near the Kremlin, following the riverbank and up to Sparrow Hills (Vorobyovy Gory).

, Many unofficial cabs, known as ‘gypsy taxis’ cruise around looking for fares, but we recommend sticking to the official taxis, recognisable by their chequerboard logo on the side and/or a small green light in the windscreen.


Moscow taxi drivers almost never use metres (even if they have them fitted) so you’ll have to negotiate a fare first.
Bargaining is a must, and even then, taxi rides tend to be on the expensive side, best reserved for when public transport isn’t a convenient option.

, These mini-buses are found in both Moscow and St Petersburg. They travel along fixed routes but passengers can wave them down anywhere, like taxis.


You pay immediately (usually around 30R) once you get inside.
Tell the driver ‘stop’, or to be more polite, ‘ostano`vite po`zhaluista’ (stop please) as you approach your stop.

, The St Petersburg underground metro has the distinction of being the deepest in the world.


Uses a four line system is quite extensive and has a colour-coding system that makes it easy to follow
Bring an english map as all signs are in Russian.
A single ride is the same price (25R), no matter how far you’re going
Buy a multi-trip ticket to save on lining up

, In the summer months between 8am and 8pm, aqua-buses (water taxis) ferry tourists and commuters alike across the Gulf of Finland and the Neva River into St Petersburg’s network of canals, connecting downtown with some outlying areas of St Petersburg.


There are four fixed routes give you the chance to admire some of the city’s most beautiful landmarks from a unique perspective.
In season, dozens of tour boats, from small private launches to luxury cruisers with meals, drinks and live bands on board take tourists out on the water.
Night cruises can be particularly romantic.

, Trams and trolleybuses offer a pleasant and extremely inexpensive way to see the city, but only a few lines are convenient for hotels and tourist sights.


Two lines worth trying are the #14 tram, which runs from the Mariinsky Theatre up through the centre of town and across the Neva, and the # 1 tram, which runs through Vasilevsky Island, including a stop just outside the Vasileostrovskaya metro station.

, As in Moscow, there are plenty of unofficial ‘taxis’ skulking around.


Using an official taxi is safer and you can usually negotiate a fairer price.
Unfortunately, official taxis aren’t particularly common, except in the busier shopping and nightlife districts.

, Only Moscow and St Petersburg have metro systems, but the streets of most other large Russian cities are regularly plied by buses, marshrutkas and taxis. A lack of Russian can make understanding bus routes and the like confusing, if not impossible.

, The best way to sightsee in and around most Russian towns and cities is via an organized day trip, or as part of a longer guided tour.

, In the end jump in a taxi back to your hotel if you end up being over-tired.

Explain your reasons.,
Thank them.",How to Avoid Single Occupancy Supplements when Traveling Alone2," It will be easier to negotiate if you call at least a month before you travel and if you want to book in the off-season. Hotels are not likely to negotiate on rates during peak seasons, but they may be willing to accommodate you during the off-season., Instead of going through a travel agent or a tour company, call the hotel directly. They will be more likely to negotiate with you one on one.When they pick up, you can say, “Hi, I am looking to book a room, and I have a few questions first.”
You can also say, ""Hello, I will be traveling on the 25th and will need a room for only one person. I was wondering if we could discuss the rate.""

, State that you have noticed they have a single occupancy supplement, and ask them if it can be waived. Even if they are not willing to waive it entirely, they might offer to reduce the rate.


You can say, “I see that you charge a single occupancy supplement. I want to know if that can be waived.”
If they say no, ask, “Can we negotiate the rate then? I would be willing to pay $140 a night.”

, If they are open to negotiation, you may want to advertise yourself as a valuable customer. Indicate that even though you are a single traveler, you will be a worthwhile guest at the hotel.


You might say, “Since it’s your off-season, I was wondering if you had any special deals.”
If you’re staying for longer than a few days, you could say, “I am staying for ten days.”
Indicate your interest in any other deals that the hotel is offering to show that you might spend money elsewhere. For example, you could say, “I am interested in your spa package as well.”

, Always be polite when negotiating. The hotel will be more likely to work with you in this case. Even if they say no, thank them for their time and help.If you managed to waive the supplement, you can say, “Thank you so much. I look forward to staying with you.”
If they said no, tell them, “Thank you for your help anyways. I will let you know when I’ve decided if I still want to book or not.”

Be sure to specify if you want to share a room with someone of the same sex.
You may not be able to find someone who is the same age or has the same sleeping patterns as you.

, Some websites will help match you to strangers who are also traveling alone. These websites will let you post a request for a travel partner or group. You can specify that you want a roommate, and they will find one who pairs well with you.Travel Chum and Connecting Solo Travel Network both offer this service to members.
Be extremely careful when finding roommates online. You never know who the other person might be. Ask the other person if you can video chat first so that you can make sure they are who they say they are. While sharing a room, keep your possessions locked safely in your luggage or in a locker.

, If you’re not having luck with specific roommate matching services, you can try posting on a general travel or destination-specific message board. While there is a little more risk to this, you may still be able to find someone who can share a room with you. You should state in your post what type of roommate you’re looking for, when you’re traveling, and where you want to stay.For example, you might post, “I will be traveling to London between June 1 and 7, and I would like a roommate. I will be staying in the West End and would prefer a male roommate.”

Think about the potential attention-drawing situations.,
Dress appropriately.,
Keep your hair neat and in the normal color range.,
Be courteous, cautious and well mannered at all times.,
Know what isn't appropriate.,
Draw only good attention.,
Know the local customs.",How to Fly Under the Radar when Traveling," The major situations where you can attract unwanted attention when traveling on an overseas trip include:


Customs
Quarantine
Police

Thieves and pickpockets
Touts
Louts and drunks
Pimps (in some cases)
Cultural clash.;
, It might seem simplistic if you're used to very liberal ways of dressing, but the way in which you dress can take care of a great deal of the possible sources of unwanted attention listed above.


Avoid wearing clothing without good form and modest coverage.
Don't wear t-shirts with messages that are insulting, cursing, or suggestive in either words or image.
Don't wear underwear as your day clothing. Avoid having bra straps or underwear showing.
Avoid clingy, see-through, revealing clothing, whatever your gender.
Avoid wearing bling, whether it's real or not.
Tone down the makeup, keep it as natural as possible.
Be modest when traveling in places where people cover up certain parts of the body (both genders).

, Brightly colored hair and unusual hairstyles will single you out for special airport and street treatment simply because you don't come across as the ""norm"". If you can handle this, fine but if the thought of constantly being harassed by authorities or strangers isn't pleasant, consider toning down your usual individual statements when traveling.

, When traveling, it's a privilege to be able to traverse other lives and cultures. While your tourist dollars are important, so are your manners and the message you bring from your own country about behavior.

, The following behaviors will not keep you under the radar - not only will get you noticed but these actions can get you into major trouble as a tourist:


Loud speaking, especially where speaking loudly is frowned upon or if it's late at night, and especially if you're criticizing the locals or comparing their country unfavorably with your own country.

Cursing and finger pointing.
Arguing back when you know you're clearly in the wrong (a special no-no with Customs, police, and other authorities)
Making jokes about bombs anywhere – accept that security measures are a pain but that they are run by people who take the measures seriously and will have no hesitation in proving so to you.
Being drunk in unknown places with no friends.
Refusing to remove shoes, don scarves, etc., at sanctuaries, people's homes, and religious places/places of worship.

, Smile and be pleasant. Be willing to make friends with new people while balancing this with your concerns about strangers. Some things to help you stay under the radar include:


Don't reveal intended travel plans or where you are staying to strangers. Ever.
Don't tell strangers your life story.
Always know where your gear and valuables are. Use money belts for securing cash when the environment is unsafe.
Be polite and firm with touts. Just say a simple ""no thank you"" and smile; break eye contact very quickly. If you need to repeat the same phrase, then do so but don't budge.

, Keeping under the radar is always helped by knowing and respecting local customs. Some of the customs may seem old-fashioned and strange to you but that's your problem because you're not home. Instead, show respect and don't create ripples. Ask for advice and love the learning.


Remove shoes when asked to do so. Forget the ""I get cold feet, I have blisters, ra, ra, ra"" responses. They don't mean anything other than disrespect; just do as asked.
Know how to behave in places of worship. This includes not entering certain sacred places if you have your period (for women), knowing how to approach deities, and wearing certain headwear or other garments to enter.
Be aware when gift exchange is expected. And know when it is rude to knock back a gift.

Check your airline’s policies.,
Consider how much baggage you need.,
Look at the limits.,
Compare prices across carriers.",How to Avoid Baggage Fees1," Budget carriers such as Spirit and RyanAir, as well as budget divisions of legacy carriers such as basic economy may only allow small personal items such as a laptop bag or backpack. Other airlines may include carry-ons but no checked bags in their base fare, while others still may allow a certain number of checked bags.Look online or call your airline to see what specific baggage is included with the ticket you are considering purchasing.;
, When looking for the best price ticket for your flight, consider how much baggage you will actually bring. If you only plan on bringing a carry-on, for example, you may not want to pay for a ticket that has checked bags rolled into the cost.Likewise, if you know you need to check bags, you may want to rule out options that charge per bag or by weight for checked luggage.

, In addition to knowing what an airline charges for baggage, know what limits and regulations they have in place for baggage. Different airlines have different regulations regarding how large or heavy both carry-on and checked items can be, so read your specific airline’s regulations carefully.It may be useful to invest in a small hanging luggage scale, which can be purchased easily online. This can help you avoid overweight bag fees.

, In some cases, a budget ticket plus baggage fees may be cheaper than purchasing a ticket with baggage included. In other cases, the baggage-included airline might be the best option. Shop around and compare prices including baggage fees to get the best deal."

If you have an accident without insurance and it is your fault, and there were personal injuries or damage to the roadways, you will go to jail.,
Mexican drivers (especially in large cities) are more aggressive than the average American driver, and are more active in their habits.,
Pedestrian and bike traffic is common throughout Latin America, and though most people are better at crossing the street than in the United States, hitting a person or a cyclist is still a huge problem.

,
Avoid driving on the highway at night if you have problems on American highways, or on highways in general.,
Be very careful passing and changing lanes.,
Two lane highways with shoulders are used as four lane highways.,
Drive at the speed of traffic, and be prepared to drive faster.

,
Do not turn left onto a street in the middle of a block; the only way out of a parking lot in such a place is to turn right and go around the block.

",How to Drive in Mexico Without Getting Into Trouble," To avoid delays and legal trouble, you can purchase a day or two of car insurance for less than $20 and let the insurance personnel take care of everything. Just be sure that you understand your coverage when you buy it. If you plan on driving at all in any Latin American country, get insurance in that country first.;
, Be alert and watch for signs that a driver is trying to change lanes or get around you. Turn signals are rarely used, so be on the lookout.

,, There is much commercial traffic along Mexican highways at night, so beware of large trucks as well.

, Be deliberate in what you do, but do not pretend that your turn signal will have any effect on other drivers. Be extra careful when you want to turn left and make sure nobody tries to pass you. If you need to cross the highway and there's traffic, pull over to the right until it's safe to cross.

, Oncoming vehicles will pass and expect you to move onto the shoulder. Vehicles will also pass on the shoulder. It is a matter of expedience, do not drive if you are easily offend.

Bring multi-functional items.,
Wash clothes at your destination.,
Pack travel sizes.,
Roll your clothes.",How to Avoid Baggage Fees2," Help keep yourself consolidated to a smaller bag by packing items that can be used for multiple purposes. Instead of packing separate slacks and jeans, for example, consider bringing a single pair of black denim pants that can be used in a work environment as well as for casual or more physical activities.Try to pack clothing that is multi-functional. Take a look at your closet and think about what pieces you use for multiple occasions. Pack those rather than pieces that only serve one purpose whenever possible., If you are going to be gone for multiple weeks or longer, don’t pack a new outfit for every day you will be gone. Instead, look into laundromats or hotel laundry service at your destination. Paying to wash your clothes a couple times will still generally be more affordable than paying baggage fees., Rather than bringing a full bottle of shampoo that you will need to check, consider buying travel sized toiletries and hygiene items. These are typically readily found in most supermarkets and drug stores, and can spare you both weight and space in your bag.Even a carry-on-sized bag may need to be checked if you have full-sized containers of items like shampoo, lotion, or even toothpaste. If you can manage with travel-sized items at your destination, invest in them.
Likewise, you can purchase travel-sized, reusable bottles to pack smaller amounts of your own toiletries if you would rather bring your own products with you.

, A common traveler tip to help get more items into a smaller bag is to roll your clothes. This allows you to fit more than folding, helping you pack a denser bag.To roll a shirt, fold the arms into the body, then fold the shirt in half. From there, roll from the neck down to the base, squeezing as you go to create the tightest roll.

Take a train.,
Ride a ferry.,
Ship your bags.",How to Avoid Baggage Fees3," Depending upon your destination, train travel can be more affordable than air travel, especially when bags come into the picture. Many railroad companies allow up to two bags for free. Regional travel that would typically necessitate a commuter or express airline can often easily and affordably be replaced by train travel in many parts of the world., Ferries often allow up to two bags in a standard ticket, and are a great alternative for over-water crossings. Ferries are especially common in the Pacific Northwest, Europe, and between major cities globally. Most regional ferry trips take no more than a day, and allow you to not only bring your bags but experience a new method of travel as you go.Some high-speed ferries may not allow the storage of bags outside of cabins for safety reasons. Talk to your specific ferry line about their baggage policies before booking.

, If you must fly, take a look at the cost of shipping your bags to your destination. You may be able to get an affordable budget ticket for your flight that can help offset the cost of shipping, making that a more reasonable option than paying baggage fees."

Plan your trip to affordable countries.,
Purchase tickets during the vacation offseason.,
Determine your travel route.,
Research the cost for your backpacking route.,
Pack enough clothes for your trip.,
Pack toiletries and first-aid items.",How to Backpack in Europe on a Budget1," Different countries and cities across Europe cost varying amounts of money to stay in. Traditionally, staying in Eastern Europe is cheaper than staying in countries in Western Europe. Some of the most affordable cities to vacation in Europe include Sofia in Bulgaria, Krakow in Poland, and Bucharest in Romania. The average price to stay in these cities for a weeknight is less than $25., Purchasing your tickets from mid-November to April is the cheapest time to get them. Avoid planning your trip in mid-June to August because this is the busiest time of the year and tickets can often climb to over $1,000.Purchasing tickets during the end of December is similar in cost to buying tickets during the peak of vacation season.

, One of the easiest and most affordable ways to backpack from city to city is to use Europe's advanced rail system.Choose cities in order and go across the continent to visit places you want to experience. You can plot out your trip and purchase tickets in advance, or you can get a discount by buying tickets on each country's individual rail website.A train from Berlin to Munich costs around 190 EUR.
A high-speed train from Bordeaux to Paris costs approximately 95 EUR.France's rail website is http://www.voyages-sncf.com.
Austria's rail website is http://www.oebb.at/de/.
Romania's rail website is https://www.cfrcalatori.ro/.
As an alternative to rail, you can use ride sharing apps.

, Typical expenses include room and board, food, transportation, airfare, and the cost of admission to events and activities. Before you commit to backpacking, make sure that you write down a detailed list of where you want to go. Do research on the current prices and get an estimate for how much everything should cost., In addition to your regular clothes, make sure that you pack extra socks and underwear for your travels. You may not be able to stop and wash your clothes, so choose ones that are good for several different occasions.Purchase fast-drying underwear just in case you need to hand wash them.

, Pack essential items like shampoo, soap, toothpaste, a toothbrush, and razors. In addition to your toiletries, you'll want to pack aspirin, prescription medicine, band-aids, and motion sickness tablets.


Other non-essential toiletries include makeup, baby wipes, and foot cream.
If you are using one backpack, make sure it has a lock or anti-theft device to protect you from pickpockets.

Stay at hostels.,
Purchase ingredients to cook food rather than eating out.,
Eat food from street vendors.,
Walk or use public transit.,
Take advantage of age-related discounts.",How to Backpack in Europe on a Budget2," Hostels are a cheap alternative to motels or hotels while you travel around Europe. Typically staying in a hostel costs somewhere around 18-40 EUR per night. When you book your trip, search for hostels in the area and see how much it costs for a night of lodging. It's important to look up hostels in each of the locations that you're visiting so that you know what to expect when you arrive.Hostels in places like London, Paris, and Amsterdam cost anywhere from 20-50 EUR per night.
Hostels in cities like Dublin, Berlin, and Budapest cost anywhere from 17-30 EUR per night., Eating out at restaurants can become a massive expense when you travel. You can avoid this by purchasing ingredients at local grocery stores, farmers markets, or greengrocers. Make sure that you have a place to cook your food.Many hostels come with communal kitchen areas where you can cook.

, There are a variety of different vendors that will serve food on the street across Europe. Doner kebabs are popular in Europe and are cheap and delicious.Look for vendors that look clean and sanitary, since some countries do not have the same health and safety standards you may be used to.

, Instead of grabbing a cab, you should try to walk as much as you can through Europe. If you're staying in a city, this is easier to do than if you are in rural areas of the country. If your destination is too far away to walk to, consider using public rail or bus because it's cheaper than paying for a ride.If you are using the train often, consider getting a rail pass for the location you are currently in.

, Many historical sites and museums in Europe have expanded opportunities for people who are students or seniors. In addition to the sights, Rail Europe also provides a senior and a youth discount that could save you money in traveling expenses. Research the things that you're paying for and see if you can take advantage of an age discount.The Louvre in France is also free to students under the age of 26."

Do your research. Where are the parades? Where are the Tipicos? Do you have any Panamanian friends you can go with or a crowd of people you can go with to stay safer and more protected? If you do, take advantage of that and join a group rather than go alone. You are a greater target when you are alone, especially if you're female. This is simply a male based society so if you're female you have to be a bit more careful.;
, Make sure you can walk and stand in your shoes for extended periods of time without discomfort. It gets hot!

, There are people who wait as long as two hours to catch a bus.

, For families Penanome is great, for singles, Panama City as is the beach, consider visiting Coronado or Chame. For an LGBT friendly location go to Las Tables. The further in the Interior you go, the more celebrations you will find. The wealthy tend to go to the beach (it's very expensive and prestigious), the average person tends to go into the Interior.


Do not wear high heels all day. The roads and sidewalks are not smooth, they are uneven and bumpy and the perfect way to twist an ankle and fall or worse. Wear comfortable shoes that you can go anywhere in.

, When you have your wallet in your back pocket it's very easy for someone to grab it and run. Buy one of those belts or wrist bands with hidden pockets. And only carry a small amount of cash and one credit card.

, In Panama the police can stop you any time and ask for your passport; if you don't have it they can give you a very expensive ticket. Any photocopy of your passport must include your entry stamp, too.


This is especially important when you drive because you can only drive in Panama on a visitors permit for three months.

, Avoid wearing anything expensive, especially necklaces, which can be grabbed and broken while the thief passes by. And with the crowds so thick,  trying to find someone who robbed you can be impossible.

, If you're a woman, wear a purse that is small and a crossbody so that it can be worn so that it's tucked under your arm. If it has a metal strap all the better; that makes it harder to break or cut.

, It's very easy to get caught up in the dancing and excitement and stop drinking water. Drink more than usual because of the heat and increased activity. You will feel better, have less muscle soreness and just generally be able to be out longer.


Even if you're primarily drinking alcohol, because it is a party after all, switch out and make every other drink water. One glass of alcohol, one glass of water. It will help you stay hydrated, but it will also help you so that you don't get so drunk.

, It can be very peligroso, or dangerous, to be intoxicated in a strange place with people you don't know. It's important to stay aware of your surroundings and keep safe.

, As part of Carnival, people will randomly throw eggs, often mixed with water and dirt on you indiscriminately. It's not personal; it's a custom. And one you may not want to partake in. If you're aware of your surroundings you can often avoid being a victim.


Also, close your car windows in certain areas when you see people with eggs; they will throw them in your car. Be sure to duck if anyone throws something at you!
This custom is expected by Panamanians, Americans may not be quite so enthusiastic. However, if it appeals to you, by all means, partake!

, You may want to wear a swimsuit under your clothing, or consider wearing a swimsuit with shorts or a skirt. Many women wear them out during the day rather than regular clothes. At night it's more dressy, but still a tradition to be sprayed by water, so be careful!

For example, it's good to tell your spouse but may not be important to tell your second-cousin, twice removed if you never talk with them. Having this conversation during a calm setting is important.

, Generally, there are three different approaches:

"
"
Check the terror warnings before traveling.,
Dress so as not to attract attention to yourself.,
Avoid anything that could indicate your country of origin.,
Don’t wear religious clothing.,
Identify safe havens you can retreat to in the event of a terror attack.,
Schedule the most direct flight path to your destination.,
Go to the most secure area of the airport.,
Choose your own taxi.,
Don’t share information with strangers.,
Avoid tourist hotspots and busy areas.,
Use caution around religious holidays.,
Keep your phone handy.",How to Avoid Being a Victim of Terrorism1," Your national government’s department of state should provide a list of locations that are dangerous for traveling due to a high risk of terror incidents. Consult the appropriate department’s site before making travel arrangements.


If you do not have internet access, ask your local embassy or police station to provide a list of terror warnings.
You can also learn about terror threats by watching the news. Follow media reports about the country or countries you’ll be traveling to.;
, If you have lots of tattoos, dress so as to cover them, especially if you’re in a relatively conservative nation. Avoid wearing bright colors or flashy clothing. If you’re traveling, adopt the normal dress of the place you’re traveling to. Try to blend into the general population.In most areas of the world, you can get away with wearing t-shirts and jeans. In many other areas, however, the local standards of dress are quite unique. Wherever you are, try to be as uninteresting in your dress as possible.

, Do not wear shirts or hats emblazoned with your national flag. Terrorists could use that to identify and target you as someone belonging to a particular nation. Additionally, do not attach keychains, buttons, stickers, or patches bearing your national flag to your clothing, backpack, or suitcase., If you encounter terrorists who target people of a particular religion, you could become a victim of terrorism. Wearing crucifixes, yarmulkes, or other religious garb could cause terrorists to target you., Obtain a map of your local area. Mark all the police stations, hotels, and hospitals on the map. Circle the ones that are closest to you or to the locations you know you will be visiting regularly or in the near future. Carry this map with you and head to the safe havens you marked out in the event of a terrorist incident.Before traveling, obtain a map of the area you’ll be traveling to and identify safe havens in the same way you did with the map of your local area.

, Some of history's largest terror attacks have taken place on airplanes or at airports. While security and screening for terrorist might be good in your nation, it might be weaker in other nations. Fly directly from your nation to your destination to stay safe.If you can't go to your destination directly, schedule a flight that lands only at airports with the lowest risk of being targeted by terrorists.

, There are two parts of the airport, the secured area beyond the security checkpoint and metal detectors, and the area before the security checkpoint. When you arrive at the airport, you will be in the unsecured area. Do not linger there. Instead, check your luggage and pass through airport security as quickly as possible., Don’t allow hotel staff or anyone else to select a taxi for you. If you do, it’s possible that you won’t actually be getting in a taxi, but a car driven by a terrorist. Vary the taxi stand you use to get around town. Only get into cabs that are clearly marked as such. Ensure the photo in the front and/or rear ID panel matches the face of the cab driver.When entering a cab look for a:


Certificate license with expiration date displayed
Cab number
Cab company name and information
Valid plates and registration sticker

, To avoid being a victim of terrorism, keep your personal information and itinerary to yourself. When you do share information with friends who you trust, do so in a private space and be wary of anyone listening in.This includes religious information. Do not tell strangers what your faith is, as terrorists often target people of particular religious background.
Racial information and citizenship should also be kept confidential. Some terrorists target only individuals of a specific race or individuals who hail from nations they consider to be enemies of their own country.

, Large public events and gatherings are common sites for terror incidents. For instance, concerts and nightclubs are often targeted by terrorists because of their high civilian populations. Areas that are quiet and rural are unlikely to be targeted by terrorists.Other areas to avoid include government buildings and locations that are symbolic of a nation’s economic or political might.
Keep your wits about you when in public, and if you get a bad feeling about someone or something you see, don’t hesitate to report it.

, Many religiously-motivated terrorists schedule large attacks to coincide with their religious holidays. Exercise extra vigilance during these times and avoid public areas., Charge your phone regularly. Program the number for local emergency services into your phone. If you see or notice anything suspicious, or if you witness a terror attack, use your phone to contact the authorities."

Confirm you meet the requirements for a passport.,

Report passport fraud in Australia.",How to Avoid Passport Scams," It might sound basic, but you should only apply for a country’s passport if you qualify for one. Confirm that you satisfy the requirements for a passport by visiting your nearest consulate or embassy, where you can ask the staff about the requirements.


Avoid relying on government officials who say they have a “friend” or “contact” who can get you a passport even if you don’t qualify.These scams typically involve bribing a government official, which is illegal. Although the passport may be legitimate, the methods used to obtain it are not.
These type of “grey market” passports are very popular in Bulgaria, Cambodia, Mexico, and Paraguay.;
, A common fraud is to use the identity of a dead person to obtain a passport. You should never accept a passport that doesn’t contain your name and correct personal information.


Also avoid applying for a passport where you are encouraged to provide fake documents, such as a fake birth certificate., It is a major red flag if a government official tells you something that contradicts the laws of the nation.This person is lying to you and probably trying to scam you.


Common scams involve economic citizenship programs. In many countries, you can become a citizen if you invest a certain amount of money to start a business in the country. However, these programs should be public knowledge. Avoid someone who hypes an economic citizenship program you can’t find any information about.
The cheapest economic citizenship programs run about $100,000 per person and have five-figure fees. It also takes several months to be accepted by the program. If someone promises lower fees or faster processing, then recognize you are being scammed.
You can ask about economic citizenship programs—and all other immigration laws—by visiting your nearest embassy or consulate.

, Most countries have a rigorous application process for becoming a naturalized citizen. You typically must spend a certain amount of time in the country and undergo a background check. If the application process seems easy, then it may be a scam.When in doubt, talk to an immigration attorney who can confirm that the application process is legitimate.
In the United States, you can obtain a referral to an immigration attorney by contacting your nearest bar association, which you can find here: http://shop.americanbar.org/ebus/ABAGroups/DivisionforBarServices/BarAssociationDirectories/StateLocalBarAssociations.aspx.
In other countries, you can find a qualified attorney by visiting your country’s consulate or embassy. For example, a U.K. citizen in Thailand should find the U.K. embassy.

, You should renew a passport through the government office that issued your passport. Only work through them. Another common scam is for third parties to advertise that they can expedite the renewal process in as little as 24 hours.Many of these scammers advertise through Google Adwords, so you’ll probably see their names at the top of the results page.
As part of the scam, they usually have you fill out detailed forms that ask for personal information. Scammers then use this information.
These scam websites typically do not list a physical address and have 800 telephone numbers which no one picks up.

, Only a few countries recognize a world passport. To obtain this passport, you fill out an application and pay a fee.The U.S. does not recognize the world passport, so don’t buy one expecting to gain admission into the U.S.
At various points in time, only a few countries have recognized the world passport. These countries have included Tanzania, Burkina Faso, and Zambia. It’s not clear these countries would accept the world passport today.
Avoid the world passport at all costs. Instead, seek a legitimate passport from a country where you are a legally-recognized citizen.

, A common scam is for someone claiming to be a government official to stop you and ask for your passport. They then try to extort money from you before giving it back. Some thieves will dress up in uniforms that resemble the police or other officials. Don’t assume that because someone looks official that they are.


You should confirm that they are an actual government official before handing your passport over.Avoid handing your passport over, if possible. Pretend not to understand what the person is saying.
Fake confusion. Say, “huh?” and raise your hands. Scammers will move on to easier targets if you pretend not to know what they are saying.

, You only need to hand over your passport in a few situations—crossing the border, boarding an international flight, etc. However, in other situations, someone will want to see your passport to confirm personal information, such as your name. You should make a copy of the personal details page of your passport for these situations.
