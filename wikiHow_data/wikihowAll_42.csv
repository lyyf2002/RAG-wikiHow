Allow extra time at the airport.",How to Arrange for Your Child to Fly Alone," Some airlines charge $100 each way for each child, some charge as little as $25 each way. Do your research to find the most cost-effective way to send your child to another destination., Some airlines will not allow a UM to travel on connecting flights. Most airlines that do allow a UM to travel on a connecting flight will charge a fee for airline personnel to assist your child with changing planes. Even if the airline allows your child to take connecting flights, it isn’t an ideal situation. Try to book a nonstop flight, or a direct “through” flight, so your child will not have to leave the aircraft. Make reservations; do not allow your child to fly standby even if the airline permits it.

, If possible, arrange for your child to fly in the morning. This will give you the rest of the day to make alternate arrangements in case the flight is delayed or cancelled., You will have to download and print out consent and liability release forms and have them filled out prior to the flight. You will have to provide your child’s name and age, as well as details about any medical considerations, including prescription medicine. You will also list the name of the person whom you are authorizing to pick up your child when the plane lands., Be very clear about the airline carrier’s policy on young adult passengers. Most airlines consider a child of 12 or over to be a young adult, and don’t assist the child on the flight unless you specifically request the assistance and pay the fee. If you don’t make such arrangements, the airline expects your child to be responsible for making their own plans if a flight is canceled, delayed, or redirected.Ensure the person picking up your child has also read the policies. Upon arrival, your child will be escorted into the terminal and released to the person you have authorized. This person will need a valid ID to be let through security to go to the arrival gate, and they will need to prove their identity before your child is released to them.

, If food will be served during the flight, reserve a meal for your child, especially if your child has dietary restrictions. Vegetarian, Kosher, and other special meals must be reserved. If there is no meal service, be sure to pack a meal for your child.


Make sure your food and beverages comply with the airline’s rules.

, Electronic tickets, stored in the airline’s computer, will help make the trip hassle-free. Having e-tickets means your child won’t have to worry about carrying and possibly losing a paper ticket.

, Some airlines allow your child to step into the cockpit and speak with the pilot. Certain airlines offer free snack boxes, or “kid’s clubs” at their hub airports. Some airlines have a policy about seating UMs together, either in the front or the back of the plane, while other airlines will allow you to choose your child’s seat., If your child has never flown, it’s a good idea to take them to the local airport to have a look around. Take them as far as the security gates and explain the security procedures. Point out where assistance is available. On the day of the flight, you will be allowed to accompany your child to the departure gate, but a little familiarity beforehand won’t hurt., Instruct your child to inform a uniformed airline employee or security guard if they need help or feel threatened. This includes telling the flight attendant if anyone seated nearby is causing them distress., Put the details in writing and include the name of the connecting airport and flight details and tell your child to keep the paper in a safe place. Include information about the return flight as well., Explain that an airline employee will escort them off the plane to meet the person authorized to pick them up. Emphasize to your child that they must never exit the plane alone, including exiting if the plane stops en route to pick up and discharge passengers.Remind your child that they are not to leave the airport alone, or with a stranger.
If your child has any doubt about whether to get off the airplane at a particular stop, or any other questions or concerns, tell them to ask a flight attendant. Also, let them know about the flight attendant call button above the seat.

, Tell your child there will be no direct supervision on the flight, and they are expected to behave at all times. Explain the airline’s policy about safety procedures and about standing or walking in the aisle.Tell your child they may be given a badge to wear and that it must be worn at all times.

, Tell them that the pilot or flight attendant may make announcements on the flight. Encourage them to listen to all announcements carefully and to promptly comply with any request made by the pilot or flight attendants., Some children may feel nervous about flying alone. Tell them what to expect on the flight and explain that it can be fun to fly on a plane. Ensure them that they will be taken care of and that someone they know and trust will be waiting for them at the destination airport.


If your child is has a favorite toy, stuffed animal, or blanket, allow them to take it along on the flight to help them feel secure.

, Choose an outfit that is easy to manage in the aircraft’s small lavatories. Explain how to use a lavatory on an aircraft if your child has never been in one.

, Label any clothing that your child might remove during the flight, such as a sweater or a coat. You should also label their carry-on bag and other items, such as a tablet, headphones, or books.

, Pack items that your child might need if their checked luggage gets lost or delayed. Include medications, eyeglasses, hearing aids, a toothbrush, toothpaste, and an extra change of clothes.Pack records including a copy of your child’s complete itinerary, your home, work, and cell phone numbers, and the phone numbers of the person meeting the flight on this itinerary. Tell your child to keep this information inside the carry-on bag. Be sure to also send a copy of the itinerary to the person who will be meeting your child.Most airlines will not permit their employees to administer medication to children under any circumstances. If your child requires medication that they cannot take unassisted and which would normally be necessary during the time of the flight, ask your child’s doctor about alternatives.

, Tell your child how to request additional juice, soda, or water. Pack some snacks, even if a meal is to be served. Include gum, for chewing during take-off and landing to relieve air pressure changes., Books, travel games, and a coloring book and crayons are good ideas. If you include a portable DVD or CD player, explain to your child the airline’s rules regarding electronic devices. Be sure to pack headphones for any electronic device.Remind your child that the flight attendant or pilot might make an announcement requesting that all electronic devices be turned off for takeoff and landing and that they must do as requested.

, Add a cell phone or a pre-paid phone and explain to them how to use it. Show your child how to make a call, receive a call, and how to turn the phone on and off. Program in your numbers and the numbers of the person your child will be meeting at the end of the flight. It’s also a good idea to explain how to make a collect long-distance call from a pay telephone., This will be useful in case they don’t have a phone and need to call you. A little bit of money is also necessary for the child to buy a meal in case their flight is delayed., In addition to arriving one to two hours before the flight, you should factor in traffic delays, security delays, and time you might need to fill out any extra paperwork that may be required at check-in."

, Offers of car transport should only be accepted from airport counters or a staffed taxi rank / marked vehicles.

"
"
Avoid visiting places that are known crime hotspots.,
Be cautious when using electronic payment systems.,
Take the standard travel precautions for not looking like a tourist:


Don't flaunt your valuables.",How to Travel Safely in South Africa3," Ask your hotel or guest house concierge or other trusted people where it is safe to go and to warn you of places to keep away from. Some important things to keep in mind include:


Avoid going anywhere that is isolated, that is known for drug crimes, gang violence, etc. (ask so that you're aware!).
Don't go into the central business areas of main cities at night.Always take taxis at night. , As with most places, it is important to take sensible precautions when using ATMs and credit cards.


Keep your PIN covered whenever using an ATM. Use ATM's that are in well-lit places and not isolated.If people try crowding around you, leave that ATM and find another one. If there is any commotion at the ATM, leave, or suggest that people seek help from the bank - con artists can try any sort of distraction to part you from your money.
Don't let any payment by credit be made out of your sight. If a merchant tries to do this, demand the card back immediately and either find cash or don't proceed with the purchase. If it is a restaurant, go up to the payment counter and insist on seeing the transaction being performed. If you're worried that your card is compromised, contact your card provider immediately.

, Leave the expensive jewellery at home, avoid accessories or bags that are too flashy. Lonely Planet even recommends not wearing watches, no matter how inexpensive.Place all valuables and your passport in the hotel safety deposit box. Even then, place items inside sealed envelopes or lockable containers to prevent staff theft.
Dress down.
Speak quietly. Don't attract unwanted attention by being overly loud or brash.
Avoid looking at your guidebook or map in the open. Duck into a store or cafe to review where you're headed.
Keep bags well-held, never wear a wallet in your back pocket, and avoid carrying too much cash on you. Wear money pouches hidden well under your clothing if you need to carry a lot of cash.
Keep cameras in your shoulder bag rather than around your neck.

"
"
Ask advice from a member of the community about the areas that you intend to visit.,
Avoid walking anywhere that is isolated.,
Have the most up-to-date maps and information.",How to Travel Safely in South Africa4," Ask friends, hoteliers, concierges, retailers in malls, etc., where it is safe to walk and visit. Local knowledge is always preferable to even that in guidebooks, so don't be shy. Be careful, however, not to ask a stranger straight off the street.


See if it is possible to go with someone who is knowledgeable about the area you want to go to if you are afraid of getting lost.

,


Use common sense. If something doesn't feel right, don't go there, or leave quickly if you are there already.
SA Places recommends that you talk to the local people before walking into the very isolated areas of Kwazulu-Natal and the the Wild Coast of Transkei on your own. , Ask for copies of recent maps from the hotel or guest house.

"
"
When hiring a car, ask for one that has GPS installed.,

Be ready for left side drive.,
Keep to roads that are well signposted and that are in good condition.,
Follow standard car crime reduction basics:


Keep valuables out of sight at all times, including when you're in the car.",How to Travel Safely in South Africa5," If you bring your own, make sure that it has current southern African maps on it.

, This is required under South African law.

, If you're from a country with right side drive, it can be a challenge to switch driving modes and requires constant vigilance. This means not driving when you are tired, as you are more likely to lapse into driving the way that feels most natural.


It also takes time to learn the rhythm of how people drive in another country, so be wary at all times, including being prepared for suddenly stopping vehicles, such as minibus taxis.
Watch for aggressive driving. Gary Ronald, spokesman for the Automobile Association of South Africa, says that aggressive driving in South Africa can intimidate people who are not used to it.

, If you try to drive on roads with potholes and poorly sealed surfaces, damage to the car could leave you stranded and vulnerable. For long trips, plan your route in advance, and be sure that the car is in good working order, and that you have adequate fuel and cash.

, Items such as cameras, handbags, iPods, laptops, parcels, etc., should be kept in the trunk (boot) of the car.
When driving through a downtown area that is crowded, keep the car windows up and all the doors locked.This will prevent anyone from attempting to reach in when you're waiting at lights, etc.
Don't give anyone a lift.
Lock car doors when you park. Park in well-lit areas and set the alarm if you have one.
If you get lost, ask a police or traffic officer for directions.

Be sure to purchase health insurance cover before leaving your own country.,
Try to use private hospitals over public hospitals if you need to use a hospital.,
Ask your doctor's advice for your own health needs before leaving.,
Beware the South African sun.,
Practice safe sex measures.,

",How to Travel Safely in South Africa6," You should find out the details from your personal provider. Some credit cards will cover certain travel insurance.

, You won't wait as long, the staff will be attentive and the standards are high.Pharmacies are well stocked in major centres.

, Unless you are coming from another African country, you won't need any specific vaccinations; tropical disease concerns are not generally an issue in South Africa. However, malaria is a major health issue in some parts of South Africa (Kruger National Park, some areas in Mpumalanga, Limpopo, and northern KwaZulu-Natal),dependent on season, climate, and location. There is no risk of malaria in the major cities. Speak to your doctor or health clinic about the necessity of taking appropriate precautions - the advice is constantly updated.Moreover, it is standard good travel practice to have tetanus, typhoid, and hepatitis A shots up-to-date., It's hot and a lot of tourists don't realize this until the sunburn sets in.

Eat and drink wisely.,
Get recommendations for transportation from a trusted source.",How to Travel Alone Safely As a Woman in Latin America," Latin America is one of the most economically unequal regions of the world, which means the region is also home to higher crime rates. The machismo culture makes it more unsafe for a woman outsider, as you are perceived as weaker than men and therefore an easy target.


Read about the development and history of Latin America. Research information on cultural traditions, race, machismo, politics, trade, and the environment. Learning a bit about these topics will help you understand why locals may treat/perceive you a particular way, and also why the inequality exists.;
, You will be more prepared on the ground if you know where you should and should not be.


Research neighborhoods that are safe for international travelers, and those that should be avoided due to crime. Within those neighborhoods, identify the safe/unsafe places (restaurants, public parks, cafes, libraries, stores) and learn their physical locations.
Often, hostels and hotels listed in travel books are legitimate and safe, but always do internet research about the neighborhood the lodging is located in.

, Reach out to your social network and ask if they know anyone in this country. Utilize these contacts to learn more before you arrive, as the valuable information the internet provides can sometimes be out-of-date.

, Practice awareness, even before your trip. Try to take note of the number of people around you, the physical space you are in, your personal belongings, the time of day, and how you are being perceived. Practicing these skills at home—in an environment where you feel comfortable—will make them much easier to draw on during your travels.

, Here are a few examples of things that you may need to un-learn to protect yourself and your belongings:


Holding your phone loosely in your hand in public, or asking someone next to you at a café to watch your computer/stuff as you go to the bathroom.
Storing your credit card/money/phone in a back pocket or a purse that is poorly sealed and/or not close to your body.
Hanging your purse/backpack on the back of your chair or placing it on the ground in a café.
Meeting people in public and sharing information about what you do, the company you work for, or where you are staying.
Taking many photographs of yourself in public or having someone else take them of you.
Taking a significant amount of money out of an ATM and carrying it in public.
Outwardly displaying your wealth through fancy clothes, electronic gadgets, or jewelry.

, The culture of machismo is real and strong, especially as a “gringa” outsider. You are seen as exotic and sometimes even “easy”, as many Latin American men perceive North American/European/Australian women as more available and promiscuous.

,


If you can, speak the language of the country you’re in instead of English.
Dress conservatively (no tight dresses, no high heels, no flashy jewelry), and do not use excessive makeup. Dressing provocatively invites extra attention, so be sure to avoid looking your best when traveling alone!
Ignore whistles and catcalls. Smiling back invites the person trying to get your attention to approach you.

, Although you may want to meet locals and experience true cultural immersion through nightlife, do not go alone into a local party, club, or even a restaurant at night. Instead find other foreigners to go with you!


Stay alert and aware, especially at night. This means not drinking too much!
Keep an eye on your drink when out in public, and don’t accept drinks from people you don’t know.

, The less stuff you bring, the more control you have over the important belongings that you need. Pack only the essentials, and invest in a travel backpack that will enable you to be mobile at all times. If something happens, you don’t want to be weighed down by heavy luggage.

, You might also want to print out a copy and store it in a safe secret place in your luggage, especially if you’re traveling to a location without reliable Internet access.

, This includes your passport number, social security number, cell phone numbers of your family, local emergency number in the country you are in, personal banking information, and the address of your home country’s embassy in each foreign country you plan to visit.

,


Look up your international country code before you travel, and as soon as you arrive, make a test call at a local call center or via Skype.
Create a Skype account to make international calls and fund it with money. Although many internet cafés have Skype, many hostels/hotels have WiFi. Make sure you have the Skype App on your smartphone so you can connect and call home.

, Contact your bank/credit card company to notify them you will be traveling abroad. This way, they will not cancel your card if they see a strange foreign charge. Also ask them about ATM fees and credit card charges, and figure out the least costly way to withdraw money.


Ideally, you should bring two cards on your trip (a credit card and debit card). Store the cards in different places (one on your body and one in a secure luggage compartment) so if one gets stolen you have the other.

, If you will be on the move, invest in a cheap cell phone that they can call to check in on you.

, These books have the latest information about restaurants, hotels, taxi services, neighborhoods, etc. These books also have detailed maps, which are great resources for international travelers.

, Since you may not have access to your smartphone (and therefore live maps of where you are) in this country, study the basic geography of the location you will be traveling, as well as the main highways and key landmarks., Airports are the perfect place for locals to identify travelers that do not know what they are doing, so have everything in order as you leave the airport.

, Use it to store the bulk of your critical belongings—your passport, cash, credit cards, and phone. Keep a small amount of cash in a purse for a taxi so you don’t have to reveal the location of the belt.

,, If this is not an option, book your first few days in the country at a legitimate, trusted hostel/hotel and arrange for a ride from the airport through them. This ride may be more expensive than the going rate, but your safety is worth the extra money.


Tell the hostel/hotel your name and make sure that the person approaching you is from your hostel and knows your full name. Never get in a taxi with a driver who approaches you and simply states he is from “your” hostel. Here are some helpful phrases:

Do you know my name: ¿Sabes cuál es mi nombre?
Hi, are you from Hostel Miraflores: Hola, ¿eres del Hostal Miraflores?



, Keep all of your bags in the back seat with you, ideally at your feet. Do not put your backpack on the seat next to you, as someone could easily break a window and steal it when the taxi is stopped at a red light or in traffic.


Do not play with your phone, camera, or computer on this ride. Keep all of your belongings at your feet, and try to blend into this new environment.

, Keep a mental inventory of all of your belongings (cameras, phones, computers, headphones, travel books, shoes) and stay very organized. Do not leave your belongings scattered across your room. Keep important things contained and out of sight (especially if someone is cleaning your room). Use a safety deposit box if you have access to one, especially for your passport and other valuables.

, In most places in Latin America, you should avoid drinking the tap water, especially in rural places or in cheaper hostels and restaurants. Also avoid eating things that may have been washed in the water and not cooked thoroughly, such as salad or raw vegetables.

, Do not accept offers of transportation from just anyone, even if it’s a taxi that seems registered. Instead, find out the best services from the hostel/hotel you are using, and pre-arrange rides through them. Ideally, always use transportation with someone you know.

Get insurance coverage for your photography equipment.,
Have everything in order with your papers.,
Take the right photography gear with you.,
Travel safe.,
Learn and respect the local laws and social customs.,
Learn the basics of the language where you're traveling.,
Do regular photo back-ups.,
Check travel advisories from your own country before venturing into countries in strife or with domestic problems.",How to Travel Safely As a Photographer," Check whether or not your travel insurance covers your photography equipment. If not, seek additional insurance. It's never possible to know whether or not your equipment is safe – it might be stolen, lost, or broken at any part of your journey. Knowing that you're properly covered in the event of any of these things happening will ease the pain of losing your equipment a little. More importantly, knowing you've got insurance can also stop you from reacting in a foolhardy fashion and trying to defend your equipment if you're mugged.


Type up a list of every photography item you're taking with you. Keep a copy in your email draft folder or in cloud storage, a printed copy with someone trusted back home and several printed copies on you in different places, such as your handbag and suitcase. These lists will help you to identify stolen or lost property quickly.;
, Carrying a camera can sometimes raise a suspicion that you're a photo journalist or someone trying to document suspicious activities, and that can cause paranoid guards or police to be wary of you.


Make sure that your passport is up-to-date with at least 6 months on it before expiry.
Get all necessary visas prior to travel.
Have all of your vaccinations before leaving, and be sure to include proofs in your papers.

, In some countries, you might not be able to just ""pick up"" things you forgot to bring, or there may be issues of compatibility or affordability involved. On the other hand, you don't want to overload yourself with non-essential gear. Plan in advance to be sure that you have each piece of photography equipment that you know you'll actually need, as well as any suitable spares but no more. Some suggestions to consider include:

Carry all suitable plug-ins and converters for the destinations you're headed for. If you're going to be in multiple countries, check online what you might need.






Carry a small, portable and durable external hard drive. Some countries may not allow you to carry your computer with you and you will want a place to store your photographs safely. (Try to find out this information in advance.)






Take the right type of camera for the type of trip you're taking. If you'll be snorkeling or diving, use a camera able to withstand being in water; same for wet jungle expeditions. If you're going somewhere very hot or cold, take the climatic conditions into account when deciding on the camera type. Remember that batteries won't work well, if at all, in many extreme weather temperatures, so you might need work-arounds.






Be sure to pack your photography equipment correctly to avoid damage. This isn't only for during transportation but also when you're carrying it. Use straps if provided, especially if you scare easily or get excited; it can be easy to drop a camera in a moment of excitement at getting ""just the right shot""!






Invest in a travel tripod if you don't want to carry a larger one. These are very compact and can improve the quality of your shots considerably more than having nothing to lean on.

, Traveling with photography equipment can set you apart as someone worth robbing, begging from, or bothering. The following safety ideas are aimed at reducing the chances of this happening:


Avoid carrying your equipment in well-known, labeled photography bags. Thieves grow to know the sign of these very quickly and can target you easily. Instead, try to ease your camera into an ordinary bag, even if still encased in its proper bag. Modern plastic cameras with modest-sized lenses can take somewhat rough use and don't always need a special bag; keep a clear filter over the lens to avoid scratching it. For more stuff a diaper bag (for women) or a gym-type bag (for men) could be helpful; don't use a bag that could inadvertently be thrown away. This is more of a problem where there are lots of people and in countries, cities, or areas with low trust issues. A cooler is a very strong, inconspicuous hard case (some padding inside is appropriate) and protects its contents against impact and external heat for several hours, such as might be present each day in a car trunk. A latch would help prevent inadvertent dumping of contents.
Travel with someone or as a group. When there is someone else with you, they can keep an eye out for you while you're busy lost in taking photos. They can also act as a deterrent to thieves or muggers when it's obvious that you're part of a pair or group.

Stay alert. Even though part of the fun of photography is to lose yourself in seeing the beauty or the unusual around you, a traveling photographer needs to be alert on two levels – the first level is about staying alert for your safety, the second level being looking for the ideal shot. Only after you're reassured that you're safe should you take your photos.
If you want to scout a place before taking photos, consider leaving the photography equipment back at the hotel safe while you do your check. That way, you can ponder and muse without having to be quite so alert to the possibility of your equipment being targeted.
Look the part. Always act like you know what you're doing and where you're headed, even if you don't. Being confident is a huge part of being left alone by people looking for easy prey.
If you have any suspicion at all that you're being followed, immediately seek help. Stop in a shop, latch onto a group of people, go into a restaurant, etc. Do whatever it takes to put the person off. Once you are located somewhere safer, call the police or friends to come and help you. Don't even think about taking out your photography gear!
Don't risk your life and limbs. Is that crazy shot really worth dangling over the edge of the cliff or clambering out on a tightrope wire? Be a sound judge of your physical limitations and don't push them. Remember, you're holding equipment that you don't want to drop, and if something does go wrong, the momentary confusion between saving yourself or your equipment could be enough to lose both of you. Just don't risk it.

, Knowledge of local laws and customs can ensure that you don't put your foot in it.


Some cultures detest or fear being photographed because they fear that the camera ""steals their soul"" (sympathetic magic or native cultural belief).Respect their beliefs even if you find it foreign or backward to your way of thinking. Other people are suffering from ""tourist burnout""; they're frankly sick of people taking their photos every which way and find it invasive or even offensive. Always cease photographing any person who objects – that's plain good manners. Read up on every culture you'll encounter and want to photograph; that way you'll be able to avoid distressing anybody.
Avoid treating individual people as if they're part of the backdrop or landscape. If you feel uncomfortable or arrogant in taking photos, listen to your feelings.Ask people if you can take a photograph of them individually or at work, play, etc. Consider how you would feel if somebody took photos of you without asking for permission as you're trying to run your market stall, or get on with your daily business. Not everybody appreciates the limelight but some people will be incredibly honored and you might even strike up a fruitful conversation, so it's always worth asking first, as a bit of considerate socializing can oil the wheels, so to speak. Another method for asking for permission suggested by Darren Rowse is to gesture to the camera, smile, and mime taking their photos with a quizzical look.You'll usually get an answer to this in affirmative because you bothered, but if it's a no, respect that.
Be especially considerate when photographing children as the close-up subjects of your photo. It'd probably freak you out if someone drove up and took photos of your kids playing on the front lawn. Keep this in mind when taking shots of kids at play in their homes, and remember that for some cultures, the fear of soul-stealing is greater in relation to children, who are viewed as more fragile.You don't want angry parents tearing after you; seek to establish a relationship first before taking photographic liberties.
Sometimes it pays to pay. Not everyone agrees with this but think about it: You've got the money, they've got the smile. Is this a case of standing on your principles, or of throwing a bit of your easy-earned cash to people living hard? Think it through carefully. Not doing so might lead to conflict if there's a general understanding in place that tourists cough up for photos. If you don't like making a payment, carry small gifts from your home country to appease people with, as suggested by Darren Rowse.Know the politics of a country before photographing anything that can be construed as politically sensitive. If you're in France and the students revolt, you're probably fine to take photos but if you're in a repressive country and you try the same, you might find yourself being rounded up by suspicious police. Use your common sense at all times.
Always obey signs that ask you not to take photographs. They mean it. Religious establishments want you to respect their faith; law enforcement and government agencies want you to respect their government's idea of privacy and secrecy, from airports to nuclear facilities; commercial entities worry about their copyrights, trademarks, and confidentiality being breached; and places that have animals worry about the animals being disturbed, scared, or harmed by photography. There is usually a genuine reason behind these requests and there will usually be an equally swift response to you seeking to break their requests or laws. When you break an actual law, you risk having your camera equipment being removed from you and perhaps even being arrested. See ""Tips"" for examples of the types of places and occasions to be careful about when photographing.

, Knowing some basic words goes a long way to being a polite photographer and will increase your chances of people agreeing to being photographed, or letting their home or artworks, etc., be photographed.


Carry a phrasebook with you at all times. One that fits in your camera bag is a good idea.
Try to learn the basic words for the area of photography that interests you most. For example, if you love photographing craft created by native peoples, learn the words for the craft items, such as baskets, clay pots, woven blankets, etc. If you love nature, learn the words for native trees and animals, etc.
Always learn please, thank you, ""you're welcome"", ""please help me"", and ""you're beautiful"".

, Do your best to try to offload your photo collection as you travel, so that if something does go wrong, you don't lose the entire collection. Some ideas include:


Mail home memory cards regularly. Try to use registered mail for this and pad really well. Send it to a family member or friend rather than your lonely mailbox back home.
Download your photos onto a computer or other storage system if you're carrying such.
Upload photos to cloud storage. This can be paid or free, although paid storage at this stage will likely be greater than free. If you really can't afford to maintain one paid account, open different accounts with different cloud storage sites to cover your needs. You'll need to have good records of where you've left them though, along with passwords and any decoy email accounts you've set up for this purpose. Keep in mind that photo exchange online can chew up your broadband allowance in some places and you may be asked to pay more.

, Wandering into strife-torn countries with a camera can be asking for trouble, especially if you're mistaken for a journalist.

Before you go, explain to your children what they should do if they get separated at any time from you or their guardians.,
Provide memory aids.,
Use your camera or cell phone and take a picture of your children when you arrive at the park.,
Make sure everyone in your group, including parents and older siblings, are wearing the same bright, recognizable clothing.,
Bring along a way to communicate with your kids.,
Find a place to designate as your 'meeting spot' if someone from the group is separated, once you arrive at the amusement park.,
Remember to stay together at all times.",How to Take Action when You Lose Sight of Your Child at an Amusement Park1," Tell them to find a uniformed park employee and explain to them that they have been parted from their group. Have them explain to the employee (or security officer) their name, your names and where they got lost.

Although asking strangers should not be a first choice, telling a child he or she should not talk to strangers or make them afraid of strangers may instill unnecessary fear. In an emergency, a child is actually often aided by a bystanders. Instead, have them focus on who is most likely to be a good choice and why: a mother with children, a grandfather with grandchildren, or a daycare worker. These are all people who are entrusted with children and are probably good with children. There is no guarantee that a park employee is completely safe, after all.

Practice what the child should do in case they cannot find parents. Going over the drill once at the park entrance is unlikely to be successful. This is something you can do while waiting in a line or while waiting for Dad to finish his lunch. Ask the child who he or she could go to for help in the immediate area.
Do this at home, too. Children can get separated from caregivers at malls, grocery stores, and downtown. It is a game that helps situational awareness, practicing self-care, and a sense of security.



 

;
, Children may not remember phone numbers, and very young children may only say your name is ""Daddy"". Remind them they have it and tell them to give it to a member of staff if they get lost or by something like a dog tag or a bracelet. You can by them with the name of the child and your mobile phone number in it.

Very prepared parents make up bright colored T-shirts with contact information on it. These can be made very inexpensively with printable transferable sheets. Just remember not to put the child's name on it--this could be used by predators to gain a child's trust. Phone numbers can be printed on the back of the shirt if you do not want it in family photos.
Write your mobile phone number on a sticker and fix it to their shirt. If you do not have a sticker write it on paper and put it in their pocket
A piece of tape with a phone number on the back is a time-tested teacher field trip precaution. Children are unlikely to lose it or have a bracelet fall off.
A panicked child may not remember a memorized phone number, or that there is a card with your phone number on it.







, This way you will have a current picture with you.

, Bold orange or yellow shirts will work fine for this purpose. Avoid wearing dark colors as these will make you and your children blend in easily with the crowd, and avoid putting your child's name on it. This will make it easy for strangers to call them out and take your child with them.

, You can give older siblings a cellphone (just make sure they know your number). Younger kids can benefit from the use of a walkie-talkie to keep in touch with you should they get lost. Show them how to use it and explain that it is not a toy, but a way to reunite if you do get separated.

, Crowded, commonly designated areas like the front gates of the park or at a bench next to a popular attraction are not good meeting spaces as they will be very crowded at all times of the day and relatively unsafe for a young child to be sitting at alone. Instead, choose a less popular area to meet up, like at the security booth or next to the restaurant where you plan to eat. This will make it easier to find a lost child.

, You probably won't mind letting older kids go off on their own for a while (as long as they keep in touch via cellphone), but younger children should hold your hand and stay with you as you walk through the park. Keep a firm grip to prevent your child from slipping away. In especially large, crowded amusement parks (i.e. Walt Disney World), it might be better to safely fasten your child in a stroller or carrier instead of allowing them to walk, lessening the chances of being separated.

Check security threats before you book.,
Pack appropriately.,
Book excursions through your cruise line.,
Leave your valuables at home.,
Find a buddy.,
Ignore distractions.,
Stay alert.,
Stay on main streets.,
Invest in travel insurance.,
Bank on the boat.,
Always set an alarm.",How to Stay Safe at a Cruise Port," One of the best ways to make sure you stay safe at a port of call is to avoid going to any truly dangerous ports. Before you book a cruise, look over its itinerary and check with both your nation and the port’s home nation to see if any threats are listed.


Departments or Ministries of State often issue travel warnings and alerts for international destinations. Call or check online with the appropriate government agency in your country to see if they have listed any warnings for any of your intended ports.Check with appropriate agency in the port’s home nation, as well, to see if they have issued any local warnings regarding the area.;
, Part of staying safe in a cruise port is ensuring you are not an easy-to-spot target. Avoid packing items such as Hawaiian shirts, fanny packs, socks to be worn with sandals, baseball caps, and other pieces that will make you stand out from the crowd as a tourist.Take a look at current fashion and clothing trends in the areas you will visit. Find copies of local magazines online or look through photos on blogs and in newspapers. You don’t need to look like a high fashion local. Simply get a sense of what would look obviously uncommon in the region.
Instead of carrying a fanny pack, a bag with a wide opening, or a backpack, opt for investing in an anti-theft bag, which is slash proof and often much more inconspicuous., If you plan on doing a shore excursion or tour while you’re in the port, book through your cruise line rather than finding an independent tour group. Cruise lines thoroughly vet their tour operators and keep records of their licenses and insurance.If there is a type of tour or excursion that you want to do but that is not listed as one of your shore excursion options, talk to your cruise director. They may have recommendations on trustworthy local tour companies.
If you insist on booking with an independent tour guide, ask for copies of their licensing and insurance before you book. If they refuse to provide such, do not book with them.

, Perceived wealth can greatly impact who petty thieves target. Leave valuable items such as tablets, computers, jewelry, expensive DSLR cameras, and designer clothing or accessories at home. If you must take certain items with you, lock them in a safe in your cabin and do not bring them with you on shore.Many people opt to use a fake wedding ring when traveling. This way, should the fake get stolen or damaged, the original is still safe.
If you are taking an international cruise, consider getting a cheap burner phone with an international SIM card and/or data plan rather than bringing your smartphone.
Avoid carrying large amounts of cash and multiple credit cards into port. Take one or two cards and/or a small sum of cash, and leave the rest locked in your room’s safe.

, A single traveler is an easy target for theft and crime while on shore. Always stick with at least one other traveler while you are away from the ship. If you are not traveling with another person, book group tours or excursions.Having a travel partner is especially important for women in international ports to avoid sexual harassment and assault, as while it can happen to any person of any sex, it is most highly reported amongst women., If someone comes up to you while you are leaving the ship or around town asking you for help or trying to sell you something, ignore them. This is a common tactic for pickpockets. While one person has your attention, another will come up behind you and try to sneak away your wallet or valuables.This goes for children as well as adults, especially in areas with major income disparities like Brazil or India. Children are often made by others to work as anything from petty thieves to violent thieves.If you notice someone trying intently to distract you, cover your pockets, keep a tight hand on your bag, and walk quickly away to a nearby, highly populated area.

, Regardless of whether you are going to be in a port for two hours or two days, it is important to be aware of your surroundings. Try to avoid intoxication while in port, and watch and listen closely to the activity around you.Petty thieves are generally active in tourist areas and around high-profile attractions such as monuments and museums. Stay alert and keep your valuables close to your body in these areas.
Always wear your bag across your body from shoulder to hip and keep your bag toward the front of your body where you can always keep an eye on it.

, Avoid going through back streets, alleys, poorly lit areas, and areas with few people in them. Instead, stay on main roads, well-lit streets, and streets that have people actively walking up and down along side them.


Back streets are an easy place to single out a tourist, especially for violent crime purposes. They are rarely actively monitored, and thus pose a large safety risk.
If there is something you genuinely want to check out in an out-of-the-way place, such as hidden bar or restaurant, go with a large group and see if you can arrange a guide who speaks the local language to get you there.

, Travel insurance can cover any number of mishaps from medical expenses to trip interruptions. Compare travel insurance plans available in your area online or call your current insurance companies to see if they offer travel insurance plans.Take a look at what the insurance covers. For safety in port, you want insurance that covers medical expenses as well as lost or stolen goods.
If you do not understand what level of coverage you’re getting based on the policy information, call the insurance company and ask, “Can you explain to me in plain terms the coverage this plan would offer?”

, Many cruise ships have ATMs onboard, and it is advisable to use them even if they charge higher fees. ATMs onboard the ship are generally checked frequently for skimmers and scanners, and are often more safe than the ones you will find in port.If you absolutely have to use an ATM while in port, only use one located in or directly outside of bank, and check for loose scanners and keypads before dipping your card.

, The ship is not going to wait for you if you are running late coming back from the port. Set an alarm or carry a watch to make sure that you make it back to the ship on time and avoid getting stranded in unfamiliar and potentially dangerous locations.Keep the phone number for the cruise line’s customer service line with you at all times. If an unforeseen circumstance causes you to miss your ship, call immediately and request help.

Elect a group leader.,
Decide on a cruise.,
Reserve your cruise early so you can be selective about your cabins.,
Communicate with your group by email.,
Book flights into the departure city a day early.,
Ask for a group discount when you book.",How to Plan a Group Cruise1," Having one person who is willing to coordinate the details and keep in touch with everyone will make the entire planning process easier.


Choose someone who is organized and has a strong personality. Too many decision makers will cause chaos when planning a cruise. An ideal group leader will take everyone's opinions into consideration and then make a final judgment.;
, This means choosing the dates of travel, the port of departure, the length of the cruise and the cruise destinations. Everyone should be able to make recommendations.


Allow everyone to share ideas, then have the group leader narrow it down to 2 or 3 options, and let everyone vote. Or, prioritize what is most important. If sailing dates and cost take priority, narrow the options that way.

, If you need adjoining cabins, triples or quads, those will go quicker on a cruise ship than a standard double cabin.


Consider the weather and other travel implications when you book. For example, a cruise in the Caribbean in September will put you there in the middle of hurricane season. Summer cruises might be crowded with families and children, which could be good or bad depending on whether there are kids in your group.

, Touching base by phone or text is great, but when you use email you can be sure the entire group of travelers is on the same page.

, This is especially important if you are flying out of a cold climate in the winter. You need enough time between arrival and embarkation. Do not let anyone miss the boat.

, Some cruise lines will offer you other benefits, such as a reduced rate on excursions, cabin upgrades and shipboard credits.

Never go out alone on a cruise ship, especially when the place you are going to seems lonely or has few people.,
Thwart being thrown off, if possible.,
If you are thrown off or fall off, try to hang onto something.,
Once you are in the water, scream as loud as you can.,
Stay afloat.,
Continue to scream even if someone on the ship sees and runs off to get help.,
Unfortunately, the ship might go far away soon without anyone noticing.,
If you can see shore, then swim towards it.,
If you do happen to be rescued, seek medical attention immediately.,
Be reasonable.",How to React if You Fall off a Cruise Ship," This is typically where dangerous activity is most likely to happen. Always bring along someone else, or make sure plenty of others are around.;
, If someone begins to approach you strangely and picks you up/begins to push you, scream as loud as you can, and cry for help. In such dire situations, it is publicly acceptable to do anything to gain attention. Screaming ""FIRE!"" is likely to get others to notice than just ""Help!"" Bite, spit on, kick, or do anything else to defend yourself on the person attempting to hurt you. While this may seem like a joke, it is what people are advised to do if approached by an attacker and not at all a joke. This may help repel the attacker.

, For example, if the ship has several decks and you happen to pass by other decks as you drop, grab hold of the railings or other bearings.

, DO NOT take your time - it is a matter of life and death. Scream, ""HELP! I'M DROWNING! RESCUE ME! I'M DYING!"", or anything else you can think of.

, Don't panic. Move your arms and legs back and forth, doing free-stroke. Hang onto anything that may have fallen off the ship as a result of your descent, such as a plank of wood, or anything else that floats.

, You need as much attention as possible.

, Wave your arms up in the air to signal help. If you see any ships near, continue to do so. Hang onto a branch if you can see it.

, This is a last-ditch effort. If shore is nowhere nearby but there is an island, and you happen to make it successfully, be prepared to survive in the wild until rescue comes.

, Chances are, you will be injured and in some kind of trauma. Report the case to authorities in the ship immediately. If you are in trauma, or are scared, remind yourself that you have survived falling off a ship, and tell yourself that you will recover in the end.

, If you have been stranded for more than about three or four hours and no ships have happened to pass by, your chances of survival are extremely low. While it may be depressing, console yourself with memories of good times..

Don't panic, in the event that your child does get lost or separated.,
Stay collected and focused on what you need to do next.,
Find the nearest employee or security officer, and explain that your child is lost.,
Give the employee or officer a complete description of your child: what he or she looks like, what he or she is wearing, etc.,
Cooperate with the park security.,
Stay where you are, unless the park security instructs you otherwise.,
Check the park's Lost & Found center, and see if you can find your child or young group member there.",How to Take Action when You Lose Sight of Your Child at an Amusement Park2," This may sound like a cliché that is sometimes impossible to remember, but if you panic you are only worsening the situation.

, Also, keep in mind that your child may not really be lost. They may have simply slipped out of your grip and are following behind, or are stopping to look at something. If you have looked everywhere around you and absolutely cannot find them, continue to the next step.

, They will radio the security office to inform them that there is a lost child in the park.

, This will make it easier for them to locate your child. Tell them if there is a specific area that your child might be likely to go to, such as a favorite ride or activity, or a pre-arranged meeting location. Take a picture of your child before going to the park (dressed in the same clothes, etc.) on your cellphone, if possible. You can show or share this with security personnel.

, Panicking or disagreeing with the security may land you in more frustration than you are in already. They are experienced professionals trained to deal with this type of situation. In fact, they see similar situations hundreds of times a year.

, Your child may be nearby, just hidden in the crowd, and will most likely come back to you if they see where you are.

, Many amusement parks have stations like these where employees who find lost children take them. There are usually some activities there to keep your child occupied until they can be reunited with you/their group. In most cases, your lost child or group member will be found by now if you have given the security a good description of them. If hours pass and your child is still not found, they will contact the local authorities.

Consider the lifestyles and budgets of those you are with.",How to Plan a Group Cruise2," While all of you might be going in different directions throughout the day, agreeing to share the evening meal together will give you an opportunity to be together and share the best parts of your day.

, Depending on the number of people in your group, it might be difficult to do everything together. Instead, plan a few outings together. Meet for coffee one morning, enjoy a show in the evening or meet up for the midnight buffet.

, Not everyone needs to do the same excursions, but you can break into smaller groups to explore your destinations.


Stay on the boat, if that is more your speed. You can take advantage of swimming pools, eat some more, hit the gym or enjoy a spa service on most ships.

, You do not need to be part of the group all the time. Everyone will find themselves needing a little quiet time in the cabin or some solitary reading time on a lounge chair.

, Try not to pressure your group members into a $250 excursion if you are the only one who can afford it.

Determine your destination.,
Figure out how much money you are able to spend on this cruise.,
Decide how long you want to stay on the cruise.,
Choose a cruise line.,
Choose the stateroom that you want to stay in on your cruise.,
Determine what activities you want to participate in not only on the ship but also at the port of calls that the cruise ship will stop at.,
Purchase cruise tickets.",How to Plan a Cruise," Cruises can now take passengers anywhere in the world. Whether you want to go to Caribbean, Alaska, Greece or Australia, the world is at your fingertips. Decide exactly what you want to do and see on your cruise and this will make you choosing your destination much easier.;
, This determination will in essence help you decide how long you want to stay on the cruise. Keep in mind, there are cruises year around so if you are not able to spend what you want on the first one, start planning another one immediately upon your return.

, You can stay on a cruise as little as 3 or 4 days and as long as a month. The only thing that determines this time is how long you want to stay and how much money you are able to spend.

, Depending on what you have decided about what you expect to do and spend on your cruise, the cruise line you choose should meet these expectations. There are Disney cruises, lesbian and gay cruises, singles cruises and even booze cruises, so the choice is yours.

, This is a much more difficult choice than some people assume. If you choose a suite, you will pay more for the room and also probably have a butler service and a beautiful view. Many cruise lines are updating their staterooms so that most have a beautiful view and are larger than the original staterooms. In other words, you will be getting more for your money.

, These activities will vary depending on what cruise line you choose and which places the ship stops. Make sure you take extra money for souvenirs, alcoholic beverages and extra activities aboard the ship that were not included in the price of the cruise.

, This can be done directly through the cruise line's website or through a travel agency. Booking in advance can sometimes get you a good discount but that is not always offered through all the cruise lines. If something comes up and you are not able to make your cruise, some cruise lines will reimburse you the full or partial price of your ticket if canceled a certain amount of time prior to the cruise.

Check the regulations listed by your cruise line.,
Make a list of things to bring.,
Lay everything out beforehand.,
Plan out your wardrobe.,
Bring a separate carry-on bag.,
Consider the destination of your cruise.,
Bring a swimsuit.,
Don’t forget a jacket.,
Throw in some nicer clothes.,
Leave prohibited items at home.,
Make sure you have a big enough suitcase.,
Only bring what you can’t go without.,
Fold your clothes.,
Use your storage pockets.",How to Pack for a Cruise," Before you even unzip your suitcase, you should be clear on what is and isn't permitted on your cruise ship. Review the website or informational packet supplied by the company you booked your trip with. Pay particular attention to sections that outline what types of items you should pack, along with what is recommended for you to enjoy your getaway. Every cruise line will be a little different, so seeing the do's and don'ts laid out in black and white can give you a leg up prior to departure.


Most companies have a separate page on their websites outlining essential items you'll want to have with you on a cruise.;
, Compile a list of everything you know you’ll need on your cruise. This will obviously include a few changes of clothes for various situations, sleepwear, and basic hygiene products, but you might also want to bring along a camera, beach supplies, alcohol or your laptop or tablet. Take care not to forget anything major.Make sure each item has been safely put away in your bag before checking it off the list.
Start making your list early to give yourself time to remember things right up to the moment you leave.
Many cruise companies allow passengers to carry on a small amount of alcohol. Check out the rules and regulations of the cruise line you booked your trip with to see what types and quantities they approve., Rather than hunting down each item individually as you go over your list, get it all out and neatly arranged in one place. After that, you can focus on finding a place for everything. Only set out what corresponds directly to an entry on the list. This will make packing much faster once you determine what goes and what stays.Gathering all your belongings at once will also give you a handy visual layout, making it easier to spot anything that’s missing.

, Think about the length of the trip you’re taking and prepare accordingly when packing clothes. It’s worth remembering that there are different dress expectations for different areas of the ship, so don’t exclusively load up on lounge wear or fancier selections. Be sure that you have something to wear every day, and bring enough clean garments that you won’t be left in the lurch if something gets dirty.You won’t need a fresh outfit every single day. Grab a handful of tops, bottoms and accessories, then mix and match different combinations.Most people make the mistake of over-packing clothing. This just makes finding room in your bags and toting them around more complicated.

, Stash whatever you need to have on hand in a small bag that you can bring with you when you board. Your travel documentation, including your passport, visas and ID, will need to go in this bag, along with other official paperwork like a copy of your ticket. As with a flight, larger pieces of luggage will usually be checked below deck until the cruise ship departs, so you won’t be able to get to your main bags until you’ve reached open water.Slip a mobile device, book or magazine into your carry-on so you’ll have something to do during slower moments.More compact items can also go into your carry-on rather than in your primary luggage.

, Not every cruise will have the same packing requirements. Take into account what the climate is like where you’ll be going. If it’s a Caribbean tour, for instance, you’ll want to have at least one swimsuit, along with other warm-weather accessories like shorts, tank tops and sandals. For longer trips, these items might comprise as much as half the clothing you bring.Include a pair of khakis or skirt and collared shirt or blouse for places where short sleeves aren’t acceptable.

, Even if you’re not making stops in Oahu or the Bahamas, you’ll want to plan on throwing in a pair of swim trunks or a bikini. Many cruises feature temperature-controlled pools, hot tubs and steam rooms among the amenities they offer. To take advantage of these amenities, you’ll need the proper swimwear.If you get away without a swimsuit, your only option will to be to purchase one from one of the ship’s gift shops, which are often steeply overpriced.
Lather up with sunscreen and put on your sunglasses to protect yourself while you swim or tan.

, Toss a jacket into your luggage or carry-on in case you get chilly above deck or at port. Travelers headed to frigid locations like Alaska or Iceland should gear up with a warm, heavy coat (wear this one onto the ship to save room). Beachgoers should also make room in their suitcases for a hoodie or cardigan for those windy nights.One helpful guideline is to dress in layers, regardless of where you’re headed. That way, you’ll be able to put on and take off clothing as you see fit. You should, of course, choose bulkier layers for cold-weather cruises.
For cold-weather cruises, take a hat and scarf and slip a pair of gloves into the pockets of your coat.

, Unless you plan on hitting the buffet for every meal throughout your trip, class up your wardrobe with a set of formal or resort casual attire. Gentlemen can wear a polo or button down shirt with a dinner jacket and slacks; ladies should pack a skirt, evening gown or party dress. In some instances, certain restaurants and clubs adhere to strict dress codes. It would be a shame to miss out on these soirees because you’re not dressed properly.You don’t have to get as fancy as a tuxedo or gown. As long as you look tasteful and presentable, most places will admit you. Lavish clothes will help you stand out among your fellow travelers, though, and can make for good photo opportunities.
If you expect to go out for an expensive dinner or visit places with a more conservative atmosphere once you reach port, bring along more than one ensemble.

, Cruise lines are very clear about what they don't want you to bring aboard the ship. Leave behind dangerous items like weapons, illegal drugs, sharp objects, candles and other flammable objects, along with anything that could interfere with the operation of the ship. These will usually get disposed of at the security checkpoints if they're discovered in your luggage, so there's a risk of losing your belongings if you don't do your homework. Save yourself the trouble later on and only pack what you need.Refer back to the packing recommendations provided by your cruise line to learn what sort of things are not allowed on the ship.
If you're unsure whether or not you should bring a particular item with you, it might be safest not to include it in your luggage.

, Now is the time to examine your valise or duffel bag and see if it meets your spatial demands. For a short weekend jaunt, you might not need much more than a rucksack, provided you’re a light packer. If you’re going to be gone for a week or longer, however, go with a travel suitcase or even an old-fashioned steamer trunk.You should have your travel bags picked out and ready to go long before you begin packing.
Be careful not to cram your suitcase so full of stuff that it’s hard to lug around.

, Be prepared to leave non-essential items behind. You’re not moving in—packing a different outfit for every day or half a dozen pairs of shoes is unnecessary. After you get together everything you’d like to bring, pare it down to whatever will fit comfortably in your suitcase, and leave room for an item or two you’ll inevitably forget until the last minute.Your cruise ship will be able to supply soap, shampoo, toothpaste and other toiletries, so if you’re concerned about your luggage capacity, these can be left behind.

, Yes, it’s a hassle, but neatly folding and arranging your clothing items will be a big help when it comes to freeing up space. Place the burliest apparel, like trousers and sweaters, on the bottom of the suitcase and stack smaller, lighter garments (socks, underwear, etc.) on top. Clumsily shoving everything into the corners of your suitcase is a good way to run out of room fast.You can also try rolling things like t-shirts and shorts to get them down to a smaller surface area. Fair warning, though—this method doesn't work well for all types of clothing and is prone to causing creasing.Hang clothing that you want to keep clean and wrinkle-free.

, The zipper pockets on your luggage are there for a reason. Store smaller essentials, like your toiletries, paper goods and phone charger, in these slots where they won’t take up space on the inside of your suitcase. That leaves the biggest section open for the biggest belongings.Making use of the pockets also keeps you from having to unzip and dig through your suitcase every time you need to retrieve a smaller item.
Secure your travel papers, electronic accessories and other valuable goods in the pockets of your luggage. It’s much safer than carrying them on your person.

This is especially great for kids (5+), because they are less likely lose their card.


Note: go to the purser and request that your younger kids do not have any signing privileges just in case the card gets lost and someone tries to use it. Also if you can find those small flat watertight containers, that helps for shore excursions so you don't have to bring a purse/wallet.;
, You can pack everyone's clothes separately (tops, bottoms, underwear, swimsuits, dressy items). This way when you get those weird, awkward, small shelves (like on Norwegian), you can shove 2 or 3 bags in each (the lowest ones can go to the youngest kids) and you can save your drawer space for other junk items like hairbrushes, itineraries/those daily sheets, sunscreen, etc. that needs to be contained. This makes packing a snap, keeps your clothes clean and most of all, helps you find where your clothes are without digging!

, Everyone's dirty laundry goes in it and it makes keeping your dirty clothes separate and contained; the room is small enough! Leave it in the bathroom under the sink. Later on in the week, when they offer the laundry special, you can easily sort the clean clothes back into the compression bags which makes packing and unpacking (when you get home) a breeze.

, You're likely to have tons of things to plug in: cell phones, Game Boy charger, portable DVD player, etc.


A nightlight is essential, especially if you have an interior cabinet and little kids. It gets pitch black in the interior rooms and you cannot see a thing with the lights out. Also, it makes the kids feel better in case they wake up during the night.

, Make your own drinks, and fill it with ice and water and it stays cold during those shore excursions.

, You might be on vacation and want no time constraints, but with kids, it helps you make it to dinner, shows, and classes, but most importantly, when you need to go and pick up the kids!

, If you are super neat, use antibacterial wipes (especially in winter, to wipe down the door handles, phone and bathroom). With current airline restrictions, they might have to go in your checked luggage. Keep them in zip lock bags and you can use those bags on the trip.

, It keeps the kids busy while traveling and while you're dressing for dinner. You can also use it as a CD player.

, Note this only works if both people actually turn them on (batteries help too!). If you forget, some cruise ships have them for rent approx. $50 for a week.

, Things will go wrong, and the only way you'll get through the week is if you all keep smiling!

Take in the beauty of the natural world.",How to Go on an Expedition Cruise," These companies specialize in delivering the sort of stripped-down adventure opportunity you’re after. There are several notable cruise lines to choose from, including Linblad Expeditions, InnerSea Discoveries and Silversea, who specialize in a hybrid luxury and excursion brand of ocean travel. Find a company that offers services near your area and meets your standards for accommodations, activities and other amenities.Cruise packages are priced per person, and will ordinarily run you anywhere from $3,000-5,000.It may be necessary to drive or even fly in order to reach the port from which your cruise line sets sail, so be sure to account for this in your planning and scheduling.;
, Expedition cruises sail all over the world, from the tropical South Pacific to the frozen Arctic to the strange and captivating Galapagos Islands. Decide what faraway locale you’re most interested in seeing. Keep in mind factors like climate, distance between ports and severe weather and sea conditions, as these can all potentially impact the outcome of even a short trip.Expedition cruises are offered to all nine continents and span each of the world’s major oceans.
Time your trip to coincide with natural events that have a limited window, such as the aurora borealis or a sea turtle migration.

, Reserve a room for yourself and everyone who will be accompanying you on the trip. Expedition cruise ships tend to be much smaller and less extravagant than luxury liners, sometimes housing as few as 60 passengers plus crew. Most cabins contain one or two beds and a minimal washroom, and feature a single large lounge area, so pack light.Booking your tickets guarantees you a room aboard the ship, as well as meals in the dining room and activities.
Because of the modest size and limited arrangements of expedition cruise ships, this type of outing may not be the best for large families or people who prefer to travel in large groups.

, If you’re venturing outside of your home country, you will need a passport in order to board. You might also be asked to supply one or two additional forms of identification, along with whatever registration paperwork the cruise line needs to confirm your passage on the ship.Make sure these documents are complete and up-to-date well before you’re scheduled to depart.
Precautionary vaccinations may be recommended or required if you’ll be passing through an area where certain diseases are commonly contracted., Much of what you bring with you will be determined by your destination. In frigid climates like Alaska and Antarctica, you’ll be making use of a heavy insulated jacket and multiple layers, whereas warmer destinations will be more forgiving about the type of clothing and accessories you pack. Keep in mind the length of your voyage so that you’ll be able to stock up on enough supplies to last you however many days or weeks you’ll be at sea.It will also be a good idea to bring along a ski mask and snow goggles if you’re headed somewhere cold, and insect repellent, sunblock and a swimsuit for tropical climates like Mexico or the Amazon.Take a look at the literature included with your ticket to get an idea of how best to prepare for a particular destination.

, During the many landings on your itinerary, you may find yourself boating, wading, rafting, cycling or hiking through rugged terrain in unpredictable weather. A few of your essential items should therefore include several changes of outdoor clothing, a spacious backpack and some comfortable, durable footwear. There will also be moments of rest and relaxation aboard the ship in the lounge, dining room and private quarters, so comfort need not be neglected.Fast-drying and water resistant clothing will be a plus, as you’re likely to encounter precipitation or be forced to make a wet landing or two as you disembark.Make sure expensive, irreplaceable and easily-damaged items are put away safely or left onboard the ship while you’re busy at shore.

, Whether it’s a camera, your smartphone or just a journal and a pen, you’ll want to have some way to create a lasting record of all the exciting things you’ll see and do throughout the course of your adventure. You’ll be able to share the highlights of the trip with friends and family when you return home and look back fondly on the memories you made sailing to the distant corners of the world for years to come.You’ll have many opportunities to take pictures of geological landmarks, wildlife and other breathtaking sights without ever leaving the upper deck.
GoPros and other portable recording devices make great companions for brisk travel., While vacation cruise lines are usually more like floating resorts, housing thousands of passengers who are forced to move in herds from one stop to the next, expedition cruises tend to be much smaller. As a result, you’ll be able to travel in relative peace and enjoy the company of your fellow travelers, who often include many interesting and illustrious types of people. A slower pace and more contained atmosphere will help you better absorb the picturesque beauty of your surroundings.The atmosphere on board an expedition cruise is friendly and casual. There’s no need to worry about conventional types of activities and events that are governed by formal etiquette.Some expedition cruises include some light entertainment and other diversions to keep passengers occupied during their voyage.

, As part of what expedition cruise lines term their “enrichment” initiative, on-dick sightseeing sessions and onshore excursions are led by teams of experienced naturalists. These may include botanists, geologists, cultural anthropologists, historians and other heads of various academic fields whose mission is to provide valuable information and context to curious travelers. You should by all means make use of this wealth of collective knowledge in order to form a stronger connection with the places and cultures you’ll be exploring.Don’t be hesitant to ask questions or interact with the specialists onboard your ship. They’re there to inform and enlighten you by sharing their unique insight.
Photography experts, skilled inland guides and other resources are sometimes available to educate passengers., Things don’t always proceed in a strictly regimented fashion aboard an expedition cruise. The smaller ships are subject to sudden alterations in weather, sailing conditions, and the whims of wildlife and other natural phenomena that can put an occasional kink in your plans. Be prepared to stop unexpectedly from time to time, and to press on when a scheduled opportunity to make port is foiled by constantly unfolding circumstances.Expedition cruises have expedition leaders rather than the usual cruise directors and staff. These individuals are responsible for keeping up with a multitude of critical travel details and use their expertise to plan the most opportune times to stop and make port.
Whereas commercial cruises give you a few hours to walk around, shop and occupy yourself freely at each stop, expedition cruises come with a built-in list of activities to participate in., From the deck of your cruise ship (as well as through spellbinding jaunts on foot), you’ll catch glimpses of shifting glaciers, cascading waterfalls or vibrant labyrinths of coral reef, along with exotic native flora and fauna. Let your mind race with amazement as you savor what for many travelers will be a once-in-a-lifetime experience.The stops on an expedition cruise are longer and much more involved than those of more commercial voyages, which means you’ll have more time to fully immerse yourself in the wonder of what’s happening around you.

As soon as you board the ship, find out where the fitness center is located and make reservations to use the equipment (if necessary).,
Make use of the jogging track.,
Use the tennis court.,
Use the swimming pool.,
Walk around the ship.,
Participate in any fitness classes such as yoga and pilates if these are available and appeal to you.

",How to Exercise on a Cruise Ship," Many cruise ships today offer large exercise rooms with state-of-the-art treadmills, stationary bikes, weight lifts and other fitness equipment and often have a spectacular view of the ocean. Visit the room when it is least crowded (early in the morning, late in the evening, or at on-shore days).;
, They are usually less than a mile long and extend the length of the ship. Jogging here is a great way to start your morning, burn off some extra calories and enjoy a beautiful view from the deck! If possible, jog with a friend or family member (if traveling with others) and share the walk.

, If the ship has a court, play tennis or other racket sports. Most cruise ships also feature a basketball court, or even rock climbing walls and mini-golf. To have some fun with your fitness routine, organize a ball game with some friends or participate in a tournament (if offered).

, Try to do some laps every morning before the day starts.

, Use this as an opportunity to discover the entire ship. Pick different routes every day but make sure to have a map; it is possible to get lost on large cruise ships!

Before you select your cruise, research the places that your ship will stop at and choose the cruise that most appeals to you!,
Don't base your decision on the appeal of the ship alone - make sure you are provided with plenty of opportunity to explore once your ship is docked.

,
When booking your room, remember that you are barely spending anytime in your room; this is not like a hotel.,
Once you've booked your cruise, research the destinations your cruise will be stopping at and find out what activities are available to you to participate in during your docked time.,
While you are on your cruise, be friendly towards your new neighbors.,
Make sure to take care of yourself.,
Although you may have been up late last night enjoying the nightlife on your cruise, try not to sleep in!,
Check out the ship.,
Finally, be sure not to sweat the small stuff, take lots of pictures, and enjoy every moment of your Caribbean cruise!",How to Make the Most of Your Caribbean Cruise,";
,, To save yourself money that you can spend elsewhere while enjoying your vacation, book yourself an interior room. Although this means no balcony or windows, this will encourage you to get out more instead of staying cooped up in your room. If possible, try to get a room in the middle of the ship. The rooms towards the front and the end may cause you to feel more sea sick than the rooms in the middle of the ship.

, You don't want to look back and regret that you didn't go snorkeling in the Virgin Islands, or swimming with dolphins in the Bahamas when you had the chance!

, Chances are you will meet other people that have been on cruises before, and they can provide you with helpful suggestions on where to go and what to do. They might become new friends beyond the vacation!

, Use lots of sun screen, stay hydrated, and be conscious of any foreign foods you are consuming. It is very hard to make the most of your vacation when you are recovering from a severe sunburn, or are sick to your stomach! (You can actually ask your doctor for a patch that you put behind your ear to help with seasickness, if you are prone to that)

, You'll miss half the trip if you spend it in your room sleeping. Wake up and have breakfast at sea, take in the beautiful scenery and watch as your ship docks into the next port. It really is incredible to watch such a large ship pull into their own parking spot! You also don't want to miss out on your day of experiencing wherever your cruise has docked. Remember you only get a few hours to go out and explore... you have to be back to the ship by late afternoon or they'll leave without you!

, Your cruise may have a couple of days when you are cruising at sea.. meaning that you will not stop anywhere that day. Explore the ship, you'll be amazed at what you find! Also, your cruise may provide a daily itinerary, explaining everything that is going on and when it's all happening. Pay attention to these because you may miss out.

Depending on whether you enter early or late, is how this will go. If you enter early, you will be given a number and directed to the seating area. Once they call your number, you will get in line. There will be two lines, a first time cruiser line and one for members who have cruised on the same line before. You will go through the line, have your papers checked, then if everything checks out you will board the ship! And your vacation will begin! However, if you come late and many people have already boarded, you will simply get into line and the same thing will happen from there, but you don't need numbers or a waiting area.;
, You may have a lot of baggage with you, so grab a table a bit larger than your family size.

, Look around and see how nice your temporary home really is. Most ships are quite beautiful.

, It will be much smaller than you may have expected, but for the time you will really spend in your room, it's large enough.

, After this, you will participate in a mandatory lifeboat drill. Some ships require you to grab your life vest, and some don't. If it is required, proceed to your room to get it, then go directly to your muster station. This is on your card, and usually on the back of your door. This will be the spot you must meet in case of an emergency. If you do not need your life jacket, then simply head to your muster station.

, This will involve dancing if you please, a barbecue, and you looking out a window, waving goodbye to your starting destination. Let the party begin!

Think about something that interests, surprises, or confuses you, and consider whether it is something you can reasonably investigate for a project. Formulate a single question that sums up you would like to examine.For instance (in a running example that will carry throughout this section), say you've heard that you can make a simple solar oven out of a pizza box.You may, however, be skeptical as to whether this can be done, or done consistently at least. Therefore, your question might be: ""Can a simple solar oven be made that works consistently in various conditions?""
Make sure the topic you select is manageable within your time frame, budget, and skill level, and that it doesn't break any rules for the assignment / fair / competition (for example, no animal testing). You can search for ideas online if you need help, but don't just copy a project you find there; this will also be against the rules and is unethical.;
, You can do this by reading reference and science books, searching online, or discussing it with knowledgeable people. Knowing your topic in more depth will help you construct your SIP.Be aware of the requirements for your project. Many science fairs require that you have at least three solid, reputable, useful sources to use as references.Your sources will need to be unbiased (not tied to a product for sale, for instance), timely (not an encyclopedia from 1965), and credible (not some anonymous comment on a blog post). Web sources that are supported by a scientific organization or journal are a good bet. Ask your teacher or project director for guidance if you need it.
For instance, the search query ""how to make a solar oven out of a pizza box"" will produce a bounty of sources, some more scientifically-grounded (and thus reliable) than others. The hit on an on-topic article in a recognized, reputable periodical should be considered a valid source.On the other hand, blog posts, anonymous articles, and crowd-sourced materials probably won't make the cut. As valuable a resource as wikiHow is (and there are articles on pizza box solar ovens here), it may not be considered a valid source for your SIP. Choosing well-developed articles with numerous footnotes (that link to solid sources themselves) will improve the odds of acceptance, but discuss the issue with your instructor, fair organizer, etc.

, The hypothesis is your working theory or prediction, based on the question you've asked and your subsequent research. It needs to be accurate and clear, but it doesn't need to be proven correct in order for your SIP to be successful (failed experiments are just as important as successful ones in science).It is often helpful to turn your question into a hypothesis by thinking in ""if / then"" terms. You may want to frame your hypothesis (at least initially) as ""If , then .""
For our example, the hypothesis might be: ""A solar oven made from a pizza box can consistently heat foods any time there is abundant sunshine.""

, After you have formulated your hypothesis, it is time to test whether it is valid or not. The experiment you design should focus exclusively on either confirming or refuting your hypothesis. Remember, it's not important if you're right, it's important how you conduct the process.Consideration of variables is key in setting up your experiment. Scientific experiments have three types of variables: independent (those changed by you); dependent (those that change in response to the independent variable); and controlled (those that remain the same).When planning your experiment, consider the materials that you will need. Make sure they are readily available and affordable, or even better, use materials that are already in your house.
For our pizza box solar oven, the materials are easy to acquire and assemble. The oven, item cooked (s'mores, for instance), and full sunshine will be controlled variables. Other environmental conditions (time or day or time of year, for instance) could be the independent variable; and ""done-ness"" of the item the dependent variable.

, Once your preparation and planning is complete, the time will finally arrive when you can test the validity of your hypothesis.Closely follow the steps that you have planned to test your experiment. However, if your test can not be conducted as planned, reconfigure your steps or try different materials. (If you really want to win the science fair, this will be a big step for you!)
It is common practice for science fairs that you will need to conduct your test at least three times to ensure a scientifically-valid result.For our pizza box oven, then, let's say you decide to test your solar oven by placing it in direct sun on three similar, 90-degree Fahrenheit days in July, at three times each day (10 am, 2 pm, 6 pm).

, Even the most interesting and enlightening test will be useless to your SIP if you do not accurately record and analyze the results.


Sometimes your data may be best recorded as a graph, chart, or just a journal entry. However you record the data, make sure it is easy to review and analyze. Keep accurate records of all your results, even if they don't turn out the way you hoped or planned. This is also part of science!As per the solar oven tests at 10 am, 2 pm, and 6 pm on three sunny days, you will need to utilize your results. By recording the done-ness of your s'mores (by how melted the chocolate and marshmallow is, for instance), you may find that only the 2 pm placement was consistently successful., Now that you have conducted your experiment and either confirmed or refuted your hypothesis, it is time to clearly and accurately state your findings. In essence, you are now answering the question you originally asked.If you started out with a simple, clear, straightforward question, and a similar hypothesis, it should be easier to craft your conclusion.
Remember, concluding that your hypothesis was completely wrong does not make your SIP a failure. If you make clear, scientifically-grounded findings, and present them well, it can and will be a success.
In the pizza box solar oven example, our hypothesis was ""A solar oven made from a pizza box can consistently heat foods any time there is abundant sunshine."" Our conclusion, however, might be: ""A solar oven made from a pizza box can only be consistently successful in heating foods in mid-day sun on a hot day.""

, Whether it is a science class assignment, science fair project, or something else, it is important to be aware of the criteria that will be used to evaluate your SIP.


For a science fair, for example, the judging could be based on the following criteria (adding up to 100%): research paper (50%); oral presentation (30%); display poster (20%)., More than likely, you will be required to write a brief summary of your SIP, known as an abstract. It needs to clearly state your idea, your hypothesis and how you tested it, and the conclusion you reached.


SIP abstracts are often limited to one page in length, and perhaps 250 words. In this short space, focus on the purpose of your experiment, procedures, results, and any possible applications., If the abstract provides the basic information, the research paper provides the substantial details and analysis of your SIP. It is easy to think the experimenting itself or the poster you get to create is more important (perhaps because they are more fun to do), but the research paper is often the most important component in the evaluation of your project.


Use the guidelines provide by your teacher or the science fair director for information on how to construct your research paper.
As one example, your paper may need to be broken down into categories such as: 1) Title Page; 2) Introduction (where you identify your topic and hypothesis); 3) Materials & Methods (where you describe your experiment); 4) Results & Discoveries (where you identify your findings); 5) Conclusion & Recommendations (where you ""answer"" your hypothesis); 6) References (where you list your sources)., The time allotted and detail expected from the oral presentation of your SIP (if required at all) can vary widely. You may need to speak for 5 minutes or 20. Be clear on the requirements beforehand; for instance, whether PowerPoint presentations are expected.Write up your research paper first, and use it as your guide in constructing your oral presentation. Follow a similar framework in outlining your hypothesis, experiments, results, and conclusions.
Focus on clarity and concision. Make sure everyone understands what you did, why you did it, and what you discovered in doing it.

, Most science fairs still require a poster presentation of your project. It will essentially be a visual display of your research paper.Science fairs commonly use a standard size, three panel display board, approximately 36 inches high by 48 inches wide.
You should lay out your poster like the front page of a newspaper, with your title at the top, hypothesis and conclusion front and center, and supporting materials (methods, sources, etc.) clearly placed under headings on either side.
Use images, diagrams, and the like to spruce up the visual appeal of your poster, but don't sacrifice content for visual pizzazz.

Find a large pot with a lid.,
Place a collection container inside the large pot.,
Pour the dirty water into the large pot.,
Place the lid upside-down over the pot.By placing the lid upside-down, the curved angle will help direct the water vapor toward the center as it collects and and falls back into your collection pot.,
Bring the water to a boil.,
Boil the contents until the liquid is almost gone.",How to Distill1," The biggest pot you can get your hands on will allow you to distill larger amounts of liquid. The pot should at least be large enough to hold another smaller container like a metal mixing bowl.


If you have a curved lid that will cover the pot, use that instead of a flat lid. The shape of a curved lid will help in collecting condensation toward the center.
If you can't find a curved lid, you can use some aluminum foil and shape it over a large bowl to get a curved shape. Then you can place the foil, curved side down, over the pot and hold it in place with the lid. This will help to direct the condensed water toward the center and your collection container.;
, Select a container that can withstand boiling temperatures.


You will likely want to elevate the collection container toward the top of the pot. You can place a small rack in the bottom of the pot and prop your container on top of it. You can even use a brick or similar object since it won't be in contact with the distilled liquid.
You can also drill a hole in the lid and use a length of tubing to collect the distilled liquid in a separate container. However, you have to be willing to put holes in your cookware to do so.

, Be sure not to get any of the dirty liquid into the collection container.


You will only want to fill the pot so that the water level is a couple inches below the height of your collection container. If the water is too close to the height of the collection container, it might splash into the container of distilled water and contaminate it.

,


You can also place some ice packs or cool water on top of the lid to help the vapor cool faster and return to a liquid form.

, Turn on the stove and heat the water. Monitor the temperature of the water and keep it at a slow boil. You want to avoid heating the water too much and having the dirty water splashing into your collection pot. Adjust the temperature as needed.

, Do not boil the pot dry or you will risk causing permanent damage to it. Let the distilled liquid cool.


It may take several hours of boiling to collect a significant amount of liquid, so be patient."
"
Pour the liquid into a distilling flask.,
Place the distilling flask over the heat source.,
Connect the condenser.,
Place the collection beaker beneath the condenser.,
Turn on the heat source.,
Collect the distilled liquid.",How to Distill2," Take the liquid you want to purify and pour it into the distilling flask. Only fill the flask between half and two-thirds full, so the liquid does not take too long to evaporate., You can use a stand to hold the flask above the burner or heat source.


You may also want to use a basin filled with sand to rest the distilling flask on instead of directly over the burner. This will prevent the liquid from boiling too violently.

, Attach one end of the condenser to the vent at the top of the distilling flask. The condenser should be angled downward to help the water flow toward the collection flask.The condenser has two tubes, one inside of the other. The condenser will transfer the vapor to the collection container and help to cool it back into a liquid form.

, Place the cup or flask beneath the opening on the end of the condenser. The liquid will drip out as the vapor cools and collect in the cup below.


You can also choose to connect the collection container directly to the condenser if you have the materials to do so.

, Bring the water to a boil.


Monitor the temperature. You may want to use a thermometer to monitor the temperature and keep the water just above the boiling point so it doesn't heat too quickly. Adjust the burner level if needed.

, Turn the heat off once the distilling flask is mostly empty. Do not heat the flask until dry as you could damage the glass. Let the liquid cool in the collection flask.


If you want the collected liquid to cool faster, you can place the collection container in a bath of cold or ice water.

Choose the dates for your cruise vacation - dates in the ""off-season"" will be less expensive than the ""peak season"".,
Decide which cruise line you want to sail on.,
Be wary of advertised specials such as ""Discount Luxury Cruise, $599 per person double."",
Get a cruise quote that includes port fees, taxes and fuel surcharge.,
Keep in mind that, unless you plan on spending a lot of time in your cabin, it's better to get an inside cabin.,
Note that cabin rates are typically based on two person occupancy.,
Remember that cruise/travel insurance is often recommended by an agency when booking your cruise.,
Understand that cruising with a group does not always save you money on your cruise.,
Check out your Sunday paper's travel section for some ideas of what the pricing is like for the different cruise lines.

",How to Get a Discounted Cruise," If you can schedule your time even a few weeks before or after the peak season you'll save substantially. For example, the peak season for Alaska Cruises are during the summer months of June and July. If you can sail before or after those dates you'll save.;
, Do a little homework and check out the amenities on each vessel to make sure it meets your expectations. Large ships have more features for time when you're on-board, but the small cruise ships can get closer to wildlife and the glaciers, and can go to ports where the large ships cannot.

, These advertisements are usually for the smallest interior cabins on off-season sailings, and do not include port fees, taxes, and the fuel surcharge.

, If the agency is unable to give that information to you then find another agency. Your interest should be the bottom line, the total cost with NO Hidden Fees. These costs can run several hundred dollars per passenger, just be aware.

, An inside cabin, without a window, is by far the cheapest. The drawback to an inside cabin is that you'll never know what time of day it is since no ""daylight"" comes into your room. Make sure you have a clock.

, In other words, the first two people in the cabin will pay the full-fare, additional people will pay less.

, Don't purchase cruise insurance from the cruise line; get a separate policy. You'll not only save money but you'll probably have better coverage too. Insurance includes trip cancellation for covered reasons, travel delays, medical expenses and lost or delayed luggage., Some cruise lines offer a small discount (about 5%) for a group; sometimes you can also get extra amenities like on-board credits. But some cruise lines do not provide anything additional for a group.

Choose a title.,
Determine the problem.,
Determine the hypothesis.,
Make a list of materials.,
Explain your procedure.,
Perform the experiment.,
Record the results.,
Discuss the results.,
Accept or reject your hypothesis.,
Include any errors.",How to Do a Lab Write Up," This is the name of the lab or experiment you are doing. The title should be descriptive, yet concise.Some teachers and/or classes require a title page. A title page includes the title of the lab or experiment, the name of the students completing the lab, the name of the instructor for whom the lab is being completed, and the date the experiment was completed.;
, Figure out what you are attempting to solve or test. This is the purpose of the experiment. Why are you doing this experiment? What will be learned from doing this experiment?When you explain the purpose of the experiment, explain what the experiment will be about and what you want to determine.


This step should also introduce the experiment. Include background information relevant to the experiment, important definitions, theoretical and historical background, and general methods that are going to be used.The purpose should be stated in one sentence. It can be stated as a question. Sometimes, the instructor will give you the purpose of the experiment.An example of a purpose statement is: The purpose of this experiment is to determine the boiling points of different substances using three different samples.
An example of a purpose question is: Does red and blue paint mix to make green paint?

, A hypothesis is the theoretical solution to the problem or predicted outcome to the test. Basically, the hypothesis is an educated guess of what you believe will be the outcome of the experiment. This is based on prior knowledge or experiments. You are not making up a solution with no support for it.The hypothesis does not have to be correct. You are creating an experiment to see if it is supported or not supported.


The hypothesis should be stated in a sentence.
Use an ""If this, then that, because of this"" format for writing your hypothesis. Have ""if this"" be what you changed, ""then this"" be your result of the change. ""Because of this"" is why the reaction occurs.
An example of a hypothesis is: If I throw a ball from a fifteenth story balcony, it will make a crack in the sidewalk.

, The next step is to write the materials used in a clear, concise list. Make sure to include all of the materials used. This will allow anyone to repeat your experiment and verify your claims.


Some instructors may let you refer to your textbook if the materials are listed there. This might look like: See page 456 in Chemistry Labs. Ask your instructor before doing this to make sure it is okay.Materials should be listed in a complete sentence. Write them in the sentence in the order that you used them., Write down the exact steps you followed during your experiment and the exact measurements you took. This takes you through a step by step procedure of the lab. Once again, this allows someone to replicate your experiment. Make sure to outline any precautions that should be taken when performing the experiment.


Detail all variables in the experiment. The controlled variables are the ones that don't change throughout the experiment. The independent variable is the one thing you will change during the experiment. It should be outlined in the hypothesis. The dependent variable is the variable that is changed because of your manipulation of the independent variable in the experiment.Some instructors require that the procedure be written in a paragraph form, not as a list and it should be a written description of what you did, not a set of instructions. Be sure to check with your instructor before writing this part of a lab report.The key to this step is clarity. You want to make sure to provide enough detail so that anyone can complete the experiment, and explain the steps in an easy to follow, detailed manner. However, be careful not to over explain or add in irrelevant information.
The procedure and materials list can be combined into one paragraph. Make sure to find out which way your instructor prefers before choosing.

, Using your procedures and materials, perform the experiment. You should complete all of the steps outlined in Part 1 before performing the experiment. Completing part of the lab write up before you do the experiment, such as the materials and procedure, is important because it gives you a clear idea of what will happen during the experiment. Writing out the hypothesis, purpose, and introduction material helps you understand the results of the experiment and not change your hypothesis based on the outcome of the experiment., This section contains the raw data observed during the experiment. You should record your observations in clear, logical manner. Organize data and categorize the data so it is easy to read and understand.


This section includes data tables, graphs, or any notes made during the experiment. The data tables should be labeled clearly, and all units of measurement should be recorded. When using graphs, use X or O instead of dots. Make sure each axis is labeled with a variable.There are two different kinds of data that can be collected. Qualitative data is observable data that does not have a numerical value. These are things you observe with your five senses. Quantitative data is observable data that responds to measurable values. Examples of quantitative results are measurements in centimeters, weight in grams, speed in kilometers, along with density, volume, temperature, and mass., In this section, analyze the experiment. Interpret the results by explaining them, analyzing what they mean, and comparing them.If something unexpected happened, speculate as to why that happened. Hypothesize what might happen if a variable in the experiment was changed., In the conclusion, explain if your hypothesis was correct or incorrect. Use data obtained from the experiment to support why you accept or reject it.Are there multiple conclusions that can be reached from the data? If so, make sure to say that. Explain what the other conclusions are.
An example of a hypothesis rejection is: Our hypothesis was incorrect. The cake did not cook at a higher temperature for a shorter amount of time. The cake was still raw when it was taken out of the oven.

, Make sure to include any errors in your data, or data that is extreme and does not fit with the other data. Discuss reasons why the data might be wrong. State what you could do differently to improve the quality and preciseness of the experiment. Human errors (ex: spilling liquid, not measuring properly) do not count.

Collect your materials.,
Test your compass.,
Place your compass on a flat surface, such as a table.,
Lay your magnet on the table.,
Bring your magnet next to the compass.,
Look at the compass needle.",How to Determine Polarity of Magnets1," You will need only a compass and a magnet. Any type of compass will work, but a disk magnet or bar magnet will be the simplest type of magnets to use for this method.;
, While the end of the compass needle that points North is usually the red end on a typical compass, it’s a good idea to check. If you know where geographical North is from your current location, you can easily note which end of the compass needle points North.


If you are not sure where your geographic North is, you can determine which end of the compass needle is the North end by going outside at noon, when the sun is at the highest point of the sky. Hold the compass flat in your hand with the South end of the compass nearest to your body.Note the position of the compass needle. If you live North of the Earth’s equator, the North end of the needle will be pointing towards you and the South end of the needle will be pointing toward the sun. If you live South of the equator, the South end of the compass needle will be pointing towards you., Be sure that the surface is free of any magnetized or metal materials that could cause a false reading. Even objects like a keychain or pocket knife can interfere with the experiment.You will notice that the North end of the compass needle is pointing to your geographical North.

, If you are using a disk magnet, the North and South poles will be on the two flat surfaces.If you are using a bar magnet, the poles will be on either end., With a disk magnet, you will need to stand the magnet on its side and hold it with your index finger so that one of the flat sides is facing your compass. If you are using a bar magnet, place your magnet perpendicular to the compass, so that one end of the magnet is close to your compass.

, Since the compass needle is a small magnet, the South end will be attracted to the North pole of your magnet.


If the North end of the compass needle is pointing toward your magnet, you have found the South pole of your magnet. Rotate the other side of your magnet toward the compass; the South end of the compass needle will now be pointing directly to the North pole of your magnet."
"
Find a length of string.,
Tie your string securely around your bar magnet.,
Hold the string away from your body.",How to Determine Polarity of Magnets2," You can use any type of string that may be around the house, such as scrap yarn or wrapping ribbon. Your string should be long enough to tie around your magnet and suspend it.


A yard of string should be long enough in most cases. You can estimate yardage by holding the string in both hands. With your right hand, hold the string to your nose. Extend your left arm as far as possible. The length of string between your left hand and your right hand is about a yard.

, Be sure that the string is tied tightly so that the magnet does not slip out of your knot. Note that, if you have a disk or sphere magnet, this method is not appropriate.

, Be sure that the magnet is free to rotate and does not come into contact with any impediments. When it stops spinning, the end that is pointing North is the North pole of the magnet. You have now created a compass!


Note the difference from the compass method, wherein the South end of the compass needle is attracted to the North pole of the magnet. When using a magnet as a compass, the North pole of the magnet will point North because what we call the North pole is more accurate the “North-seeking pole,” which is attracted to the South pole of the earth’s internal magnet."
"
Gather materials.,
Fill a cup, bowl, or small dish with water.,
Prepare your Styrofoam.,
Place your magnet on the Styrofoam and put it in the water.",How to Determine Polarity of Magnets3," This method requires a few basic household objects that you likely have on hand. If you have a small magnet, a piece of Styrofoam, water, and a cup, you can complete a fun experiment that will help you determine the polarity of your magnet., You don’t need to fill your dish all the way, just enough so that your Styrofoam has enough water to float freely.

, The Styrofoam should be small enough to place in your water dish and a large enough to hold your magnet. If you have a large piece of Styrofoam, you can cut it to fit.

, The Styrofoam platform will turn until the North pole of your magnet is pointing North."

Contact information should be listed on your water bill. Other local government agencies will be able to direct you to an appropriate contact if you cannot find this information.;
, The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) mandates that all community water systems must prepare and distribute an annual water quality report for their customers by July 1 of each year.This information will tell you what levels of lead and other contaminants have been detected in the water.

, The EPA’s website has a searchable countrywide map and links to online reports. Be aware that not all reports are available online, however.

, Lead levels should be below the EPA's action level of 15 parts per billion.Anything higher than this means you are at risk of having elevated levels of lead in your drinking water.

, The pipes in your home are not the pipes that are tested in the Consumer Confidence Report. Decide whether you want to administer tests on your own pipes to determine the specific lead levels in your home. Anyone can have their individual pipes tested, even if the Consumer Confidence Report shows that lead levels in your water supply fall below 15 parts per billion.

, Some suppliers will come to your house and perform this test for free. It’s a good idea to try this option before testing the water yourself.

, The EPA is required to provide a Consumer Confidence Report but it’s important to test the water from your own faucets to determine if your specific lead levels vary.

, You can ask a professional from a state-certified lab to test your water if your local water supplier is unable to perform a test for you. To find a state-certified lab:


Call the EPA Safe Drinking Water hotline. The number is 1-800-426-4791 and offers both English and Spanish service.
Go to the EPA's Web site. The Environmental Protection Agency web site offers information on finding a state-certified lab to test your water.Look online or in your local phone book. Search for Water Testing Laboratories. Make sure to find a company that does not offer free water tests in exchange for selling you a water treatment system.

, There are many private companies that offer water-testing services. These companies can test for a variety of contaminants, including lead. Be aware that the cost of hiring a private company can vary.

, A number of municipalities offer their residents a free or low-cost water testing kit. These almost always require you to send a water sample from your home to a laboratory for analysis. Contact your local government to find out if your community has a free water-testing program for homeowners or renters.

, These can be purchased from many home improvement stores or online. Be aware of companies that advertise lead water tests that don’t require you to send the samples to a laboratory. The results from these tests are usually inconclusive.

, Testing your water will require you to flush your plumbing system. The entire process takes 6-18 hours and is best done early in the morning or late in the evening.

, It is important to follow the instructions precisely to ensure you collect the correct sample and do not contaminate it. Kit instructions may vary.

, This is where you will collect your water sample and can be any faucet in your home. Many people choose a faucet that they drink from, because drinking water with high concentrations of lead can cause negative health effects.

, Run the water from the cold water tap of your faucet for 1-2 minutes until the water is cold.

, Do not use any water in your home for the next 6-18 hours. This includes outdoor water. It is important to follow this step to allow any lead particles to collect in your pipes.

, Some water testing kits include a large plastic water bottle. If you do not have one, use a clean jar with a sealable lid. Fill the bottle or jar with water from your faucet.


Put the water bottle under the same faucet that you used to flush your plumbing system.
Slowly turn on the cold water.
Fill the bottle with cold water.
Turn off the water.
Put the lid on the water bottle. Make sure it is screwed on tightly.
Shake the bottle to mix the water sample thoroughly.

, You should have received a small sample bottle in your water testing kit. Fill this small sample bottle with water and screw on its lid. There is no need to shake it.

, Use the packaging supplies you received with your kit or buy packaging supplies at your local post office.


Place the bottle in a bubble-lined bag.
Fill out your household information. Many kits include an information card for you to fill out. Make sure to include the time and date of your sample and where you collected the sample.
Place the bubble-lined bag and information card in an appropriately-sized envelope.
Mail the envelope. Make sure to mail the sample within 7 days of collecting it. Send the samples to a state-certified laboratory or the water supplier where you received your kit.

, Results might take up to six weeks. Make sure to protect yourself from potential lead exposure while you wait.It is a good idea to be cautious when using your water until you have definitive results about the levels of lead.

, Run your faucet for at least 30 seconds before using it to ensure any lead has been flushed from your pipes. This process should be followed for water used in cooking, drinking, and bathing.

, Do not use hot water from your tap for cooking or drinking. Hot water increases the chance of lead being in your water.

, Boiling water does not diminish the levels of lead or protect you from lead exposure. Remember, the presence of lead in water cannot be seen, smelled, or tasted.

, Make sure you buy a filter that reduces lead. Be sure to maintain the filter and replace filter parts in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. Always use cold water when filling up your filter.

, Most faucets have a small piece at the end of it called a faucet aerator. Remove and clean this piece every few months to ensure no lead particles have become trapped in it.

, All pipes made after January 1, 2014 are required to contain no more than 0.25% lead.It is a good idea to replace lead pipes if you can afford it.

Monitor the laboratory's costs.,
Determine which costs are volume dependent and which are volume independent.,
Determine the cost per procedure.,
Determine the revenue or reimbursement per procedure.,
Limit the number of nonproductive tests.,
Discuss proper laboratory utilization with all staff and laboratory technicians.,
Update all laboratory workers on any changes in standard operating procedures.,
Try to run tests together and coordinate procedures whenever possible.,
Order supplies in bulk to save money, if the supplies are unlikely to be outdated.,
Look for ways to run tests or procedures more efficiently.,
Determine which tests to perform in-house and which to send out to a reference laboratory.,
Monitor the effects of any cost-cutting strategies over time.",How to Cut Costs in a Laboratory," Maintain an accurate journal and ledger, logging every expense, such as salaries and benefits paid, supplies, equipment, overhead, services, personal costs, fees, fines. Proper accounting of the laboratory's costs will guide efforts to implement cost-cutting strategies. Cost cutting efforts directed at the bigger cost categories will most likely result in bigger savings.;
, Volume dependent costs are those that are a function of the laboratory's volume. For example, supplies are generally volume dependent, because the higher the work load of the laboratory, the more supplies it will need, hence supply costs will tend to increase with revenue. Volume independent costs, on the other hand, are fixed costs regardless of the laboratory's volume. For example, overhead costs such as rent and utilities tend to be fixed costs.

, This can be calculated by adding up all the costs associated with certain procedure and dividing by the number of procedures, over a specified period of time. Effective cost-cutting strategies should aim to lower the cost per procedure.

, This can be calculated by adding up all the revenue or reimbursement derived from certain procedure and dividing by the number of procedures, over a specified period of time.

, By comparing the cost per procedure versus revenue or reimbursement per procedure for various procedures, it will become apparent which procedures are profitable and which are a drain on the laboratory's resources. The number of unproductive tests and procedures should be limited.

, Ensure that everyone understands when certain tests and procedures are indicated, and that all criteria for specimen submission, handling, processing, and reporting of results are observed. Eliminating unnecessary tests and procedures will save money.

, Discuss these changes during morning reports, staff meetings, and annual training, and post these changes in bulletin boards. Ensuring adherence to all protocols will help reduce unnecessary costs.

, If multiple specimens are sent at the same time for the same test, pool them together will yield the same result as running the test on them separately, but cost will be significantly cut down. Savings in time and resources will cut down costs.

, For supplies that may expire or become obsolete, calculate the inventory turnover (cost of goods sold divided by inventory) and make sure the time to expiration/obsolescence is well below the period of time implied by the turnover.

, For example, if a new machine can run twice the number of specimens in shorter time, it may decrease the cost per procedure and save money. Before deciding on a new equipment that can do things better, however, one must consider the initial cost of the instrument, ongoing reagent costs, cost of training technicians to use the new machine, depreciation costs, etc. and weigh these cost carefully against the cost savings it brings.

, Consider all costs associated with a specific test or procedure, including cost of quality control testing, cost of supplies, cost of proficiency testing and training, clerical time for record keeping, and mailing or transport costs to outside facilities. If a test requiring special technical skills or equipment is rarely requested, it may be cost-saving to have the test sent out rather than performed in-house. On the other hand, frequently performed tests, or those that require quick turn-around time, may be better performed in-house.

, Be patient, as the effects of any such strategies may take months or years to manifest. An effective cost cutting strategy should lower the cost per procedure or the expense ratio of the laboratory.

Decide how you want to travel.,
Decide what part of the Caribbean you would like to visit.,
Schedule your vacation according to the Caribbean seasons and carnivals.,
Look for Caribbean packages to countries that speak your language.",How to Find Cheap Caribbean Vacation Packages1," There are Caribbean vacation packages available through cruise lines and flight and hotel combinations. Airlines, travel aggregate sites, like Expedia, Cruise lines and Caribbean-only websites all offer vacation packages to the Caribbean, but they are separated into cruise and vacation package (air travel) sections.;
, There are usually considered to be 3 different regions to visit in the Caribbean. The prices will usually be higher the farther that you travel away from your home country.


The Western Caribbean is also sometimes called the ""Greater Antilles,"" and it includes Cuba, Jamaica, Haiti, the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico. Outside of the islands, it also includes the Eastern edges of Mexico, Belize, Honduras and Costa Rica that abut the Caribbean Sea.
The Eastern Caribbean region includes ""Lesser Antilles,"" the eastern chain of Caribbean islands that run from Anguilla to Barbados. Other well known Eastern Caribbean islands include the Turks & Caicos islands, Martinique, St. Lucia, Grenada and Trinidad and Tobago.
The Southern Caribbean region is usually regarded as the ""ABC"" islands, Aruba, Bonaire and Curacao. These islands sit just above the top portion of Venezuela, and the continent of South America. These islands are part of the Lesser Antilles, but they are often separated from the Eastern Caribbean islands on cruise and vacation sites.

, In general, the wet season is June through December, and the dry season is January through May. Book your trip outside of peak travel times, in order to get the best deal on vacation packages.


Take note of carnival season in the Caribbean, which is the week-long celebration right before the Catholic observance of Lent. Although the celebration is traditionally in February, some Caribbean islands have also scheduled their carnival to take place in May or June to encourage tourism. These are peak travel times, and hotel and flight prices will be consistently higher.
Take note of hurricane season in the Caribbean, which usually takes place between June 1st and November 30th. You are taking some risk when booking during the hurricane season, so check into the cancellation policies on your travel package. You can often find better deals during hurricane season than you can at other times of the year.
You may find that prices spike during cold weather months in Europe and the United States. Most Caribbean cruises take place during this time.

, In general, France offers better deals to French Caribbean islands, and the UK offers better deals to British islands. Although many of these islands are independent today, there are more flights from these countries to familiar islands.


The French Caribbean islands of Martinique, Guadeloupe and the French half of St. Martin, use the Euro. Vacation packages to these islands from the United States or other North or South American countries are likely to be more expensive than trips to other countries that use the Eastern Caribbean dollar or other currencies. The islands of St. Barts, Anguilla and the Grenadines are considered getaway islands for celebrities, so they are usually more expensive as well.

Understand the relationship between a statute mile and a nautical mile.,
Multiply the knots by 6,076.,
Divide the feet per hour rate by 5,280.",How to Convert Knots to Miles Per Hour1," A statute mile is what Americans commonly use to measure long distances over land. A statute mile is equal to 5,280 feet.A nautical mile is usually used to measure distances that are across open water or space. A nautical mile is equal to 6,076 feet. 

Knots are determined by how many nautical miles are being travelled per hour. 1 knot = 1 nautical mile per hour. ;
, This converts the rate in knots to feet per hour, since there are 6,076 feet in a nautical mile.

For example, if a boat is travelling at 17 knots, to find how many feet per hour, calculate 17×6,076=103,292{\displaystyle 17\times 6,076=103,292}.


, Since there are 5,280 feet in a statute mile, to know how many miles per hour something is traveling, divide the number of feet per hour by 5,280.For example, if a boat is travelling 103,292 feet per hour, to find out how many miles per hour it is travelling, you would calculate 103,2925,280=19.56{\displaystyle {\frac {103,292}{5,280}}=19.56}So, a boat travelling at 17 knots is travelling about 19.56 miles per hour.


"
"
Understand the relationship between knots and miles per hour.,
Set up the conversion formula.,
Plug the number of knots into the formula.",How to Convert Knots to Miles Per Hour2," Both are rates of speed. Something travelling at 1 knot is equal to travelling 1.152 miles per hour., Since 1 knot = 1.152 miles per hour, the formula is 1.152x=y{\displaystyle 1.152x=y}, where x{\displaystyle x} equals the rate in knots, and y{\displaystyle y} equals the rate in miles per hour., Make sure you are substituting for the x{\displaystyle x} value. Multiply to find the number of miles per hour.

For example, if the wind is blowing at 20 knots, you would calculate as follows:1.152(20)=y{\displaystyle 1.152(20)=y}23.04=y{\displaystyle 23.04=y}.So, if the wind blows at 20 knots, it is going about 23 miles per hour. 


"
"
Multiply the miles per hour by 5,280, then divide by 6,076.,
Multiply the miles per hour by 0.869.,
Try this sample problem.",How to Convert Knots to Miles Per Hour3," This converts the rate to feet per hour, since there are 5,280 feet in a statute mile. Dividing by 6,076, the number of feet in a nautical mile, tells you how many knots something is travelling.

For example, a boat might be travelling 20 mph.

Converting to feet per hour: 20×5,280=105,600{\displaystyle 20\times 5,280=105,600}.

Converting to knots: 105,6006,076=17.38{\displaystyle {\frac {105,600}{6,076}}=17.38}.

So, a boat travelling 20 mph is travelling at about 17 knots.


, This is the conversion rate, since there are about 0.869 knots per mile. The product will tell you the rate in knots.For example, the wind might be blowing at 25 miles per hour.

Simply multiply, or use the formula 0.869x=y{\displaystyle 0.869x=y}, where x{\displaystyle x} equals the rate in miles per hour, and y{\displaystyle y} equals the rate in knots.


25(0.869)=21.725{\displaystyle 25(0.869)=21.725}

So, wind blowing at 25 mph is blowing at about 22 knots.


, A red boat is travelling at 15 knots. A blue boat is travelling at 17 miles per hour. Which boat is travelling faster?

To convert how fast the blue boat is travelling in mph to knots, multiply by the number of miles per hour by 0.869:0.869(17)=14.77knots{\displaystyle 0.869(17)=14.77\;{\text{knots}}}

The red boat is travelling at 15 knots; the blue boat is travelling a little less than 15 knots. So the red boat is travelling faster.

At the student level, you will either be assigned a topic during a course or choose a lab that performs research that interests you.Choose a subject that excites you or that you find yourself drawn to.
Scientific research isn’t limited to just subjects like biology, chemistry, and physics. As long as you follow the scientific method to perform your study you are doing research.;
, The research question will be the main focus of your study. Once you have a chosen a topic that interests you, investigate some of the unanswered questions within that field. The research question should be based in a field that you have some familiarity with. You can have more than one research question for a scientific study.Do a brief literature search to familiarize yourself with what information is already out there and what unanswered questions there are.Make sure you have the necessary resources available to you (funding and laboratory equipment) to work on the question.
Talk to professors or other researchers and have them help you identify a question that you could work on.
Many articles will state some of the unanswered questions and speculate on future directions or suggest experiments that will be necessary in the future. Use these as a springboard for your own ideas., You may have done a brief literature search to help you develop a research question, but now you must really do your homework. Find and read articles in the field related to the problem you’ve identified. Read the current literature as well as some of the seminal papers that established the field.It is impossible to read every paper, but when performing research, you want to be an expert on the topic. You also don’t want to repeat experiments that have already been done.
The literature search will help you design the experiments and determine the proper experimental conditions to use.
Take detailed notes as you read through the literature. You will likely be writing a paper on this information after your study is complete and this information will be the basis of your introduction.

, A good research question is clear, specific, refers directly to the problem, and identifies a target group of participants.After reading the literature more thoroughly, you will likely need to revise your research question to encompass all that you have read.


Using your new knowledge, make your research question or questions more specific.

, The research plan is the roadmap for your studies. When working on a research plan, keep in mind that the final objective is usually publication. Design your experiments with this in mind.Ask yourself the following questions:


Who or what is the study population? Do you need ethical approvals to work with the necessary subjects?
How will each experiment contribute to the answer to the question you’re asking?
How is the data collected? How do you define success in a study?
If an experiment will not produce data that you would include in a paper, is it necessary to the understanding of the problem?
What type of statistics will you use to analyze the data?

, In order for your experiment to be meaningful, you need to have an experimental sample size large enough to perform statistical analyses on. In order to determine this, you need to know some information about your experimental population and use a power analysis calculator.


To use a power analysis, you need to have an estimate of the effect size, an estimation of the variability within the data (standard deviation), the level of significance (standard convention is p=0.05), and power (the rate of false negatives you are willing to accept, generally set at 80%).Running smaller pilot studies can help you gather the necessary information for a proper power analysis to calculate sample size.
If you don’t have the means to do a pilot study, use some rough estimations based on information you have gathered from the literature.

, When designing the experiment you need to know all of the solutions you will need to use and the type of equipment you will need access to. Many universities have core facilities with instruments you can use if your specific lab does not have all of the equipment necessary.


You may need to be trained on the equipment and develop the proper expertise before you can start your experiments. Keep this in mind when planning a timeline.
If you don’t have access to the necessary equipment, you might consider working with collaborators who have the equipment and expertise., The key to a well-designed experiment is to have a manageable number of testable conditions.If you are doing a drug study, you probably want to test different dosages, but you don’t want too many. You will likely have to do a few smaller experiments to optimize the test conditions you will use in the final experiments.


Literature searches can help you identify time points, dosages, and treatment conditions relevant to your studies.

, Experimental data is useless without the proper control conditions to compare them to. A control is a condition that is kept constant and used to measure the change of the experimental condition.A proper experiment has only one variable and multiple controls to ensure that any changes seen in the results are due specifically to the variable that was changed.
To test different variables, you will need to perform multiple experiments.

, In research you must identify and define what the outcome is for your study.You also want to define what you consider “success” of an experiment. If you are studying a biological process, the outcome may be the measure of the amount of a specific protein produced.


The outcomes must be measurable with consistency or they will not produce usable data.
All statistical analyses to be used for the study should be established before data collection.

, After completing the overall design of the experiment, write up a detailed protocol that includes every condition to be tested and all the necessary calculations. Performing the experiment is much simpler when you have done all of planning before you begin.


The more detailed you make the protocol, the easier it will be to follow and repeat the experiment later.

, In order to complete your studies in a reasonable amount of time, it’s helpful to draw up a loose schedule of when you will do each experiment.Keep in mind that many experiments will not work the first time and you will have to repeat them to make sure the data is consistent.


Use a weekly or monthly calendar to schedule experiments, including time for analysis and interpretation of results.
As you continue through experiments, some conditions may change or perhaps you will end up going in a different direction. This is normal, just be flexible with your schedule.

, During the design phase, you will have written up a detailed protocol that should include all of the solutions and components needed to perform the experiment. Using this write-up gather everything you will need. Make sure to sign up to use shared equipment in advance so it will be available to you when you need it.


Do as much of the small stuff as possible the day before such as labeling tubes and making solutions.

, The day of the experiment, use your detailed protocol and follow the instructions closely. If you deviate from the written protocol at all, make sure to note what you did that was different. Keeping a lab notebook with all of your experiments and results is essential to conducting research.The first time you do an experiment, it is extremely likely that you will make mistakes or things will go wrong. This is totally normal. Take notes and learn from your mistakes for the next experiment.
Record your results in your laboratory notebook.

, If the data you obtained from an experiment indicates that the experiment itself didn’t work, you will need to troubleshoot it and figure out what went wrong.There are a number of factors that can contribute to an experiment failing:


If you were using a special kit from a company, contact them or seek out their troubleshooting information.
Make sure all of the reagents used were not past their use-by date.
Check to make sure all of your instruments were working properly that day.
Double check all of your calculations and make sure the proper amounts of everything were used.

, After collecting all of the data, you can analyze it and start drafting a manuscript for publication.


Use all of the same reagents and instruments whenever possible to limit variability between experiments.

, For most experiments you will be given a raw data output of numbers. Depending on the study, you will transfer these numbers into another program to make graphs and compare the various groups. It’s important to pay close attention to the data when moving it between programs.


Take care to avoid copying and pasting rows or columns of data incorrectly.

, During the experimental design phase, you should have decided on the statistical tests and analyses you would perform on the data.Once finished with data collection, run these tests to determine significance within your datasets.


Indicate significance where applicable on all of your figures and state the exact statistical values within the text of the manuscript.
Use programs such as Graphpad Prism, R, and SAS for the analysis.

, There are many programs used in the scientific community to generate figures that would be fit for publication, but even simple programs such as Excel can be used. Figures should be clear and concise. Make sure all font sizes used are clearly legible in both size and style.


Organize panels so that similar data is grouped together.Avoid using color within the figures as there are generally expensive fees associated with color figures., When you have all of your results gathered together and in figure form, you can start writing the manuscript. Begin with the material and methods section as this is the easiest. Describe the data in the results section and then talk about the conclusions you draw from them in the discussion. Finish with the introduction, abstract, and title.Determine the journal you want to submit for publication before writing so you can follow their style guide.

, Follow the submission guidelines and the style guide specific to the journal you submit the manuscript to.They will contact you within a few weeks with comments about the paper. It may be sent back without review or it will be sent to other scientists for reading and comments.After the paper is reviewed by other knowledgeable professionals in the field, it will come back with comments that you will need to address.
If the paper does not get submitted for review, you will need to submit it to a different journal. This may require revisions to adhere to the new journals style requirements.

, When you get the manuscript back from peer-review you will have to revise the paper according to the comments.You may need to perform many more experiments or you may simply need to provide a few more details or do some small easy experiments.


To address the comments, revise the manuscript and write a cover letter rebuttal stating how each comment was taken into account in the revised paper., After final revisions, resubmit the paper to the journal for another review. Usually, this is the final step and the paper will be published; however, it is possible that you may need to do another round of revisions.


Once your manuscript is accepted, you will be sent proofs to review and then it will be ready for publication!"

Gather the necessary materials.,
Make the homemade dough.,
Separate the dough into six balls of varying sizes and dye.,
Wrap the orange dough around the red ball.,
Wrap the yellow layer around the sphere.,
Flatten and wrap the brown layer next.,
Wrap the Earth in the “ocean” and continents.,
Slice the ball in half using the floss.,
Label each layer.,
Include interesting facts about each layer.",How to Create a School Project on the Layers of the Earth1," To make a three-dimensional model, you will need to purchase sculpting clay or make your own homemade play dough. Whichever version you choose, you will need six colors: yellow, orange, red, brown, green, and blue. Parental supervision is recommended if making the dough yourself. To make your own play dough you will need:2 cups flour
1 cup coarse sea salt
4 tsp cream of tartar
2 tbsp vegetable oil
2 cups water
Cooking pot
Wooden spoon
Food coloring: yellow, orange, red, brown, green, and blue
Floss or thin string;
, If you have purchased sculpting clay or play dough then you can skip this step. Stir to combine all ingredients (flour, salt, cream of tartar, oil, and water) until there are no lumps. Add the mixture into the cook pot and heat on low, stirring constantly. As the dough heats it will thicken. Once the dough starts to pull away from the sides of the pot, remove it from the heat and let it cool to room temperature.When cool, knead the dough for 1-2 minutes.
Parental supervision is recommended for this step.
The coarse salt crystals will still be visible within the dough. This is normal.

, Start by making two small balls about the size of a golf ball. Make two medium sized balls and then two larger balls. Add a few drops of food coloring to each ball according to the list below. Knead the dough until the color is fully incorporated.Two golf ball sizes: one green, one red.
Medium sizes: one orange, one brown.
Large sizes: one yellow, one blue.

, You will build the layers of the Earth from the inside out. The red ball represents the inner core. The orange dough will be the outer core. Flatten the orange ball slightly so that you can wrap it fully around the red ball.


You want the entire model to remain relatively spherical to resemble the shape of the Earth.

, The next layer to add is the mantle which will be represented by the yellow dough. The mantle is the largest layer of the Earth so you want to make sure that you have a nice thick layer of yellow around the dough ball you have made so far.Roll out the dough to a good thickness and then wrap it around the ball, joining all of the sides together into one layer.

, The brown dough will be used to represent the crust. This is by far the thinnest layer of the Earth. Roll out the brown dough until is quite thin and then wrap it around the dough ball as you did with the previous layers.

, Using the blue dough, wrap a thin layer around the globe. This will be the final layer added to the model. The ocean and continents are all technically part of the crust layer so they don’t count as their own individual layer.Finally, shape pieces of the green dough into approximations of the continents. Press them into the ocean approximately where they belong on the globe.

, Place the ball on a table and then position the floss along the center line of the sphere. Imagine where the equator would be and place the floss there. Push the floss through the dough to cut the ball in half.The two halves should show you a clear cross-section of the layers of the Earth.

, Make small labels for each layer by wrapping some paper around a toothpick. Tape the paper in place. Make four labels: Crust, Mantle, Outer Core, and Inner Core. Stick the toothpicks into the corresponding layer.


Because you have two halves of the Earth, you can use one half with the layers labeled and exposed and present the other half with the ocean and continents face up, as a “view from the top”.

, Look up facts about the composition and thickness of each layer. Include information about the density and temperatures present. Write up a small report or infographic to include with your 3D model to explain the different layers of the Earth.


The crust is interesting because there are two types of crust: oceanic and continental. This is easily seen by looking at the model and seeing that the crust contains both the oceans and the continents.The mantle takes up about 84% of the Earth’s volume. The mantle is mostly solid, but acts like a viscous fluid. Movement within the mantle is responsible for the motion of tectonic plates.The outer core is liquid and is estimated to be 80% iron. It spins faster than the rotation of the planet and is thought to contribute to the magnetic field of the Earth.
The inner core is also composed mostly of iron and nickel with potential heavier elements such as gold, platinum, and silver present. Because of the massively high pressure the inner core experiences, it is solid.

Label all of the layers.",How to Create a School Project on the Layers of the Earth2," Making a paper model is similar to making the clay model, except your layers will be made using different sized circles of construction paper. To make this model you will need four pieces of different colored (brown, orange, blue, and white) construction paper, a geometric compass or circle stencils of four different sizes, a glue stuck, scissors, and a large poster board.


The finished size of your paper model depends on how large you want to make it.
Using a compass to draw the circles is an easy way to make perfect circles and easily vary the sizes.
If you don’t have a compass, you can find four circular shapes to use as stencils for each layer of the Earth.
Use textured paper to make your model stand out.

, Draw four circles of varying sizes on the different colored construction paper. Make the inner core white, the outer core blue, the mantle orange, and the crust brown. Use the compass or your circular stencils to make shapes according to the following dimensions:


Inner core: diameter of 2 inches
Outer core: diameter of 4 inches
Mantle: diameter of 8 inches
Crust: diameter of 8.5 inches
These dimensions are just suggestions, you can make the circles any size you would like as long as you make the mantle the largest layer and the crust the thinnest layer., Once you have drawn the circles, take a pair of scissors and carefully cut each circle out. Try to cut as close to the drawn line as possible to make sure each layer is circular. Stack the layers from smallest to largest so you can clearly see the various layers on top of each other.


Place the brown crust down first, then place the orange mantle on top of that, then the blue outer core, then the white inner core.
Use the glue stick to glue each layer down.

, Glue the four-layer Earth model to a larger poster board. Make four labels and glue them down next to the appropriate layer: Crust, Mantle, Outer Core, Inner Core.Include interesting facts about each layer. Add information about the composition of the layer, the average temperatures, and any special features that each layer has.


Try to relate your interesting facts to discussions that you may have had during class.

Gather the necessary materials.,
Draw a circle around the horizontal and vertical centers of the foam ball.,
Cut a quarter out of the ball.,
Paint the outside of the ball with the continents and ocean.,
Draw the layers of the Earth.,
Label each layer with a toothpick.",How to Create a School Project on the Layers of the Earth3," This model uses a foam sphere to represent the Earth with a quarter of it cut out so that you can see the inside layers of the “Earth”. To make this, you will need a large Styrofoam ball (diameter ~5-7 inches), a pencil, a ruler, a long serrated knife, acrylic paint (green, blue, yellow, red, orange, and brown), a paintbrush, four toothpicks, tape, and small strips of paper. Parental supervision/help is recommended when cutting a slice out of the ball.All of these supplies should be easily found around the house or purchased at a craft supply store.

, You want to cut out approximately a quarter of the foam ball. To do this, you need to draw a circle around the horizontal and vertical halves of the ball. It doesn’t have to be exactly the center, but try to get close.Hold a ruler to the point that is about the center
Hold the pencil in place above the ruler.
Have a friend rotate the ball horizontally while you hold the pencil and watch the line form around the center.
When the ball is back to the starting point, rotate the ball vertically.
When you’re finished, you should have two pencil lines that dive the ball into quarters.

, With the two lines around the foam ball, it should be divided into quarters. You are going to cut one of those quarters out with the knife. Parental supervision is strongly recommended for this step.Position the foam ball so that one of the lines is facing straight up.
Place the knife on the line and gently saw back and forth until you reach the center of the ball (the horizontal line).
Reposition the ball so that the horizontal line is now facing up.
Gently saw again until you reach the center of the ball.
Wiggle the quarter until it comes free from the ball.

, You’ll want to start the model by painting the outside of it like the globe. Sketch the continents in pencil and then paint them green. Paint around the continents with blue to represent the ocean.You can throw away the quarter that was cut out of the ball.
Let the globe dry before painting the inside.

, With the pencil, sketch the layers inside the quarter that was cut out. The inner core is going to be a small circle in the very center of the ball. The outer core is next and should have a width about one-quarter of the inside. The next layer is the mantle which will take almost all of the remaining space. The crust will be a very thin line painted just around the edges.Once each line has been sketched, color them in with the various paints.
Use yellow for the inner core, orange for the outer core, red for the mantle, and brown for the crust.

, Make a small paper tag and wrap it around a toothpick. Tape it in place. Label each piece of paper with the corresponding layer. Stick the toothpick into the foam ball so that everything is properly labeled.


Alternatively, you can write the labels directly on the ball.

Data should usually be normally distributed revolving around a mean (average).,
Find the mean of each subgroup.,
Find the mean of all of the means from the previous step (X).,
Calculate the standard deviation (S) of the data points (see tips).

,
Calculate the upper and lower control limits (UCL, LCL) using the following formula:


UCL = CL + 3*S






LCL = CL – 3*S






The formula represents 3 standard deviations above and 3 standard deviations below the mean respectively.







,
Refer to the below chart with steps 7 through 10.

Evaluate the graph to see if the process is out-of-control.,State whether the system is in-control or out-of-control.",How to Create a Control Chart,"

In the example below, a bottle company fills their bottles to 16 oz. (mean); they are evaluating if their process is “in-control”. The amount in ounces over 16 oz. is normally distributed around the mean.


Measurements need to be independent of one another.

In the example, the measurements are in subgroups. The data in the subgroups should be independent of the measurement number; each data point will have a subgroup and a measurement number.

;
,


To find the mean, add all measurements in the subgroup and divide by the number of measurements in the subgroup.

In the example, there are 20 subgroups and in each subgroup there are 4 measurements.



,


This will give you the overall mean of all the data points.
The overall mean will be the centerline in the graph (CL), which is 13.75 for our example.

,,,,


In the above example, there is a line drawn at one, two, and three standard deviations (sigma’s) away from the mean.

Zone C is 1 sigma away from the mean (green).
Zone B is 2 sigma away from the mean (yellow).

Twist one end of the foil tightly around a match and leave the other end rolled loosely., Stick the matchstick of the tightly rolled match into a piece of cardboard. This will hold that match in place. Being anchored in the cardboard also allows you to aim the match and launch in whatever direction you choose., Use a candle or lighter to heat the foil. Put the flame directly under the area of foil that conceals the match heads. When the matches get hot enough, they will ignite. This will send the loose match shooting out of the aluminum holder.When the match heads ignite, gas is rapidly formed and this expanding gas forces the loose match out of the aluminum holder with a considerable amount of force.

You will use three pencils to make a stand. You will also need a cork, water, and a bicycle pump to pressurize the bottle.

, Reduce the drag of the water bottle by taping a paper cone to the top of the rocket (the bottom of the bottle). Tape paper or cardboard triangles on either side of the bottle to act as fins. The triangles should come about halfway up the bottle., Tape pencils around the sides of the bottle to make a stand. Make sure that the pencils are pointing down. This stand will allow you to point your rocket up (or at an angle if you wish). Without a stand, your rocket will likely just flail around near the ground instead of lifting off., You should fill the bottle half full of water. The water will provide the mass needed to propel the rocket during the launch. You can add food coloring for a colorful blast off., Throw away the bottle’s original cap and replace it with a cork that fits into the opening of the bottle. The cork will allow pressure to build inside the bottle. The cork will also pop out allowing the contents to shoot out rapidly and propel the bottle., Use a bicycle pump with a needle. Insert the needle into the bottle through the cork and pump. Once enough air has been pumped into the bottle, the pressure will force the cork out and launch the rocket into the air."

Carbon dioxide will be produced in this reaction, which will cause pressure to build inside the bottle., Drop the baking soda packet into the vinegar. From this point forward, you will need to move quickly. The tissue will unravel quickly. The reaction will start as soon as the baking soda comes in contact with the vinegar., Quickly place the cork in the opening of the bottle. This will prevent gasses from leaving the bottle and cause pressure to build. With the cork in, set the bottle upside down on the pencils., As the tissue unravels and the baking soda and vinegar react, more and more gas will build inside the bottle. This will force the cork out from the bottom of the rocket. That force will propel the rocket off of the ground and into the air."

Consider surgery.",How to Detect Symptoms of Avascular Necrosis," As the bone or joint is breaking down, it will manifest as sharp pains that are often described as stabbing, shooting, tearing or piercing. If you have AVN in your hip, this pain will be more focused in the groin, thigh and buttocks.


It is easy to detect the symptoms of having AVN as it has only one: pain. Unfortunately, AVN is painless at first, so if you experience pain, it means that AVN is getting worse.
Pain is only felt in the area where AVN is present. The most common areas affected are joints in the hip, shoulder, knee, hand and foot, with the hip being most common of all.;
, And as the condition progresses or gets worse, pain may occur even if you are lying down or resting. With pressure on the bone or joint, you may also experience stiffness and muscle spasms.


Severe pain is described as such when it interferes or limits your joint function or activity. This, unfortunately, means this joint is already collapsing or breaking down.

, The progression of AVN may take months to a year.The pain may intensify from mild to severe if it is left untreated. There is no way to determine how often the pain will occur. The only thing you can expect is more pain more often if you continue to do things involving the damaged area.


Stiffness and muscle spasms, too, will likely occur more often as the muscles from the damaged area lose support from the bones. The veins in the muscles, for the record, are highly affected as well because of decreased blood flow., AVN can happen to anyone, but it is most common in men between the ages of 30 and 60. Recognizing how these factors come into play in your life can help you determine the likelihood of AVN affecting you. Here are the common risk factors that can lead to this condition:



Alcohol drinking. Too much alcohol in the body can develop fat in the passage way of blood. This fat interrupts or blocks blood flow, including in the bones, which is the number one cause of avascular necrosis.Corticosteroid use. Long-term use of this drug can increase the risk of having avascular necrosis. It is said that steroids interfere with the body’s ability to break down fats which blocks or narrows the passage way of blood in the bones causing blocked blood flow in the bones.

Other medical conditions. There are medical conditions that increase the risk of having AVN. Usually these medical conditions have indirect factors, but it is again associated with the use of corticosteroids. These medical conditions are HIV, lupus, diabetes, sickle cell anemia, Gaucher's disease, blood clots and artery damage.

Medical procedures. There are medical procedures that can contribute to have the risk of having AVN. Radiation for cancer patients, Dialysis and Organ transplant specifically Kidney transplant are examples of this procedures. These medical procedures involve use of Corticosteroids in the onset of the procedures. Remember, Corticosteroid use is a major risk factor of having AVN.

, Pain occurs at rest if the condition is left without management, causing more and more bone destruction. Thus, take action as soon as possible to prevent the progression of this disease. Even if AVN isn't the culprit, it's still wise to talk to your doctor. Arthritis and osteoporosis, to name two similar, common examples, are also conditions that deserve treatment.


Often mild symptoms – pain that is simply an achy discomfort – are ignored and simply dealt with. Unfortunately, AVN isn't something that will go away on its own and requires treatment as soon as possible.
Stiffness and restriction of joint movement (if there is a joint affected) happen due to a lack of nutrition to parts of the joint surface, which results in osteoarthritis. What starts out as AVN can progress to more complicated issues – yet another reason to consult your doctor.

, Avascular necrosis (or AVN) is a disease involving the loss of blood supply in the bones that causes death of bone tissues. This leads to breaks in the bone and if left untreated, bones will collapse. AVN is also known as osteonecrosis, aseptic necrosis and ischemic bone necrosis.X-rays can help but usually show changes only in the late stages. Bone scan and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) are also procedures that help to diagnose AVN.

, You can decrease pain and inflammation by using ice packs on the affected bone and/or joint. Take an ice pack, wrap it in a cloth or resealable plastic bag, and keep it on the area for 15-20 minutes. Do this every 2 to 3 hours. Any longer and you may numb the area and risk tissue damage.


Massaging the surrounding muscles may help in relieving pain, too. With your ice pack on the area, take your other hand and gently rub the surrounding tissues to keep blood flowing.

, The aim of exercise in the treatment of AVN is to prevent joint stiffness, relieve pain, and promote healing. It increases blood supply to the affected area, which helps the joint or bone receive nutrients. This aids in the healing process, too. Talk your doctor or physical therapist about what exercises are appropriate for your condition.


Although it is hard to do physical activities if you have AVN, there are proper exercises for the disease that can be done with the help of a therapist. Each case of AVN is slightly different and requires slightly different exercises to improve. These strengthening exercises should be determined by a doctor.
Exercise the joint in all directions to increase your range of movement. This increase in nutrients to all joint surfaces prevents osteoarthritis, which also limits joint movement.
Of course, weight bearing exercises are not recommended as they can worsen the situation. Exercises should include stretching, brisk walking, and toning exercises., AVN causes undue stress in your bones. Rest is needed so that your bones can relax, preventing an increase in bone damage. Restrict work and activities that require pressure, movement and weight on the affected joints.


This is important whether or not your are getting medical treatment. In the case of hip or knee AVN, using crutches can support or assist your movement so you can still move around – but healthily.
The balance between exercise and rest needs to delicately maintained. Safe exercises need to be performed to keep blood flowing in the damaged area; it's unsafe movement, like lifting heavy objects for example, that needs to be avoided.

, When you can, stay off the joint. Use crutches or a walking aid, like a cane, if the affected area is your hip or ankle. Talk to your doctor to determine the appropriate amount of time to use an aid. You will have to exercise the area some to keep it flexible.


Decreasing the weight the bone/joint has to bear can delay or prevent surgery entirely when done early enough in the progression of the disease. Staying off it appropriately can quicken the natural healing of the joint.

, These drugs relieve pain and inflammation. Many are available over-the-counter. However, they only treat the symptoms of AVN and not the root of the issue. Here are some common examples:



Ibuprofen. 200 to 400mg should be taken every 4 to 6 hours

Naproxen. 200 to 220mg taken twice per day

Ketoprofen. 12.5mg taken every 4 to 6 hours

Aspirin. 325mg taken every 3 hours or 500mg every 6 hours

, Blocks in the passage way of the blood in the bones can form blood clots. Blood thinners such as warfarin can prevent clots in vessels to aid in the supply of blood in your bone. The recommended dosage of warfarin is usually 2-5mg daily.Cholesterol drugs work similarly to blood thinners, reducing the amount of fat in the blood. As fats are the one causing the blockage of blood flow in the bones resulting in AVN, these drugs can really be a great help. A common example is rosuvastatin, usually recommended at 5mg daily.

, Bones that are injured or broken can cure themselves on their own time. This is why a child with a broken arm, for example, isn't a huge concern. But if bone damage is associated with AVN, the progress of bone damage is so fast that bones fail to repair on their own. Osteoporosis drugs can help your bones repair themselves more quickly, slowing the effects of AVN.Bisphosphonates drugs, the major class of osteoporosis drugs, like alendronate, are usually taken at 5- 10mg daily.

, Avoid alcohol to decrease the risk of future avascular necrosis and/or to improve your prognosis if AVN is currently taking toll on one of your bones and/or joints.


Avoid steroids if possible, too. Some diseases need steroid treatment at high doses. If you're currently treating another illness with steroids, talk to your doctor to find an alternate medical route to take.
Any treatment you undergo may not be affective if you are still taking steroids or drinking alcohol., If bones collapse entirely or are broken down already, surgery or entire replacement of the joint is recommended. It will be replaced with a metal or plastic bone/joint.There are three surgeries to consider:Core decompression. These involve removing the inner layer of the bone. The space created stimulates production of new bone tissues and blood vessels. It reduces pain as well.

Bone transplant. A part of a healthy bone called a graft is taken from a different part of your body that is connected to the area affected by AVN. This strengthens the damaged area and allows new cells to grow.

Bone reshaping. This is also called osteotomy. This procedure removes a part of the weight bearing joint, whether above or below, shifting the weight from a different part near the damaged area. This delays joint replacement.

Individual molecules may strike one another and bounce off like billiard balls without being deformed in any way.The pressures of ideal gases increase as they are squeezed into smaller spaces and decrease as they expand into larger areas. This relationship is called Boyle’s Law, after Robert Boyle. It is written mathematically as k = P x V or, more simply, k = PV, where k represents the constant relationship, P represents pressure and V represents volume.Pressures may be given using one of several possible units. One is the pascal (Pa), defined as a force of one newton applied over a square meter. Another is the atmosphere (atm), defined as the pressure of Earth’s atmosphere at sea level. A pressure of 1 atm is equal to 101,325 Pa.The temperatures of ideal gases increase as their volumes increase and decrease as their volumes decrease. This relationship is called Charles’ Law after Jacques Charles. It is written mathematically as k = V / T, where k represents the constant relationship between the volume and temperature, V again represents the volume, and T represents temperature. Temperatures for gases in this equation are given in degrees Kelvin, which are found by adding 273 to the number of degrees Celsius in the gas’ temperature.
These two relationships can be combined into a single equation: k = PV / T, which can also be written as PV = kT.;
, Gases have both mass and volume. Volume is usually measured in liters (l), but there are two kinds of mass.


Conventional mass is measured in grams or, if there is a sufficiently large mass, kilograms.
Because of how lightweight gases usually are, they are also measured with another form of mass called molecular mass or molar mass. Molar mass is defined as the sum of the atomic weights of each atom in the compound the gas is composed of, with each atom compared against the value of 12 for carbon.Because atoms and molecules are too small to work with, quantities of gases are defined in moles. The number of moles present in a given gas can be found by dividing the mass by the molar mass and can be represented by the letter n.
We can replace the arbitrary k constant in the gas equation with the product of n, the number of moles (mol), and a new constant R. The equation can now be written nR = PV/T or PV = nRT.The value of R depends on the units used to measure the gases’ pressures, volumes, and temperatures. For volume in liters, temperature in degrees Kelvin, and pressure in atmospheres, its value is 0.0821 L atm/K mol. This may also be written 0.0821 L atm K-1 mol -1 to avoid using the division slash with units of measure., Developed by chemist and physicist John Dalton, who first advanced the concept of chemical elements being made up of atoms,Dalton’s Law states that the total pressure of a gas mixture is the sum of the pressures of each of the gases in the mixture.


Dalton’s Law can be written in equation form as Ptotal = P1 + P2 + P3 … with as many addends after the equal sign as there are gases in the mixture.
The Dalton’s Law equation can be expanded on when working with gases whose individual partial pressures are unknown, but for which we do know their volumes and temperatures. A gas’ partial pressure is the same pressure as if the same quantity of that gas were the only gas in the container.For each of the partial pressures, we can rewrite the ideal gas equation so that instead of the form PV = nRT, we can have only P on the left side of the equal sign. To do this, we divide both sides by V: PV/V = nRT/V. The two V’s on the left side cancel out, leaving P = nRT/V.
We can then substitute for each subscripted P on the right side of the partial pressures equation: Ptotal =(nRT/V) 1 + (nRT/V) 2 + (nRT/V) 3 …

, For the purposes of this calculation, we’ll assume a 2-liter flask holds 3 gases: nitrogen (N2), oxygen (O2), and carbon dioxide (CO2). There are 10g of each gas, and the temperature of each gas in the flask is 37 degrees C (98.6 degrees F). We need to find the partial pressure for each gas, and the total pressure the gas mixture exerts in the container.


Our partial pressure equation becomes Ptotal = Pnitrogen + Poxygen + Pcarbon dioxide.
Since we’re trying to find the pressure each gas exerts, we know the volume and temperature, and we can find how many moles of each gas is present based on the mass, we can rewrite this equation as : Ptotal =(nRT/V) nitrogen + (nRT/V) oxygen + (nRT/V) carbon dioxide


, The Celsius temperature is 37 degrees, so we add 273 to 37 to get 310 degrees K.

, The number of moles of a gas is the mass of that gas divided by its molar mass,which we said was the sum of the atomic weights of each atom in the compound.


For our first gas, nitrogen (N2), each atom has an atomic weight of 14. Because the nitrogen is diatomic (forms two-atom molecules), we have to multiply 14 by 2 to find that the nitrogen in our sample has a molar mass of 28. We then divide the mass in grams, 10 g, by 28, to get the number of moles, which we’ll approximate as 0.4 mol of nitrogen.
For our second gas, oxygen (O2), each atom has an atomic weight of 16. Oxygen is also diatomic, so we multiply 16 by 2 to find the oxygen in our sample has a molar mass of 32. Dividing 10 g by 32 gives us approximately 0.3 mol of oxygen in our sample.
Our third gas, carbon dioxide (CO2), has 3 atoms: one of carbon, with an atomic weight of 12; and two of oxygen, each with an atomic weight of 16. We add the three weights: 12 + 16 + 16 = 44 as the molar mass. Dividing 10 g by 44 gives us approximately 0.2 mol of carbon dioxide.

, Our equation now looks like this: Ptotal =(0.4 * R * 310/2) nitrogen + (0.3 *R * 310/2) oxygen + (0.2 * R *310/2) carbon dioxide.


For simplicity’s sake, we’ve left out the units of measure accompanying the values. These units will cancel out after we do the math, leaving only the unit of measure we’re using to report the pressures in.

, Plugging this value into the equation now gives us Ptotal =(0.4 * 0.0821 * 310/2) nitrogen + (0.3 *0.0821 * 310/2) oxygen + (0.2 * 0.0821 * 310/2) carbon dioxide.

, Now that we have the values in place, it’s time to do the math.


For the partial pressure of nitrogen, we multiply 0.4 mol by our constant of 0.0821 and our temperature of 310 degrees K, then divide by 2 liters: 0.4 * 0.0821 * 310/2 = 5.09 atm, approximately.
For the partial pressure of oxygen, we multiply 0.3 mol by our constant of 0.0821 and our temperature of 310 degrees K, then divide by 2 liters: 0.3 *0.0821 * 310/2 = 3.82 atm, approximately.
For the partial pressure of carbon dioxide, we multiply 0.2 mol by our constant of 0.0821 and our temperature of 310 degrees K, then divide by 2 liters: 0.2 * 0.0821 * 310/2 = 2.54 atm, approximately.
We now add these pressures to find the total pressure: Ptotal = 5.09 + 3.82 + 2.54, or 11.45 atm, approximately.

, Again, we’ll assume a 2-liter flask holding 3 gases: nitrogen (N2), oxygen (O2), and carbon dioxide (CO2). There are 10g of each gas, and the temperature of each gas in the flask is 37 degrees C (98.6 degrees F).


The Kelvin temperature will still be 310 degrees, and, as before, we have approximately 0.4 mol of nitrogen, 0.3 mol of oxygen, and 0.2 mol of carbon dioxide.
Likewise, we’ll still report the pressures in atmospheres, so we’ll use the value of 0.0821 L atm/K mol for the R constant.
Thus, our partial pressures equation still looks the same at this point: Ptotal =(0.4 * 0.0821 * 310/2) nitrogen + (0.3 *0.0821 * 310/2) oxygen + (0.2 * 0.0821 * 310/2) carbon dioxide.

, Because the volume and temperature are the same for each sample in the gas, not to mention each molar value is multiplied by the same constant, we can use the distributive property of mathematics to rewrite the equation as Ptotal = (0.4 + 0.3 + 0.2) * 0.0821 * 310/2.


Adding 0.4 + 0.3 + 0.2 = 0.9 mol of gas mixture. This further simplifies the equation to Ptotal = 0.9 * 0.0821 * 310/2.

, Multiplying 0.9 * 0.0821 * 310/2 = 11.45 mol, approximately.

, To do this, divide the number of moles of each gas into the total number of moles.


There are 0.4 mol of nitrogen, so 0.4/0.9 = 0.44 (44 percent) of the sample, approximately.
There are 0.3 mol of nitrogen, so 0.3/0.9 = 0.33 (33 percent) of the sample, approximately.
There are 0.2 mol of carbon dioxide, so 0.2/0.9 = 0.22 (22 percent) of the sample, approximately.
While the above approximate percentages add to only 0.99, the actual decimals are repeating, so the sum would actual be a repeating series of 9s after the decimal. By definition, this is the same as 1, or 100 percent.

,


Multiplying 0.44 * 11.45 = 5.04 atm, approximately.
Multiplying 0.33 * 11.45 = 3.78 atm, approximately.
Multiplying 0.22 * 11.45 = 2.52 atm, approximately.

Determine the Young's Modulus.",How to Calculate Modulus3," Bulk modulus expresses the strength of the material when external force is applied in the axial direction, producing stress. The external pressure p (force times area over which the force is applied, expressed in MPa) applied to the material equals the dilation (a unitless number) times the bulk modulus K (expressed in MPa). As p = K times dSs, the bulk modulus K is determined as p divided by dSs.

, Shear modulus expresses the strength of the material when external force is applied in the perpendicular direction, producing strain. The external pressure p (force times area over which the force is applied, expressed in MPa) applied to the material equals the dilation (a unitless number) times the shear modulus G (expressed in MPa). As p = G times dSn, the bulk modulus G is determined as p divided by dSn.

, Stressing a material will cause a proportional strain and vice versa. Young's modulus describes the relationship between stress and strain in the material. It is a linear relationship up to the yield point of the material. Young's modulus E equals stress divided by strain.

Practice presenting your project.",How to Create an Amazing Looking Science Project in 1 Week," The first step to create an amazing science project is to pick a topic that interests you. If you’re interested in the topic, you’ll want to make the presentation the best that you can because it will be fun.


Start with a general topic such as physics, chemistry, or biology and get more specific from there.;
, Once you’ve chosen a topic, research some projects that fit with that topic. There are two general types of projects: investigation and invention. Investigation projects seek to answer a specific question.If you want to know the why and how something happens, choose an investigation project. Invention projects seek to solve a specific problem.Try searching online or find books at the library to find potential projects.
Search for both investigation and invention projects to give you a variety of options.
Some examples of quick projects include DNA isolation from strawberries, chromatography using colorful candies, making a simple circuit, and growing salt or sugar crystals.

, There are a couple of important things to consider when choosing your project. Pick a project that is in line with the research topics you listed above. Choose something interesting that will take less than a week to complete. Ask yourself the following questions when deciding which project is best for you.


Does it interest you?
Do you have access to all of the necessary materials?
How long will it take to perform the experiments? Is there enough time to repeat everything if it doesn’t work properly the first time?

, If you only have a week to finish, make a daily schedule and stick to it. If you thoroughly plan everything beforehand it will be easier to finish on time. Be sure to leave extra time in case you run into unexpected bumps in the road. Try a schedule similar to the one listed below.


Day 1: List topics and research potential projects.
Day 2: Choose a project and gather the materials.
Day 3-4: Perform the experiments. If you have an experiment that takes multiple days try condensing days 1 and 2 into one day to give yourself more time. Repeat experiments if necessary.
Day 5: Analyze your data and draw some conclusions. Start drafting your report and outlining the board.
Day 6-7: Make clear concise figures of your data, write the final report, and put together the board.

, Before starting any experiment you have to do a little bit of background research on your problem. Use reputable sources such as books from the library and websites ending in .org, .edu, or .gov.


Take detailed notes while doing your research to simplify the writing process.
Write down all of your sources so they can be properly cited.
Let’s say we want to do an experiment using chromatography to identify the food dyes used in certain candies. You’d want to research what chromatography is and what it can be used for., Once you’ve done your research, you should have a good idea of what materials you’ll need to complete your experiment. Make a list of all of the things you will need. Gather the materials you already have at home and ask a parent to help you get the rest.


Keep everything in one place so you’ll have easy access to it when you’re ready to begin.
For candy chromatography, you’d need different colored candies such as Skittles or M&M’s, filter paper strips, water, a clear glass or beaker, food coloring, popsicle sticks, binder clips, and a ruler., A hypothesis is a proposed answer to a scientific problem. This proposal is based on research and must be either supported or refuted through experimentation.A hypothesis is usually written as an “If this than that” statement.For example: If an M&M is green, it will be made up of yellow and blue dyes.

, Make a written step-by-step procedure for your experiment. Having everything planned beforehand ensures everything will go smoothly when you actually perform the experiment.


Mentally go through every step while writing your procedure.
Come up with an alternative strategy if the first attempt doesn’t go exactly as planned.
For candy chromatography, you will be comparing the chromatograph of known food dyes to that of colored candies to determine what dyes were used. Here is a condensed sample procedure:

Set-up the experiment by filling your glass with water at the bottom.
Attach filter paper to the popsicle stick using the binder clip.
Extract dye from the candy by placing it on top of a drop of water for three minutes. Removing the candy leaves you with a small droplet of dyed water.
Use another popsicle stick to transfer the dye to a spot on the filter paper about 1 inch (3 cm) from the bottom. Spot a drop of known food dye on a separate sheet of filter paper to compare to the candy.
Place the filter paper in the water so it is just barely touching and let the water rise up through capillary action. Remove the strips when the water is about a quarter inch from the top of the paper. Mark the strip at the highest point the water rose.
Let the filter paper dry, then analyze the paper to see if the dyes have similar color spots on the filter.



, There are three types of variables in any given experiment: independent, dependent, and constant.


An independent variable is one that the scientist manipulates. A properly designed experiment has only one independent variable.For example, the independent variable is the color of the candy used in each run. You can test a blue and brown M&M and/or a red and green Skittle. It is unknown and will be compared to the known constant variables of the food coloring dye.
The dependent variable is the condition that the scientist observes in response to the independent variable.The dependent variable is the dye that makes up each candy. At the end of the experiment you will observe the dye that makes up the color of each candy.
The constant variables are conditions that stay the same between experiments. Constant variables or controls allow you to determine that the dependent variable is changing only in response to the independent variable and not some additional changing variables.For our example, the known food dye is a constant variable. Other constant variables are using the same temperature and amount of water for each run, using the same type of filter paper, and comparing all of your unknown candies to the same food coloring dye.
List your variables, identifying all three types in your experiment.
Make sure you only have one independent variable per experiment.

, Now that you’ve done all the proper preparation, you are ready for the fun part. Follow your written procedure and do the experiment. Make detailed observations during the process. Take pictures and write down notes. Document everything you did during the actual experiment. Write down all results. Ask yourself the following questions as you go and write down the answers.


Did anything not go as planned?
Did you skip or add steps in the procedure?
Did anything surprising happen?
For our example, record the distances traveled of the spot from the original sample and record the total distance the water traveled.Take pictures of your experimental set-up and at each stage of the process. Photograph each piece of filter paper for your results as well.

, All good scientific data can be replicated. Repeat your experiment at least one time and see if you get the same results. Ideally, you will repeat at least three times total.If your results are not the same, think about why that might be. Propose solutions to address this problem.
For our example, run multiple trials of the same color candy. Compare them to multiple trials of the same food dye.

, Analyzing and drawing conclusions from the data is the final step in your experiment. Did the change you made in the independent variable change the outcome of the dependent variable? Do the results support or refute your hypothesis? An easy way to look at the data is to make a graph or chart out of the numbers.Don’t change your hypothesis if it doesn’t match your data. Part of the fun of scientific exploration is determining why your hypothesis is wrong and designing experiments in support of a new hypothesis.
State your conclusions in a clear and concise manner, summing up your results and why they are important.
For our example, you can calculate an Rf value for each spot on the filter paper. The Rf value is the distance traveled by the sample divided by the distance traveled by the water.You can compare the Rf values of the candy spots to the food dye spots to determine if the same food dye was used.

, Writing the report should be simple as you’ve already done most of the work. Your report should include the background, the purpose of your experiment, your hypothesis, the materials needed, the procedure, the variables, your observations, the results, the analysis, and your conclusion.


Your teacher will tell you the exact length of the report, but a paragraph for each section is generally a good place to start.
Proofread for errors before you turn in any written work.
Properly cite all the sources used for the development of your project.

, The best way to visually present your project is with a display board. Use bright colors and easy-to-read fonts.Add colored construction paper to make everything stand out.


Make your sub-headings bold and large enough to read from a few feet away.
Display boards come in many different colors. Stick to a simple color scheme. Too many different colors can make things look chaotic and difficult to read.
Use the construction paper as an accent to your content. Print the content on a piece of white paper and then glue that onto a piece of construction paper that is slightly larger so it has a colored border.
Add a border around the outside of the display to make it pop.
Use pre-cut letters to spell out the title.
Make sure everything looks crisp and clean. Don’t use wrinkled paper or leave glue marks on the board. Use the same font for all of your text.

, Make sure everything flows naturally on your board. Everything should be evenly spaced and easy to read. Center the title and make it large enough to read from a few feet away.Include enough information for someone to understand exactly what you did and how you did it, but avoid using giant blocks of text.


Include pictures taken during the experiment and graphs of the data.

, If someone comes up to your display board, you want to be able to tell them exactly what you did and have them walk away understanding your experiment. Practice a 1-2 minute explanation of your project and be prepared to answer any questions people may have.


Keep notecards handy in case you need to refresh your mind.

Make a list of what he or she says will earn a good grade. Keep these requirements in mind while designing your project. If your teacher hands out any worksheets regarding the science fair, keep them together in a folder.;
, Sometimes people limit themselves to strictly scientific pursuits that might not interest you. When you think about it, everything is in the science field. For example, if you love art, you could research how the chemicals in paint react or how they make the artificial colors. After researching, pick the topic that interests you most.


Try brainstorming ideas. Get a sheet of paper and a pencil and write down all the ideas that you have or problems you’d like to solve.Pick a topic that is appropriate to your age level. It’s okay to be ambitious, but make sure you have enough time to finish everything before the deadline.
Keep track of all of your sources so you can cite them in your final report.
For example: Let’s say you are fascinated by plants and how they grow. If you live in a place that doesn’t get much sunlight, you might ask how the low light would affect the ability of the plant to grow. You could do an experiment that exposes a plant to different levels of light and seeing how well it grows under each condition.

, A crucial part of planning your science fair project is knowing how much time you have to complete it and how much time it will take to research, execute, and write a report about your project. Some experiments may go quickly, but others may take multiple weeks. If you need to talk to an expert, make sure you contact them as soon as possible so you can get on their schedule in time.


Spend at least one week researching your topic and gathering information.
It can take up to a week to design your experiment with all of the proper controls and gather all of the materials needed for completion.
If you have a multi-day or multi-week experiment, keep this in mind when making your timeline.
Leave at least a week to analyze the data, write your final report, and design your display board.
Choose an experiment that fits within your time constraints.
For our example: You will need a few weeks to let the plants grow in the various conditions so make sure you have enough time to devote a few weeks to it.

, Use your background to generate questions you can answer with a properly designed experiment. The background is essential to properly designing your experiment and understanding how and why the experiment can answer the question you are asking.If you will need to use any mathematical formulas or equations to answer your question, research these as well so you understand them before you begin.
Research experiments that may have already addressed some aspect of your question. Designing the experiment will be easier if you have a previous framework to build upon.
Ask your teacher or a parent to help you better understand the topic you’ve chosen by asking them if it looks like you have any gaps in your knowledge.
For our example: Research what plants would work best for the experiment: quick growing, slow growing, a plant that needs a lot or little sunlight? How much natural sunlight does the plant generally need to grow properly? How many hours of light do they get each day? What kind of soil does the plant need to grow? How much water does it need?

, A variable is a condition in the experiment that can occur in varying amounts. When designing an experiment, it is important to identify all of the variables before you begin. To properly examine a cause and effect relationship, you only want one variable to change while everything else remains constant.The independent variable in an experiment is the condition that the scientist changes throughout the experiment. You should only have one independent variable in a properly designed experiment. For example, the amount of light each plant gets exposed to is the independent variable.
The dependent variable is the condition that is measured in response to the changes in the independent variable. It is the one that gets observed throughout the experiment. For example, the growth height of the plant throughout the experiment is the dependent variable.
The controlled variables are all of the conditions in an experiment that remain constant throughout the duration of the experiment. For example, type and amount of soil, amount of water, and hours of light exposure.

, A hypothesis is a testable statement about a scientific process that is made based on a researched topic. It is an educated guess about a scientific process and the way it might work.It is usually phrased in an “If this, then that” statement.


For example: In our experiment about the growth height of a plant in different light levels, your hypothesis might be: If plants need light to grow, then they will not grow as high in low light or no light conditions.

, Once you have chosen a topic and made a hypothesis, you need to design an experiment that will properly test that hypothesis. How will you answer your question? What materials will you need for the experiment? Is there a specific order you need to do everything before it will work? How many times do you need to repeat the experiment before you believe the result?


Answering these questions will help you make a materials list and develop a clear procedure.
Make sure your experiment can be performed safely or with adult supervision.For our example: You will want to test a few conditions such as no light, low light, and high light. You will also need to define what low light and high light are in terms of watts or lumens (measures of light). You will need to decide what type of plant you want to use and if you want to buy them already sprouted or grow them from seeds. Keep in mind if you grow them from seeds you’ll need at least two weeks before you start seeing growth through the soil. You’ll need to set up a system, likely in a closet, where your plants can get a set amount of light each day. You might need to design a black box with a light source on top that allows the plant to only get that much light. How long do you want to let the plants grow? You’ll need a few weeks to really see differences in the plant growth. How will you measure the growth? From the bottom of the pot or from the top of the soil? Be consistent with each measurement.

, The procedure is a step-by-step list that details everything you need to do to answer your scientific question. A proper procedure should allow someone to duplicate your experiment exactly without asking any questions.Each step should be clear and only require one action. If a step requires too many things, it should be broken up into multiple steps.


Write the steps with an action verb at the beginning: Open the container.
Avoid statements such as, “I opened the container.”
Let a parent, sibling, or classmate read your procedure and see if they have any questions. Add more steps if necessary.

, Look over your procedure and determine what items you will need to execute the experiment. Make the list very detailed so you aren’t in the middle of an experiment when you realize you’re missing something important.If an item is particularly cheap or fragile, you might want to gather extras just in case you need them.
Take all of the necessary safety precautions before starting the experiment.
For our example, you’ll need soil, water, seeds or grown plant (you’ll want the plants to be approximately the same height or measure the starting height and subtract the final growth from the starting height at the end), a ruler or yard stick, a constant light source, a closet, and containers for your plants.

, Follow your detailed procedure to actually do the experiment. Prepare as much as you can beforehand and have all of your materials nearby so you can get to them when you need them. Have your lab notebook on hand so you can make observations and take notes during the process.Make a note if you altered the procedure in any way during the actual experiment.
Take pictures during the experiment to use on your display board.
For our example: Place your plant/light set-up in the closet and turn on the lights. Make sure you give the plants the same amount of water at the same time every day to limit variability.

, Write down all of your observations and results as you go along. If you have a short experiment, keep good notes on exactly what you did and what results you obtained. Not all experiments can be completed the same day. If you are doing a long-term experiment, like growing plants, make daily observations about the plants and how they’re changing.


Keep all of your observations and data in your lab notebook.
For long-term experiments, date each observation so you know exactly when you made it.
For our example: Record the measurement of their height every day or every other day using the ruler. Limit the amount of time their exposed to light during the measurement process. Keep a log of all of your measurements and take pictures along the way.

, There can be a lot of variability that occurs during an experiment. To account for this variability, scientists perform the same experiment multiple times and average the data of each trial together. Repeat your experiment at least three times. If you are doing a multi-day experiment, use multiple replicates in one experiment.


For our example: Start the experiment with three plants in each light condition. Again, try to use plants with the same starting height or just subtract out the original height at the end.

, Did you forget to do something? Did you make any mistakes during the process? Have you done multiple trials of each experiment? If you made mistakes, repeat the procedure until you can do it perfectly. If you are confident in your data, it is time to decipher it and draw some conclusions.


You might be able to glance at your data and see if it supports or disproves your hypothesis, but know that you can’t make any firm conclusions until the data has been properly analyzed.

, A properly designed experiment will have replicates or multiple trials. You may have performed the experiment multiple times or you may have tested multiple items at the same time (example: tested battery length of 3 batteries from each brand or tested growth of 3 of the same plant under multiple growing conditions). The data from each of these replicates need to be averaged together and will represent one data point for that condition. To average the trials, add each trial together and then divide by the number of trials.


For example, our 3 plants in low light may have grown 3.0 in, 4.0 in and 3.5 in. The average growth height for low light is (3+4+3.5)/3 = 3.5 in.

, Oftentimes, it is easier to see differences in the data when you make a visual graph. Generally, the independent variable is plotted on the x-axis (horizontal) and the dependent variable is on the y-axis (vertical).Bar graphs and line graphs are a great way to visualize your data.
You can draw a graph by hand, but it looks much cleaner and more professional to make it on the computer.
For our example, graph the light levels on the x-axis and the growth height on the y-axis.

, Give the graph a title and label the x-axis and y-axis. Be sure to include the proper units used (hrs, ft, in, days, etc). If you have multiple data sets on one graph, use a different symbol or color to represent them. Put a legend on the right side of the graph to identify what each symbol and color represents.


Give the graph a title that tells you exactly what you’re looking at.
For example: “Plant Growth Height in Various Levels of Light”

, Now that you have plotted your data, you should be able to easily see differences between your various conditions. At the elementary and middle school level, you can draw your conclusions simply by looking at the data. State whether the data support or disprove the hypothesis. Discuss changes you might make to the procedure or future studies you could do to further the study.At the high school level, you might be able to run some statistics on your data to see if there truly are differences.

, Before you start working on the actual display board, you need to put together your report. The report shouldn’t be too difficult because you have written most of the sections during the actual experiment. A full report needs to have a background, the purpose of the project, the hypothesis, the materials and procedure, identification of the variables, your observations, results, analysis, and final conclusion.


Some reports may require an abstract, which is just a short summary of the entire project.
Proofread your entire report before turning it in.
Cite all of the sources used for your report. Do not copy and paste information from sources, but summarize it in your own words.

, The board is where you can get a little creative and make an artistic display of everything you discovered with your experimenting. Pick one or two bright colors that complement each other to use as an accent. Avoid hand writing the information as this can give your board a messy look. Center the title at the top of the board and use large letters that can be seen from a distance.Make subheadings that are bold and large enough to read at a distance of 2-3 feet.
Too many colors on the board can be overwhelming and look chaotic. Stick to one or two colors to make everything pop.
Print the necessary information on white paper and then layer the colored construction paper underneath.
Avoid using wrinkled paper and leaving glue marks on the board.
Make sure your fonts and font sizes are consistent throughout each section.

, Center subheadings above the paragraphs of information. Make sure everything flows together: start with the introduction, hypothesis and materials on the left side, add the procedure, experiment, and data in the center panel, finish with the analysis and conclusion on the right panel. This is a loose guideline to follow. Organize everything so that it looks nice and ordered.


Include pictures that were taken during the experiment to show exactly what you did.
Avoid using giant blocks of text. If you do have some that are large, break them up with pictures or figures.

, On the day of the science fair, people will want to hear all about your project and how you did it. Practice what you are going to say in front of friends and family so you won’t be nervous on the day of the presentation. Be prepared to answer questions about your project as well.

Write some notecards with key points in case you need to refer back to them when speaking with someone.

Extract useful values from the given information.,
Set up the appropriate equation.,
Find values for your volume variables.,
Plug your known volume variables into the porosity equation.,
Solve the equation to obtain a porosity value.",How to Calculate Porosity1," When calculating porosity theoretically, you will be given an example situation that contains some of the values you need. Read your question carefully and look for values such as total volume (Vt{\displaystyle Vt}), solid volume (Vs{\displaystyle Vs}), and pore volume (Vp{\displaystyle Vp}). Always pay close attention to the units of these values.

It will help to write these values out separately. For example, if your question provides Vt{\displaystyle Vt} and Vs{\displaystyle Vs}, you would write:


Vt{\displaystyle Vt} = 5.00 cm^3


Vs{\displaystyle Vs} = 3.00 cm^3


;
, By definition, porosity (Pt{\displaystyle Pt}) is equal to the pore volume (Vp{\displaystyle Vp}) divided by the total volume (Vt{\displaystyle Vt}), or Pt{\displaystyle Pt} = Vp{\displaystyle Vp}/Vt{\displaystyle Vt}. Keep in mind that this is not the only equation that can find porosity. If values are given for bulk density and particle density rather than values for volumes, you should use a different equation., It is helpful to keep in mind that Vt{\displaystyle Vt} is the sum of solid and pore volumes, or Vt{\displaystyle Vt} = Vs{\displaystyle Vs} + Vp{\displaystyle Vp}. This relationship can be rearranged to allow you to solve for the any of the volume variables, as long as the other two are known. For example, and Vt{\displaystyle Vt} - Vp{\displaystyle Vp} = Vs{\displaystyle Vs}.Using the same values as listed in previous steps, Vt{\displaystyle Vt} = 5.00 cm^3 and Vs{\displaystyle Vs} = 3.00 cm^3, we can solve Vt{\displaystyle Vt} - Vs{\displaystyle Vs} = Vp{\displaystyle Vp} to find that Vp{\displaystyle Vp} = 5.00 cm^3 - 3.00 cm^3 = 2.00 cm^3.


, Once you have determined a value for Vp{\displaystyle Vp} and a value for Vt{\displaystyle Vt}, you can plug them into the porosity equation, Pt{\displaystyle Pt} = Vp{\displaystyle Vp}/Vt{\displaystyle Vt}. Be sure that you include units for Vp{\displaystyle Vp} and Vt{\displaystyle Vt}. Also, you should be sure that the units match, if not, you will need to do dimensional analysis to make them match.
, Now that your equation is totally set up and has the appropriate values in place, you can solve by doing simple arithmetic. It might help to have a calculator handy for this part. You should also note that the units for Vt{\displaystyle Vt} and Vp{\displaystyle Vp} are the same and cancel out by division. This is exactly what you want to happen since porosity is a unitless value.Since porosity is often expressed as a percent, once you have found the decimal value, it is common to multiply this value by 100%.

Using the same values from the above examples, your equation will look similar to this:


Pt{\displaystyle Pt} = 2.00 cm^3 / 5.00 cm^3 = 0.400.

If you would like to express that value as a percent, you would multiply it by 100% to yield Pt{\displaystyle Pt} = 40%.

Assume the particle density (Pd{\displaystyle Pd}) of your sample to be 2.66 g/(cm^3).,
Use the relationship between volume and density to derive your equation.,
Find your Pb{\displaystyle Pb} value.,
Solve the equation by inserting the appropriate density values.",How to Calculate Porosity2," The particle density of a sample is equal to the mass of the sample divided by volume of the sample. When dealing with soil samples, the average particle density of soil is 2.66 g/(cm^3). For that reason, this value is assumed to be the particle density of any soil sample, unless otherwise specified., Since density is defined as mass per volume, and porosity is a comparison of pore volume to total volume, it is possible to express porosity in terms of density as well. The result is the equation Pt{\displaystyle Pt} = (1 - Pb{\displaystyle Pb}/Pd{\displaystyle Pd}) where Pt{\displaystyle Pt} is your porosity, Pb{\displaystyle Pb} is the bulk density, and Pd{\displaystyle Pd} is the sample’s particle density., The Pb{\displaystyle Pb} value will be given to you in a straightforward question. If the value is not given, you may be given other values such as the dry mass of the sample and the sample’s volume. In this case you would divide the dry mass of the sample by the sample volume to find your bulk density, or Pb{\displaystyle Pb}., Now that you have obtained values for Pb{\displaystyle Pb} and Pd{\displaystyle Pd}, you can solve for Pt{\displaystyle Pt}. Note that the value obtained by dividing Pb{\displaystyle Pb} by Pd{\displaystyle Pd} should ALWAYS be less than 1, thus the equation Pt{\displaystyle Pt} = (1 - Pb{\displaystyle Pb}/Pd{\displaystyle Pd}) should never yield a negative answer. If it does, you likely divided Pd{\displaystyle Pd} by Pb{\displaystyle Pb}, which is incorrect.This equation will give you a decimal value for porosity. To express porosity as a percent, simply multiply that decimal by 100%. For example, 0.41 x 100% = 41%.

Measure the volume of your sample.,
Measure a volume of water.,
Saturate the sample with water.,
Record the volume of water used.,
Set up the equation to solve for porosity with volume.,
Do the calculations to find your sample’s porosity.",How to Calculate Porosity3," You can measure the volume directly if your sample exactly fills a container with a known volume. You can also transfer the sample to a container such as a pre-measured beaker to measure volume. If you are unable to measure the volume directly, you can calculate the volume mathematically.

Transferring the sample from one container to another may affect the porosity by disrupting the material.


, It is not important exactly how much water you measure out. The two things that are important in this step are measuring out more water than you will need to saturate your sample, and writing down exactly how much water you started with. This is the only way you can know how much you used.
, This is an easy step, but can tricky. You want to add enough water so that all of the pores in your sample are filled, but you do not want to add any extra water. While it is important to get as close as you can to exactly saturating the sample, there will be some degree of error. Get the water level as close to the surface level of your solid sample level as possible., To do this, you will need to subtract the volume of water that is left from the volume of water you started with. This will leave you with the volume of water that was poured out. The volume of water you used is (approximately) equal to the pore volume of your sample., Now that you have the volume of your sample (Vs{\displaystyle Vs}) and the pore volume (Vp{\displaystyle Vp}), you can add them together to get total volume (Vt{\displaystyle Vt}). It is now possible to use the equation Pt{\displaystyle Pt} = (Vp{\displaystyle Vp}/Vt{\displaystyle Vt}) x 100% to find your porosity (Pt{\displaystyle Pt}). , Enter the appropriate values into the equation. Be sure to keep track of your units and make sure that they cancel out appropriately, as porosity is a unitless value. A calculator might be handy for this step, also."

Saturate the area you want to sample.,
Drive the steel ring into the ground.,
Dig out around the steel ring.,
Remove the ring.,
Record the saturated mass of your sample.,
Record the volume of your sample.,
Transfer the soil to an oven safe container.,
Dry your sample.,
Weigh your dried sample in the dish to find your total mass (mt{\displaystyle mt}).,
Subtract mc{\displaystyle mc} from mt{\displaystyle mt} to find the dry mass of your sample (md{\displaystyle md}).,
Calculate the mass of water in the saturated sample.,
Convert the mass of water to the pore volume of your sample.,
Divide the pore volume by the total volume of your sample.",How to Calculate Porosity4," A good way to do this is to place a pre-weighed steel ring on the ground where you would like to take a sample and fill it with water. Allow the water to sit in the ring overnight, or until it is absorbed by the ground. This will make it easier to collect your sample., Use a block of wood and a hammer to drive the ring down into the ground. The soil inside the ring is referred to as a core or core sample. The ring protects the core sample from being disturbed during collection., Use a spade and other digging tools to carefully dig around the steel ring. You do not want to disturb the soil inside the ring. Cut away any roots from the bottom of the ring., Once you have cleared out the soil around the ring, you can remove it from the hole. Keep the core sample inside the ring and do not disturb it. Be careful not to lose any of the sample when moving it., Add water until the sample in the ring is fully saturated and can hold no more water. Weigh the sample in the steel ring. Subtract from that value the mass of the steel ring. This will leave you with the saturated mass of your sample.
, The volume of your sample will be the same as the volume of your ring. Since your ring is a cylinder, to calculate the volume you will multiply the height of the cylinder by the radius squared (the radius is the distance from the center of the circle to the edge), and then multiply that by pi (often rounded to 3.14). If you do not know the radius you can measure across the top of the cylinder at its widest point and divide that measurement by two., Be sure to pre-weigh the container and write down the mass of the container (mc{\displaystyle mc}). If you are planning to use a microwave oven to dry your sample, be sure that your container has no metal and is microwave safe., If you are using a microwave, 10 minutes on high should be sufficient to dry out your sample. This ensures that all of the pores in the sample have been cleared of water. You can also dry the sample in a conventional oven at a temperature of 105 degrees Celsius, or 221 degrees fahrenheit, for at least 2 hours.Though they are still full of air, this will not affect the mass of the sample., Remember that this value is not the mass of your sample. It is the mass of your sample plus the mass of your container. Do not use this value to calculate porosity., To find the dry weight of your sample, you can simply subtract the initial mass of the container from the final mass of the container plus the sample. Be sure that the number you get makes sense. For example, you will not have a negative value for mass. If you do this is incorrect and you should troubleshoot your math., Subtract the dry mass (md{\displaystyle md}) from the saturated mass (ms{\displaystyle ms}). The difference will be the mass of water (mw{\displaystyle mw}). Again, the dry mass should be smaller than the saturated mass.
, By definition, one gram of water is equal to one cubic centimeter of water. This means that the mass of your water in grams is equal to the volume of water in cubic centimeters. Since your sample was saturated, all pores are filled with water, therefore, the pore volume is equal to the volume of water present in the saturated sample.
, This will yield a decimal number that is smaller than one. Multiply that number by 100%. The result is the porosity of your sample expressed as a percent.

Formulate the question you would like to answer.,
Identify the dependent variable.,
Identify the independent variable.,
Identify the relevant population.,
Select subjects for the study from your population.,
Randomly assign subjects into two groups.,
Ensure that subjects do not know which group they are in.,
Ensure that experimenters also do not know which subjects are in which group.,
Conduct a “pretest”.,
Administer the treatment to the experimental group.,
Administer a post-test.,
Compare the post-test results produced by the experimental and control groups.,
Calculate descriptive statistics.,
Test your hypothesis.,
Evaluate your experiment.",How to Conduct a True Experiment," Frame your question using the language of cause and effect. Does better nutrition cause higher test scores? Can aspirin cause a reduction in the symptoms of depression?;
, This is what you hope to change through the experiment. If you are looking for cause and effect, in other words, this is the effect.For example, if you want to know if listening to punk music makes you sleep less, the dependent variable will be the numbers of hours slept.
A dependent variable must be measurable.

, The independent variable is the factor that you think will cause a change in the dependent variable. It can be thought of as an intervention or a treatment.In your cause-and-effect question, it is the term that comes before ""cause"": does better nutrition cause higher test scores? Better nutrition is the independent variable, and higher test scores is the dependent variable.
For example, if you are studying the effect of talk therapy on grief, receiving the talk therapy is the independent variable.

, Do you want to study the members of a particular group, such as a college or a city? Are you interested in all diabetic adults, or post-menopausal women, or children who have moved at least twice?

, If your population is small (for instance, one high school), you might be able to study the whole population. Otherwise, you will need to select a random sample.Random selection ensures that your subjects have a diverse set of characteristics that reflects the population in general. This helps you to avoid introducing unintended variables. If education level is significant to your study, for example, and your population includes people with very little education as well as people with Ph.D.s, for example, you don’t want a subject group composed only of college freshmen.
There are several methods of randomly selecting subjects. For a relatively small population, you could assign each member a number and then use a random number generator to select members. For a larger population, you could take a systematic sample (for example, the second name on each page of a directory) and then use the random number method just described with that smaller subset.Select a group large enough to produce statistically useful data. The ideal size will vary greatly depending on factors such as the size of the underlying population and the expected size of the effect.You may use a sample size calculator to aid in determining a target size., One group is the experimental group, while the other is the control group. You must guarantee that any given subject has an equal chance of being in either group.


Use a random number generator to assign a number to each subject. Then place them in the two groups by number. For instance, assign the lower half of the random numbers to the control group.
The control group will not be given the treatment or intervention. This will allow you to measure the effect of the intervention.

, If this condition is met, you are conducting what is often called a “single-blind” study.This helps to keep your two groups identical in all respects except the actual intervention or treatment, and is part of controlling for extraneous factors. All members of your study, regardless of group, should believe equally that they are receiving the real intervention or treatment.

, If neither the subjects nor the experimenters know, during the experiment, which group is which, you are conducting a double-blind study. This is another way to remove possible extra variables that could affect your study. If experimenters don't know which group is the control group, they won't be able to inform them unconsciously by, for example, administering the inert treatment less carefully.


Have different people in charge of assigning subjects to a group, administering treatment, and evaluating subjects after treatment.

, In other words, measure the dependent variable before the experiment begins. This can be described as a “baseline” measurement.


A pretest is not a required feature of the true experiment. However, it increases the ability of your experiment to demonstrate cause and effect.In order to say that A causes B, you want to show that A happened before B, which can only be done through the use of a pretest.
For example, if you were measuring the effect of, say, playing the trumpet on academic performance, you might obtain the grades received by your subjects for the semester before the experiment., Ensure that the only difference between the experience of the experimental group and the control group is the treatment itself.


In a clinical trial, this often means that a placebo is administered to the control group. A placebo resembles the real treatment as closely as possible, but is in fact designed to have no effect. For example, in a study on the effect of a medicine, both groups would come to the same room and receive an identical-looking pill. The only difference would be that one pill would contain the medicine, while the other would be an inert “sugar pill.”In other kinds of experiments, keeping the two experiences equivalent will take other forms. Take the example of the effect of playing the trumpet on academic performance. You might want to offer the control group another kind of lesson or opportunity for socialization, to be sure that it’s really the trumpet-playing in specific and not getting a music lesson in general that is causing the effect., After the course of treatment or intervention is complete, measure the dependent variable. If you conducted a pre-test, the post-test should mirror the pre-test as much as possible, so that the results are directly comparable.

, In addition, if available, compare pre-test and post-test results. To do this, you will need to conduct a statistical analysis of your data. While this is a broad subject, you can make a good start by calculating basic descriptive statistics and by running a t-test to assess if differences observed are significant., These are statistics that allow you to communicate your data effectively.They provide information about the properties of the data you've produced and allow your readers to understand important things about it from a single glance.When you say, for example, that on average people who received the medicine got better 1.7 days sooner, you are presenting descriptive statistics.


What is the central tendency of the data? Central tendency is measured using mean (average), median, or mode. For example, in a study on the effects of caffeine on sleep, you will want to calculate the mean number of hours slept by members of the control and experimental groups.
What is the distribution of the data? Again, there are many different ways to measure how the data are distributed, including range, variance, and standard deviation.

, Tests of significance will allow you to estimate how likely it is that your results were produced by chance rather than a genuine experimental effect.It determines whether there is a statistically significant difference between the results for the control and experimental groups.


A t-test is a common test of significance. A t-test compares the difference between the means of two sets of data in relation to the variation within the data.You can calculate a t-test by hand or by using statistical software such as Microsoft Excel.

, What limits were there on your ability to control possible extraneous factors? To what extent did your subject group reflect the larger population you hoped to study? What alternative hypotheses could be sustained on the basis of your data? When presenting your results, consider limitations honestly and use them to suggest further lines of research.

Getting a visa can be a long and expensive process, so if you don’t need one, it’s probably better not to bother.Certain groups have free passage into the UK. Citizens of other European Union nations, non-EU members of the European Economic Area, Switzerland, and members of the Overseas Countries and Territories (OCT) do not need a visa.
People who definitely need a visa include those who are stateless, hold a non-national travel document, hold a passport from an authority unrecognized in the UK, or are a refugee.;
, There are a number of different visas available from the UK. The kind you get will depend on your purpose for visiting the country, what country you are coming from, and how long you intend to stay. Check your circumstances through the visa website to see what kind of visa you require.There are a number of other countries from which the UK does not require a visa for any visit less than six months, including the United States. When you search for your visa, the British government will tell you that, and also provide a list of documents you will need when you enter the country.

, If you are visiting the UK for more than 6 months and are a resident of a specific list of countries, you’ll need a tuberculosis test. You will get a chest x-ray, and may need to give a sample of sputum (phlegm coughed up from your lungs).The clinic that tests you must have been approved by the British Home Office. The British government has a full list of the countries that require a test, as well as lists of approved clinics.There are some additional rules that provide exemptions from TB testing. If you are a diplomat accredited to the UK, a returning resident who hasn’t been away for more than 2 years, or you lived for at least 6 months in a country that the UK doesn’t require testing from and you’ve been away from that country for no more than 6 months, you don’t need a TB test for a UK visa.

, Apply through the British government’s service, available online at the Visa4UK site: . You will be able to fill out an application for your visa, which includes information about what type of visa you would like, how long you intend to stay, and the purpose of your visit. When you are finished, print out the form.


You will need to register an account at the site before you begin. You will need to include information such as your name, date of birth, nationality, and current address and contact information.
You can receive the forms in your native language, but all of your answers need to be given in English.
There is a specific new service available for Standard Visitor, Marriage Visitor, and Permitted Paid Engagement visas from China, India, Russia, Belarus, Benin, Nigeria, South Africa and Turkey.
The UK does not allow the online application in every country. If yours is one of them, you need to go to the application centre and fill one out there.

, The cost of your application will depend on several factors, including the type of visa you are trying to get and how long you intend to stay in the UK. Each visa costs a different amount, so be sure you know what you are expecting to pay before you begin the application.There are additional services available in some countries, such as priority service for fasting processing. You will be able to select and pay for these services when you fill out the online application. You can also select and pay for some of these services at the application centre when you submit your application.

, In order to finish your visa application, you should bring your materials to an application centre. That is where you will submit your application materials.To receive a British visa while in Canada, for example, you will need to visit one of the centres in Toronto, Edmonton, Ottawa, Halifax, or St. John’s.Some countries do not have application centres, so you will need to apply through a centre in a neighboring country. For example, if you hold a passport from Bhutan, you will need to visit an application centre in India for your visa.

, These appointments are usually made as part of the application process, so when you fill out your application, it will ask you to arrange a time to visit the application centre. Be sure to print out the email confirmation you receive for your application. You will not be able to go to your appointment without it., You should get to the application centre 10 minutes before your appointment to sign in. If you are late, you will miss your appointment, and need to reschedule, which can take some time. All visa applicants are required to book an appointment before submitting their application.Remember to bring any supporting documents required to your appointment as well. These documents can include a confirmation of your appointment, a valid passport or travel document, a signed and dated printout of your application, a printout of your payment receipt, and any other supporting documents relevant to your application.
Your appointment will include the collection of biometric information, such as fingerprints and a photograph. Depending on the country, you can bring a photograph with you, or have one taken there.If you are in a nation that takes a digital finger scan, make sure your fingers are free of decoration, cuts, abrasions, or any other markings that might make it difficult to get an acceptable scan. If you are having your picture taken there, it should not include sunglasses or tinted spectacles, or any head covering unless it is worn for religious or medical reasons.
Some appointments will require an interview, such as a student applying for a Tier 4 visa under the Point based system. Make sure to include this information when you make your appointment.The UK offers a range of additional visa services, such as the priority service, for faster processing. You can find out which services are available on your local visa application centre's website. You can usually select and pay for additional services ahead of your appointment, or on arrival at the application centre.

, Once you receive confirmation that you are approved, go back to the centre to pick up your passport and visa. You are now certified to travel to the UK.


In some larger countries, like the United States, the British government’s Decision Making Centre will mail your documents directly to you. They will also notify you by email when they have made a decision.Processing times vary depending on the type of visa you are applying for, so check with your application centre to see how long you can expect to wait.From the United Arab Emirates, for example, UK Visas and Immigration will try to return non-settlement visas within 15 working days. Settlement visas can take a little longer, within 12 weeks. These times are estimates, as the government will review each application individually."

"
Start planning at least a week in advance.,
Allow each passenger to bring one activity bag (in addition to their suitcase).,
Pack a small overnight bag for each passenger if your road trip will span over multiple days.,
Make road rules before departing.,
Prepare for emergencies.,
Be flexible while on the road.",How to Stay Organized on the Road," The key to being organized is preparation, so you’ll need to consider several factors before implementing your ideas:


Identify the vehicle you will be using to take your road trip. Is it a large, roomy SUV or a small car? Obviously, the vehicle size will be extremely important in planning what (or how much) you can take and trying to stuff more into a car that has very little room will make life harder for you.






Make a list of the vehicle occupants. If you can fit everyone in your vehicle comfortably, along with their suitcase and one travel and activity bag, you should be fine for the road trip. If you think you may be cramped, consider renting a larger vehicle for your trip if possible, especially if you will be car-bound for more than one day.






Consider your final destination. Will you be heading somewhere cold or a tropical paradise? Do your accommodations have a washer and dryer and how many days will you be gone? Also, do you need to pack equipment for your vacation such as skis or a surfboard? Knowing as much about your accommodations as possible will help you determine if you can pack a smaller sized suitcase (if you're heading to the beach where you have access to a washer and dryer) or if there’s no way around it and you must pack for each day. Also, consider renting supplies (such as skis and boots) if car room is at a premium.






Determine the number of days or hours that it will take you to complete your road trip. If it will take more than one day to get to your destination, will you need to secure accommodations along the way? If you will need overnight accommodations, conduct online research to identify hotels along your route and make a reservation for each night you need lodging. Don't assume availability; all it takes is one wedding party to fill up the only motel in town.






Obtain directions or a map. If you don’t have a GPS system, print directions using a mapping website or visit your local travel club (like AAA) and obtain a map.GPS systems are not always available,obtain a map.





;
, The best way to stay in control while on the road is to allow each passenger one small bag (roughly the size of a backpack) in which they can pack games, books and electronic devices.


Provide children with a specific list of what they can and cannot take in their activity bag. For example, tell them they can take three books, one pack of crayons and two coloring books. The amount of items should directly correlate to the number of hours or days on the road. For a three hour road trip, one book should be sufficient, however, if you will be road-bound for three days, asking that they pack several books and puzzles is not out of the question. Electronic devices such as tablets or game consoles can carry more books, puzzles and games, so consider taking one to share among the children.






Ask adults to ensure they have all important documentation included inside their travel bag. Maps, day planners, confirmation numbers and tickets should be secured in their bag. Medication should be in the bag too, to avoid having to rummage through the back for it when needed.







, At the end of a 12 hour driving stint, the last thing you want to do is drag heavy luggage to a room for a quick rest. Instead, determine the number of days you will be on the road, and pack a travel bag that includes enough fresh clothing and toiletries for the number of days on the road. Pack a plastic garbage bag inside one of the passenger’s bags and for dirty clothes each evening; that way, you keep the dirty clothes worn during the day separate from the rest of your items.

, The only way you will calm the chaos is to establish a few general car rules and ask everyone to kindly adhere to them throughout the trip. Some rules that have proven their worth for others taking road trips include:


Trash is thrown away at every stop. Request that every passenger search their area for cups, napkins, bags etc. and dispose of it every time the car stops. This will avoid mountains of trash building up and unidentified squashed objects being smushed into the hard-to-reach places of the car.






Maintain a small trash receptacle in the car. Keep a small garbage bag in the front seat and ask that each passenger use it after snacks or meals. This will help to minimize the amount of rogue trash in the car. Empty this bag at every stop.






Shoes must be kept by each passenger. Although everyone loves to take off their shoes during a road trip, demand that shoes be kept on the ground by the passenger to prevent missing shoes . Also, if your feet stink, shoes must be worn at all times unless they're a cherubic toddler with no foot odor. Alternatively, bring foot spray to kill odors.






Passenger space must be maintained and organized at each stop. If the kids want to color in the car or play with toys, fine. However, they must understand that once the car stops they must return whatever they’ve taken out of their activity bag back to its original spot.






Each passenger should perform a mental checklist after every stop. To ensure that items are not lost during the road trip, ask that each passenger double check important items that should be in their activity bag such as cash, maps and favorite toys, for example. The last thing you want is to be an hour away from the last stop only to realize you left tickets or your child’s favorite blanket at the last stop.






Always check you have your wallet after roadside stops. The feeling of leaving it behind is more than chilling.







, Anticipating the unexpected will help you stick to your schedule and maintain a sense of order throughout your car trip. Assemble an emergency travel kit that can be maintained either underneath a car seat or in the trunk (but in an accessible area so it can be accessed if needed while the car is in motion). Items to consider include:


Over the counter and/or prescription medication. Also, don’t forget important medicines such as an Epi Pen or migraine medication if you have allergies or are prone to sudden extreme headaches






Bandages and Band-Aids. Include various sizes and special blister Band-Aids






Antibiotic cream and anti-itch cream






Antibacterial waterless soap or wipes






Diapers and wipes (if a baby is traveling with you)






Small can of insect repellant






Digital thermometer






Leak-proof plastic bag. Whether someone has to vomit or if they have to use the toilet and you can’t get off the road, it’s better than having the offensive matter strew all over the vehicle. Don’t forget to dispose of the plastic bag immediately at the next stop






Small can of air freshener--for a more pleasant ride






One 8 ounce bottle of water--you never know when or if you may need water to clean up messes or wash wounds.







, Sometimes events happen that are beyond your control. Learn to relax and go with the flow if your trip becomes disorganized (think of it as making fond memories that you’ll laugh about in years to come). You can always regroup at overnight stops (do it first thing in the morning when you're most refreshed and least likely to despair over the state of the car).

Visit restaurants where there are mostly local faces—your patronage will be appreciated, and your budget will benefit since often more pricey dishes in foreign restaurants are less expensive than an average meal back home.;
, Don't just go from tourist destination to tourist destination without lifting your head. Strike up some conversations with the locals, or even sit on a park bench and people watch.

, Often a place where there are lots of locals there is an authentic cultural experience lying ahead of you.

, Try to find neighborhoods within walking distance or easily accessible by public transit (if at all possible) that have a lot of things that you are interested in.

, Do you love food? Ask if you can get a ""tour"" of your favorite kitchen. You love glass sculpture? Find the artist and see whether you can be her apprentice for a day.

, Don't go everywhere first class—one of the richest experiences of your life might be on a third class train in India on a wooden bench for over 14 hours, where you could meet a woman who invites you to her house, where they have one bed between 5 family members, and she says to you, ""If you give an Indian your heart, they will share with you everything.""

, Reflect on what you see, hear, taste and touch. Allow for transformation because if the journey doesn't affect your perspective, your sense of humanity, beauty, and the wonder of life, then it is time to do a little soul searching for a way to connect to your heart.

, Be respectful of where you are, and act in a manner that will bring credit to where you came from. Ask questions, and really, really listen. Realize that even though what you are doing is perfectly acceptable where you come from, others may find it insulting, or awkward. Be extra courteous to make up for unintended insults.

, Laughter is a universal human language.

, You will find that there is a whole world of kindred spirits who call themselves travelers, and avoid the tourist mentality. Remember how it feels to share your stories with people who aren't interested, so when you do find a fellow traveler, if you really want to know about their trip, clear your calendar and pack your bag. Your adventure awaits.

Have a good story - even if it may not be true.",How to Sleep Comfortably in a Car," What you need for a good night's sleep in the car depends on your location, the weather, and what sort of temperatures you are acclimated to. In subzero temperatures, you will probably benefit from a couple of sleeping bags (one inside the other), in addition to a blanket and a beanie for your head.


A $60 sleeping bag will keep you warm in −20 °F (−29 °C) weather outside. In a car, you can get by with a −20 °F (−29 °C) sleeping bag. If it gets colder, then just add an extra layer of clothing to your sleeping attire.
Bring a safety pin with you to keep your sleeping bag closed if it does not draw tightly around your head. If you toss and turn in the middle of the night, it could come undone and you could wind up awake and freezing.
A knit hat (knit cap, toque, ski hat, and so on) will keep you much warmer at night. Also, you can pull it over your eyes for additional darkness.
A sleep mask can help you sleep more soundly. In a pinch, you can blindfold yourself with a bandanna, tie a scarf around your eyes, use a hat, and so forth. Otherwise, you may find yourself up at the crack of dawn, as it is hard to darken a car completely.
No sleeping bag? Two blankets pinned together with safety pins are the next best thing. Or even sleeping under a pile of blankets.;
, A thin cloth (like a sheet or even a towel) hung in the windows keeps bugs out and lets air in. The weather is the most important thing to consider when in this situation. Hot weather can actually be worse than cold, as you could wake up in the morning feeling sticky, gross, and covered in mosquito bites. Try opening the windows just an inch or so to find a happy medium.


You can also buy mesh to place in your windows (or sunroof). Wire mesh can be scavenged from an old screen window or door, or screening can be bought at a hardware store.
Be careful of very hot temperatures in cars. Cars can heat up very quickly, and if you are in a very hot climate, such as a desert, this can be a real hazard. If you become overcome with heat, you may not wake up and realize you are close to dangerous dehydration and/or heat exhaustion.

, Try to think ahead, especially if you plan on spending more than one or two nights in your car. It will likely get dark out, and harder to find what you need before bedding down for the night. This likely means:


Water
Flashlight
Pillow (or pillow-like object), blanket or sleeping bag.
Cell phone: for emergencies, for a wake-up alarm, or a game to play.
Book: A little reading can make a dull night more pleasant.
Coffee can with lid (for men and women with excellent aim) in case you have to pee, it may be easier to do so with a coffee can than get up in the cold or bug-filled outdoors.
Hand sanitizer or baby wipes. Clean your hands before eating or after using the bathroom or any time hygiene is in doubt. Since you may have irregular access to running water, these toiletries can help prevent you from illness and keep you looking and smelling presentable.
If you are in the car with others or with cargo, you will likely be sleeping sitting up. Sleeping in the car seat is not exactly the best place to sleep, but if you have to, use a travel pillow that supports your head and neck. You will wake up in the morning much happier.

, A tidy car makes it easier to find things, especially at night. A clean car is a pleasure to sleep in and even a few inches often makes a great difference in your comfort. Also, if it is dirty and smelly, it will be much more difficult to fall asleep.


Keep only the essentials out, like a flashlight, water, a backpack for one set of clothes (unless you are traveling), and a towel.
A cleaner car also attracts less attention, especially if clean on the outside. Few people will think to ask questions of a car that looks presentable. A filthy car filled with trash and bags looks suspicious.
Avoid clutter by putting things away during the day. While you do not absolutely have to roll up your sleeping bag in the back seat or fold your towel, it will look tidier from the outside and thus less suspicious. This is especially important if you are trying to not be obvious about sleeping in your car.

, Tarps are inexpensive, usually easy to find, and will keep prying eyes away. A tarp can help cut down on sunlight while often also allow for ample ventilation.


Tarps on cars can look suspicious. Most people do not cover a car with a tarp, so this can point out a person sleeping in a car. In some places, this can be a problem, as described below.

, Unfortunately, sleeping in your car is illegal in many places, and even if not technically illegal will often be judged suspicious by the locals. Here are a few ideas:


Stores like Walmart, movie theaters or 24 hour gyms. It is hard to tell who is sleeping in their cars and who is just parked while shopping, watching a film or working out. The downside is that people will also be constantly in the area-- although this can be a form of security as well.. Also, many of these 24 hour stores also have bright lights on all night long.
Churches and other sanctuary-like establishments. Very often these buildings are quiet most of the week. If someone finds you, hopefully they will be kind enough to just continue on their merry way.
Backroads and under overpasses. These are low-volume areas where you may not be disturbed, but just make sure the area is actually quiet and remote. An apparently nearly deserted back road may actually be well-travelled by residents, who know who is supposed to be there and who is not. Also, rural roads may have trucks or farm equipment constantly moving through.
Residential areas that allow street parking. In this situation, your car will often just blend in on the side of the road. Just do not stay for too long or your vehicle may appear suspicious. Keep in mind that some urban residential areas may require special parking stickers to park legally. Also, street lights may become a problem for good sleeping.
Public overnight parking. If it is an overhead parking garage, park on a high floor so that noise from cars entering and exiting will not bother you. Make sure to check signs to make sure the time limit is long enough and the parking lot allows overnight parking.

, Many locations may be quiet and relatively safe one day, and not another.


Example: An empty parking lot next to a soccer field. During the middle of Friday night, no one is around, there are portable toilets, and it is seemingly perfect, but the next morning, there are a ton of screaming 7-year-olds ready for Little League and their mothers and fathers are peering suspiciously in the direction of your car.
Example: A quiet corner, not a person in sight, and it's dark enough to sleep. But when you awake the next morning you find that there are shady-looking individuals about who also like the isolation of the area.

, Consider two things:


Face your car in the direction where it would be most difficult for people to spy on you or look in the windows to see you there. Corners are good, too.
Face your car in the direction you want for the morning. Face it east if you want to wake with the sun and west if you want to stay snoozing.

, This is just good sense as you are likely going to have to use the bathroom at some point. If you can get easy access to a bathroom, you will have a better experience and keep more hygienic.


Be careful of safety, however. Bathrooms that are unattended are also sometimes locations for crime. A bathroom that is in a 24 hour store or interstate rest stop is likely safer than a public bathroom in an urban park - but not always.
Portable toilets are sometimes available at all hours. These are sometimes found at rest stops, construction sites, or parks.
You can sometimes get away with using facilities (such as the pool or beachside bathroom and shower) of a campground, hotel, or the like if security is a bit lax, and you are sneaky.
Gas stations usually offer public bathrooms.
You can always urinate outside if you must, but this can result in a public urination citation in populated areas.

, Showers and bathing may be tricky to find on the road, but not impossible.


In many areas, public beaches have showers.
Some truck stops have pay showers. While not free, they can be a great comfort on the road.
A ""solar shower"" is easy to find in most camping equipment stores. It is a bag that heats up water during the day, that can be used to shower or wash dishes at night. While such a device still needs a way to hoist the bag up high, and get some privacy, it can give a good shower when there is no running water.

, If you're worried you will be found, consider making it so your car can not really be seen. You can either do this with a tarp, by putting a whole bunch of goods in your car blocking you from view, or by sleeping underneath a pile of linens.

, Park your car in your spot for the night, and make a visit to the bathroom beforehand.

, Again, this depends on the climate you are in. However, it is going to get stuffy regardless of the temperature (within reason, of course), so consider cracking the window slightly. If you are under a pile of blankets in the cold, it might actually feel good.


Do not crack it too much, though, for security purposes. And if there are mosquitoes, crack it even less. A half an inch or less (1.25 cm) is plenty.

, If you have problems sleeping in less than perfect conditions or your body has a tendency to ""wake up"" achy, pop one before hitting the sack. It will be easier to fall asleep, easier to stay asleep, and you will feel less sore in the morning.

, As much as possible, that is. If you are in the back seat, move the front seats forward to get the most space possible. Tuck in the seat belt clips so they do not end up jabbing you in the back.


If the back seats turn down, do so. You could also pop open the back so you can put your legs (or head) in the trunk area.

, On the off chance someone comes knocking on your door, you want to be wearing clothes, and acceptable clothes at that. So get comfortable, but stay dressed. Workout clothes are best. This way you can also turn your bed into a getaway car at a moment's notice if need be.


And account for the weather, too. If it is cold, make sure your head is covered to keep heat from escaping. If necessary, put on several layers. If it is hot, a t-shirt and shorts will do just fine. You could also wet them beforehand to stay cool.

, The community your car is parked in may react to your presence, and how you look and act may well determine how you are treated. If you are considered suspicious, you may find yourself harassed or even jailed if you are not careful.

, People tend to be less concerned about strangers when they are friendly. Say hello to people, be polite, and a little confident chit-chat can go a long way to reassuring the locals.


In general, keep to yourself. Drawing too much attention to yourself is usually not a great idea. Car camping is often technically illegal, so you do not need to spotlight yourself.
If you have a particularly charismatic and outgoing personality, you may find yourself able to use your abilities to your advantage. You can find out information, ask favors, maybe even find a friend. But, of course, be careful as not every friendly stranger is safe.

, If you are dirty, scruffy, and dressed like a stereotypical ""bum"", this may draw the attention of the locals. Try to keep clean, dress in an unassuming manner, and look as though you are a respectable individual.

, If confronted by authorities, such as a police officer, store manager, park ranger, or concerned citizen, it is good to have a simple story about why you are there that is believable and not scary. It could well be true, or it may not be, depending on your situation. For example:


""My deepest apologies, I'm on my way to a rally in Washington, D.C. I feel very strongly about protecting the environment, you see. I don't have money for a hotel, so I was planning to sleep here for the night. I'm sorry if I worried you. I'll move right along.""
""I'm very sorry, I just lost my home and have nowhere to sleep until I get to my parents' home.""
""Sorry, sir. I pulled off of the road because I was falling asleep at the wheel. I've been driving for 10 hours. I'm OK, just wanted to be safe.""
""I'm sorry, officer - I'm getting away from an abusive relationship. I'm on my way to my sister's house in Alberta. I don't have any money for a hotel but I just had to get away from there as soon as I could.""
Be nice and polite to the police. Law enforcement officers may be there to enforce vagrancy laws, but they also really want to help people in need, too. Very often, they will offer help, leave you in peace, or at least let you be on your way without further trouble. Do not treat every police officer as you enemy; they are often helpful.

But do not depend on the local constable to be on your side, as not everyone will be. It is better to not get the attention of the police in the first place.

Check to see if you meet the qualifications.,
Complete the proper application form.,
Write a second passport request letter.",How to Add a Second Passport1," For the most part, United States citizens are allowed to have one valid passport. Under certain conditions, you may qualify for a second passport. You may obtain a second passport under the following conditions:Some countries may deny a passport if yours contains stamps from certain countries. If you need a visa to a country that may deny your current passport, you may qualify for a second passport.
If your travel visa has been delayed due a lengthy government process, you may qualify for a second passport if you need to travel immediately.
If you are on a trip and you are unable to continue traveling due to conditions beyond your control, you may qualify for a second passport.
Keep in mind there are no guarantees when it comes to passports. Even if you meet the above conditions, there is still a chance your application for a second passport will be denied.;
, There are two forms associated with the with applying for a second passport: the DS-11 Application Form and the DS-82 Application Form. Depending on your circumstances, you will fill out one or the other. You can download the form online at the US Passport Guide website found at http://www.uspassporthelpguide.com/..


When obtaining a second passport, the DS-11 Application Form would typically be used if your active passport has been lost or stolen.
The DS-82 is used if you're renewing your passport, or applying for a passport by mail. You can not use it to replace a lost or damaged passport.
Both forms can be downloaded online and then filled out. Use black ink and write legibly. If you're filling out the DS-11, you have to present the application to an agent at a passport acceptance facility prior to signing.

, A second passport request letter is required as you will need to explain your circumstances. You can type up a letter that briefly describes your need for a second passport. You should print your name after printing your letter, and also sign and date the letter.Address the letter to the U.S Department of State. Write something at the top of the letter like, ""Re: Second Passport.""
You do not need to provide more than a couple of paragraphs explaining your situation. You should also write that you that you will report it right away if either of your passports is lost or stolen. The Department of State wants to make sure you will follow legal regulations regarding your passport.

Include a photo and your current passport, if you have it.,
Pay all necessary fees.,
Package and send in your materials.",How to Add a Second Passport2," You should usually include your first passport with your application, if you have one. Obviously, a lost or stolen passport cannot be included in an application. You should also refrain from sending in very damaged passports. These materials should either be mailed in, if you're using the DS-82 form, or presented to a local government agency or passport acceptance facility.Make sure your photo meets standards or your passport could be significantly delayed. Photos should be 2 by 2 inches and taken within the last six months. They should be printed in color, and on matte or glossy photo paper. They should include your full face with a plain background. You must have a neutral expression.
Most drugstores will do passport photos for a small fee, and you can probably find passport photo services in your area by doing a quick google search. These places will make sure your photo meets standards.

, There are always fees associated with applying for a passport. Fees vary from person-to-person, depending on things like age, the reasons for applying, and how quickly you need your passport. Review your application carefully to make sure you pay all necessary fees. A failure to pay certain fees can result in your passport getting delayed.An application fee is generally required, which comes out at around $165. You also have to pay a fee of $135 for a passport book, and a $35 fee for a card.
Fees are not always consistent. You may have to pay more or less depending on your specific circumstances. Review your materials carefully and, if you have any questions, ask at a passport agency.
As you generally mail in documents, send a check or money order. Check with the passport agency in regards to payment, however. Agencies will have different preferences in regards to payment. Some may even allow you to pay online with a card.

, You can find a list of passport agencies online. You will send your materials in to an agency. If there is an agency near you, you can also bring your materials to the agency in person.Mail or turn in all your documents in the same envelope. A Tyvek envelope is recommended.
It can take several weeks to receive your second passport. If you need your passport sooner, see if you can find an expedited passport courier service in your area. You may be able to receive your passport as soon as 24 to 48 hours after submitting materials.

See if you are eligible for a foreign passport.,
Watch out for scams.,
Understand you're unlikely to get a diplomatic passport.",How to Add a Second Passport3," If you do not meet the qualifications for a second US passport, you may be eligible for a foreign passport. If you have citizenship in another country, you can get a passport from that country. You also may be able to get a passport from a foreign country if your spouse is a citizen., There are many organizations that offer to sell passports for foreign countries fraudulently, or offer to provide a second passport for a fee. When seeking out a passport, remember if it seems to good to be true, it probably is. You do not want to end up stuck in a foreign country with a phony passport.Gray market and black market passports should be avoided. Suppliers that claim they have a ""friend"" who can help you get a passport fast, without going through the legal steps required. These kinds of passports may be stolen or counterfeited.
Second passport should never be obtained through a business. Fill out government forms to receive your passport, and mail them in to a legitimate passport agency.

, Some companies claim they can sell you diplomatic passports, allowing you to become part of the diplomatic corps of another country. This is highly unlikely unless you meet very specific qualifications. A diplomatic passport is considered a high honor, and it cannot be bought from a company.

Enjoy the journey.",How to Quit Your Job and Go on a Road Trip," If you've been longing to get away and discover the beauty and wonder of both nature and people that are located right off your doorstep, stop waiting and start considering the possibility as a reality. Depending on your employer and the type of job you have, it might be possible to take extended leave instead of simply quitting your job. Alternatively, it really might be the right time to quit your job and to seek other opportunities as part of the road trip experience; after all, you never know who or what you're going to meet as part of your experience and new doors will definitely open for those who look


Consider asking for an extended leave of absence or perhaps arrange a sabbatical. While this can limit the length of your trip, it will also have the added benefit of potentially allowing you to carry health coverage through your employer, and having a job to return to when you get home. At least ask, all they can do is say no!;
, Doing much of your planning on the front end will allow your adventure to be much more stress-free and enjoyable. Allow at least a half year to a year to plan and save those dollars.


Set your budget and plan the length of your trip: These two go hand it hand. The longer you are gone, the more money you'll need. If you are planning to quit your job, you'll probably want to travel for at least 4 to 6 months to make it worthwhile.
Realistically, try to determine how much money you'll need each month while traveling. You need to include basic expenses such as food, gas, and nightly expenses, but also other expenses such as health care, auto/RV insurance, storage of personal items back home, credit card payments, an emergency fix-it fund for the rig, maybe even plane fare so you can travel home to see loved ones once or twice, especially in the event of an emergency, a new arrival, or a special anniversary or birthday.
If children are coming with you, you will need to consider their age needs and their educational needs (if relevant). You might need to homeschool as you travel – be sure to clear the requirements with your home state before leaving, as well as checking with your kids that this is going to work for them too.
Have health check-ups before setting off. If you need medications or ongoing check-ups, be sure to ask your doctor how this might be possible as you travel.
Decide whether your pets are going to be a part of your experience. This is much easier for dogs than cats; you may need to consider boarding or paid feeding options for pets unable to come with you. Sometimes family members can be a good option for caring for pets temporarily at their own homes. If you do take pets, ensure that they are properly registered and that their vaccinations are completely up-to-date.

Be sure that they can travel in safety with you; you may need to invest in special harnesses or crates.Bear in mind that having a pet can limit the places you stay, and the places you visit. RV parks and campgrounds may allow pets, but will not allow pets to be left unattended while you run errands or go on a day trip.Many national and state parks do not allow dogs, even on a leash. Also consider that your vehicle is now your home, and vehicle safety concerns now apply when your leave your pet 'home'. Remember never to leave your pet unattended in your vehicle in warm weather for any length of time.



, This is really a matter of personal preference. You can plan very specifically where you will go and when, or you can just generally plan the direction you would like to go and play it by ear. The latter approach allows you the advantage of discovering unexpected destinations and staying to explore, and that's what the trip is all about, right? Not being obliged to be at one destination by a certain time also allows you to relax a lot more.


If planning to cross over to Canada or Mexico, be sure to have your passport and all vehicle registration papers with you. Know what you can take across the border both ways – ask customs officials if you're not sure.
Ideas for places to visit along the way:

, Car travel is an option, using camping equipment or motels at night. While this option will likely save you a significant amount of money on gas, other daily tasks can prove to be much more difficult. Storage, organization, cooking, keeping food cold, exposure to the elements, general comfort level, etc., may prove to be a hindrance. For the purposes of this article, we will assume you will be choosing a recreational vehicle (RV). There are several types of RV's to choose from, and your choice depends on your budget, comfort level requirements, and personal interests. Some of the options include: a van, a motor home, a trailer, or a 5th-Wheel. Choosing or buying an RV can be a guide all by itself, but some main things to consider when selecting an RV include:


Resale value: If you'll be buying a rig just for the trip, consider the resale value as a topmost concern. Some RV makes tend to hold their values well, others not so much. Do your research with care and ask other RV owners what their preferred choices are.
Weight: Take time to learn about weight ratings such as GVWR or CCC. Slides are nice, but can add unsafe weight.
Storage: Consider the available space for both personal items, fresh water, waste tanks, propane, food, etc. Typically, motor homes and 5th wheels have more storage capacity than travel trailers or vans. If you're taking along a lot of sporting, expedition, hobby, or camping equipment, bear this in mind.
Size: Bigger is not always better. Get something practical and comfortable, but avoid bigger unless it's absolutely essential. Bigger can be more expensive to move around and you may be limited to only certain campgrounds by having too large an RV. When traveling a long time, it can be helpful to err on the side of being able to get around more easily and squeeze into smaller spaces; it'll take you a lot farther.
Power: Will you need a generator, solar, or will you be plugging in every night?
Towing: If you go with a motor home, you may want to consider towing another vehicle behind you (toad). Having an everyday driver can be great, because you won't have to pack up the entire RV just to run to the grocery store or maneuver up those windy roads for a day hike. But there are special considerations, and some states require auxiliary braking in the ""toad"", so be sure to research the regulations before contemplating this add-on.

, Start looking now so that you can familiarize yourself with market trends and relative prices and conditions of RVs.


Learn how to inspect an RV, and what types of questions to ask of the seller.
Arrange financing with your bank, and expect that you will only be able to finance about 80 percent of the Blue Book value of the RV. You'll likely need to come up with 20 percent down payment.
Be cautious of dealers; you'll probably find the best deals as private party sales. If you do want to buy from a dealer - go to the dealer with your own financing in hand, and know your stuff inside out.
Read Know what to look for when buying a Used RV, How to use a Guide to buy a Used RV, How to buy foreclosed RVs, and How to buy a used motor home for more details.

, Once you've determined how much you'll need to save, you can start concurrently putting money away into a savings account and reducing your spending at home. Living on the road is a frugal experience, and you'll likely need to change your spending habits. Starting now allows you to save more, and gets you used to spending less. If you're able, try to pay down any outstanding debt, especially credit cards, car payments, hire purchase, etc.

, Take only what you need or love. Once you've packed up the RV - take at least a quarter of it out of the RV and leave it at home. This trip isn't about the stuff you have; it's about the stuff you haven't seen. So pack light - all your goodies will be waiting for you when you get home. If you need something later on that you've left behind, you can either buy it new, or ask someone from home to ship it to you.


What to do with your home while you are away? For some, it may be as easy as ending the lease on an apartment, or bravely selling your home prior to the trip. However, if you own a home and plan on keeping it, planning how to care for it in your absence may become more complex. It's important to have your home cared for while you are gone. Some options include having family members or trusted people house sit for you while you're away; rent out the property through an agency; have the neighbors check in regularly and perhaps pay a gardener to tend to the garden; shut the house up (similar to winterizing) but only if you can be sure that leaving your house unattended is a safe and secure thing to do.

, Nothing will shorten your trip faster than spending more than you saved. So long as you stick your budget and have some money set aside for emergency repairs, your travels should be pretty worry free.


Have a splurge night now and then so that you don't feel deprived. Build the occasional restaurant meal or cinema visit into the budget.

, Keep a record of where you have been in a journal, scrapbook, online blog, etc. – whatever works best for you. You're likely to visit a lot of places and it's easy to forget some of the experiences without memory prompts. Take lots of photos and store them carefully on your computer or online and share them with family and friends too. And make the most of your contacts; you never know what might be about to turn up next in your life!

,How to Pack for a Trip1,
"
Make a checklist of every item you plan to take on your trip.,
Plan your outfits ahead of time to avoid over-packing.,
Buy travel-size containers for your toiletries, regardless of the length of your trip.,
If you will be going through customs, check your luggage prior to packing.,
Place heavy items at the bottom of your bag, especially if it is an upright model.,
Pack clothing using the time-honored ""roll"" technique.,
Pack sweaters, jackets, and underwear in reusable compression bags, which can create up to 75% more space in your luggage.,
Place breakable items, like jewelry or glass, wrapped in socks and tucked into shoes inside your luggage.,
Buy wide clip rings.,
Bring snacks in case you get hungry.,
Bring entertainment in case you get bored.,
Remember that trips are meant for fun and rest, not stress!",How to Pack for a Trip2," This will include clothing, shoes, toiletries, and paperwork and possibly also maps, guidebooks, reading material, and hotel or rental car information. This checklist will also help you when packing for the trip back home as you will have a list of everything that you brought with you.



Commonly forgotten items include toothbrush/toothpaste, socks, sunglasses, sunscreen, hat, pajamas, razor, and deodorant.

Never underestimate how quickly your space will fill up. Will you really need five pairs of shoes for three nights? And four coats? Consider the weather and what kinds of activities you will be doing. You might want to visit www.weatherchannel.com to check out how the weather will be at your destination.

, If you have a decent sense of what the weather will be like, you can be very precise. If not, bring versatile items (ex. a cardigan or light jacket that goes with several of your tops, some three-quarter-sleeve shirts, jeans that look good rolled up at the bottoms) that will allow you to adapt to changing conditions. As much as possible, bring items you can get away with re-wearing. Layering is a good way to not only disguise re-worn items but also deal with changing weather.



Stretch your travel wardrobe by color-matching. If you make sure every piece of clothing you pack works with many other pieces, you can create a host of mix-and-match possibilities.

Bring empty plastic bags for dirty items. If you won’t have an opportunity to wash your clothes, tucking them away in a separate bag will keep you from having to mingle the clean with the dirty or sort through your stuff every time you want to change.

, This includes your toothbrush, toothpaste, deodorant, etc. Unless you will be in a remote location for weeks, you can always drop into a local shop to restock your supply of soap and toothpaste. If you will be flying, there might also be restrictions on the amount of liquid or gel you can bring on the plane, meaning you may find yourself forced to choose between shampoo and toothpaste while going through airport security. Go to the airline's website to check out the guidelines.



Put all your toiletries in a secure bag. You definitely do not want an explosion or a leak in your luggage! Oh, and again, these should be in travel sizes.

If you will be staying at a hotel after your arrival, you can completely skip the shampoo and conditioner and simply use what the hotel provides. (You can buy other necessities at the destination such as toothpaste.)

, Ensure that it is completely empty (especially if the luggage is not yours), because as soon as you're in security check, no one is responsible for its contents except you. Usually, suitcases have hidden zippers along the center or side. Open these and give it a good once-over. It is better to be safe than sorry.



If you will be crossing borders, consider using tamper-evident products to seal your case so you can check if your luggage arrives without being breached before you go on to clear customs.

, Struggling with a rolling luggage that twists and flips in every gentle turn and falls over when you let it go is no way to move around.



As you pack your luggage, check items off your list. Be thorough; you don’t want to have to dismantle your entire bag in a panic to find out whether or not you’ve taken care of something.

, Lay two or three items on top of one another, smooth to flatten, and roll them up like you would a sleeping bag to save space and prevent wrinkles. For added wrinkle insurance, place a sheet of heavy tissue or packing paper between items of clothing before rolling. Don't worry about wrinkle-prone garments; most hotel/motel/inn rooms have an iron and board in the closet for your needs, not to mention a hotel laundry service.

, These lock in odors, so they also work for storing dirty laundry. Compression bags work very well. Ziploc sells these. What you have to do is place the item inside, close the bag, and put the included air pump over a little one-way hole. Suck out the air with the pump. It's that easy.

, This ensures ultimate safety.

, Available at major supermarkets like Target or Walmart, these look like shower curtain rings, and can be opened and then clipped onto something to connect it. Clip important things like the passport baggie onto your handbag or carry-on and clip that to your suitcase. Big bulky bags that you must let go of while tending to other concerns are an obvious target for thieves. Keep paperwork, identification, money, and expensive items slung over your shoulder or even hidden on your body (you can buy under-clothing pouches for slim items) depending on the safety of the location. However, don’t hide anything you will need immediately.

, Bring light snacks for quick trips or places where you can purchase meals and heartier ones for long bus/plane/train/car rides. If you have allergies or conditions that call for certain foods (e.g. gluten-free or nut-free) and won’t have many options while traveling (planes that offer meals usually cater to this), bring more filling snacks.

, Diaries (and pens), travel-size games, decks of cards, books, and mobile devices are huge boredom-killers during long rides.

, Don't fret too much over organizing and planning. If it gets too stressing for you, have a traveling agency plan your voyage. Sites like tripadvisor.com or seatguru.com can help you find reviews of places, hotels, restaurants, and airlines as well as good seats and hot deals.

"
Know which items not to bring on a plane.,
Separate liquids from the rest of your carry-on.,
Avoid checking in luggage if possible.,
Consider getting a TSA-approved laptop bag.,
Keep your most important items in your smallest bag.",How to Pack for a Trip3," This applies to safety, size, weight, and even food, as there are restrictions on all of these.


Safety restrictions vary between countries but include obvious safety hazards (knives in your carry-on, flammable liquids in any of your luggage), not-so-obvious hazards (nail clippers or files in your carry-on), and a few seemingly inexplicable items (an unopened bottle of water on US flights – unless you purchased it after going through security).
Weight and size restrictions depend on the airline, so check their website ahead of time for more information. Most medium duffel bags and hand luggage marketed as carry-on will be accepted into the cabin.
Avoid bringing peanuts on planes. These can cause allergic reactions in other passengers.
If crossing international borders, don’t bring agricultural items (fruits, vegetables, seeds), meats, or dairy products. Though you may be able to get away with it in some countries, many regulate these items to reduce the spread of nonnative species and disease.

, Liquids should be easily accessible so that you can remove them for inspection while going through security. In the US, there are very specific liquid and gel allowances:


You are allowed to bring a maximum of 3.4 ounces of a liquid/gel per container (not total). For example, a 2-ounce bottle of shampoo, a 2-ounce bottle of toothpaste, and a 3.4-ounce bottle of face wash would be okay.
All individual containers of liquid must be placed together inside a resealable 1-quart bag (provided for you if necessary as you move through the security line). Before you and your luggage go through the scanners, you will have to place the bag of liquids by itself on the luggage conveyor belt so that it can be inspected if necessary.
To circumvent the hassle of packing and storing liquids separately, bring solid toiletries (ex. solid deodorant, powder concealer, etc.). You can also put liquids in your carry-on bag.
Liquid allowances don’t usually apply to prescription medication (provided that you have documentation with you to verify), infant formula, breast milk, or the like. Just be sure to store these separately from your other liquids and inform an agent that you have them.

, Many airlines pad their bank accounts by charging passengers for check-in luggage. Even if you don’t mind the extra expense, waiting for check-in luggage to be processed and redistributed after arrival can add another half hour or more to your airport experience – and occasionally, bags that don’t make the flight must be sent to you at a much later date. If you are traveling with kids, make sure each one carries the maximum amount of luggage allowed (if possible) so that, as a group, you can bring more items into the cabin. Wear your heaviest clothing (such as jeans, running shoes/tennis shoes, sweatshirt) while traveling to save on space. Consider replacing your jeans with light-weight travel pants which take less space and dry quickly.

, If you are flying in or through the US and your laptop is inside your bag together with other items, you will be asked to remove it before your things are X-rayed, which can slow down the line and create a mess if not properly organized. If you’re still luggage-hunting, you might want to get a bag designed to avoid this process (usually consisting of a laptop flap that folds away from the rest of the bag so that the laptop can be X-rayed by itself without technically being removed).

, Most airlines allow one small and one medium piece of carry-on so that people are still able to bring things purses and diaper bags. Since you will most likely be stowing the larger of the two bags in the overhead bin, avoid putting things you will want during the flight (ex. a sweater, book, or snack) up there or you will have to stand in the aisle and dig through it mid-flight.

"
"
Distribute heavy items evenly between bags.,
Keep valuables on your person.,
Make sure the train offers snacks before deciding not to pack any.",How to Pack for a Trip4," Most trains have huge luggage allowances, making them a great alternative to planes in some situations. Like on planes, these items are often stored in overhead bins, but since you may be dealing with full-sized luggage instead of little bags, lifting them up and getting them back down can be tricky. Make sure you don’t have any one bag that feels like a ton of bricks or you may find yourself stuck in the aisle with shaky knees and a bag over your head asking strangers to bail you out.

, Stowing luggage in the overhead bin might make you feel so much like you’re on a plane that you decide it’s safe to put important items there, but remember that your stuff won’t be monitored by attendants and that passengers get on and off trains all the time. Carry your valuables with you at all times, especially if you plan to stretch your legs, get snacks, or nap.

, Most trains do (or stop at places where either vendors come aboard with food or you can quickly pop out and get some), but if you’re traveling in a country where you aren’t as familiar with the customs or train protocol, make sure you don’t find yourself on a 18-hour overnighter without a scrap of food or drink.

Pick the right bag.,
Make a list of everything you will need to bring.,
Consider packing for a bad layover.,
Make sure all of your electronics and delicate items are protected.,
Pack your liquids correctly.,
Pack your necessities in easy to access locations.,
Pack in some boredom-busting entertainment.,
Wear warm clothes on the plane.",How to Pack Your Carry on Bag1," Make sure it's durable, easy to carry, and that it can hold all of your necessary items. More importantly, make sure it meets your airline’s size requirements. Check your airlines FAQ to see the measurements of the largest bag you can bring. If you fly multiple different airlines, check the ones you fly most frequently and choose a size bag that will satisfy all the airlines requirements. A good way to tell if it will work or not is to consider whether or not it will fit in or under the plane seat in front of you.The Vacation Carry-On: The ideal carry on bag is one that has a large body with a lot of pockets. Pockets are fantastic for keeping all of your stuff separate--one pocket for wallet/phone, one for makeup, one for your book, etc. Large purses, messenger bags, or satchels are all great options that give you a lot of space to store your stuff, and generally have great pockets.
The Business Carry-On: As you might have guessed, a briefcase is a really good carry on for the working man or woman. Find one that can be slung over your shoulder in case you need to make a run for your flight. Briefcases that have built-in organizers and a pocket for your wallet/phone/keys/other necessities are great options.
The Kid/Teenager/College student Carry-On: Think, backpack. Backpacks are fantastic for holding laptops, school books, last minute exam cramming notes, and toys. Because of the zippers, it also ensures that all of your stuff stays in one place so you won’t lose your Game Boy or that super important notebook.;
, It's best to begin with the bare essentials, then move on to the entertainment or work items. These bare essentials include your license or passport (depending on whether you are flying domestic or international), your wallet with money or credit cards in it, your phone, and medications you might need, and of course, your plane tickets. Other items to consider packing include:Work or school items: this could include your laptop, your phone and laptop chargers, business notes, class notes, homework, reading that you have to do for class, etc.
Entertainment: books, headphones and an iPod, your camera, game consoles, DVDs to watch on your laptop, magazines, a travel book for where you are going, toys, etc.
Medications and toiletries: It's best to keep any medications you need with you on the plane. You could also consider bringing an extra pair of contact lenses, mouth wash, etc.
Stuff to help you sleep: This includes a neck pillow, eye mask, ear plugs, etc. Inflatable neck pillows are the best because they take up very little space when deflated.

, If you get stranded overnight during your layover, or if your other luggage gets lost (pray that it doesn't) you might want to consider bringing a couple of items with you on the plane. You might want to put these items in their own small bag within your carry on bag. These items include:


A toothbrush and toothpaste, a comb or hairbrush, a fresh pair of underwear, socks, and deodorant.

, Carry-ons have a tendency to get knocked into a lot, so safe-proofing your valuables is generally a good idea. If you are bringing your laptop or tablet, make sure you have a good safety cover for it.

, Remember that most liquids are not allowed through security. You will need to pack your liquid items in one quart-sized, clear, plastic, zip-top bag. Each passenger is allowed one of these clear quart-sized bags. In the bag, your liquids are limited to 3.4 ounce bottles so don’t plan on bringing that gigantic bottle of sunscreen.You can either pack your larger bottles in a suitcase that you check, or buy the liquid items that you need when you reach your destination. Purchase bottled water and drinks after you pass through security.

, You will need to be showing your license and tickets at least twice while traveling, so it's important to keep them in a spot where you can get at them easily. Pack your essentials first but do not put them at the bottom of your bag.


When packing your laptop keep it easily accessible so you can easily reach it when you have to go through security. The majority of the time you will have to remove your laptop from your carry on to get it scanned. This also goes for your plastic bag of toiletries, if you choose to bring one.

, Once you have packed your essentials, put your entertainment items into your bag. Putting them in last ensures that the stuff you actually need fits into your bag. Don’t overstuff your bag--you don’t want to be lugging around a 25 pound bag. Make sure that your bag zips (if it has a zipper) so that you know none of your stuff will fall out.



Research your airline. Some planes have built-in entertainment systems, some have in-flight movies, and some even serve meals. Pack your boredom-busting items accordingly.

, Wearing a sweatshirt or jacket is always a good idea on a plane, as they tend to keep the temperature of planes at what seems to be freezing. If worst comes to worst, you can always tie your jacket or sweatshirt to your carry on bag (or around your waist)."

.,
Obey all traffic signs.,
Yield.,
Enter the rotary.,
Once in the rotary, maintain your right-of-way.,
Continue around the rotary, watching for the road you wish to exit upon.",How to Drive in a Rotary,"]]Understand the purpose of the rotary and how it works. A rotary is a one way circular roadway that connects other roads similar to the way spokes of a wheel connect to a center or hub. Rotaries allow access to any road from any road generally without the use of traffic control lights. Common in Europe and New England, a rotary might be found at some intersections of 4 or more roads (see photo at right), but are sometimes placed in the middle of a roadway solely to calm traffic. Most of the time, rotaries are used when traffic patterns are complex due to number of streets converging or due to size of the area such as where entrance and exit ramps from both directions of an elevated highway connect to a smaller roadway below (see lower photo at right).;
, It's not unusual even for local residents to roll through stop signs while attempting to merge with rotary traffic. This is often because drivers are too focused on the complexity of the intersection and sheer volume of traffic than signs. Fortunately, the vehicular traffic should be coming from just one direction.

, Many states have laws that require vehicles not yet in the rotary to yield to the traffic already in the rotary. Do not force rotary traffic to stop or to perform evasive maneuvers while attempting to merge. Merge into rotary traffic with the same principles employed at the end of highway entrance ramps, but at much slower speeds.

, After locating a safe break in traffic or at an oncoming driver's invitation, merge into rotary traffic. Rotary traffic in the U.S. is always in a counter-clockwise direction. This means a right turn will be required to enter and to leave the rotary.

, All usual precautions should apply (e.g., don't get into a show-down over anything), but yielding your right-of-way to those trying to enter is to significantly disrupt the flow of rotary traffic.

,


Know which road to take to get out of the rotary traffic. This can be from your understanding of the area from prior experience, a map or GPS, a passenger or even an additional trip around the rotary if necessary.
Stay in or navigate to the outside (right-most in the U.S.) lane of the rotary traffic to make your exit. If there are double-lane exits, DO NOT travel in the right-most lane unless you plan on exiting at the next exit; to travel past a double-lane exit in the right lane may dangerously cut-off those in a left lane who wish to (legitimately) make that exit. There are no left turn exits from a rotary that has a counter-clockwise traffic pattern.
If you miss your exit road from the rotary, do not stop. Continue around until the road appears again (no one will know you missed your turn - unless they too, have missed theirs). This can easily happen to anyone unfamiliar with the layout of the roads that connect to the rotary, especially if not traveling in the outside lane of the traffic.

"
Choose your bag wisely.,
Lay out all of the clothes you want to bring.,
Plan out your toiletries.,
Plan your travel outfit before you put everything into your suitcase.,
Pack your entertainment, electronics, and other smaller items into your carry-on bag (rather than your suitcase).,
Employ a stellar packing technique.",How to Pack Your Carry on Bag2," While each airline has its own rules regarding the size of your carry-on suitcase, most airlines follow a rough guideline that is 45 linear inches (14 x 9 x 22 inches). However, if you can find a carry-on suitcase that is 20 inches (50.8 cm) long, you will be good to go--almost every airline deems that the perfect size for the overhead compartment. Check your airline’s website for the specific requirements of that airline.You should also look for a suitcase that only has two wheels, because four-wheelers have a tendency to roll all over the place (especially if you let go of them while on the bus transporting you to your flight)., Once you have laid them out, reduce the amount by half. Think lightweight, since you’ll be packing all of your stuff into a tiny suitcase. Do you really need twelve pairs of pants and eighteen shirts? Chances are, you probably don’t. Only pack what you really need. Also aim for lighter materials that you can layer. Denim is heavier than other materials like cotton so consider the weight of your clothes when packing.


Coordinate the colors of your outfits. This will help you to stretch the clothes you bring into more outfits. Remember that black goes with everything.
If you are really having trouble limiting the amount of clothing you are bringing, try following this rule: shirts get worn for two days each and pants or shorts get worn for three days each. Apply this rule to the clothes you have laid out and see if that reduces the amount at all.

, Because you have a carry-on, you will most likely be limited to the standard one-quart, plastic, resealable bag of toiletries for your liquid items. You can also bring a bag for dry items like makeup, deodorant, etc. For larger liquid items, consider buying these when you get to your destination, or use the free ones that you get at hotels and motels.

, You should wear your heaviest items on the plane so that you don’t have to stuff them into your carry-on. Wear your jeans and jacket or sweatshirt, as well as your heaviest shoes, so that you have more space for other items in your carry-on., After all, you are allowed two carry-ons, one that gets stored in the overhead compartment (your suitcase), and one (your bag) that gets stored under your seat. See Method One for tips on how to properly pack your carry-on bag for the flight.

, There are many different ways to pack efficiently. Use one method, or try a combination. Make sure to keep anything you will need to take out for security (like your toiletries) right at the top. Some of these techniques include:


The Rolling Method: Roll, roll, roll your pants into a little tube! Rolling your clothes up into tubes is a great way to save space, particularly when compared to folding all of your clothes. It also does less wrinkle damage.Use compression bags. These bags can be purchased at most everything-stores like Target, Bed Bath and Beyond, etc. Stuff your clothes into these bags, zip them up, and then squeeze them so that all the air gets removed. You will be shocked by how tiny these bags filled with clothes can get.
Stuff things into every nook and cranny. Stuff your socks in to shoes, dresses into nooks and crannies--anything you can fit. It won’t be the most organized carry-on, but you will definitely have everything you need."

Adjust your packing needs accordingly. Pack more or less of all of the essentials depending on where you’re headed. Are you going to the beach for several days? Double check that you have all your swimming essentials.
Are you heading to Disney World? Be ready for lots of walking with comfortable shoes and breathable clothing.
Are you seeing a show in the evenings? You may need something fancy.
Are you spending a lot of time in business meetings? Be prepared with business wear and a jacket or sweater if you’ll be sitting in the A/C.;
, Even though it’s the “Sunshine State,” the weather in Florida fluctuates a bit with the seasons. Your packing needs will vary greatly from month to month. As a general guide:


The average high in Florida in February is in the high 60s, and the average low is in the low 40s.
The average high in Florida in July is in the low 90s, and the average low is in the low 70s.
Don’t forget to make note of the precipitation forecast as well.

, If you’re staying with friends or in a rental house, you may have access to a washer and dryer. If that’s the case, and if you are willing to repeat outfits, you may be able to dramatically cut down on the amount of clothes you’re bringing.

, Include tank tops, short sleeve shirts, shorts, and dresses. Particularly if you’re going to be spending a lot time outside, choose fabrics that breathe well, such as cotton or linen. Avoid polyester and rayon in the summer.Sunglasses and hats are a must, and you'll want lots of sunscreen. If you were only able to pack a 3.4 oz container of sunscreen, be prepared to buy more when you get there. You may also want to consider some aloe or lotion in case you get burned.

, Summer in Florida is hot! Odds are good your hotel will have a pool, and if it doesn’t, Florida is a peninsula, so there are beaches everywhere. If you’re planning to spend any time in the water at all, pack all your swimming gear. You’ll probably want several swimsuits. Even if you’re only staying a few days, it’s a good idea to pack at least 2 swimsuits so that they have time to dry in between wearing. (Florida is quite humid in the summer, so it could take a while.)
Remember your flip flops and sandals. If you’re going to be in and out of the pool or at the beach, flip flops or sandals will be very helpful. (If you’re going to be walking around a lot in addition to swimming, be sure to bring a pair that give you plenty of support, such as the kind designed for hiking and other outdoor activities.) You may want to consider sandals with sturdy straps if you’re going to be doing any water activities like canoeing or kayaking. Pack a beach towel. If you’re going to a hotel, you won’t need other linens, but a large beach towel is a must, because they won’t supply those. If you’re going to be spending time at the pool instead of the beach, check to see if your hotel supplies poolside towels.

, If you’re headed for touristy destinations like Disney World, you will probably be on your feet a lot. Pack tennis shoes and thick socks to prevent blisters. (You could also think about a pair of athletic sandals if you’re afraid tennis shoes and socks will be too hot, but be sure to wear something you’ve already broken in so you they don’t rub.), Even though you are unlikely to need this outside in the Florida summer, almost every place you go will be air conditioned indoors. Pack something light to keep the chills away inside.

, If you anticipate going out to dinner, you may want to bring something a bit dressier. In most tourist destinations, you don’t need an evening gown or tux - just a nice dress or a button-down shirt should be fine.You may want to double check that none of your destinations have a dress code. If so, you may need a jacket and tie or a nicer dress.
If you’re traveling for business, you may also need business or business casual attire, so adjust accordingly.

, Assess the activities you’re planning for your trip very carefully. Winter clothing will take up quite a bit more room than summer clothing, of course, so you’ll need to strategize based on what you’ll be doing.


Don't forget a medium-weight jacket. Even though Florida has a generally warm climate, the lows in the winter average in the 40s, so you’ll need a jacket in the evenings and early mornings.
Throw in a scarf and a hat if you’re particularly cold-natured. You probably won’t need gloves, but they can’t hurt.
Pack layers that you can wear more than once if possible. For example, a neutral colored sweater that matches several outfits will help a lot.

, With an average low in the 40s in midwinter, Florida can get quite chilly. You probably don’t need your bulkiest sweaters, but you can’t go amiss with a pair of jeans and a few long sleeve t-shirts.

, Particularly if you’re going to be doing any activities that involve a lot of walking, you may get a bit warm in long sleeves, even in the winter. You probably won’t need any shorts unless you’re going to be very far South, since the average winter high is 60 degrees, but if you’re a hot-natured person, you could consider bringing a pair., Depending on where you’re going in Florida, odds are pretty good that you’ll encounter at least one downpour. Most cities there get between 90 and 140 days of rain per year. You will probably want an umbrella or light raincoat. Take a close look at the forecast to decide if galoshes will be worth the space they take up., If you’re flying, decide whether you are checking bags or just bringing carry-ons. If you’re driving, you’ll likely have a bit more space to pack extra items, depending on how many people you’re sharing your car with.Check the regulations from the airline you’re flying with regarding size and weight requirements for both checked baggage and carry-ons.
Most airlines will let you bring a small carry-on suitcase or overnight bag plus a personal item such as a purse, backpack, or laptop case. (A backpack is usually a good option if you’re going to be doing many touristy activities.)

, You’ll need a picture ID with your birthday on it in order to fly, rent a car, or buy alcohol. It’s also a good idea to leave a copy of your photo ID with a friend or family member in case you lose yours while you are travelling. , If you have an ATM card and a credit card, it’s a good idea to bring both. You should also bring some cash for tipping, vending machines, and parking. Pack different forms of payment in different places (one in your purse or backpack, another in your suitcase, another on your person) in case you lose your luggage. , If you have AAA or belong to some sort of frequent flyer club, don't forget to bring the proof. You should also bring up-to-date insurance cards for yourself and anyone else in your family in case of emergency. If you’re driving your own car or renting, bring auto insurance information as well.You may want to bring phone numbers for your travel and insurance agents as well.

, No matter what season you’re traveling to Florida, the toiletries you need are likely to be pretty similar. Put liquids in 3.4 oz (100 ml) containers and put the containers in a 1 quart bag. If you’re flying and not planning to check your baggage, you will have to put all of your liquids in small containers in order to get them through security. You can usually pick up travel-sized bottles of toiletries in the drug store. Depending on your personal needs, don’t forget


shampoo
conditioner
razor
shaving cream
aftershave
toothbrush
toothpaste
lotion or moisturizer
tampons and/or pads
makeup
sunscreen
soap
prescription medicines
over-the-counter medicines you take often (such as pain relievers, vitamins, or antacids)

, As a general rule, pack enough underwear for every day of your visit plus 1-2 extra pairs. If you wear bras, don’t forget those and, if you’ll be active, remember sports bras. If you wear undershirts or camis, you will probably want a fresh one every day if it’s warm, but you can likely get away with wearing an undershirt twice in the winter. , You can probably get away with about 1-2 sets of pjs per week if you’re not a particularly sweaty sleeper. If you tend to lounge around in your pjs in the evenings or mornings, you may want to bring an extra set or include some sweats or gym shorts and t-shirts.

, Particularly if you have limited packing space, it’s a good idea to pack a variety of clothes that you can mix and match. In particular, this will help limit the number of shoes you have to bring to match your outfits, which will free up quite a bit of space. For example, many people find that it works well to bring a lot of black clothing and just a few pops of color.
If you’re packing for summer in Florida, consider using beige or light brown as your color scheme. Pack a few brightly colored tank tops, headbands, or other small items to brighten up your vacation wardrobe.

, If you’re bringing a laptop, cellphone, or tablet, pack all of the accompanying chargers. If you’re driving, you may want to consider chargers that plug into your vehicle.


You may want to consider a charger that works on multiple devices if possible. Many of them come with multiple prongs so that you can charge more than one device at a time.
Load your electronics with movies and games for entertainment if you’re travelling with little ones. (Or maybe even if you’re not!)
If you’re planning to take lots of pictures, be sure to bring a cord to transfer them to your computer in case you run out of space on your phone or camera.

Check traffic reports before you go.,
Put your GPS to work.,
Use traffic apps.,
Don’t fear the HOV lane.,
Learn several ways to reach your destination.",How to Avoid Traffic Jams1," Local television news programs often give morning and afternoon traffic reports to help commuters. Some locations also have dedicated traffic radio. Tune into these before you get in the car. If it sounds like traffic is backed up on your normal route, take one of your alternatives., Many GPS systems have built-in traffic flow monitoring. These can alert you when a route is clogged by a traffic jam. Some can even automatically automatically change your route to a clear one. Check the instructions for your model to see what capabilities it has, and how to set up the traffic monitoring features., The navigation tools built into most smartphones have the ability to detect traffic problems, much like dedicated GPS devices. There are also apps like Waze that you can install and use to help avoid traffic jams.Traffic apps may have special features like real time camera feeds to view traffic conditions, or social features to help you connect with other drivers and learn about various routes.
If you just your phone to help avoid traffic jams, be sure not to check it while you are actually driving.

, Cities that have freeways often devote one of the lanes to High Occupancy Vehicles (HOVs), or ones that have at least two people riding in them (including the driver). These almost always have fewer cars, which means less congestion. Give the HOV lane a chance and see if it helps you avoid jams., Most destinations in busy locations can be reached in several ways. Before you go, look up several routes, including the fastest, the shortest, and alternatives that may take you down side streets. You can take one of the alternatives if you expect a traffic jam, saving you time and headache.Use maps or apps to research possible routes.
You can also ask other people which routes they take to avoid traffic congestion.

Avoid rush hour.,
Ask to change your work shift.,
Make the most of public transportation.,
Enjoy the freedom of two feet or wheels.",How to Avoid Traffic Jams2," The early morning and late afternoon hours are the worst traffic times in most locations, because that is when most people are on the road going too and from work and school. If at all possible, avoid driving during these times. Leaving just a little bi earlier or later can help you steer clear of bumper-to-bumper traffic..

, If you work during the day and have to drive, you still might be able to avoid rush hour. Ask your supervisor if you can change your work shift so that you come in and leave earlier and later to beat traffic.


A more involved change is to work from home, but some employers are open to this idea. Even if you can work from home only one day a week, that means a little less time spent stuck in traffic jams.

, There are real benefits to public transportation, including decreased traffic overall. For you as an individual, it can be a solution for avoiding traffic jams. Modes like rail and subways bypass roads altogether. Even bus routes are usually planned to get people where they need to go efficiently. Sit back, relax, and let someone else do the driving!, If you only have to go a fairly short distance, try not to drive at all. If it’s a walkable distance, there’s no need to get stuck behind the wheel. You can also try biking, especially if there are dedicated bike lanes in your area. This can be more direct and enjoyable that driving.Walking and biking can also be great choices for your health.
In some locations, motorcycles and scooters are allowed to drive between lanes of traffic. If this is allowed in your area, this can be another option for escaping a traffic jam.

, You will need to submit information about your trip when you apply. Therefore, go ahead and plan your trip, booking flights and hotels.

, As you plan your trip, keep documentation of your trip. You will need to submit that documentation as proof of where and why you're traveling to a country in the Schengen area.

, With this visa, you are allowed to be in the Schengen area for up to 3 months, spread out over a 6 month period. Make sure your trip does not exceed this time period.

, In most countries, you cannot apply earlier than 3 months in advance of your trip. Even if you plan far ahead, you have to wait for the visa application. It's a good idea to buy travel insurance, just in case your visa does not get approved, and you must cancel your trip.

, You apply for a travel visa as you normally would. However, you do not have to apply for visas for each country, as long as you stay in the Schengen area., You only need a Schengen Visa if you are not one of the approved countries. You can use an inquiry tool, such as the one The Netherlands has on their visa website, to see if you need one.


For instance, United States citizens do not need a visa to enter this area, as long as they have a blue passport. They can stay up to 3 months.Nonetheless, you should still check the passport requirements for the country you are visiting. For instance, your passport may need to be valid for 6 months out from your date of entry.However, a whole list of countries do not have this benefit, such as Russia, Bahrain, Thailand, Saudi Arabia, Cambodia, Turkey, Yemen, and Zimbabwe.

, The first method you should use is to choose the country where you will spend the most time. So if you're planning to spend 10 days in Germany and 5 days in France, you'd apply with Germany. If you are staying an equal amount of time in every country, choose the one you're going to first. , Though you can leave and come back within the 6 month period, you should check to see if your whole trip falls within the boundaries of the Schengen area. If it does not, you may need to apply for a visa in the other countries you're visiting., The Schengen Visa application form is the same in every country. However, you should be able to download it from the government website of the country you are applying for the visa in. Therefore, if you plan to apply in France, you can download it from France's government website., You will need basic biographical information, such as your name, your date of birth, your country of birth, and your current nationality. You will also need passport information, such as the type of passport, the passport number, and the date it was issued.


Next, you will provide information about your trip, such as how long you will be in each country, the type of visa you're applying for, and the reason you are going.
You also must give information about where you're staying, as well as information about how you're supporting yourself while there. Finally, you must identify your spouse and children, as well as identify any family members that you are visiting and are dependent on.

, You will need documents such as your passport, proof of residency, and a passport photo. You'll also need documents about you trip, such as a copy of your flight schedule and proof that your health insurance will cover you throughout the Schengen area, as well as documents that show why you're visiting. You also need to verify your employment and provide pay stubs from the last 3 months.


For a business trip, you'll need to get the company that's hosting you to provide a letter, as well as your own company. Both should state why you're visiting on business, and at least one should say who's paying for your trip and provide the place you're staying.
For a fun trip, you need information such as your hotel reservations, which includes the proper contact information for that hotel. You should also provide info if you're going on a tour.
If you're visiting people, you may need a special form to verify that. For instance, in The Netherlands, the form is called the Proof of Private Accommodation and/or Sponsorship, which the host needs to have certified by the Dutch City Hall. The country will also need a copy of that person's passport or residence permit.

, Most countries require that you apply at their embassy or consulate in person in your host country. Most of the time, you will need to make an appointment before visiting. You can use either the foreign country's government website or your own country's government website to find the consulate nearest you., You will be fingerprinted at the consulate's office if you haven't before for a Schengen Visa. If you have before, the consulate should be able to look it up., The fee will vary both by the country you're from and the country you're applying to. The foreign country's website should have the current fees, or you can call the consulate before you arrive to find out the fee.

Gather your equipment.,

Buy a good quality flight case.,
Bubble wrap.,
Pack your equipment.,
Line the case with the bubble wrap.,
Lay the guitar down.,
Pull the roll of bubble wrap over the guitar.,
Extra protection.,
Finished.

",How to Pack a Guitar for Travel," There's nothing worse than arriving at your destination only to find you've forgotten your picks. Get your spare picks, capo, extra strings, tuner and everything else that you'll need and place them in one spot. Don't leave anything out because if you don't bring strings and your old ones break, you could find yourself using a size or type that you don't really want to play with. If you're missing something, buy it now.;
, If you only have one guitar, you're not going to be concerned with this step. However, if you have lots of guitars, choose one. It could be your favorite or one that you don't mind getting knocked around a bit or won't be so cut up about if it goes missing. Acoustic guitars are easier to carry about as you don't have to pack an amp and only need to bring minimal spare hardware. If you really want to bring your electric though, go ahead in full knowledge that you'll have some extras to carry.

, Flight cases are rock solid. They can withstand nearly everything from a drop down a flight of stairs to the baggage handlers in the airport. However, with all the safety comes a price. A good quality flight case can start from £100. If you don't really want to spend that much, get a good quality hard case. These can be around £50. A nice way to get them cheap is to go to a music store and ask if they have any slightly blemished ones. A hard guitar case that used to be £60 can be reduced to £20 if it's a little battered. Don't get one that's too broken though.

, That's right, bubble wrap. The stuff you used to play with when you were a kid. Bubble wrap is great for absorbing impact and could save your guitar's life. Stationery shops and supermarkets usually sell bubble wrap quite cheaply. Get loads of it too, you'll need to wrap your whole guitar up. You could have a little bit lying around the house, so don't spend too much on it, as you could always buy more if you run out.

, If your guitar case comes with a small built-in compartment for extras, put all of your equipment in before packing the guitar. This is because to get to your equipment again, you'll have to unpack the guitar and start all over. It's just a hassle that you could avoid. If your guitar case doesn't come with a compartment, keep your equipment in your hand luggage. Don't try to shove it in the case, it could break.

, To line the case, simply unroll the bubble wrap and put one layer in the bottom of the case. You don't need to make the layer very thick because you're going wrap the guitar up separately. The lining is just for a small bit of added protection.


If your guitar fits too snugly to line the case with bubble wrap and still have your instrument fit in, your case may be too small. It should have a little bit of flexible room in there.

, Now that your case is lined, lay your guitar in the bottom of the case. Do not cut the bubble wrap used for lining off as you're still going to be using the roll, so only cut it at the end.


Does your guitar fit? It should still have some room for more bubble wrap. You should start to see that the guitar is looking quite secure in the case though, secure enough for it not to break.







, This is why you shouldn't have cut the bubble wrap off of the roll, it's easier to work with it all rolled up.


Simply roll the bubble wrap over the guitar so that it ends up at the bottom of the case. Now you have a layer of bubble wrap on the bottom of the guitar and on the top of the guitar.
Cut the bubble wrap off the roll and tape the two loose ends together.

, There are some parts of the guitar that need a little bit more protection. These parts are mostly the headstock, the neck and a little bit around the sides of the body.


To protect the headstock, simply wrap some bubble wrap around it. Cut and tape the loose ends.






To protect the neck, start the bubble wrap from the very top (the nut) to the very bottom. Cut and tape the ends. To protect the body, stuff the sides with scrunched up balls of bubble wrap. Repeat as many times as you like with spare bubble wrap.

Prepare your truck to make it easier to secure your cargo.,
Use cargo netting for hauling light materials like insulation or lawn trash.,
Buy a tarp sized for your load.,

Secure cargo to a pallet when it is loaded.,
Be aware that it is difficult to secure cargo in a truck bed in a fashion that will ensure its safety from a determined thief who has opportunity to access the truck unnoticed.,
Invest in quality ratchet straps for tying down heavy cargo.,


Tie your cargo down from at least two sides, securing ropes or straps to the load itself where possible, or crossing over the top in an X manner to prevent movement in all directions.
,


Travel the smoothest, straightest path available.,
Be aware of the load capacity of your truck.,

Tie a flag on unusually long loads, so other drivers will notice it overhanging the tailgate and avoid approaching too closely.,Keep very heavy loads as far forward as possible to prevent the front of the vehicle from becoming light and making steering less effective and more difficult.,
Consider placing valuable tools and other items behind the seats in the cab.",How to Pack a Pickup Truck for Safe Travel," There are a number of different manufacturers and models of trucks, many of which have built in anchoring systems for cargo, but you may still find the need to add additional anchor points to suit your particular needs. Look at these options.

Install a bed rail. These options protect the rail of the truck bed from scraping and dents when heavy cargo is loaded over the side, may improve the appearance of the truck, and add tie down locations for large cargo which may be taller than the sides of the truck's bed.
Install a non-skid bed liner. These are usually fabricated from polymer materials and have the added benefit of preventing damage to the bed's factory finish. They can be removable or factory applied, and will reduce load shifting on the slippery truck bed floor in braking and cornering situations.
Install side rails. Most full-size pickups have factory formed post holes in the top of the bed sides. These are carryovers from a time when stake bodies were added to farm trucks for hauling hay or otherwise increasing the cargo capacity of the truck bed. You may want to haul trash or other light, bulky cargo, and can create your own temporary stake body by installing wooden posts in these holes and screwing horizontal rails along the length of your truck bed.
Install additional tie down anchors in the bed floor. You may purchase D-rings or other similar aftermarket anchoring systems from auto parts stores and screw or bolt them directly to the truck bed floor for anchoring specific cargo. Keep in mind, drilling the original metal of your truck may encourage rust and devalue the vehicle in the event of resale.






Keep a large cooler in the back of the truck for hauling groceries or other items back from the store. These are weather resistant, and keep things from blowing out while travelling.




 A standard locking aluminum tool box for storing small items.

Purchase and install a large permanent toolbox, or tool boxes. These come in a remarkable number of configurations, but if you cannot find one that perfectly suits your needs, metal fabrication shops can custom build one to your specifications.
Purchase and install a Tonneau Cover. This is the ultimate cargo protection, offering weather proofing, locking ability, and improved aerodynamics. Two drawbacks to this remedy are cost (they are expensive), and the fact they preclude hauling tall loads.;
, These nets are custom made and sized for specific bed sizes, and although they are a significant investment, made from nylon or polyester fiber, they resist rot and decay, are easily stored, and are very lightweight and easy to handle. Most come with hooks that attach to the seam underneath the sides of the truck bed, or have attachment anchors that fasten permanently to the truck's sides., Truck beds vary in size, depending on whether it is a mid-size, compact, or full size pickup, and is short or long wheel-based. You will find tarps that have integral snaps that secure them, or you may want to anchor your tarp with bungee cords, which can be lapped over the sides of your truck's bed and hooked under the fenders., A lot of freight hauled and delivered in tractor trailers rigs is loaded on wooden pallets to make loading and unloading with forklifts possible. You can often find these pallets at salvage yards or building supply stores free or available for a nominal fee. The wooden frame of a pallet is less likely to slip on the truck floor, and since they are fairly heavy and built of slats, you can secure the load directly to the pallet., Here are some simple things to make a thief's attempt to steal your cargo more difficult.
Park your truck in a well-lit area at night.
Make sure your cargo is as invisible as possible, either by covering it with a tarp or storing it in some type of container.
Park where your vehicle is visible to passers-by. Interstate Highway rest areas are a prime location for thieves, so try to park in the front, where people entering and leaving will discourage a thief.
Lock the most valuable items inside the truck, and out of sight if possible.
Consider buying a king-cab or quad-cab pickup so you have more interior room for storing your cargo.
Travel directly to your destination when transporting cargo from one location to another. Stopping and shopping, sight-seeing, or for other activities exposes your cargo to greater risk either from theft or weather.


, These are made of strong synthetic fiber, and paired with solidly anchored attachment points will hold even a heavy, unbalanced load tightly. Be sure to store these straps properly when not in use: sunlight, oil, dirt, etc, can slowly break down the fabric of the straps. This could cause them to become weakened and possibly fail.,, Avoiding curving or rough roads will decrease the chance your cargo will be subjected to extreme forces., Vehicle suspensions and tires have a load rating (GVWR, or Gross Vehicle Weight Rating), found on the factory sticker on the edge of the driver's door panel. Never exceed this amount., Very long loads are more likely to shift, so you may have to tie a guying line to them to keep them stationary.,, This puts them out of sight, and out of the weather. When the truck doors are locked, this is about as safe as it gets.

",How to Make a Travel Lingerie Bag," You'll need 4 pieces of fabric (2 for the outside of the pouch and 2 for the lining), 10” (25cm) high by 15.5” (40cm) wide.;
, They'll need to be 10” (25cm) high by 15.5” (40cm) wide.


Iron the interfacing onto the wrong side of the outer pieces of the pouch.

, Lay the zipper face down along the long side of this piece. Since the fabric is a bit wider than the zipper, there will be some excess on each side. This will be your seam allowance.

, Arrange it so the zip is essentially sandwiched between 2 pieces of fabric. Using your zipper foot, sew across the entire side.

, Each side of the zipper should be sandwiched between the pieces of fabric. Press open.

, Pin it wherever you like on the outer layer of fabric. Do not sew through both the outer and lining layers.


Sew as close as you can to each edge of the ribbon.

,, Thee outer layers should be facing each other and the lining layers facing each other.

, This will allow you to turn the pouch right side out and have no seams exposed.

, Fold it in half, and tuck it inside the outer pieces of the long side of the bag with the raw edges pointing out so it’s sandwiched between the layers.

, When you come to the zipper, fold it so both sides of the zipper tape are touching, with the zipper teeth pointing towards the lining side of the pouch. This will make the zipper neater.


Sew the other long side, folding the sides of the zipper against themselves again.

, If you forget to leave the 4” (10cm) opening on the lining pieces, just open the stitches with a stitch ripper so you have enough room to get your hand in.

, This gives the bag some shape and also makes it a bit more interesting.


To do this, pull apart one corner of the bag, making a point as shown, using the side seams as a guide.
Sew 2” (5cm) in from the point.
Repeat on each corner.

,, Begin to gently turn the bag right side out. Poke the corners open with your fingers.

, Push the lining into the bag.

You can consult any of various packing lists online for ideas about what to take to certain locations or for certain conditions.
Include items for all seasons on your list. If you use sunscreen mostly in summer and lip balm mostly in winter, include both.;
, Remember, you are leaving this bag packed, so these are not the items you use every day at home.

Get containers and pour in your preferred shampoo and conditioner.
Use the same products you use at home. It's cheapest to buy stuff like shampoo in the larger sizes and pour them into travel-sized containers, and you know exactly how your favorite shampoo will work in your hair.
Alternatively, if you aren't particular about things like soap and shampoo, you can collect travel sizes for free from hotel rooms and keep them in your kit for when you are places where they are not provided.
Wrap shampoo bottles in plastic bags, in case of undesired opening.
Before you travel with anything you don't normally use at home, try it at home before taking it on the road. Timbuktu is not the place to discover that you're allergic to something, or that you can't stand using it. Trying your kit at home is also a good way to find out how quickly you use up things like shampoo and toothpaste.

, Buy a separate razor from the one you use at home (this might be a good place for a disposable razor), a travel-sized tube of toothpaste, and so on.
Look for items you already have around. Do you already have a spare toothbrush, hairbrush, tweezers, or nail file?

, Try one of the many commercial bags available, or you can simply use a plastic zipper bag. If you're buying a bag, look for one with many separate compartments, so that items don't get jumbled up. Some toiletries bags are designed to hang from a built-in hook.
If you're traveling by air and have toiletries in your carry-on bag, you will be required to take any liquids out and have them in clear view. In this case, U.S. departures limit liquids to 100 mL or 3,4 oz. and require you put them in a clear one-quart zipper bag. Packing them in an easy-to-access location is extra convenient. Try loading solids in a separate clear bag if you run out of space.

, You should end up with a complete, compact bag of only the things you need to have to travel, but all the things you need for any trip., Your kit will be ready to go the next time you leave, and your use of the kit will be fresh in your mind. Is it time for a fresh razor or blade? Are you running low on shampoo? Take care of it first, then put the whole kit back in the drawer or on the shelf, or even in your suitcase, all ready to go next time., Some of my best souvenirs are foreign toiletries . If 300 million Europeans can live without a special brand of toothpaste,chances are you can too."

Cut back on unnecessary spending. Decide what's important to you and what you are willing to sacrifice for your European vacation.
Consider taking a second job or some side work to make extra cash that can be put toward your vacation savings plan.
Use coupons, shop sales and purchase necessary items on discount.
Set aside some money each month for your vacation. Work out a budget and figure out what you can realistically apply toward your travel fund.;
, You can save the most money on travel and accommodation costs by planning your trip to Europe far in advance. A good rule of thumb is at least 11 months.

, Rewards programs include frequent flyer miles and credit card points systems, and they can be used toward air travel, auto rentals, accommodations, tours and vacation upgrades. Discounts through club memberships like AAA and AARP can also save you money on your trip to Europe.

, Comparison shop on Internet airfare sites and call around to travel agencies to get the best pricing. Being flexible with airports and departure/arrival dates can also save you money.

, Make a list of the places and things you most want to see during your trip to Europe, and plan your vacation accordingly. This will allow you to take inventory of what your highest expenses will be so that you can cut costs in the other, less important, areas. Additionally, if you plan on staying in just a few big cities, like Paris, Brussels, Berlin or Rome, for longer periods of time, rather than trying to squeeze in many places in relatively short periods of time, you can save money on transportation and accommodations.

, Put some research into planning your trip to Europe and you will find that many notable European attractions, like the Eiffel Tower, are either free to the public or relatively low-priced. If you plot out the course of your European vacation carefully, you can do a lot of sight-seeing on a limited budget.

, Reading tourist manuals can give you valuable insight into money-saving techniques regarding the local transportation, lodging, eating and phoning customs. Make it a point to know of inexpensive local traditions and pastimes, such as the Oktoberfest in Munich or a game of rugby in Edinburgh.

,


Take public transportation. Buses and trains are less expensive than cab rides and car rentals.
Buying a pass can save you even more money than if you pay per ride. A Eurail pass will enable you to see all of Europe, and is available in several different packages and price ranges.
Do as much sight-seeing by foot as possible.
If you decide to rent a car while on vacation in Europe, choose manual transmission and diesel cars.
Rent a bicycle.

, There are several alternatives to staying in 4 star hotels:


Vacation rentals. Rent a home, guest house, apartment or villa from a private owner. If you will be staying in France, look into renting a ""gite.""
Budget hotels. You may find that 2 and 3 star hotels are suitably comfortable for your stay in Europe. Additionally, European chain hotels are relatively inexpensive.
If you have friends or family members in Europe, ask to stay with them. If you know people who regularly travel to Europe, ask if they have any European friends who wouldn't mind taking in some boarders.
Hostels, universities, convents and monasteries offer shared rooms and are, by far, the least expensive European boarding option.

, If you make an effort to get to know the locals, you may be invited to partake in activities that are both culturally relevant and free. From weddings to festivals and other celebrations, a local insider can involve you in memorable European experiences outside of the traditional European vacation tourist attractions.

,


Small restaurants with a good local following are generally much less expensive than fancy eateries. Additionally, taking advantage of menu specials, like the French plat du jour, and early bird pricing can save you even more money.
If you book a vacation rental, you may save money by cooking your own food.
Europe is full of street vendors. Purchase prepared meals and then bring them to your rental to eat. Vendors in Istanbul will even give you free samples of the popular dish locum.
Pack a lunch if you plan on spending the day sight-seeing by foot.
Bring snacks and a water bottle while touring and stop for food and drink less often.
Coffee time is a traditional pastime in Europe, and you may find that many Italian cafes will charge you to sit at a table to drink your coffee. Be sure to ask and, if that is the case, tell the cashier you choose to stand at the bar.

, Follow these practices to save on fees when you convert your US dollars to euros and/or pounds:


Check with your bank to see if it has a European branch where you can convert your money without paying fees.
Get cash from ATMs.
Use a credit card that does not charge for foreign currency conversion.

, The European off season is October through May, during which time every expense associated with a vacation in Europe is deeply discounted. European beaches, such as the Cote d'Azur and Amalfi Coast, are busiest in the months of July and August, but can still be enjoyed in June for a fraction of the cost. Major cities like London and Rome are interesting any time of year.

, Opt for scratch-off phone cards and land lines instead.

, Bring things like batteries, film, toiletries and water bottles with you so that you don't have to purchase them while on vacation. Additionally, it is not necessary to spend a lot of money on souvenirs. Photos, ticket stubs and attraction brochures are great reminders of your European vacation, and are free.

Hitchhiking. It's generally safe if you do it during the day, and seasoned hitchhikers can cross the entire US in four days or less.



 


Train hopping. It's free, but it can also be dangerous and stressful. Looking over your shoulder for train yard workers and being ready to hop out of a moving vehicle when someone gets creepy with you may not be everyone's idea of fun. In addition, this is illegal, and may net you felony trespassing charges if you are caught.







Canoe. If you have one and the weather is good, consider canoe camping.






Take a bicycle ride. You don't move as far as a car in one day, but you cover more territory than walking. Like hiking, you get to see the countryside up close and meet interesting people. Bicycle Touring.

Motorcycle or scooter. If you have one already, it's just about the cheapest way to propel yourself over long distances, because of the low fuel costs. If you don't have one, look into the cost of renting and compare it to the next few options.
Buses and trains. This is safer than the previous options, but you'll need to check the fares for the trip you have in mind to determine how cost-effective it is.






Driving. This is comparable to bus and train fares in terms of gas costs, but if you don't have a car, you'll have to rent one, which can get pretty pricey. However, there are several ways to push down the cost of driving:






Carpool and split the gas/rental costs. If your friends don't want to come along, check the rideshare section of your local craigslist:

Network. Ask everyone you know or even anyone you chat with throughout the day if they know of anyone you can stay with. Ask in your Twitter, Myspace, and Facebook updates.
Go to http://couchsurfing.org and find someone who's offering up their couch. The website has a vouching system to help address concerns about safety.
House-sitting is a good method of obtaining free shelter, though it comes with responsibilities. Some websites list house-sitting opportunities for free, and others will charge you.
If you live in a city or region where others want to travel, you can arrange a temporary home-swap with people who live wherever you'd like to stay. This can be coordinated through Craigslist and other sites.


Sleep in your car. Many interstate rest areas allow overnight parking. Vans, pick-up trucks with camper tops, and even small hatchbacks with the rear seat folded down can make comfy beds. And you will be especially thankful when the rain starts pouring down, and you can just pull over and not worry about setting up a tent. For some additional tips, read How to Live in Your Car.
Go camping. In state and national parks in the US, campsites are often cheap, or even free. (Chain campsites, and large resort-type ones with pools and arcades will often cost you as much as a hotel would.)
Look for hostels. This dorm-style lodging is usually cheaper than motels.

, Generally, the less prepared food you buy, the better.


If you have or can borrow a camp stove, you would be surprised how easy it is to cook a cheap and delicious pasta feast in a parking lot or rest stop. See How to Use a Trangia Camping Stove.
Stuff a jar of peanut butter and some crackers in your pack to save you from the overpriced gas station snacks.

Dumpster Dive. This can also be useful for finding cans and glass bottles and getting cash for them in some cases.

Find Wild Edible Plants --especially berries (like dewberries) and other fruit. If you're in the desert, you might be able to gain sustenance from yucca and prickly pear cactus. A word of caution, however, be sure you know what you are eating and that it is edible. Some berries and other plants are very similar to others that are very lethal. As long as you know what you're eating berries and other plants are a great way to get free food!
Bring energy bars. They might be expensive, but they'll hold you over when you need to avoid the temptation of buying food at a restaurant so you can wait until you get to a grocery store and buy much cheaper food that you can cook yourself. If you have the time, you can make your own energy bars before you go.

,


Can you play an instrument? An afternoon of busking on a busy city street may get you some cash to buy a meal or gas to get you to your next destination. See How to Make Money Busking (Street Performing).

Panhandle Please note that panhandling is illegal in some places. Know the law to keep yourself from getting in trouble.
Farm labor. Go to websites that list farms and farm work opportunities and look for operations in the areas you plan to travel through. Call in advance and ask if you can work for a full day. If they can't give you cash, maybe they'll give you food and/or lodging.
Two good farm listing sites in the US are Local Harvest and ATTRA.



,


A comfortable bag. You might need to do a lot of walking, so choose a backpack intended for that purpose. Make sure it has support straps across your hips and shoulders, and the straps should be padded.
A folding bike. If you're not traveling with your own means of transportation, a portable bike could be a sensible investment for if you need to travel from your campsite or the place you're staying to a local grocery store, or so you can explore areas easily when you're not hitchhiking. When you're not using it, you can fold the bike and carry it with you.
Baby wipes. Bathing can become an issue when traveling in this fashion. You may not have daily and immediate access to a suitable shower. Baby wipes will allow you to freshen up easily. You can buy some or, better yet, make your own.
Camp stove. As mentioned earlier, this is handy for making your own food anywhere.

,


Most major cities have all types of free entertainment and services; which can be found, on sites like Lafreebeee and Freecycle.org, depending on where you live.
Museums are free on certain days of the month or if you have a student id.
You can see free movie screenings if you know where to look and how to sign up.
Sign up for free coupon offers and take the coupons with you on your trip.
There are free medical clinics in many major cities.

Plan ahead and be flexible for your plane ticket.",How to Visit Japan on a Budget2," An international plane ticket is expensive but if you shop around and pick your travel time well, you can spend a lot less. If you buy from a travel agent and come to Japan in April or May, you will pay almost $2,000. If you use the internet to find your ticket and come in early March or the rainy season (June), you can spend as little as $750. Compare prices for tickets to Narita Airport and Kansai Airport––sometimes one is quite a bit cheaper than the other.

Get a Japan Rail Pass.,
Rent a bicycle.,
Hitchhike.",How to Visit Japan on a Budget3," This special passbook is available only to people on a tourist visa, must be purchased before arriving in Japan and offers unlimited rides on Japan Railways trains for one, two, or three weeks. A rail pass for one week is around 28,300yen or $300USD for regular cars, to 37,800 Yen or $415USD for green cars. A ""green car"" on Japanese trains is a luxury car. The difference is very small and you will find that all seats on the Shinkansen are quite comfortable and spacious.

, Near most train stations you can rent a bicycle for the day for under $10. If you're going to tour a whole town you might find that a bicycle is cheaper, more convenient, and more fun than taking the bus or a subway. However, if you come during the rainy season to save money on the plane ticket you may want to stick with the buses and subways. If not, affordable rain gear can be purchased in any convenience store.

, It sounds like bad advice but in Japan hitchhiking isn't nearly as dangerous as it can be in other countries, especially for men. Many Japanese people will drive you as far as they can for nothing more than a few hours of English conversation. It is not recommended for solitary female travelers and is best done in pairs if you do hitchhike. For more details, read Will Ferguson's Hitchhiker's Guide to Japan.

Take a good guidebook to Japan.,
Consider capsule hotels and internet cafes.,
If you aren't shy and you speak some Japanese you can stay in a Love Hotel.,
Consider a pension.,
Look for business hotels in city centers, around train stations.,
Use a youth hostel.,
Go camping.",How to Visit Japan on a Budget4," A guidebook will tell you where you can find lodging in any city you're likely to visit in Japan, and has everything conveniently sorted by cost, allowing you to quickly spot the budget options. A guidebook will also list popular restaurants, attractions, and other points of interest.


Note that Japanese accommodations have two basic classifications––Western-style and traditional. It's a good idea to plan at least one night's stay in a traditional Japanese inn (ryokan), which will give you a good taste of the traditions of Japan, even though this might be pricier than your other budget stays. The room price in a ryokan usually includes breakfast and dinner. If you do stay in a traditional place, be sure to follow local customs or you may offend the Japanese.

, If you're traveling alone or with a small thrifty group you can often save money by staying in a capsule hotel or an internet cafe:


Capsule hotels were invented to give Japanese business men a place to sleep until the first train of the next day if they missed the last train home. However, they also offer tourists a cheap place to crash. You don't get a room so much as a tube with a mattress, but you cannot beat the price. To get in and out, you usually have to slide and there isn't room to sit or stand. You'll usually find these clustered around train stations or the areas with nightlife. Ask whether bathing facilities are included in the price, as sometimes they are. Not all capsule hotels will accept women, so bear this in mind.
Internet cafes also can be an inexpensive place to sleep. If you come in late, you can often get a room from midnight to 8am for about $20. You may be sleeping on a couch, but if you really want to save money it might be worth it. The internet cafes often have showers as well.

, Love Hotels are places where Japanese couples get some privacy from their multi-generational homes for a few hours. However, after 11pm you can get the room for the night and usually for very little money. The room usually comes with a free condom as well and you get to see a truly bizarre sight, a sex-toy vending machine.

, This Western-style place to stay is usually run by a married couple near or in resort areas of Japan. You'll usually get a meal with the price.

, These are budget-conscious hotels used by business travelers and can also be used by tourists. You will usually need to know some Japanese though, as these hotels aren't catering to tourists. As well as a good price, you'll get a clean room and it's likely that you'll be near at least one affordable place to eat.

, Japan has plenty of youth hostels and they are good for the budget-conscious traveler. The downside to hostels is usually their location––they tend to be found in the outer parts of built-up areas or tucked in out-of-the-way places. This can increase your travel costs but it can still be better than expensive central accommodations. For the cheapest rates you'll need a membership card but decide whether this is worth it by considering how often you'll stay at hostels.

, There are campsites throughout Japan and if the season is right, this can be a fun, albeit often crowded, way to experience Japan. Be aware that overcrowding is fairly typical during Japanese holiday seasons. You can sometimes rent tents and in some places you'll also be able to rent a cabin or lodge if you've booked in advance. However, the Japanese National Tourist Office does recommend that you take your own gear, ""to avoid disappointment"". Also note that getting to and from campsites can be problematic if you don't have your own transport.

Stick to budget restaurants and bars when eating out.,
Get food from grocery stores.,
Check out the food vending machines.,
Visit the usual chain food stores.,
Eat at food halls and food markets.,
Avoid buying alcohol and clothing.,
Get pre-made meals at a convenience store.,
Take plenty of digital photographs as your souvenirs.",How to Visit Japan on a Budget5," Japan offers plenty of budget food choices in restaurants, so you don't need to avoid eating out altogether. Décor is often a good indicator of price, so be alert. Tipping is not expected in Japan, so you can save even more by not doing so. It's a really good idea to have a menu-reading list on your smartphone or in your guidebook so that you know what you're eating and the value. And it pays to ask for meibutsu if you're a food lover––this is the word for ""speciality"" and will ensure that you get the most locally true cuisine possible.


Noodle bars and night street stalls specializing in noodles (ramen) are often a great way to get very full at an affordable choice. You'll know a ramen restaurant when you see customers seated at a long counter eating from steaming bowls. Udon and soba dishes are another cheap way to eat in Japan provided you choose a cheap restaurant.

Izakaya is the Japanese version of a pub-eatery, and you can get a selection of typical Japanese foods as well as Western foods as such places. It's casual food, and therefore usually fairly inexpensive.

Yakitori is a skewer of vegetables and charcoal-grilled chicken. It's usually served with beer or sake after work and it might be enough for a meal in some places. There are yakitori restaurants (yakitori-ya), often found near train stations. Just be aware that prices are usually for one yakitori, so add up the costs if you want more.
Although sushi is considered to be a snack, it is possible to fill up on sushi as a meal. Look for automatic sushi places, known as kaiten-sushi, that serve sushi on an automatic conveyor belt. The color code on the plates you choose are the price indicators and they should match with a price chart on the wall. Choose carefully and you might be able to fill up for very little cost.
Look for places where the locals eat, although you'll need a grasp of basic Japanese as such places rarely have menus and if they do, rarely anything in English. Look for nomiya and aka-chochin Japanese restaurants or chuka-ryori-ya cheap Chinese restaurants.

, Grocery stores sell plenty of prepared foods just like convenience stores but for a lot less money.

, These are almost everywhere in Japan and you can get a range of food and drink from them, including snacks, green tea, coffee, beer, etc.

, McDonald's and other fast food chains are everywhere. Try Mosburger, a Japanese hamburger chain.

, These are great budget places to eat, with lots of variety available. Along with grocery stores, these can be a great place for vegetarians, as there will be plenty of fruit, rice snacks and vegetables for sale.


Bakeries are another option, although most food sold in bakeries is fairly sweet and isn't going to be quite what you're used to.

, You might have heard that things in Japan are really expensive, however if you avoid alcohol and clothing you will find that everything else is quite reasonably priced. You should, of course, try sake while you are in Japan. Just don't plan on going out to bars every night.

, Convenience stores have great tasting, inexpensive pre-made meals. They have everything from prepared ramen to beef bowls. Some convenience stores even have fresh bakeries. Most will have microwaves and chopsticks and/or disposable utensils available. Many have counters where you can eat in the store, if you wish.

, They're cheaper and more personal than souvenirs or expensive artisan items, and they're the best way to jog your memory years later.

Set a daily budget for entrance fees and associated costs with visiting places.,
Find the free or low-cost things to do.,
Buy souvenirs in 100, 300, 500 and 1,000 yen stores.",How to Visit Japan on a Budget6," This will help you to make good decisions about what is worth paying to see and what is not really affordable.

, There are many ways to experience all that Japan has to offer without having to pay much. Just a few of the things you might like to do:


Visit Akihabara (known as ""Akiba"" for short) in Tokyo. This electronics district has all the latest otaku (geek) trends and simply taking it all in can be an exciting experience.
Visit Japan's beaches. There are lots of beaches on both mainland Japan and on the islands of Okinawa. If the weather is good, these are a fascinating way to spend some time.
Visit Shibuya, the shopping center for Tokyo youth. Here you'll see many trendy Japanese, along with emerging trends. Bring your camera along.
Take time to check out the architecture. Tokyo has a smorgasbord of amazing buildings to examine and photograph.
See what festivals are happening while you're visiting. Getting caught up in the excitement of festivities can be a great way to remember your time in Japan.
Visit temples and shrines. There are so many that you could make your entire trip revolve around these beautiful, peaceful and enlightening places.
Take time to see Japanese gardens. Some may charge, some may be free but you'll find plenty to see and enjoy as you take a rest from the hectic pace outside of the garden.
Go hiking. Provided you can get to the good hiking locations, this can be a very affordable way to see more of Japan. The huts on hiking trails tend to be priced reasonably and there are amazing things to see, from volcanoes on Japan's southern island of Kyushu to the peaks of the Japan Alps in Central Honshu.
Save money on Tokyo's museums by getting a Grutt Pass, which will get you free or discounted access to around 75 museums in Tokyo., One price stores come in many types in Japan, corresponding roughly to $1, $3, $5 and $10 stores. They have more expensive one price stores as well. Many items in these stores look like they were far more expensive and make great gifts for yourself and others. Look for THE DAISO, Seiriya and 3 Coins, but there are countless others.

Consider whether a test case already exists.,
Know the characteristics of a good test case.,
Consider the different scenarios possible before writing.,
Give your self sufficient writing time.",How to Write a Test Case1," Before writing a new test case for your module, find out whether there are already existing test cases that test the same component. This can be a real time saver!


If you do find existing test cases, consider updating test case, rather than writing a new one.;
, Being aware of what constitutes a good test case will help you write a better and stronger test case.These characteristics include:


Accuracy: The test clearly articulates the purpose.
Tracing: The test is capable of being traced to requirements.
Repetition: The test can be used to do the test as many times as necessary.
Re-usability: The test be reused if necessary.
Independence: Every test case you write should be able to be performed in any order, without any dependency on other test cases.
Concision: The description of a test case should be simple and clear and have no extraneous steps or words. A tester should be able to understand it by reading it one-time over. The description should use action words, like ""do 'x'"" and ""do 'y'.""

, Concentrate on what could happen with the product when being used by a customer. Think about this carefully and design your test(s) accordingly.Scenarios should be concise. The goal of a test scenario is not to provide a lot of specific details, but to instead convey a specific idea about testing a particular case.

, Because scenarios and cases form the base for future test cases and testing, you need to give yourself enough time to write a quality test as well as time to have the procedure thoroughly reviewed."
"
Select a tool for writing a test case.,
Write a test case with your chosen tool.,
Write a basic test case statement.There is a typical format for these statements:



Verify .,
Review written test case.",How to Write a Test Case2," Excel spreadsheets are highly recommended for writing basic test cases and for manually testing them.When you plan to automate test cases, then get the licensing for tools like Test Director. There are also a number of tools that can be downloaded freely on the Internet., This will allow you to keep track of the case and its related data.A good template includes:


Serial Numbers: This is the test case count.
Test Suite ID: This is the ID of the test suite to which this test case belongs.
Test Case ID: The ID of the test case.
Test Case Summary: The summary or goal of the test case.
Related Requirement: The ID of the requirement this test case relates/traces to.
Prerequisites: These are any prerequisites or preconditions that must be fulfilled before executing the test.
Test Procedure/Steps: This is the step-by-step procedure to execute the test. Be very detailed and specific here as this is the most important component. Each step can be written very directly using key words such as ""enter,"" ""verify,"" ""click"", ""login"", etc.
Expected Result: The anticipated result of the test. While writing test cases, note what page/screen you expect to appear after the test.You could also attach screenshots or specification documents to the relevant step and note that the system should work as outlined to help simplify the step and anticipated result and to make the process easier to follow for the tester.
Actual Result: This is the result of the test after it is performed.
Status: This is the status that will occur in the test, e.g. ""Pass"" or ""fail"". Other status can also be used, such a ""Not Executed"" if testing is not performed and ""Blocked"" if testing is blocked.
Remarks: Here you can add any comments on the test case or the execution of the test case.
Created By: This is the name of the creator of the test.
Date of Creation: This is the date when you execute the test.
Executed By: This is the name of the person who actually carried out the test.
Date of Execution: The date you performed the test.
Test Environment: The systems in which the text was executed. Here you'd note, for example, the operating system and the web browser you used.

,

Using Instead of ""using"", you can also use ""entering"" or ""selecting"", depending on the situation of your particular test case.

With .

To , Your job isn't quite over once you've written the test case; you still need to review everything that has been written and evaluate that all of the steps are clear and comprehensible and that the expected results match those steps.You can review the case yourself and assess any gaps or missing areas by putting yourself in the role of Tester. But you can also have your test case reviewed by peer testers (known as ‘Peer Review’), developers, product owners or any relevant stakeholders."

Proofread and edit.Read your brief out loud to make sure that there is no awkward phrasing or parts that do not make sense.",How to Write a Legal Brief," The case file should contain information about the facts that you or your firm has compiled through conversations or meetings with your client. It is important that you understand these facts as they are critical to your correctly identifying the legal issues in the case.


Be sure to read the entire file very carefully – missing even the slightest detail could mean you reach an incorrect conclusion.Do not dismiss anything in the file out of hand. If you can’t decipher a piece of handwriting (a doctor’s report, for example) seek help until you can be sure you’ve read and understood everything.;
, The court record consists of the pleadings filed with the court including the original complaint, any answer to that complaint, cross-complaints, counterclaims, and any number of other types of pleadings or motions submitted to the court.Depending on the stage of proceedings of your case, there may not be a court record yet.
If there is a court record, read it carefully to understand the facts, procedural history, legal issues and your opponent's position.

, As you review the file and court record, prepare a list of the facts.Include only facts relevant to the legal issues. For example, if you are writing a brief on a “Motion to Compel Discovery,” it would not be relevant to include information about the opposing party’s personal life unless it had something to do with why he or she did not turn over the documents.
Organize the facts into columns of “pro” and “con” (either for or against your position).
Place a star next to those facts that are especially good or especially bad for your case.
For each fact on your list, take note of the source in which you found it so that you have the citation on hand if you use it in your brief. For example, if you get a particular fact from the “record” on page 5, you should place (R. 5) after you state that particular fact

, Based on your review of the case file and court record, identify the legal issues that are relevant to the brief.


For example, in the course of defending a lawsuit, an issue might arise during discovery, with the other party refusing to turn over important documents. In that case, the issue would be whether or not the other party is required to turn over those particular documents.For each legal issue, consider what questions, if any, you would like to answer in the course of your research.

, To research the legal issues in your case, you will need to identify the relevant cases and statutes. A starting point for gathering this information is to refer to sources that provide an overview of different areas of the law.


Ask attorneys in your firm or other attorneys you trust whether they have worked on any cases with the same legal issues you will be addressing in your brief. If so, ask to review briefs or memos they have prepared on those issues.Consult recent practice manuals published by state Bar associations. These can be found in law libraries and online through legal research subscription services, such as Westlaw or LexisNexis.As you review these materials, take note of citations of statutes and cases relevant to the issues in your case. These will provide you with a starting point for conducting your research.

, Once you have identified the statutes applicable to the issues in your case, look them up and read them.


Search for statutes online through subscription based websites, like LexisNexis, Westlaw, Loislaw, FastCase, Casemaker and Bloomberg Law. The U.S. code and many state statutes can also be accessed for free by searching for them online.If you cannot locate the text of a statute online, go to a law library and look for it in the relevant code. ""Annotated statutes"" are particularly helpful, as they provide an explanation of the law and a listing of relevant cases., Find and read relevant cases you identified through your review of briefs, memos, practice manuals and annotated statutes.


Locate cases online through subscription based websites, like LexisNexis, Westlaw, Loislaw, FastCase, Casemaker and Bloomberg Law. If you do not have a subscription to these services, look for your cases on Google Scholar, which contains an extensive database of state and federal cases that can be accessed online free of charge. Pay special attention to cases with similar facts in which the holding supports your position.
Consider how to distinguish the facts in your case from cases with holdings that are unhelpful to your position.

, Before you cite any cases in favor of your position, you must ""Shepardize"" them to confirm they are still good law.


Shepardize online by looking up the citation for your case on Shepard's by LexisNexis, KeyCite by WestLaw or similar services on Loislaw, FastCase, Casemaker or Bloomberg Law.Shepardize in print by reviewing Shepard's Citations print guides in a law library.Keep in mind that any cases that have been overruled are not binding on the current court and should not be used in a brief.

, There are two general categories of court briefs: trial briefs and appellate briefs. A trial brief is usually submitted during or before trial in support of or in opposition to a motion filed with the court. An appellate brief is submitted to a court of appeals in support or in opposition to an argument that a lower court's decision must be overturned.Appellate briefs are longer and more formal than trial briefs. They require a title page, table of contents and authorities, in addition to statement of facts, questions presented and legal argument. The exact requirements of an appellate brief will depend on the procedural requirements of the appeals court to which the brief is being submitted.
Unlike appellate briefs which generally conform to a set format, trial briefs vary widely depending on the kind of motion the brief is intended to support and the type of court to which it is being submitted (civil, criminal or immigration court). For example, a brief in support of a motion for severance of defendants in a criminal case may look different from a brief in support of a motion for summary judgment in a civil case.
If you are preparing a trial brief, ask a lawyer you trust for a template of a brief supporting the same kind of motion to the same court. Be sure the lawyer specializes in the area of law covered by the brief. Use this template a starting point for drafting your brief, while always checking the formatting requirements of your court to ensure you are complying with court rules.

, Every brief will be formatted differently depending on the type of brief and the court to which it will be submitted.Read the court manual for your particular court for the rules that apply to your brief, including those regarding: page limits, font size and type, paper color, parts that must be included in your brief.
Find out what legal citation format is required by the court. For example, although most courts require briefs to use the “Bluebook” legal citation format, in California courts, you must use the “California Style Manual” instead. Additionally, in Alabama, all briefs must be submitted using the font “Courier New” in size 13 while other courts will require different fonts.
Scrupulously follow all rules. Briefs that do not comply exactly with the rules may not be accepted by the court, and may be returned unread., The title page contains information identifying the case and naming the person who filed the brief.


The exact contents of a title page are set out by the rules of the court.
Generally, it includes: the court name, jurisdiction, case number, title of the case (the names of the parties), title of the document, name(s) and address(s) of the lawyers filing the document, and the date filed.A short trial brief may not require a title page. However, refer to the rules of your particular court before leaving it out.

, The ""Table of Contents"" must contain every heading in the brief as well as a page reference for each.A short trial brief may not require a table of contents. However, refer to the rules of your particular court before leaving it out.

, The ""Table of Authorities,"" also referred to as the ""Table of Cases,"" usually appears after the table of contents. It lists each case or other authority cited in the brief.Group the authorities by cases, statutes, rules, and other authorities.
Within each group, list the authorities in alphabetical order. Each authority must include the full citation and a cross reference to each page in the brief where the authority is cited.
If you are preparing a trial brief, you may not need a table of authorities. Refer to the rules of your particular court before leaving it out.

, Write a jurisdictional statement that tells the court what authority confers jurisdiction on the court to hear the case.Refer to the statute or source of law that grants the court the power to hear the case. For example: ""The court has jurisdiction under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.""While a jurisdictional statement is expected for appellate briefs, it is not usually included in trial briefs. Consider the rules of your particular court and legal issues in your case to determine whether or not you should include one.

, Write out the facts and procedural history relevant to your case in a section called ""Statement of the Case.""In presenting the facts, be clear, concise and persuasive without including language that implies a legal conclusion, such as the word ""negligently"" to describe how something was done.For example, in a negligence case in which a plaintiff was injured due to an unmarked ice hazard on a ski trail, highlight the facts that show the plaintiff could not have avoided his injury by being more careful: ""The glare from the sun prevented him from seeing that the trail was covered in ice. As a result of the glare, he was unable to avoid the dangerous ice hazard.""In describing the procedural history, state the date on which a lawsuit or criminal charges were initially filed, the legal basis for the lawsuit or charges and the relevant motions that have been filed in the case of a trial brief or the rulings by the trial court and previous appellate courts in the case of an appellate brief.

, The ""Questions Presented"" section frames the issues for the court. It should identify the legal issues at stake, with sufficient reference to the facts of the case to make the matter concrete and compelling. Each question generally consists of one sentence, beginning with the words ""whether"" or ""does"". For example: ""Does the public burning of an American flag during the course of a political demonstration constitute free speech subject to the protection of the First Amendment?""
If you are preparing a trial brief, you may not need to include a ""Questions Presented"" section. Look to other similar briefs submitted to the same court and to the court rules to decide whether to include one.

, The section called ""Summary of Argument"" should contain a clear and concise summary of what you will argue. This is basically a shorter version of your argument.Include only the most persuasive parts of your argument.
Do not simply repeat the point headings from the table of contents.
Follow the same structure you will use in your argument.
Trial briefs often do not include this section.

, The ""Argument"" section is the heart of the brief. This is where you will analyze the law that applies to your case and apply the legal principles to the facts.Each argument section or subsection should begin with an argumentative point heading. The heading should state in one sentence the main thrust of the argument to follow with enough detail and specificity for the court to understand the substance of the argument.If preparing an appellate brief, the point heading should always be capitalized and should emphasize why or why not the trial court decision should be overturned. For example: ""THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN ADMITTING TONY'S STATEMENT BECAUSE IT WAS THE FRUIT OF AN ILLEGAL POLICE SEIZURE AND THEREFORE MUST BE SUPPRESSED UNDER THE WONG SUN DOCTRINE.""If preparing a trial brief, a point heading does not usually need to be capitalized and should emphasize why the motion before the court should be either granted or denied. For example: ""The court must not admit the prior trial testimony of the witnesses because even though the prior testimony exception to the hearsay rule may apply there are unusual circumstances that run contrary to the purpose of the confrontation clause.""Beneath each heading, begin each section with a paragraph that summarizes the argument. Within the argument, you should make your strongest points and present your strongest authorities first.Support your statements with citations of the facts and to the law.
When citing cases in support of your position, emphasize their similarities to your case.
Anticipate what your opponent will argue and refute those arguments. For example, if you find a case that seems to support your opponent’s position, distinguish that case from your case.
If you are responding to an opponent's brief, state your case before responding to your opponent's argument.
Be as concise as possible without omitting necessary details. Judges are busy people and do not appreciate having to read long briefs when the same issues could have been covered more succinctly.

Have someone else proofread the brief and recommend any edits that he or she feels are necessary.

Pack only carry on luggage.,
Make sure your luggage is within the size limits.,
Reduce the amount of luggage you carry.,
Pack tightly as well as lightly.,
Wear as much as you can rather than packing it.,
Use the largest allowable personal item.,
Put heavy items in your carry-on luggage if you are checking a bag.,
Weigh your bags at home.,
Ask which items you can pack for free.,
Transfer large amounts of liquids to travel size bottles.",How to Avoid Airline Baggage Fees1," Most airlines allow you to bring one piece of carry-on luggage and one personal item (such as a purse or backpack) free of charge. If you can fit everything you need into this luggage then you can avoid baggage fees entirely.Some budget airlines charge even for carry-on luggage, so check with yours ahead of time to be sure.
Your carry on baggage may sometimes be checked (for free) at your gate before departure if the plane is expected to be very full.;
, Carry-on luggage must fit into the overhead compartment on a plane, and a personal item must fit under the seat in front of your. Check your airline’s website before you depart for its specific size regulations.Most airlines have a receptacle at the check-in counter or gate that you can slide your carry-on luggage into to verify that it is within the size limits.
Keep in mind that your airline may technically have a weight limit for carry-on luggage, though crews rarely take the time to weigh carry on luggage.
In the worst case scenario, when your carry on is weighed and found to be over the limit, you may be asked to check it.

, Most people tend to significantly overpack.Carrying as little as possible is the best way to avoid or reduce baggage fees. If you can reduce two checked bags to one, or a checked bag to a carry-on, you’ll see instant savings.Minimize the number of things you take. For instance, you might think you need to bring five pairs of shoes on vacation, but three will probably do it.
Favor a few versatile items over lots of one-use pieces. For instance, if you’re going on a beach vacation, carry a long white button-down shirt: you can wear it with pants, and it can double as a swimsuit cover.

, Balling all of your clothes up and throwing them in your luggage will waste precious space. Instead, roll your clothes up tightly and neatly place them in your luggage. You’ll be able to fit much more in your luggage, and reduce the number of pieces you carry--and the fees you’ll be subject to. There are other ways of squeezing more in. For instance:Vacuum pack your clothing in compression bags. All you have to do is hook a vacuum cleaner up to an opening on these bags, and it will remove all of the excess air so that your items take up less space.
Tuck small items within other items. For instance, roll up socks or a belt and place them inside your shoes.

, This is another way to reduce the amount you have to carry in your luggage, thereby lowering potential baggage fees. There are a number of creative ways to do this. For instance:Wear layers on the plane to reduce what you have to put in your luggage.
Wear your bulkiest items, like a large coat, rather than putting them in your luggage. You can always take it off once you’re in your airplane seat.
Use your pockets to hold small things rather than putting them in your luggage. You can even fold small clothing items and place them in large pockets of a jacket or cargo pants.

, Almost all airlines allow you to carry a personal item for free. This is usually expected to be something like a purse or laptop bag, but a backpack or small duffel will also usually slip by with no problem. Pack as much as you can into this item., Personal items and carry on bags are usually not weighed (unlike checked bags). Put your heaviest items in carry-on luggage to make it less likely that your checked bag be subject to an overweight baggage fee., No one wants to make it all the way to the check-in counter before realizing that their bag is overweight and subject to an overweight baggage fee. Do yourself a favor and use a digital scale to weigh your baggage before you depart. If it’s over your airline’s limit, take something out to avoid the fee.If you are travelling with multiple people, you can distribute items among all the luggage to make sure that each person's bag is under the weight limit.

, Though it’s not always announced, most airlines do not make passengers pay to pack items like strollers, child car seats, and necessary medical equipment. Before you try to stuff items like these into a checked bag and subject yourself to a fee, ask your airline if they can fly free., Liquids can usually only be carried on board a plane in small amounts, such as 3 ounces or less. If you’re carrying larger amounts of a liquid, you will have to check your bag. You can bypass this regulation, however, by repackaging the liquid in smaller bottles. That way, you can avoid the checked bag fee.For instance, if you are carrying a nine-ounce container of shampoo, transfer it to three three-ounce bottles instead, and place them in your carry-on luggage.
Remember that things for infants (milk, formula or food) and necessary medications are usually not subject to the liquid amount limits.

Choose an airline that does not charge fees for a checked bag.,
Get elite status with your favorite airline.,
Check with your airline to see if you qualify for exceptions.,
Sign up for an airline credit card with free baggage perks.,
Fly first class.",How to Avoid Airline Baggage Fees2," While most airlines use baggage fees for checked bags as a revenue stream, a few allow passengers to check a bag for free. As of early 2017, carriers such as Southwest and JetBlue offer this option., If you earn special status with an airline based on frequent flyer miles or other arrangements, this often comes with discounts on or elimination of baggage fees. While always flying with the same airline may not mean you have the cheapest ticket each time, you may save money on baggage fees this way in the long run if you frequently travel with lots of luggage.Contact your preferred airline for information on how to earn elite status.

, Many airlines offer incentives or exceptions for special passengers or classes of flights. These can include the elimination of baggage fees. For instance, some airlines offer a free checked bag on international flights, and many allow members of the military to check bags without paying a fee.Check with a customer service agent of your preferred airline to see if you qualify for an exception like this.

, Airline credit cards often offer free checked bags as an incentive. If you fly frequently and don’t mind signing up for a card, this can be an option for you.Typically, you have to use this card to purchase your tickets in order to have your baggage fees waived.
Airline credit cards sometimes have special restrictions and high annual fees, so read the fine print before signing up. The card will only be worth it if you save money in the long run by avoiding more in baggage fees than you pay for card fees.

, Most of the time, first class tickets are automatically bundled with a free checked bag. These tickets can be much more expensive than those for economy seats, but if you just want to avoid the trouble of paying separate baggage fees, you can spring for first class.

"
"
Spread fees around if you are traveling with multiple passengers.,
Ask about ticket class upgrades.,
Use your charm to reduce baggage fees.",How to Avoid Airline Baggage Fees3," Airlines often charge a fee for a first checked bag, and a higher fee for additional bags (such as $25 for the first bag, and $35 for each additional one). If you are traveling with multiple people, make sure that each pays for their own bag, rather than one person paying for them all--the overall fees will be lower.


For instance, for a group of four people traveling with four bags, it might cost $130 if one person checks and pays for all of the luggage, but only $100 if each person checks and pays for their own.

, Many airlines will offer passengers the option to upgrade to first class or another tier at the last minute for an additional fee. This is usually only offered shortly before departure. While there is a fee for this upgrade, you may decide the comfort and convenience of not having to pay separate baggage fees is worth it. In certain instances, it may even be more affordable than paying baggage fees.For instance, if you are offered an upgrade to first class on Delta for $90, you will be allowed to check up to three bags without an additional fee.
If you were traveling with a group of three, each person checking a bag, your baggage fees might total $95. If one of your group springs for the first-class upgrade and checks all of your bags, you will save a little money.

, Sometimes, the decisions about baggage fees are up to agents at the check-in. This means that if you are extra polite, you might be able to avoid fees.


For instance, if you have a bag that is slightly over the weight limit, you would ordinarily be subject to an overweight baggage fee.
However, if you tell the agent that your bag is only over the weight limit because you had to put a gift for your adorable 3-year old niece in it, you just might get out of paying the fee.

Provide for the creation of bylaws.,
Write how the constitution can be amended.,
Write how the proposed constitution shall be ratified.,
Write how questions concerning the interpretation of the constitution shall be decided.",How to Write a Constitution," Begin your constitution with a preamble. The preamble should introduce the constitution in a few sentences. It should also state the reasons and purpose for which the organization is being formed., After the preamble, write “Article 1: Name.” This article should provide the name of your organization.Section 1 of Article 1 may state, for example: “The name of this organization shall be (insert full name), hereafter referred to as (insert a shortened name).”The shortened name may also be an acronym, and if you use an acronym, this article may say, after stating the full name of the organization, ""This organization will use the name or its acronym (enter acronym) in all publicity materials and correspondence.""Section 2 of Article 2 may state, for example: “The officers of (enter shortened name or acronym) shall make up the Executive Board of (enter shortened name or acronym), hereafter referred to as the ‘Board.’”, This article should be Article 2 of your constitution. Write “Article 2: Purpose.”


Section 1 of Article 2 should provide the purpose of the organization. You can write, for example: “The purpose of this organization shall be (enter in a few sentences the purpose of the organization).”Section 2 of Article 2 should provide the purpose of the executive board. You can write, for example: “The Board shall (enter purpose of the executive board).”, Article 3 of your constitution should provide the rules on membership of the organization. This article should provide the specific requirements of membership, the rights and responsibilities of members, and the grounds for revocation of membership.Section 1 of Article 3 can say, for example: “The general body of the organization must be comprised of at least two-thirds of (enter the group(s) to whom you wish to extend two-thirds majority membership, such as students within a specific department). The requirements of membership are (insert requirements).”Section 2 of Article 3 can say, for example: “The privileges and responsibilities of membership are (enter a list of rights and responsibilities).”Section 3 of Article 3 can say, for example: “Membership may be revoked (by whom and by what procedure) due to (list criteria).” You can also use this section of Article 3 to note any restrictions on membership of specific group(s) of people. Note, however, that in the case of university organizations, it is generally against the rules to exclude people from joining your organization on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.This may also be true of non-university organizations, and it is in your best interest not to include in your constitution arbitrary rules that exclude certain groups from joining your organization for no legitimate reason.
To make clear your nondiscrimination policy, you may write, for example, ""Membership shall be open to all current students, faculty, and staff of (enter name of university), regardless of age, creed, race, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, socioeconomic status, disability, national origin, or status as a veteran. This list is not exhaustive."", Article 4 of your constitution should provide the rules on meetings and procedures for your organization.


Section 1 of Article 4 can state the frequency of meetings and can designate the party who has the right to call meetings.
Section 2 of this article can indicate how policy decisions will be made and how formal voting will take place for the approval of those decisions.You can write, for example, ""A majority of the Board shall constitute a quorum to transact any business. A majority of those voting shall constitute an affirmative vote of the Board. Each Officer shall be entitled to one vote and the vote of the majority of the Board at any meeting at which there is a quorum shall be sufficient to transact business."", Article 5 of your constitution should provide for how officers will be nominated and elected and the eligibility criteria for holding office. This article should also list the duties of officers, the length of their terms, and any restrictions on membership.Section 1 of Article 5 can say, for example: “The organization shall have the following officers…” followed by a list of officer titles. This section should also indicate the methods of nomination and election of these offices and who is eligible to hold these offices.Section 2 of Article 5 can say, for example: “The duties of these officers shall be (list duties).”Section 3 of Article 5 should state the lengths of terms that the officers can hold and any term limits.Section 4 of Article 5 should state the group from which the president and treasurer of the organization may be chosen. You can write, for example: “Only members who are undergraduate students in the College of Engineering may hold the position of president or treasurer.”This section should also state that no member can be president and treasurer at the same time., Article 6 of your constitution should provide the rules on elections, appointment procedures, and removal of members. This article should also provide the rules on interim appointments or elections in the case of a mid-term vacancy.Section 1 of Article 6 can say, for example: “Organizational elections must take place at least once per year.”This section should also provide the general rules on elections, whereas more specific election rules can be written in the organization’s bylaws.The general rules on elections may include, for example, rules on voting procedure. You can write, for example: ""The winners of the elections for representatives shall be determined by plurality vote. No student, however, shall be elected as class representative unless he or she receives the vote of ten percent (10%) of the class from which he or she was elected.""Section 2 of Article 6 should provide the general appointment procedures for appointing officers, whereas more specific appointment procedures can be written in the bylaws.Section 3 of Article 6 can say, for example: “The members of the Board may be impeached and removed (enter grounds for impeachment and removal and enter impeachment and removal procedures).”Section 4 of Article 6 can say, for example: “In the event of a mid-term vacancy of an elected officer…” followed by the procedure for electing an interim or permanent replacement officer., Article 7 of your constitution should provide the names of committees, the duties of each committee, the rules on selection and removal of committee members, and the procedures for formation and dissolution of committees.Section 1 of Article 7 can say, for example: “The standing committees of this organization shall be…” followed by a list of all standing committees.Note: a standing committee is a permanent committee whose purpose is to consider all matters that relate to a particular subject.Section 2 of Article 7 can say, for example: “The duties of each of these standing committees shall be…” followed by a list of the duties.Section 3 of Article 7 should provide the rules on how committee members will be selected and removed.Section 4 of Article 7 can say, for example: “Additional committees may be formed and dissolved by the organization…” followed by the procedures for adding and removing committees., Article 8 of your constitution should provide the rules on how the organization’s and executive board’s bylaws will be created and amended and who has the power to do so.Note: Bylaws are rules that an organization adopts to govern its internal operations and its dealings with others.These rules are intended to complement the constitution. Bylaws can be detailed rules that cannot be covered in detail in the constitution itself.


Section 1 of Article 8 can say, for example: “Bylaws of the organization shall be established and amended by…” followed by the procedures for creating and amending the organization’s bylaws.Section 2 of Article 8 can say, for example: “Bylaws of the Board shall be established and amended by…” followed by the procedures for amending and creating bylaws of the executive board.Bylaws should not contradict anything in the Constitution. Generally, bylaws contain detailed provisions on such topics as membership, dues, duties of officers, the Board, committees, order of business, amendment procedures, and other specific policies and procedures necessary for the organization or its operation., Article 9 of your constitution should provide the rules on amendments to the constitution. This article should state how and by whom amendments can be proposed and what percentage of vote is required for the amendment to be adopted. A common example is two-thirds of the voting membership.This article may state, for example, ""Amendments to the Constitution may be proposed by two-thirds (2⁄3) vote of the Student Council or a petition signed by fifty (50) currently enrolled students."", Article 10 of your constitution should provide for how the constitution you are proposing shall be ratified. This article can say, for example: “This constitution shall be established by a vote of a (insert fraction) majority of the membership of the organization.”A recommended fraction for ratification is a 3/4ths majority., You can write, in Article 11, for example: ""Questions concerning the interpretation of this document shall be decided by the Board."""

Define precedent generally.,
Define precedent in the legal sense.,
Understand the difference between binding and nonbinding precedent.,
Understand stare decisis.,
Read the entire court opinion.,
Identify the main issue addressed in the case.,
Look for language that usually precedes the rule of a case.,
Determine the reasons behind the court’s ruling.,
Identify all of the laws on which the opinion relies.,
Determine how the law applies to the facts of the case.,
Note that the ratio decidendi may be expressed in wide or narrow terms.,
Determine whether the rule of law in your case is broad or narrow.,
Realize that a broad rule of law will tend to apply to many more cases than a narrow rule of law.",How to Understand the Ratio Decidendi (Common Law)," This term refers to an action that happened or something that was done in the past, which serves as a model or guidance for future actions. If you encounter a certain situation, you would look to precedent – or how the situation was handled in the past - in order to handle that situation at the present time. For instance, suppose that you ground your oldest child for two weeks for getting a “D” on his report card. A year later, when your middle child receives a “D” on her report card, you would look to precedent to know how long to ground her. Since your oldest child was grounded for two weeks, then your middle child also should be grounded for two weeks for the same behavior.;
, A precedent is a decision by a judge or a panel of judges that is binding on, or governs, lower courts in the same jurisdiction. It establishes a rule of law, or “ratio decidendi,” that other courts must follow. When one of the lower courts has a case involving the same or similar facts as a precedent, the court must follow the precedent. In the case of the ratio decidendi, the precedent set is the principle or reasoning that has been established in a single case that serves as an example or rule to be followed in subsequent cases.A precedent also may be referred to as the “holding” of a case.
Typically, an appellate court establishes precedent. This could be a U.S. Court of Appeals, the U.S. Supreme Court, or a state appeals or supreme court. However, courts can also look to other equivalent courts for precedent. For instance, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana might look to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Indiana for precedent in some cases.
The other meaning of precedent in law refers to a model document or clause that a lawyer bases the drafting of clauses, contracts, agreements, etc. from.

, Some court decisions are binding on courts, meaning that a court has to follow those decisions. This is the case, for example, if the U.S. Supreme Court establishes a rule on a particular point of law. Any lower courts, such as a U.S. Court of Appeals, must follow the U.S. Supreme Court decision. Non-binding precedent involves decisions by equivalent courts. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit might look at how the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit has ruled on a particular case as nonbinding precedent. It can follow the other court’s decision, or not; it is not required to follow the other court’s ruling because it is not binding precedent., Stare decisis translates to ""let the decision stand"". This means courts considering a certain kind of case generally have to follow the rulings in previous court cases. It also helps people know what to expect when faced with certain legal issues. You can simply to look to previous court decisions in order to find out how a court might rule in your case., A published court opinion may contain many different rules and discuss a number of different laws. Reading the entire opinion first can help you identify and classify all of the issues decided in the case. This technique helps prevent you from improperly focusing in on a sole or minor aspect of the case.

, It is possible for one court opinion to discuss a variety of issues. You must pick out the main issue addressed and decided by the court. This will be the rule or holding of the case., Sometimes a court will make it easy to pick out a holding by using the words “we hold that”, “we find that”, or “our ruling is.” These are all words that should trigger you to look for the rule of the case directly following them.


You might also look to the part of the opinion in which the court identifies which party won the case. The rule may be located near the winning party’s name in the text.
For an appellate court opinion, you can look for the outcome of the appeal. The court usually states that it “reverses” or overturns the lower court’s decision, or that it “affirms,” or agrees with the lower court’s decision.
A useful tool used in many law schools is requiring students to “brief” the court cases that they read. By mapping out the facts, rule of law, analysis, and conclusion separately, you may be able to better understand the rule of law of the case.

, Particularly in appellate court decisions, the judge will go to great lengths to rationalize and provide support for his or her ruling. Including the rationale behind the decision allows other courts to understand why a certain ruling was made and why it should reach the same conclusion in similar cases. Look for keywords such as “reason”, “rationale”, “analysis,” and “conclusion” in identifying the reasons for the court decision., For instance, a case that deals with the sale of goods is likely to involve the “Uniform Commercial Code.” A constitutional law case is likely to concern an amendment to the U.S. Constitution.


As many laws are quite detailed, you also should take note of which section or provision of the law is discussed in this case.

, Judges interpret the law in order to apply it to the facts that are in front of them. By making this interpretation clear in their decisions, judges make it easier for other courts facing similar cases to following their reasoning. Try to discover how the facts impact the judge’s interpretation of the law in the case.For instance, up until the recent U.S. Supreme Court decision, many courts in states nationwide have considered whether there is a fundamental right for gay couples to marry under the U.S. Constitution. Some courts interpreted the Constitution to create a fundamental right to gay marriage. Other courts reached the opposite conclusion by applying the same law to the same facts. This example shows how difficult it can be to apply the law to the facts and how courts can reach completely opposite conclusions.

, A wide or broad rule of law may apply to all types of different factual situations that are similar to the case at hand. In contrast, a narrow or limited rule of law may only apply to a certain set of circumstances.


Some court decisions address a point of law using very broad, generalized principles that can apply to a variety of factual situations. For instance, suppose a case established a rule of law that the Uniform Commercial Code applies to the sale of all motor vehicles. If the precedent case dealt with a truck, a court that later had a similar case involving a car rather than a truck would still follow the same rule of law.
Other decisions are very fact-specific and restricted only to the case in which the rule is stated. A narrow rule of law gives courts the ability to distinguish similar cases based on slightly different facts from the precedent. If a rule of law only applies to a very specific factual situation, then courts won’t be necessarily bound to reach the same result in cases in which the facts vary somewhat.

, The court decision will often state that its ruling is limited to a certain set of facts if it is intended to be a narrow rule of law. Otherwise, if the case is not too fact-specific, it is likely to be a broader rule of law.

, A broad rule of law will encompass many cases and fact situations because it is not limited to a particular set of facts. A narrow rule of law may only ever apply to a single case and set of circumstances.

Contact your Congressional representative.,
Present the need for your bill.,
Be prepared for a long wait.",How to Write a Bill for the United States Congress," When writing a bill for the U.S. Congress, you must understand that you are proposing a law that will take effect over the entire country. To generate the support that is needed in order to pass, you will need an issue that has nationwide appeal. Read national newspapers and watch national news broadcasts to find issues of wide interest and importance.Issues that affect everyone in everyday life are good candidates. For example, you might consider topics related to our national food supply, energy use, national security or other general topics of concern.;
, You must also realize that your local Representative or Senator will need to champion your cause and introduce your bill in Congress. Therefore, the topic must be something that generates strong enough local concern to catch the attention of your legislator. If you can generate strong local support, then you will be more likely to convince your legislator that the bill is important enough to introduce into Congress.As an example, if you live in a state where fishing is a major industry, you may see a need for a law that limits pleasure boats in designated fishing waters. This is a topic that would probably find great support among many residents of your state.
You may choose to set up an online petition or survey tool to measure public opinion on this question.

, To do the job well, you will be devoting many hours to research, writing and lobbying on your bill. Select a topic that you believe in entirely. Your passion for the subject will carry through to your writing and will help generate support among other people. You may also base the bill on your own personal experience or expertise.For example, if you are the parent of a special needs student, you may choose to research special education laws and draft a bill that enhances the services that are required for such students.

, You are going to need to know everything you can about the topic before you can present a bill to Congress. Use any available resources that you can to learn about the issue. Research the problem, as you see it currently, and gather data and statistics. Investigate possible solutions and try to determine what costs would be associated with the solution that you are proposing.You may wish to begin with a reference librarian at your public library to begin your research. From there, as your research continues, you may find yourself investigating specialized sources of information, visiting law libraries, or speaking with experts in the field.

, Part of your research can be in the form of public opinion. As you learn more about the topic, you should try to find out how much of the general public identifies the same issues and concerns that you have. Any of the following can be useful ways to gather public opinion and support:


Conduct informal gatherings of neighbors.
Organize a small town meeting at a community center, church or library meeting room.
Ask to speak at meetings of your local school PTA, civic organizations, chamber of commerce or other organized groups.

, Start a campaign on Facebook or Twitter. These are increasingly powerful tools for sharing your views with a nationwide audience. You can also use online petition tools to gather support. If you craft a well-worded online petition, you can get people to “e-sign” it and demonstrate that they hold the same beliefs you do.


As an example, the Attorney General of Massachusetts recently initiated a social media campaign to gain support for legislation that was being proposed for a law in that state.Gather data from your online presence, such as the number of signatures you have on your online petition or the number of followers or likes that you get on Twitter or Facebook. This data, if it is positive, can help generate support among legislators.

, If possible, try to arrange an early meeting with your Congressional representatives. Even if your bill is not yet written, it can be a powerful beginning to discuss the topic with your elected official. If you can judge your representative's level of interest, you may gain some insight into the way to write your bill.


For example, if you wish to propose a piece of gun control legislation, but you find out that your representative is very much opposed to gun control, you may choose to go in a different direction. You might tailor your bill to be more moderate, in hopes of building stronger support for it.

, It can be helpful to understand how other bills before Congress are currently being treated. You don’t want to draft a bill that is very similar to something already exists. You can find out what topics gain attention and what topics to avoid. Some sources for such research include:


Congress.gov. This is a free, publicly accessible database with current information on bills before Congress. It has the most current information about committee debates, bills currently before Congress, and upcoming hearing schedules. You can find this information at www.congress.gov.
National Journal. This is a source that provides current research and information on a wide range of political topics in and around Washington, D.C. You can find the access to the National Journal at www.nationaljournal.com., The title is the first part of your bill that will catch people’s attention and immediately begin to generate interest. If you construct a positively worded title, you can build support before people even get to the text of it. For example, a bill that is titled “A Bill in Favor of Increased Gun Control” is likely to turn away many people. In contrast, the same issue could be presented as “A Bill to Improve Safety in Public Places” is going to build much more positive support., In a brief statement, explain the objective of the law you propose. Other legislators who are considering your proposal will need to be able to read this one statement and envision voting for it.For example, the No Child Left Behind Act of 2002 gave as its purpose, “The purpose and intent of this title are to ensure that all children have a fair and equal opportunity to obtain a high-quality education.”

, The next section of your bill should identify the individuals for whom the bill is intended, or for whom it is not intended. You will need to define the people who are covered by the proposed legislation. For example, a bill to propose a national minimum wage salary might state that it applies to “all workers who are legally employed within the United States, who have a valid permit to work in the United States, and who have not been convicted of any drug-related offense within the past six months.”Alternatively, you could define the bill’s application with a statement of exception, by defining those people who are not covered by the proposed legislation. For example, a bill proposing gun control might state, “The requirements of this legislation do not apply to members of any local, state or federal law enforcement agency.”

, Any terms that you include in your bill that will have a particular meaning should be listed and defined in this section. Even if you think that a term is self-explanatory, you should list it and give its definition. The definition section is also the place where you can include such restrictions as age, nationality, residence requirements and so on.For example, it is not unusual for a word as common as “individual” to be defined, particularly if an “individual” might include not only living people but also corporations, partnerships or other legal entities.

, This is the real heart of the bill. This is the section that provides the requirements that you wish to propose. In this section you need to make your statements as clear and concise as possible, so there can be no confusion or misunderstanding about your intentions. Much of the debate that occurs with regard to a bill centers on this section.The length and organization of this section will depend on the complexity of your issue. A simple bill may be as brief as one sentence long. A more complex bill may need to be broken into sections and subsections.


Plan the organization of your bill. Each main requirement should be written as a separate section and should be introduced using the labels ""Section One,"" ""Section Two,"" and so on. More specific, defining statements should be inserted as subsections.

, Many laws do not become immediately effective upon passing and being signed by the President. In many cases, you need to allow some time for transition and preparation before a new idea becomes a requirement. For example, if you are proposing a change to the national minimum wage, requiring the change to take effect immediately upon passage would cause chaos for many businesses, who would need to make changes to payroll systems and budgets and determine how the new wage would have to change their workforce.


It is common for a bill to include a section that says, “This legislation becomes effective six months after the date of enactment.” If no effective date is provided, then the bill becomes effective immediately upon being signed by the President.

, It is generally understood that a bill that requires some act by the government will cost money. However, it is not appropriate for the bill itself to include its own budget. Budgeting the government is an entirely separate task. It is appropriate, however, for your bill to include language that might limit funding, either to a number of years or a specified amount of money.As an example, your bill might include an appropriations section that says, “Congress shall appropriate such funds as necessary for up to ten years from the date of enactment of this legislation.” This would limit funding for ten years, unless Congress takes additional action within that time to extend the provision.

, You need to get the attention of your legislator for your bill to get to Congress. The first step is to reach out to your Representative or Senator to discuss the issue. You can find contact information for all federal elected representatives at the government site www.USA.gov/elected-officials. Follow the link to “Contact federal elected officials” to find your own Representative or Senator.The link will lead you to the legislators’ Washington, D.C., addresses and official email addresses. Legislators also have local, in-state offices. For this information, you may conduct a search directly for the name of your legislator, or check your state’s official government website.
Some representatives conduct open office hours specifically to meet constituents. If that is not available, you should contact your legislator's office and try to schedule a meeting. You may need to begin by meeting or speaking with an aide. Take whatever opportunity you can get.

, When you can schedule a meeting, whether with your legislator or an aide, you should be ready with a brief presentation. You will need to convince your legislator that your bill is one that deserves to become a federal law. You should be prepared to discuss your research, any data you have collected, and the drafting that you have already put into preparing the bill. Understand that members of Congress and their staff have many demands on their time.


You should present your information as concisely as possible, and then offer more detail if the legislator wishes to review it.

, After you get the bill that you have drafted into the hands of your Representative or Senator, the process for that bill to become a law is really only just beginning. The legislator will have to introduce the bill in Congress, where it will be discussed, debated, transferred to one or more committees, reviewed in more detail, edited, and eventually voted on. This is a very long process."

Locate the appropriate appellate court.,

Copy the caption.,
Insert the title.,
Compose the body.,
Insert signature block.,
Append a Certificate of Service.,
File the Notice of Appeal.,
Pay fees.,
Serve the notice on the other parties.",How to Write a Letter of Appeal," Every court sits in a hierarchy made up of other courts. You appeal a court's decision to the court that sits directly above it. If you do not know which court to appeal to, ask the judge after he has issued his ruling or check with the clerk court.


In the federal court system, district court decisions are appealed to the circuit courts, whose decisions may be appealed to the Supreme Court.In state courts, trial court decisions are generally appealed to intermediate appellate courts, who in turn may be appealed to the state’s Supreme Court.
There are many exceptions. For example, specialized courts exist at both the state and federal level. A federal bankruptcy court’s decisions are often appealable to the district court or to a special Bankruptcy Appellate Panel.;
, Each court has rules for proper formatting as well as deadlines. You should get the rules and read them.


Pay close attention to deadlines for filing. If you miss the deadline, a court will dismiss your appeal.
Deadlines vary by state and court. In Illinois civil cases, you have 30 days from the date of the final judgment entered into the trial court.In California, you typically have 60 days.But in Pima County, Arizona you only get 14 days. Because the deadlines can vary, it is critically important to find and read the appellate rules for the court you are appealing to.
Typically, you can find rules on the internet. Texas, for example, has a PDF you can download, as does Florida.

, Many courts have pre-printed forms which you can fill out and file as your Notice of Appeal. Even if your court does not have a pre-printed form, you can use one as a model for creating your own.


There are many examples on the internet of forms for federal and courts.

, If you lost at trial, then the plaintiff can move to enforce its judgment against you even though you have the right to an appeal. The plaintiff could garnish your wages or put a lien on property. If you win on appeal, you can get the money back, but the plaintiff may have spent it already or else be insolvent.


The bond prevents the creditor from garnishing assets during the pendency of the appeal. Unless you can put sufficient cash in escrow, you may have to secure a bond from a third party.To secure a bond at a favorable rate, you should meet with banks you already do business with and discuss getting a bond., The caption is the heading of a legal document. It lays out the parties, the case number, and the name of the court hearing the case.


Almost every document that you file should have the same caption. Simply copy this information and format it into a new document.
In some jurisdictions, you will use the name of the court which will hear the appeal instead of the name of the court that heard the trial. Check with your appellate rules.

, Two lines below the bottom of the caption center the words ""Notice of Appeal."" Make the words bold.

, The body of the notice should tell the court what you are appealing. Include the following information:


Your name and the case you are appealing from (e.g., “I, John Smith, in the above captioned action…”)
The court you are appealing to (e.g., “…do appeal to the …”
The order you are appealing and the court which issued it (e.g., “…from the judgment entered against me by the on …”)
Request for relief: what you want the appellate court to do (e.g., “…and request that the judgment be reversed and the case sent back to the lower court for a new trial.”)

, Beneath the body, insert room for your signature. Underneath the signature line, type your full name, address, and telephone number.

, You must serve the other parties in your lawsuit notice that you intend to appeal. You can do this by sending them copies of your completed Notice of Appeal. You must certify to the Court that you have notified them.


You can give notice in several ways. For example, many courts allow for notice by mail. If you can serve notice by mail, type, ""I hereby certify on that I have served a copy of this Notice of Appeal by to the parties at the addresses listed below."" Then list the parties, including their addresses, and sign and date the certification.
If you choose to mail, be sure to send by certified mail.
You may also hire a process server to deliver the notice, or deliver it yourself. In this case, type, ""I hereby certify on that the attached Notice of Appeal was delivered by hand to the parties listed at the addresses below.” Then list the parties and their addresses, followed by your signature and the date.

, You can hand deliver it to the court. Typically, you will file the Notice with the court from which you are appealing. The clerk should direct you to the right court.


If you file in person, be sure to take copies of the Notice and have them time-stamped. You will keep a copy for your records but also send a stamped copy to the other party.

, In most jurisdictions, you must pay a fee for filing a notice of appeal. Call ahead to ask for the amount as well as acceptable methods of payment.


If you are posting a bond, then take the bond with you. You can post it at the same time that you file your notice of appeal. Ask the clerk how.

, Put a time-stamped copy of the Notice in an envelope and mail it. You may also have it served.


Send by certified mail so that you have proof that the Notice was received.

Read Article 2 of the United Nations Charter.,
Note that Article 2 (1) makes it clear that the UN is based on the sovereign equality of all its members.,
Read Articles 2 (3) and 2 (4) together.,
Note that under Article 2 (5), every country is required to support the United Nations when it takes action under the UN Charter and must refrain from assisting countries against which the United Nations is taking preventive or enforcement action.

,
Understand that the UN has an obligation to ensure that countries not belonging to the United Nations follow the foundational principles laid out in the UN Charter, in order to maintain international peace and security.

,
Recognise that the UN is unable to interfere with domestic or country internal matters.",How to Understand the Basic Principles of the United Nations," This Article contains the basic principles that guide the United Nations.;
, This means that every country is sovereign and independent, which ensures that every country has an equal say in the UN. There are some notable exceptions to this, namely the formation of the Security Council and the International Court of Justice, but every country who is a member of the UN has equal voting power in the General Assembly.

, These two Articles concern the settlement of disputes by peaceful means and the fundamental obligation to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any country. These two rules are very important foundational rules that have directed international relations since 1945.

,,, This is noted by Article 2 (7). The role of the United Nations is to facilitate and promote relations between countries that are members of the UN rather than to tell them what to do on their own territory. Exceptions to this, however, include human rights law and international environmental law but even then, it is often very hard for the United Nations to intervene where the issue is solely internal, such as civil war. In recent years, the UN has become more reliant on insisting that the violation of human rights within a country can give rise to a threat to international peace and security and thereby trigger UN intervention.

Ask why.,
Accept ambiguity.",How to Think Like a Lawyer," To see all the possible issues in a set of facts, lawyers look at the situation from different perspectives. Putting yourself in others’ shoes allows you to understand other points of view.


On law school exams, students learn to structure their answers using the acronym IRAC, which stands for Issue, Rule, Analysis and Conclusion. Failure to spot all possible issues can derail the entire answer.For example, suppose you’re walking down a street and notice a ladder leaned against a building. A worker on the top rung is reaching far to his left, cleaning a window. There are no other workers present, and the bottom of the ladder juts out onto the sidewalk where people are walking. Issue spotting involves not only looking at this situation from the viewpoint of the worker and the person walking on the street, but also the building owner, the worker’s employer, and potentially even the city where the building is located.;
, There’s a reason you might say you were “blinded” by anger or another emotion -- feelings aren’t rational and keep you from seeing facts that may be important to solving a problem.


Accurately spotting the issues is important to determine which facts are relevant and important. Emotions and sentiment can cause you to become attached to details that bear little to no importance to the outcome of the situation.
Thinking like a lawyer requires putting aside personal interests or emotional reactions to focus on real, provable facts. For example, suppose a criminal defendant stands charged with molesting a small child. Police arrested him near a playground, and immediately began asking him why he was there and his intentions regarding the children playing nearby. The distraught man confessed he planned to harm the children. The details of the case may be revolting, but the defense attorney will set aside the emotional trauma and focus on the fact that the defendant was not informed of his right to remain silent before he was questioned., Non-lawyers may perceive this ability as a moral failing in lawyers, but it doesn’t mean lawyers don’t believe in anything. The ability to argue both sides of an issue means you understand that there are two sides to every story, each of which has potentially valid points.


When you learn how to make opposing arguments, you also learn how to hear them, which increases tolerance and allows more problems to be solved cooperatively., Deductive reasoning is one of the hallmarks of thinking like a lawyer. In law, this pattern of logic is used when applying a rule of law to a particular fact pattern.

, A syllogism is a particular type of deductive reasoning often used in legal reasoning, and asserts that what is true for a general group will also be true for all specific individuals in that same group.Syllogisms consist of three parts: a general statement, a particular statement, and a conclusion about the particular based on the general.
The general statement typically is broad and nearly universally applicable. For example, you might say “All dirty floors show negligence.”
The particular statement refers to a specific person or set of facts, such as “This restaurant's floor is dirty.”
The conclusion relates the particular back to the general. Having stated a universal rule, and having established that your particular person is a part of the group covered by the universal rule, you can now arrive at your conclusion: “This restaurant floor shows negligence.”

, Sometimes you don’t have a general rule, but you can see several similar situations in which the same thing happened. Inductive reasoning allows you to conclude that if the same thing happens enough times, you can draw a general rule that it will always happen.


Inductive reasoning doesn’t enable you to make any guarantees that your conclusion is true. However, if something happens regularly, it’s probable enough for you to rely on when creating a rule.
For example, suppose no one’s told you that, as a general rule, a dirty floor shows negligence on the part of a shop employee or shop owner. However, you observe a pattern in several cases where a customer slipped and fell and the judge ruled the owner was negligent. Because of his negligence, the owner had to pay for the customer's injuries. Based on your knowledge of these cases, you conclude that if a shop floor is dirty, the shop owner is negligent.
Only knowing a few examples may not be sufficient to create a rule you can rely on to any great extent. The larger the proportion of individual cases in a group that share the same trait, the more likely the conclusion is to be true., When lawyers argue a case by comparing it to an earlier case, they’re using an analogy.


Lawyers try to win a new case by demonstrating that its facts are substantially similar to the facts in an old case, and thus the new case should be decided the same way as the old case was.
Law professors teach law students to reason by analogy by proposing hypothetical sets of facts for them to analyze. Students read a case and then apply that case’s rules to those different scenarios.
Comparing and contrasting facts also helps you determine which facts are important to the outcome of the case, and which are irrelevant or trivial.For example, suppose a girl in a red dress is walking through a store when she slips and falls on a banana peel. The girl sues the store for her injuries and wins because the judge rules the store owner was negligent in not sweeping the floor. Thinking like a lawyer means identifying which of the facts were important to the judge in deciding the case.
In the next town over, a girl in a blue dress is walking to her table at a café when she slips and falls on a muffin wrapper. If you’re thinking like a lawyer, you’ve probably concluded that this case has the same outcome as the previous one. The girl’s location, the color of her dress, and what she tripped on are all irrelevant details. The important, and analogous, facts are an injury that occurred because a store owner was negligent in his or her duty to keep the floors clean.

, Like emotions, assumptions create blind spots in your thinking. Lawyers seek evidence to prove every factual statement, and assume nothing is true without proof.

, You may have had experience with a young child who asked “why?” after everything you said. Although that can get annoying, it’s also part of thinking like a lawyer.


Lawyers refer to why a law was made as its ‘‘policy.’’ The policy behind a law can be used to argue that new facts or circumstances should also fall under the law.
For example, suppose that in 1935, the city council enacted a law prohibiting vehicles in the public park. The law was enacted primarily for safety concerns, after a small child was hit by a car. In 2014, the city council was asked to consider whether the 1935 statute prohibited drones. Are drones vehicles? Would prohibiting drones advance the law’s policy? Why? If you’re asking those questions (and recognizing arguments that can be made on both sides), you’re thinking like a lawyer.
Thinking like a lawyer also means not taking anything for granted. Understanding why something happened, or why a certain law was enacted, enables you to apply the same rationale to other fact patterns and reach a logical conclusion.

, Legal issues are seldom black and white. Life is too complex for legislators to account for every possibility when they write a law.


Ambiguities allow for flexibility, so laws don’t have to be rewritten every time a new scenario comes along. For example, the Constitution has been interpreted to relate to electronic surveillance, a technological advance the Framers couldn’t have imagined.
Much of thinking like a lawyer involves being comfortable with nuances and gray areas. However, just because those gray areas exist doesn’t mean distinctions are meaningless."

Learn a little background information first.,
Understand that the bill is first introduced.,
Learn that the person introducing the bill may hire a representative to speak in the House of Representatives.,
Learn that after the hearing of the bill is scheduled, the committee hears the bill.,
Understand that when the bill makes it to the two chambers of congress, it is sent to the House of Representatives.,
Know that once the bill is sent to the two chambers of congress for voting, the bill can no longer be changed.,
Understand that when the bill is successful in each of the two Chambers of Congress, the House and Senates version of the bill may be different.,
Know that after the compromise version of the bill is created, the committee votes on the bill.,
Know that the compromise version of the bill is then sent to the two chambers of congress again for voting.,
Afterwards, the bill is sent to the Governor.,
Realise that even if the Governor sends the bill back to the two chambers of Congress, the two chambers can vote on the bill again.",How to Understand How a Bill Becomes a Law," In the legislative branch, there are two groups. One is The House of Representatives, and one is the Senate. Both are part of the legislative branch, with each group containing a certain number of people (The number is different for each state.) These two groups in the legislative branch will be referred as the two chambers of congress throughout this article.;
, In the legislative branch, anyone in the House of representatives or the Senate can propose a bill.

, After the House has listened to the bill, it is sent to the appropriate committee. (Ex. the Traffic Committee, Agricultural Committee, Electronics Committee.)

, Afterwards, the committee votes on the bill. If the vote has at least 51% support for the bill, it advances to the House of Representatives and Senates. However, if the minority of the people go for the bill, it is killed.

, At this point, amendments of the bill can be made. (For example, if the bill proposes that water supply be limited for each home, a person could say that drinking water would be an exception to the bill).

, If the majority of the people vote for the bill for each group, it progresses on. However, if less than half of the people vote for the bill, it is killed.

, To solve this problem, a committee of five people from each chamber is chosen to work out an in-between version of the bill.

, For the bill to move on, more than half of the people from the committee from each chamber must vote for the bill for it to progress. (In this case, at least 3 people from each chamber must vote for the bill for it to move on.

, At least the majority of the people from each chamber must vote for bill for it to progress.

, At that point, he or she has 10 days to veto or approve of the bill, after which the bill will come into effect without the signature of the Governor. If the Governor approves of the bill, it is taken into action. However, if the Governor wants to go against the bill, he or she can veto the bill and send it back to the two chambers of Congress.

, If at least two thirds of the people from both chambers votes for the bill, the veto is overruled, and it is taken into action. Otherwise, the bill is killed.

Complete and return the interrogatory answers within 30 days.",How to Respond to Interrogatory Questions," In most courts, you must submit your responses to interrogatories within 30 days from the date they are delivered to you or your attorney. Recall that this time includes meeting with your attorney (if you have one), collecting relevant documents, reviewing and preparing your answers, typing the response, reviewing the responses with your attorney, copying the responses, and delivering them to the other party. It’s not a lot of time, so get started right away., If you have an attorney, then most likely he received the interrogatories and has sent them to you with instructions to answer them. He has probably already identified the ones that deserve legal objections, and he will handle that part of it. You should sit with your attorney, read through the questions together, and briefly discuss what your answers will be for each one. Your attorney can guide you to make sure that your answers are consistent and appropriate for your overall case., Read each question before you answer any of them. Read through all of the information and evidence made available to you, as well.Reviewing related documents will allow you to form answers that are complete and accurate.
Make sure that you understand each question before you answer it. If you are uncertain about a particular question, consult with your attorney.

, Before you start writing down answers to the interrogatories, it may help you to pull together any paperwork, contracts, receipts, witness statements, or whatever other information you may have that is relevant to the case. That way, when you get to certain questions that ask for names, dates, or other specific information, you can more easily look it up.You are not required to conduct any special research in order to answer interrogatories, but you are expected to look up some information that you would reasonably have available.
For example, suppose you are involved in a car accident case because your brakes didn’t work, and the other party asks you, “What was the number of accidents caused by brake failure in the U.S. in the past five years?” You should object, because you cannot be expected to look up this information.
On the other hand, suppose you are asked, “How many times have you had your brakes serviced since you purchased the car?” This is a reasonable interrogatory. Even if it means that you may have to estimate or look through car repair receipts, you should answer it. In the end, if you truly don’t know, you could estimate or answer that you don’t know.

, Look through the interrogatories that you received and simply count to make sure that the opposing party has not exceeded the allowable limit. When you are counting, if a question is presented in multiple parts, you can count it as multiple questions.Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule Number 33, allows 25 questions, “including all discrete subparts.” This means that you can break a multiple part question into its parts and count each part. The Federal Rules will apply if your case is in Federal Court.
State rules apply in state courts, and may allow more or fewer than the Federal Rules. In most states, the Rules of Civil Procedure will follow the same numbering structure as the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. If Federal Rule Number 33 covers interrogatories, then in your state court’s rules it will probably also be Rule Number 33.
For example, a question that says, “Identify each person who was present at the accident scene and describe what each person did immediately following the accident,” is really two questions: (1) Identify each person and (2) Describe what each person did following the accident. Count this interrogatory as two questions.

, Interrogatories are a chance for either party to a law suit to get information from the other party by asking questions. However, there are some limits to what can be done with interrogatories, and if your opponent goes too far, don’t be afraid to raise an objection. If you are working with an attorney, he will probably point out the objections first. But if you have concerns, ask him about it., Each interrogatory is supposed to ask only one question. If the interrogatory raises multiple questions in one, this may be grounds to object.An example of an impermissibly compound objection would be, ""Name each person who was present at the accident, and for each person describe what he or she saw, give that person's address and work experience, and provide a history of the repairs that you have had done on the car.""

, If possible, interpret each question in a way that can be answered. But if, no matter how you try, you cannot make sense of a question or find a way to give a specific answer, then object.For example, if the question asks, “When did he do it?” without any more specification, you need to object because you cannot be expect to know who “he” is or what “it” is.

, For example, if a question asks, ""What did the passenger in your car say when you ran through the red light?"" is objectionable if it is not clear that you did run through the light.

, Interrogatories must ask questions that are, at the very least, relevant to the case. Any question that asks for too much detail that goes beyond the scope of the lawsuit is objectionable.For example, if you are in a contract dispute case regarding a specific purchase, and you are given an interrogatory that says, “Please identify your annual income for the past three years and provide copies of tax returns,” this would be objectionable. Your income probably has nothing to do with the contract in question.

, If you are represented by an attorney, then he or she, in fact, will be the one who is technically making the objections. Your role is to provide answers to questions. The attorney's role is to make legal objections.

, “List” questions are those questions that will directly ask you to list specific pieces of related information. You must provide each known piece of information requested.An example of a standard list question might read, ""List the names, business addresses, dates of employment, and rates of pay regarding all employers for whom you have worked over the past five years.""
Leaving information off your list can prevent various witnesses and evidence from being introduced. Moreover, if the information you omit is revealed during the trial, the validity of your testimony could be called into question.
When asked for dates, be precise if possible, but do not guess. If you can only remember the month and year, then say so. If you can only remember the year, then say that. However, if you can readily find the answer for a precise date, you should do so.
When necessary, go through your records to answer list questions as thoroughly as possible.
If you know that there is information you are unable to recall and do not have records for, mention this fact after completing the rest of the list.

, Yes-or-no questions are fairly straightforward. The first part of the question will ask a closed-ended question that you'll need to answer with a ""yes"" or ""no."" The second part of the question will ask you to provide further detail.For example, a yes-or-no question might ask something like, ""Were you receiving treatment for any physical disability or sickness during the time of the complaint? If so, state the nature of the condition, the type of treatment, the date you began treatment, and the physician in charge of your treatment.""
If your answer is ""no,"" all you need to do is write ""no."" Do not answer the second part of the question.
If your answer is ""yes,"" you will need to answer the second part of the question with information that is both thorough and accurate.

, Narrative questions are open-ended and ask you to describe events related to the case. Provide accurate, complete information, but do not answer more than is necessary. If adding some particular details will help your case, then include them. But do not feel compelled to include details that may not help your case.An example of a narrative question could be something like, ""Describe in detail the actions you performed leading up to the accident mentioned in the complaint, including the known results of each action.""
Provide brief answers that address all of the points raised in the question while mentioning little else. Do not include irrelevant details, and make sure that your answers do not shift the blame for an incident to yourself.
If you are asked to answer what you could have done to avoid an accident or incident, don't guess or speculate on what actions you may have taken. It is better to write, ""There was nothing I could do to prevent it” or even simply “I don’t know what else could have been done.”
If describing injuries, mention any and all injuries linked to the incident, including those you believe to be minor. Remember that any facts you leave out of your interrogatory answers might not later be admitted in court.

, Some questions may ask about your plan for the trial, such as, “List all expert witnesses you intend to call at trial.” At the time that you are dealing with the interrogatories, you may not have yet identified any expert witnesses. So you will answer, “No expert witnesses are known at this time. I reserve the right to amend this answer if and when any are identified.” Then, if you do find an expert witness that you will use at trial, make sure you send the opposing party a letter that add this name to your answer.In the final preparation stage for trial, there will be a time for each party to provide a full list of witnesses and exhibits that are going to be used at the trial. Your list of witnesses or exhibits at this time should match whatever information you previously provided in responses to interrogatories. If they don’t match, your opponent could raise an objection and delay the trial or prevent your witness from testifying.

, Interrogatory responses should be headed with the “caption” of your lawsuit. This will include the name of the court centered at the top of the page, the name of the case (e.g., “Smith, Plaintiff, vs. Jones, Defendant”), and the case number, something like CV-16-12345 (the case number will have been assigned by the court clerk when the case was filed and needs to appear on all documents). Then you will title the paper, “Defendant’s Answers to Plaintiff’s First Set of Interrogatories” (assuming that you are the defendant and this was the first set).Either party may serve interrogatories on any other party in the case.
It is permissible to send more than one set of interrogatories, as long as the total number of questions does not exceed the number allowed by the rules of civil procedure. So, for instance, a party could send the “First Set of Interrogatories” that contains ten initial questions, and then after reviewing the answers to those questions, submit a “Second Set of Interrogatories” with fifteen additional, more specific questions.
If you have an attorney representing you, then you probably will not need to worry about this step. You will just provide the answers, and the attorney or his or her staff will make sure that the page is set up correctly.

, As a general rule, you should write your answers on a separate document, not respond directly on the page you received from the other party. This document can be a computer file or a typed, printed response.Legible handwritten replies may also be sent but are not preferred.
Generally, for legibility, your responses should be double-spaced and printed on one side of the page only.
If possible, without becoming overly burdensome, you should retype each interrogatory and follow the question with your answer. In most courts, repeating the question is not required, but it is helpful and generally expected, to make reviewing the answers easier. Your response will look something like this:

INTERROGATORY NO. 1:
ANSWER NO. 1:
INTERROGATORY NO. 2:
ANSWER NO. 2:



, You do not list objections separately. If you have any objections to particular interrogatories, you will present them instead of an answer. If you can answer part of a question but part of it is objectionable, then answer what you can and object to the rest. For example, the following might be what your response would look like if you were involved in a case about a car accident:


INTERROGATORY NO. 17: Identify the make and model of the car you were driving at the time of the accident, and provide the number of similar accidents involving that make and model car in the U.S. for the past year.
ANSWER NO. 17: I was driving a 2013 Honda Accord. I object to the remainder of the question as it requests information that is overly broad, irrelevant to this case, and calls for additional factual research.

, In legal terms, a “verified” answer is one that you have signed at the end. You need to include a statement at the end of your interrogatory answers that says, “I verify under oath that the answers to these interrogatories are true to the best of my ability,” and then sign it.If you are represented by an attorney, and the attorney provided language for any objections, then the attorney will also sign in support of those objections.
Some attorneys disagree on whether you need to include the words “under oath” in your statement. As long as your answers really are true, you should probably include the “under oath” language. If your answers are intentionally false (i.e., you are lying), and you sign the statement “under oath,” then you could be charged with the crime of perjury. If you tell the truth, to the best of your ability, you have nothing to worry about. The rule on this may differ from state to state as well.
In some states, your answers may need to be signed in front of a notary as well.

, Even if you save the document on your computer, make a copy of your signed interrogatory answers before sending them out. You will need to send a copy to every party in the case.The original must be sent directly to the requesting attorney or self-represented party who sent the interrogatories.
In some cases, there may be more than one plaintiff, or more than one defendant. You need to send a copy of your responses to everyone involved in the case.

, Under most circumstances and in most states, you must answer and return the responses to interrogatories withing 30 days of receiving them.The exact deadline can vary if the judge presiding over the case decides to set a different time limit. In such instances, the new deadline should be clearly stated when the interrogatory is delivered to you.
If you have a valid reason for being unable to meet the deadline, speak to your attorney about the possibility of requesting an extension. If you are not represented by an attorney, then call the other party (or his or her attorney) directly and discuss an extension. Most attorneys will be reasonable about discovery, if you act reasonably as well.
If you fail to complete and return the interrogatory by the deadline, the court could sanction you or take other legal action against you. If you are just late, then at first, the court may just order you to answer. But if you continue to delay or refuse to answer, the court could order a financial fine against you, could limit your ability to present certain evidence or witnesses, or take some other action that the judge thinks is appropriate.

Mention that you need a subpoena for a witness. There are different subpoenas if you want to request documents.

Start the subpoena process early. You typically can’t serve a subpoena on a witness the day before you expect them to testify. Instead, you might need to give a certain amount of notice, such as two weeks or even longer. Read your state’s rules to find out how much notice to give.;
, Each court requests slightly different information, but you generally will need to provide the following:The witness’ name and address.
The name of the court.
The title of the action (which is typically the names of the parties, e.g., “Smith v. Smith”).
The type of subpoena.
Attorney information (if you are an attorney).
A command that they testify at a certain time and place.

, Check to see if the clerk needs to sign off on the subpoena.Usually, they do. You should also make a copy for your own records., Acceptable methods of service will vary, depending on the jurisdiction. You should read your state law on subpoenas to check. Generally, courts allow the following methods:The sheriff might serve the subpoena.
You can hire a process server for a fee. Check online or in the phone book. Process servers usually charge around $45-65 to make service.
You can ask someone over 18 to hand deliver the subpoena, provided this person is not a party to the case.
You might be able to mail the subpoena certified mail, restricted delivery.

, In many jurisdictions, you need to pay the witness a fee to attend your deposition, hearing, or trial. You may also need to pay a mileage fee.Check your state law to see if this applies to your situation.

Always have proof that you’ve made payment. For example, pay with a check and then get a copy of the canceled check.

, You should receive proof that the subpoena was served, typically in the form of an affidavit signed by the server.Keep this paperwork, since you might need to prove to the judge that service was made. Also check whether you need to file the affidavit with the court., Depending on your jurisdiction, you might need to send a copy of the subpoena to all other parties to the lawsuit. For example, if you’re suing two people, then both defendants will need a copy of your subpoena.Check how you can send the copy to other parties. Usually, you can fax or mail it—you don’t have to personally serve it.

, Find your copy of the subpoena as well as proof that service was made (typically an affidavit). Also find proof that you paid any required witness fees. You’ll need to show the judge you followed all the rules when you sent the subpoena., You need to ask the judge to enforce the subpoena. Type up a short motion and an affidavit in which you explain the witness has not shown up to testify. Typically, the judge will issue an “order to show cause,” which is an order for the witness to show up to court and explain why they didn’t comply with the subpoena.

You might be able to make an oral motion to the judge, especially if you are in the middle of a hearing or trial. For example, you can say, “Your Honor, my witness, Mrs. Kathy Smith, has not shown up even though I served her with a subpoena.” Show the judge your paperwork.

, Typically, you can serve it in the same manner that you served the subpoena. However, double check by reading the court rules. Hold onto proof you made service., The judge will give your witness a chance to explain why they didn’t show up to testify. For example, they might argue you didn’t complete the subpoena correctly or serve it properly. If the judge decides you did everything right, they’ll order the witness to testify.A witness who refuses to testify can be held in contempt and arrested. They might also be fined until they agree to finally comply.

Understand the direct meaning of ""obiter dicta."",
Note the relevancy of obiter dicta in future court decisions.,
Realize that obiter dicta may take different forms.,
Spend some time looking for obiter dicta when reviewing a case.,
Identify the holding or ruling in the court opinion.,
Isolate all language in the case, both facts and law, that directly supports the rule of the case.,
Consider the remaining language in the case.,
Determine the significance of the dicta at issue.,
Understand that judicial dicta still do not constitute binding authority.,
Distinguish obiter dicta by asking whether it supports or relates to the holding of the case.",How to Understand Obiter Dicta (Common Law)," With respect to court opinions, obiter dicta are the thoughts or observations stated in a case that are not directly relevant to the outcome of the case. While these thoughts may not pertain to the case at hand, they do have the potential to inform or guide future court decisions. decision-making.


Obiter dicta is also regularly referred to as simply “dicta.”;
, Obiter dicta can guide, inform, or enlighten future case reasoning, but they are not binding. This means that a future court does not have to follow any rule or observation made as obiter dicta in a previous court case. Rather, a court only need follow the rule of the case. Given that obiter dicta do not form a part of the reasoning of the case, subsequent courts can dismiss obiter dicta outright. Nevertheless, some obiter dicta have proven to be very influential in subsequent cases.Another commonly used term for obiter dicta is persuasive authority. Obiter dicta are not binding or mandatory authority for a court facing a similar case in the future. However, they can be used as persuasive authority or support for one’s opinion on whatever matter they address.
Whether or not a court will rely on obiter dicta in reaching a future decision is unknown. While some judges may utilize it to support a point or ruling, other judges may disregard it altogether. There is no requirement that judges use or even consider obiter dicta.

, Some of the more commonly used types of obiter dicta include “what if” scenarios, “we are leaving this issue open for the future” statements, analogies, illustrations, and hypotheticals. Courts may even use obiter dicta to make a very pedantic point, such as whether it is proper to use the term “attorney’s fees” or “attorneys’ fees.”

, It is also interesting to look for obiter dicta that have been influential in subsequent cases. Identifying obiter dicta can you help you understand the way in which judges can take obiter dicta and use it in support of their decisions.

, In order to determine whether language in a court opinion is obiter dicta, you first must identify the rule of the case. Look for language indicating a ruling, such as “we hold that,” “our decision is,” or a reference to which party won the case.

, This language normally constitutes the rationale of a case and gives information that is necessary to or supportive of the outcome of the case. This includes any reasoning by the judge that supports his or her ultimate conclusion.


For example, if the rule of the case is that the sale of trucks is governed by the Uniform Commercial Code, then the fact that the case concerns the sale of a truck and the law used in the case, i.e. the Uniform Commercial Code, are both necessary to the result reached in the case. This means that the identified facts and law are part of the court’s ruling, not obiter dicta.

, If they address a situation different than that presented in the court’s opinion, or are only marginally relevant to the case at hand, then they are likely to be considered to be obiter dicta. In other words, obiter dicta are not essential to the outcome of the case.


For instance, in the case involving the truck sale being governed by the Uniform Commercial Code, the observation by the judge that SUVs also ought to be governed by the Uniform Commercial Code is obiter dicta, because it is not dealing with the case at issue.

, While obiter dicta are “by the way” statements by a judge, judicial dicta carry much more weight. Judicial dicta are the result of a comprehensive discussion of the legal issues in the case, and thus should generally followed by judges in future cases.


Judges need not follow even judicial dicta if they have a strong reason for doing so, or if the judicial dicta are clearly erroneous in some respect.

, While judicial dicta might be highly persuasive or very logical to the rule of the case, it is still not binding authority that a court absolutely has to follow.

, If it makes a point other than the rule of the case, then it’s probably obiter dicta. This type of dicta is more like an offhand remark or an off-topic comment than a statement that relates to the reasoning of the court’s opinion.

Generate Keywords.,
Europa.,
EUR-Lex.,
Paid Services (Westlaw and LexisNexis).",How to Research European Union Law," The first step to efficient legal research is always to find out your key words. Unfortunately for Americans, the E.U. has not yet submitted to our legal jargon. Fortunately, the E.U. maintains a webpage the help Americans translate our legal words into theirs. You can also look at a E.U. oriented law review article or treatise. The next step will get you started on the legal research, and also help generate key words.;
, Go to the official E.U. website.


Advanced Search. Conduct an 'advanced search' for the area of law you are interested in, and browse the results for a page about your topic. Be sure to omit press releases and select summaries of legislation.






Summaries of Legislation. Alternatively, browse the Summaries of Legislation. While any pages on the general Europa website will be oriented to the layman not the lawyer, this is an effective way to start your research. The Europa page (or lack-thereof) will let you know whether the E.U. legislates this area of law, give you an overview of the E.U. policy, help you develop keywords, and links to primary source material.







, Go to EUR-Lex, the official legal database of the E.U. There are four approaches to efficient research on Europa, detailed in the steps below:


EUR-Lex Directory of Legislation. The directory is listed on the left-hand side of the EUR-Lex homepage. You must browse the directory and since legislation only appears in one place, you must exhaust all possible areas of the directory.
EUR-Lex Browse by Topic. In the center of the homepage towards the bottom you will see a link to ""Thematic Files."" This is organized by topic and more user-friendly for a beginner than the directory. Like the directory, you must browse.
EUR-Lex Basic Search. The basic search is the most user-friendly way to find legislation on EUR-Lex for a beginner. Before entering your search terms, you can limit by legislation, case law, topic, etc. The search query itself is limited, but permits some use of booleans. Start with a broad search and click ""refine"" on the results page to do a search within a search. Rinse and repeat.
EUR-Lex Advanced Search. The advanced search system is difficult to learn, but effective once understood (see ""tips"" below). There are several fields to use in your query, and these fields can be compounded. Some of the fields have particular uses that may not be apparent by looking (for example, ""Subject_matter"" field requires input of a specific bibliographical term and general terms will not yield results).

, Finding E.U. legal material is easy on Westlaw and Lexis for anyone who is already familiar with the sites. The only substantive advantage these services offer over EUR-Lex is that the query rules and booleans are more familiar.


On Westlaw, go to Directory --> International --> EU. From here, select the EU database you want. You will not get some of the traditional Westlaw perks like annotations.
On Lexis, go to Area of Law --> International and select an EU database. Note that Lexis gets its results directly from EUR-Lex.

Identify the name of the reporter.,
Look for a series reference after the reporter abbreviation.,
Identify the volume number.,
Find the page number.,
Look at the additional page number for a specific reference within a case.,
Learn to identify regional reporters as well.,
Find the date of publication at the end of the citation.,
Recognize the United States Code as the source of federal statutes.,
Look for each state’s individual abbreviation for its laws.,
Find the Title or Chapter number, if one is given.,
Find the section number of federal laws at the end of the citation.,
Be flexible when reading citations to state laws.,
Understand that each state has its own system of subdividing its statutes.",How to Read a Legal Citation," In legal citation terminology, the “reporter” is the volume of books in which the court decision is printed. This will be the alphabetic abbreviation in the middle of the citation. You will need to get used to some of the most common ones, and be able to look up the rest.For the decisions of the United States Supreme Court, the reporters will be either the official United States Reporter, abbreviated as U.S.; the Supreme Court Reporter, abbreviated as S.Ct.; or the Lawyer’s Edition reporter, abbreviated as L.Ed. In most law libraries, these volumes will generally appear near each other.
For decisions from lower federal courts, including the Circuit Courts of Appeal and some Federal District Courts, the reporters will likely be the Federal Reporter, abbreviated F., or F.2d or F.3rd, or the Federal Supplement Reporter, abbreviated F.Supp.
For decisions of the highest court of most states, the reporter will often be some abbreviation of the state’s name. For example, the reporter for the highest court in Massachusetts is Mass.; the reporter for the highest court in New York is N.Y.S.; the reporter for the highest court in California is Cal.;
, Some reporters have reached the point where they decided to start their numbering system over again. In these cases, they start a new series of volumes and call it the “2nd Series” or “3rd Series” or even “4th Series.” The reference to “2nd,” “3rd,” or “4th,” as appropriate, will appear immediately following the abbreviation of the name of the reporter.For example, the highest court in California is up to the 4th Series, so the reporter name will appear as “Cal.,” “Cal. 2nd,” “Cal. 3rd,” or “Cal. 4th.” You must make note of the proper series number, if there is one, or you will find the wrong information.

, The number that leads off the legal citation is the volume number within the named reporter.For example, if you have a legal citation of “384 U.S. 436,” the number 384 tells you that you want volume 384 of the United States Reporter.
If you have a citation of “42 Cal. 4th 254,” the number 42 tells you that you want volume 42 of the 4th Series of the California Reporter.

, The page number will be the number that immediately follows the reporter abbreviation. If there is a series reference, then the page number will immediately follow the series reference.For example, in the citation “384 U.S. 436,” you are looking for a case that begins on page 436 in volume 384 of the United States Reporter.
In the citation “42 Cal. 4th 254,” you are looking for a case that begins on page 254 of volume 42 of the 4th Series of the California Reporter.

, Sometimes, a legal citation to a court decision will include an extra number at the end, separated by a comma. This is a reference to a page within the written decision, leading you directly to the page where a quotation or reference can be found.For example, if your citation reads “384 U.S. 436, 440,” the specific quotation or reference you are looking for will appear on page 440. The decision actually began on page 436 of volume 384 of the U.S. Reporter.
If your citation reads “42 Cal. 4th 254, 260,” the specific quotation or reference you are looking for will begin on page 260, of a case that began on page 254 of volume 42 of the 4th Series of the California Reporter.

, Some states do not have a reporter designated to that state alone. For those states, the written decisions of the state’s highest court, as well as some lower courts, will be printed in what is called a regional reporter. This is a series of books that cover a region of the United States. There are seven different regional reporters.The Atlantic Reporter and Atlantic Reporter 2nd and 3rd Series are abbreviated A., A.2nd, and A3rd, respectively, and include decisions from Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Vermont.The Northeastern Reporter and Northeastern Reporter 2nd Series are abbreviated N.E. and N.E.2nd, respectively, and include decisions from Illinois, Indiana, Massachusetts, New York, Ohio.The Northwestern Reporter and Northwestern Reporter 2nd Series are abbreviated N.W. and N.W.2nd, respectively, and include decisions from Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin.The Pacific Reporter and Pacific Reporter 2nd and 3rd Series are abbreviated P., P.2nd, and P.3rd, respectively, and include decisions from Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, Utah, Washington, Wyoming.The Southeastern Reporter and Southeastern Reporter 2nd Series are abbreviated S.E. and S.E.2nd, respectively, and include decisions from Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia.The Southwestern Reporter and Southwestern Reporter 2nd and 3rd Series are abbreviated S.W., S.W.2nd, and S.W.3rd, respectively, and include decisions from Arkansas, Kentucky, Missouri, Tennessee, Texas.The Southern Reporter and Southern Reporter 2nd and 3rd Series are abbreviated So., So.2nd, and So.3rd, respectively, and include decisions from Alabama. Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi., For reports of court decisions, the date of the case will appear in parentheses at the end of the citation. The actual printing date of the book in which the case appears is considered irrelevant for most uses.


An example is the case of Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966). This case is often referred to even today, but regardless of what current publication may print a reference to it, the date is always 1966, which is when it was decided.

, When you are reading citation references to individual laws or statutes that have been passed by the U.S. Congress, you will look for the abbreviation U.S.C.

, Each state will have its own name for its set of laws. Some states will have more than one, with a separate code for separate types of laws.


For example, the laws of the state of Maryland are reported in the Maryland Code Annotated, which is abbreviated Md. Code Ann.
The laws of the state of Missouri are reported in the Missouri Revised Statutes, which is abbreviated Mo. Rev. Stat.

, Most sets of statutes are subdivided by topic or category. These subdivisions are usually referred to as either “Titles” or “chapters.” Some states may use other designations.


The United States Code is subdivided into Titles, which are arranged by subject. The first number in a citation to the U.S. Code is the title number. For example, a reference to 20 U.S.C. §1681 refers to Title 20 of the United States Code.
In Massachusetts, the laws are subdivided into chapters, so you may have a reference to M.G.L. (Massachusetts General Laws), c.209, sec. 12. This will be chapter 209.

, Usually the final number in the statutory citation will be the specific section number for the law that is being referenced.


For the U.S.Code, the citation will look like, 20 U.S.C. §1681. The § symbol stands for the word “section.” In this case, it indicates that you are looking for section 1681 within title 20 of the U.S. Code., Some states will have only a section number, which may be divided into multiple parts. These parts will indicate further subdivisions, which the state may call chapter, title, article, section, or something else. Each state has its own system of categorizing its laws.


For example, a statute in Indiana will be referred to as “Ind. Code (Indiana Code) §26-1-1-101.” This means that within the Indiana Code, the laws are broken up into multiple parts. This particular reference is to Title 26, Chapter 1, Article 1, Section 101.A statute in Alabama, for example, will appear as AL Code, §10-5-2. These numbers refer to Title 10, Chapter 5, Section 2., Each state uses a different system, and the title or chapter numbers from one state do not mean the same thing in another state.


For example, Title 10 in Alabama is about Corporations, Partnerships and Associations, while Title 10 in Indiana refers to laws about Public Safety."
"
Obtain the correct citation for the case you wish to Shepardize.The correct citation includes the reporter, volume and page number.,
Locate the set of Shepard's Citations that matches your case’s reporter.For example, if your case is from the Pacific Reporter, you will need to locate the set of Shepard's Citations that corresponds to the Pacific Reporter.

,
Gather all of the volumes necessary to Shepardize your case.,
Check each of the volumes and supplements gathered for references to your case.Begin with the most recent volume or supplement on the list.,
Identify the list of cases that have referenced your case.,
Carefully review the list of cases that have cited your case for any negative history.The abbreviations next to the cases will alert you to whether your case has been reversed, overruled or denied.,
Read all cases with abbreviations that indicate negative treatment.,
Repeat this process for each bound volume and supplement listed in “What Your Library Should Contain.”Work in order from the most recent to the earliest reference.

,
Complete the process by obtaining the most current information directly from the publisher.",How to Shepardize a Case2,"
You will also need the year it was decided.

,, Once you have the set of Shepard's Citations that matches your case's reporter, you will need to identify which volumes within the set are necessary for Shepardizing your case. Within your set of Shepard's Citations, look for the most current softbound supplement.
The front cover of this supplement will contain a list entitled ""What Your Library Should Contain."" This is the complete list of volumes and supplements you will need to review in order to Shepardize your case.
Gather all of the volumes and soft-cover supplements in this list, from the most recent all the way back to the date your case was decided.

,
Scan the pages of the particular volume or supplement in search of the reporter, volume number and initial page number that correspond to your case. The reporter and volume number appear at the top of each page, with the reporter in the center and the volume number on the left. The initial page numbers are listed in order on each page.
Once you have found the right page, the case name and decision date should appear next to the initial page number for your case. If you do not see your case, it means it is not referenced in that particular volume or supplement and you can move on to searching for it in the next one on your list.

, For each volume or supplement in which your case appears, you will find a list of citations and authorities that have cited your case. This list appears beneath the case name. At the top of the list, you may find citations in parenthesis. These are called parallel citations and indicate that your case has been cited in other reporters. You will need to Shepardize each of these citations to obtain a comprehensive result.
After parallel citations, you will find a list of cases that have cited your case. This is the list of cases you will need to review to determine whether your case is still good law.
At the end of the column of citations, you will find secondary authorities citing your case. They have no negative or positive effect on the authority of your case, but they will lead you to articles that could help you interpret your cases.

, The full list of abbreviations can be found in the Table of Abbreviations in each volume of Shepard's.
References to cases are organized by jurisdiction and court, with the highest court listed first. Be particularly wary of negative history by cases from higher courts as these decisions are binding on cases from lower courts.

, If you find a case with an abbreviation that indicates the court reversed, overruled or denied your case, take note of the citation. You MUST look it up to determine how exactly the ruling affected the law in your case.


Note that the citations are to the specific pages of other cases that have cited your case.
Think carefully about the proposition of law for which you wish to cite the case and consider whether in fact the more recent case affected the validity of that particular proposition.
If the proposition for which you had hoped to cite your case is no longer valid, you will not be able to use it in support of your argument. In that scenario, you will need to start over with your legal search and find a new case that supports your argument.

,, Even the most recent published supplement from Shepard's lacks coverages from the previous two months.To learn whether any relevant cases have been decided during those two months, call the toll-free number on the back cover of the most recent Shepard’s supplement. A publisher’s representative will check for as-yet unpublished citations of your case.

Be prepared.,
Remain calm.,
Keep your loved ones close.,
Don't get involved.,
Drive appropriately if you're in a car.,
Move away from the riot as calmly as possible.,
Avoid heavy-traffic areas.,
Move to a safe enclosed area.,
Stay informed.",How to Survive a Riot1," If you know you're in an a riot-prone area but have no way to avoid being there, then taking a few simple precautions can have a big impact on your life. Though it's easier to assume that a riot won't happen in your area, it's better to be prepared for the worst. Even the calmest crowd can turn dangerous when its members are in a frantic, angry mood. Anger and hysteria are contagious, so it's best to know how to avoid these situations if they arise.


Get familiar with your area. If you're just visiting a location for a season or two, you should still get to know your surroundings as intimately as possible. Study a map until you're very comfortable with the area where you work, the area where you live, and the routes between those.
Think about your possible escape routes and safe havens before anything actually happens. Crossroads are good because you've got at least one road to race off down if rioters go crazy or the police start charging.
If you work in a volatile environment, make sure you know several routes for getting home so that you have a number of methods of escape in the event of a riot.
Carry small amounts of cash with you in case you need to quickly arrange transportation, pay off looters, or address your basic needs.;
, Riots bring intense emotions boiling to the surface, but if you want to survive one you'd be better off keeping your own emotions in check. Your adrenaline and survival instincts will kick in, but strive to think rationally and pursue safety methodically.


Avoid confrontation by keeping your head down.
Walk at all times. If you run or move too quickly, you might attract unwanted attention.

, If you're not alone, then the first thing you should do is grip the hands or lock elbows with all of the people who are with you. If you're with a child, hold him in your arms so he doesn't get trampled. Sticking together with your loved ones should be your first priority -- your second should be finding a way out. Reassure the people you're with that you have strength in numbers and that you'll be fine if you stick together.

, If you're caught in a riot, the last thing you want to do is try to take sides, help out, or stand out. In fact, you should stand out as little as possible as you move to the outside of the mob and away from the action. To do this, stay close to the walls and other barriers, though avoid bottlenecks, or any areas where a lot of people are squeezing through a small space.

, Unless your car is the focus for the angry mob in the riot, you should stay in the car and continue driving as calmly as possible. Try to keep to the streets that are clear of riots, and avoid the main roads that are more likely to be occupied. Keep moving forward and don't stop to assess the situation. If someone tries to block your car, honk your car and keep driving until he gets out of the way (of course, this doesn't mean you should hit the person.) Drive at moderate speed so they have time to back off and realize that you mean business.


Remember that you're in a position of power when you're driving. Don't let a few angry people stop you from driving your car and keep going unless you absolutely can't.
Many activists are afraid of cars because there have been cases of any drivers running down the protesters on the roads. Remember to be firm, but not aggressive, to avoid giving the wrong impression.

, If you're on foot, you should move away by going with the flow of foot traffic, not against it. If you go against the traffic, you're much more likely to stand out, to get stampeded, or just to get pushed or blocked. If you feel that you may fall down in the big crowd and get trampled, use your elbows to push down on the crowd so that it carries you. Though you may want to run for your life, you should move calmly and relatively slowly.


Continue to move with the crowd until you can escape into a doorway, an alley, a side street, or a safe building.
If you're in the middle of a crowd, it's especially important to try to move in the direction of the crowd until you may your way to the outside of the crowd.

, To maximize your chances of safety, you should avoid the areas that are most likely to be crowded and show stay off the beaten path so you don't put yourself in a dangerous situation. Even if the heavy-traffic areas are your quickest path home, they won't be safest path if they are the targets of any rioters. Here's what you should do:


Avoid major roads. Major roads, squares, and other high traffic areas are likely to be crowded with rioters. If possible, stick to less-traveled side streets to avoid the mobs.
Avoid public transportation. Buses, subways, and trains will likely be out of service, and stations and depots will probably be packed with people.

, Riots most commonly happen outside on the streets, not inside buildings. Just by moving inside a sturdy and controlled building, you can protect yourself from the brunt of a riot. Any building with a basement, or even a sub-basement, can help you hide from a mob. Being in any safe building at all is safer than being out on the streets. Look for homes that can serve as ""safe houses"" in advance if you're really concerned about finding a safe space in the event of a riot. If you can, talk to the owners first.


Lock the doors and windows and stay away from them. Though you may be tempted to watch the riot from the windows, this will increase your chances of getting hurt.
Move to rooms that do not lead directly outside, to avoid getting hit by stones, bullets or other missiles.
Look for at least two exits in the building in case you need to leave in a rush.
Just look out for fire. If the angry mob turns toward the building, it can be a target.

, Use the social media to alert you as to where to stay away from, as well as the local radio and news. Just as the rioters have started using social media and texting to alert one another where to go, you can flip this on its head and ask people to help you know where to stay away from. Messages informing you of which streets and areas are currently being targeted provide you with instantaneous warnings of where to avoid.


Social media may provide new information as rapidly as possible, though it may not be as accurate, so keep your bases covered.
Remember that staying informed can help you avoid a riot even better than it can help you survive it. Staying on top of the news can help you know which areas should be avoided in advance.

Wear safe clothes.,
Carry a solution for rinsing your eyes in case you're exposed to tear gas.,
Keep your documents on your person if you're traveling abroad.,
Carry an extra cell phone.,
Have sugar candy on hand to keep up your energy.,
Avoid being hit by riot control chemicals or weapons.",How to Survive a Riot2," Wear clothes that minimize the amount of exposed skin, such as long pants and long-sleeved shirts, when you go out. Do not wear clothing that could be interpreted as military or police wear. Do avoid wearing anything that looks like a uniform. Furthermore, if you do not want to be mistaken for a rioter by the police, avoid dark colored clothing, especially black hooded sweaters, since this type of clothing is associated with rioters in many countries around the world.


Every crowd of rioters is unique. Though you can't do a costume change in the middle of a riot, you should try to avoid looking like the rioters if you can. For example, if you're caught in a riot and are wearing the same sweatshirt as the rioters, take it off.

, If you're worried that you may be exposed to tear gas, you should have a solution of half liquid antacid and half water (spray is better than stream and it's available in many drug stores and larger stores) and use it to rinse eyes in case you are exposed to tear gas.


You can also carry toothpaste with you and smear it under your eyes if tear gas is released and you have nothing else available to protect you.
Another good thing to bring is a rag soaked in lemon juice or vinegar in a plastic bag, this can be used to breathe through for some protection against gas., If you're traveling abroad, register with your country's consulate and carry your passport and/or visa with you at all times. Even domestically, have ID and emergency contact information on you in case you are arrested or become unconscious.

, If you're walking around a high-risk area, you should take your telephone, two if possible (one in your pocket and one in a bag). If one is lost or taken, you still have another one., Adrenaline will drain you of energy quickly and a sugar hit will help you move out faster., Police may deploy riot control agents (tear gas, water cannons, rubber bullets, for example) to disperse a crowd. These weapons and chemicals can cause severe pain, respiratory distress, and blindness. Try to stay away from the front lines of a riot, and learn to recognize the signs that a riot control agent has been used and how to handle exposure.


Avoid wearing oil based moisturizer or sunscreen as chemicals cling to these on your skin. Remove with detergent-free soap before going near the riot.Wear glasses rather than contact lenses; tear gas behind contact lenses is unimaginable pain. Swimming goggles can protect eyes, or a gas mask.Put wet bandannas in a plastic bag and carry these for your mouth. Wrap them around your mouth if tear gas is released. They need constant replacement as they will keep soaking up the gas.Wear vinyl or latex gloves to protect your hands from pepper spray; the nerve endings will make them feel like agony if sprayed.Carry spare clothes to change if you're hit by chemicals or a water cannon. Put them in a plastic bag for protection.
Avoid rubbing your hands or fingers into eyes, nose, mouth etc. after a chemical attack. Stay calm.

Dress comfortably.,

Stay in one place, but pay attention to what needs to happen.,
Wait for rescue.",How to Survive a Plane Crash," You’ll need to be able to stay warm if you survive a crash. Even if that is not a consideration, the more of your body is covered during impact, the less likely you are to receive serious injuries or burns. Wear long pants, a long-sleeve t-shirt, and sturdy, comfortable, lace-up shoes.


Loose or elaborate clothing poses a risk, as it can get snagged on obstacles in the close confines of a plane. If you know you’re going to be flying over cold areas, dress appropriately, and consider keeping a jacket on your lap.
Cotton or wool clothing is also preferable as it is less flammable. Wool is preferable to cotton when flying over water, as wool does not lose its insulating properties to the degree cotton does when wet.;
, Although you may want to be comfortable or professional-looking on a flight, sandals or high heels make it hard to move quickly should there be an emergency. High heels are not allowed on the evacuation slides and you can cut your feet and toes on glass or get flammable liquids on or in your sandals if you wear them.

, Passengers in the tail of the aircraft have 40% higher survival rates than those in the first few rows, in the event of a crash. Because a quick escape gives you the best chance for survival, it’s best to get seats as close as possible to an exit, on the aisle, and in the back of the plane.


Yes, it's actually statistically safer to fly economy than first-class.Save money and stay safer.

, Yes, you may have heard it all before, and you’ll probably never need it, but if you keep your headphones on during the pre-flight instructions or ignore the safety card, you’ll be missing out on information that could be vital in the event of a crash.


Don’t assume you know it all already, either. Every type of airplane has different safety instructions.If you're sitting in an exit row, study the door and make sure you know how to open it if you need to. In normal circumstances the flight attendant will open the door, but if they are dead or injured, you'll need to do it.

, Find the exit closest to you, and count the number of seats that it'll take to get to it. If the plane crashes, it could be smoky, loud, or confusing in the cabin afterward. If you need to escape, you might have to feel your way to the exit, which will be a lot easier if you know where it is and how far.


You might even write down the number in pen on your hand, so you'll have a quick reference if you need to.

, Every centimeter of slack in your seat belt triples the G-Force you'll experience in the crash, so keep your seat belt properly tightened at all times you're on the aircraft.


Push the belt down as low over your pelvis as possible. You should be able to feel the upper ridge of the pelvis above the upper edge of the belt, which helps to brace you in an emergency much better than your soft stomach.
Leave your belt on, even if you're sleeping. If something happens while you're out, you'll be glad to have the restraints in place.

, Try to determine what surface the plane will land on so you can customize your preparations. If you’re going to be landing in water, for example, you’ll want to put your life vest on, though you need to wait to inflate it until you’re out of the plane. If you’re going to be landing in cold weather, you should try to get a blanket or jacket to keep you warm once outside.


Plot out the general course you'll be on ahead of time, so you'll have some idea of where you are when the plane crashes. If you're flying from Iowa to California, you can be fairly certain you won't be landing in the ocean.
Use the time before the crash to find your exit. If the plane is going to crash, you almost always have several minutes to prepare before impact. Use this time to once again review where the exits are.

, If you know you’re going to crash, return your seat back to its full upright position and stow away any loose items that could become hazardous, if at all possible. Zip up your jacket and make sure your shoes are tied tightly to your feet. Then assume one of two standard brace positions used for surviving a plane crash and try to remain calm.


In either position, your feet should be flat on the floor and further back than your knees to reduce injuries to your feet and legs, which you will need in order to successfully exit the craft after impact. Place your legs as far under the seat as possible to avoid breaking your shin bones.

, If the seat in front of you is close enough to reach, place one hand palm-down on the back of that seat, then cross the other hand palm-down over the first hand. Rest your forehead against your hands. Keep your fingers unlaced.


It's also sometimes recommended that you put your head directly against the seat in front of you and lace your fingers behind your head, tucking your upper arms against the sides of your head to cradle it.Bend forward, if there's no seat in front of you. If you don’t have a seat close in front of you, bend forward and put your chest on your thighs and your head between your knees. Cross your wrists in front of your lower calves, and grab your ankles.

, It can be easy to get swept up in the pandemonium immediately preceding and following a crash. Keep a cool head, though, and you’re more likely to get out alive. Remember that even in the worst wrecks, you do have a chance of survival. You’ll need to be able to think methodically and rationally to maximize that chance.

, If you inflate it in the plane, when it starts to fill up with water, the life jacket will force you upwards against the cabin roof and it will be very hard to swim back down, leaving you trapped. Instead, hold your breath and swim out, once you're out, inflate it.

, You’ve probably heard this on every commercial flight you’ve been on, but it’s worth repeating. If the integrity of the cabin is compromised, you have only about 15 seconds or less to start breathing through your oxygen mask before you are rendered unconscious.


While you may feel an impulse to first help your children or the elderly passenger sitting next to you, you’ll be no good to anyone if you don’t remain conscious. Also, remember that you can put somebody else's oxygen mask on even if they're unconscious. This might help save their life.

, Fire and smoke are responsible for the largest percentage of crash fatalities. The smoke in an airplane fire can be very thick and highly toxic, so cover your nose and mouth with a cloth to avoid breathing it in. If possible, moisten the cloth to provide extra protection.


Stay low as you escape, to duck under the level of smoke. It might not seem like a big deal, but passing out due to smoke inhalation is one of the most dangerous things that can happen during this critical period.

, According to the National Transportation Safety Board, 68 percent of plane crash deaths are due to post-crash fire, not injuries sustained in the crash itself.It’s critical to get out of the aircraft without delay. If fire or smoke is present, you will generally have less than two minutes to safely exit the plane.


Make sure the exit you choose is safe. Look through the window to determine if there is fire or some other hazard outside of an exit. If there is, try the exit across the plane, or proceed to another set of exits.

, Flight attendants undergo rigorous training to make sure they know what to do in the event of a crash. If a flight attendant is able to instruct or assist you, listen closely and cooperate to increase everyone’s chances of survival.

, Don’t try to rescue your belongings. It’s common sense, but still some people don’t seem to get it. Leave everything behind. Rescuing your belongings will only slow you down.


If you end up needing to salvage supplies from the plane crash site, worry about that later. Right now, you need to make sure that you get clear of the wreckage and find some safe cover. Get out now.

, If you’re stranded in a remote area, the best thing to do usually is to stay close to the aircraft to await rescuers. You don’t want to be too close, though. Fire or explosion can happen at any time after a crash, so put some distance between you and the plane. If the crash is in open-water, swim as far away from the plane wreckage as possible.

, While it’s essential to stay calm after a crash, you also need to recognize when you need to act and do so swiftly. Help out people who are struggling and tend to people's wounds using basic first aid available.


Attend to your own wounds if at all possible. Check yourself for cuts and other abrasions, and apply pressure if necessary. Stay in one place to reduce the chance of exacerbating internal injuries.
Negative panic is a strange inability to react assertively and appropriately to the situation. For example, a person may just remain in his or her seat instead of heading toward the exit. Watch out for this in your fellow passengers or traveling companions.

, You stand a much higher chance of surviving if you just stay put. Don't wander off and look for help, or try to find something close by. If your plane went down, there will be people on the way quickly, and you want to be there when they arrive. Just stay put.

Leave your purse at home.,
Bring only what you need.,
Walk in busy, well-lit areas.,
Be aware of the area and the people, especially if you find yourself having to walk in an isolated or lightly populated area.,
Hold your purse tightly and close to your body, whether on a bus, train, or walking.,
If you believe someone is following you don't turn around use a shiny object like a car mirror or window to look back.

,
Shorten the strap on your purse so you can carry it tightly between your elbow and body.

,
Remember that you come before your purse.,
Report anything or anyone suspicious.",How to Prevent Purse Snatching," Carry necessary items (ID and money) in a wallet, tucked safely in your pocket. If you don't have pockets and/or there are additional items you prefer to carry, such as makeup, keys, and a phone, consider putting them in a bag that wraps around your stomach and can be hidden from view, or a backpack strapped around both shoulders so that it can't easily be snatched.;
, Don't carry any more cash or credit cards than you absolutely need to do your shopping that day. Usually, one credit card is enough, and you should have the customer service number written down somewhere (see tips) so that you can report the card stolen immediately if your purse is snatched. Decide even before leaving the house whether the contents of your purse are worth getting hurt for.

, You may think that you're exposing yourself to more purse snatchers, but they are more likely to strike in dark, isolated areas because they don't want to get caught. Walk briskly and confidently. Bring a friend.

, Look at the person who might approach or pass you. Do not look away. Look directly at their hands or at what they might be carrying. They prefer to strike and run, and not be recognized. If you do not appear to be vulnerable and will be able to give their description, they just might keep walking past you.

, If possible, wear it underneath a coat or jacket. Also, secure the latch or zipper. You might be tempted to wear your purse diagonally on your body (over the neck as well as the shoulder) or loop the strap around your wrist to prevent the purse from being easily snatched, but keep in mind that if someone does try to steal your purse, a hard yank on tightly wound purse strap can cause injury.

,,, If someone pulls it away from your hands or your shoulder, let it go! It is more important to avoid injury than save a purse. Never fight to keep it.

, If you suspect that someone seems to be lurking someplace that they do not belong, contact security if you are in a mall, or contact the manager if you are in a supermarket. Better to report your suspicions and be wrong, than to ignore it and be robbed or hurt.

Pack for survival.,
Get a room in the lower levels of the hotel.,
Learn your escape routes when you arrive at the hotel.,
Check some essential features of the hallway and of your room.,
Put your room keys and flashlight in your shoes before you go to bed.",How to Survive a Hotel Fire1," Bring a flashlight and potentially a battery-operated smoke detector. These may seem like overkill, but they don't cost much or take up much room in your luggage. Organize, don't agonize. The flashlight could save your life if you have to quickly navigate a dark hallway or stairwell, and the smoke detector can alert you to fires while you're sleeping.


Check the batteries on each of these before you leave. In most parts of the world, smoke detectors are mandatory in hotel rooms, but when was the last time you tested one?
If you don't bring a smoke detector with you, at least make sure the one in your room works.;
, If a fire starts, you'll want to get out of the building as quickly as possible. This can be difficult if your room is in the upper floors of a high-rise hotel. When you make your reservations, ask for a room on the ground floor or close to it. If you're not able to do this in the reservation process, request it when you check in. If you're in an earthquake area, taking this measure could be helpful.

, If a fire started in your home, you'd probably know the best way to get out and you'd probably be able to find your way there even in complete darkness. If you can't do this in your hotel, you're risking your life.


Ask for a map of the hotel at the front desk. If you can't get a map at the front desk, you may be able to find one on the inside of your room's door, depending on where you're traveling.
As soon as you get to your room, study the map and find the nearest exit. Then find the alternate exits. Walk the potential escape routes from your room all the way to the outside of the building, counting the number of doors between your room and the exits and noting any unusual features that may help you find your way. Check for potential hazards or obstructions along the way and try to make sure the exit doors open. Don't plan on using the elevator.

, If a blaze were to suddenly erupt, you can't leisurely test certain features of the building. Doing this ahead of time saves you time and reduces your action plan to instinct instead of analysis in the event of a fire.


Find out if stairwell doors lock behind you. If they do, you could be trapped in the stairwell if it's filled with smoke, so you'll want to exercise extra caution before committing to that option.
Make sure to keep the windows in your room open. If they do not, locate something in your room that you could throw through the window. Visualize how you would make your escape through the window, and make note of ledges or fire escapes that might assist you. Two stories is typically a reasonably safe jump — although there is still a good chance of injury — but if the window were your only possible escape route and you were in imminent danger you might need to risk jumping from a greater height. You can learn how to survive a fall from heights here.
Locate fire extinguishers and fire alarms and make sure you know how to use them.


, If you need to leave your room during a fire, you want to be sure to bring your keys and flashlight, and while you don't want to waste time dressing, shoes can make your escape easier. Keep them together, and hopefully you'll remember them.


If your hotel has multiple keys for different doors, make sure you know which keys open which doors, and label them if necessary.
Bring all keys with you if you have to leave your room, because you may not be able to exit some doors without them. You may find that your room is the safest place to be and you'll need your key to get back in.

Leave everything behind if you detect smoke or fire.,
Stay low to the ground as you move.,
Feel the door with the back of your hand.,
Check the phone.",How to Survive a Hotel Fire2," If you need to get out of the hotel, don't worry about your personal belongings. If you have your hotel keys and flashlight, you've got everything you need. Nothing else is important. Material possessions are not worth sacrificing life and limb for.


If no alarm has sounded, look for a fire alarm and sound it. If your room does not contain a fire alarm, don't move to the hallway just yet simply in order to sound it.

, As soon as you notice signs of fire (including the sound of your smoke detector or a fire alarm), try to stay low. You may not immediately notice smoke, but even a small amount of toxic smoke can incapacitate you. It's best to stay low — smoke and heat rises, meaning it will be thicker further from the ground.

, Don't open the door without first feeling it. The back of your hand is very sensitive to heat, and by using it you also won't risk burning your palm or finger tips. If the door or doorknob is hot, the fire is probably right outside. If that's the case, don't open the door.


Even if the door isn't hot, get ready to slam the door quickly shut if you need to. Open the door slowly, just a crack, with a steady hand. The pressure from the fire can force the door open if proper care isn't taken.

, If you are able to make a call, notify the front desk of your whereabouts. If you can't reach the front desk, try to call the fire department or call the local emergency number to let them know where you are. Hang a sheet or article of clothing out the window as a beacon to rescuers.

"
"
Stay in your room if the fire is in the hall blocking the exits, or if the hall is filled with heavy smoke.,
Climb out the window and jump if it is safe.,
Head to the nearest exit if the hallway appears safe.,
Count the doors to the exit, and stay on the same side of the hall as the exit.,
Take the stairs to exit the building unless the stairwell is filled with smoke.,
Get medical attention promptly.",How to Survive a Hotel Fire3," Even if flames are not present, thick smoke can kill you, so unless your room is on fire or also filled with heavy smoke, you're probably better off staying inside.


If there is smoke present in the room, open the windows and turn on the bathroom vent if available.
Place wet towels at the bottom of the door and around any other cracks around the doorway. The wet towels will help keep smoke out of the room.
Fill the bathtub with water. Use an ice bucket, trashcan, or suitcase to throw water onto the door or any other hot surface or spot fire in the room. If you have a fire extinguisher in the room, or if you're able to safely get one from the hallway, keep it close at hand and be ready to use it.
Create a mask by wetting a towel or article of clothing and tying it around your nose and mouth. Remember, smoke inhalation is deadly and most fire fatalities are caused by smoke or toxic gas inhalation. Do all you can to minimize the amount of smoke you're exposed to.

, If you have a ground-floor room, you can probably just climb out the window to safety. Remember you should not attempt to jump from higher than two stories unless your life is imminently threatened. You should also not jump if you can see dangerous obstructions below your window, or if there is fire outside your window. If the conditions are right, and you are certain that you can not easily or safely exit the building through the halls, do not hesitate to use the window. Otherwise, wait as long as possible for rescuers to come before jumping from a window.


If fire or smoke is present outside your window, close the window, tear down the curtains or drapes and move combustible objects away from the window.

, Bring your key(s), flashlight and moist-cloth mask with you. Close your room door behind you. Closing the door will help to keep smoke out of the room, which could save your life if you need to return to the room.


Stay low. If even the slightest amount of smoke is present, or if it is dark and you can not tell if smoke is present, crawl in the hallway. It's important to understand that while the air may be reasonably safe to breathe near the floor, one breath of the toxic air that may be lurking higher up could incapacitate, and eventually kill, you. There can also be substantial temperature differences in just a few vertical feet. You may not be able to tell if the air above you is poisonous or superheated until you have already breathed it in. By then it could be too late. Stay low.
Stay near the wall as you make your way through the hall. The wall can be your guide down the hallway, so try to keep in contact with it. In addition, other hotel guests may be running down the hall and you're more likely to get trampled if you're in the middle of the path.

, If you've planned your escape route when you checked in, you should know how many doors you have to pass and you'll be able to find the exit even if you can't see a thing.

, Use the handrail to guide you and to help you keep your footing. If heavy smoke chokes the stairwell, you have no choice but to get to another exit or go back to your room. Do not try to rush through the smoke unless your return route is blocked. The smoke will probably be extremely toxic and you don't know what you will run into further down the stairs.


If egress is impossible, go back to your room or up to the rooftop exit. If you find that flames or heavy smoke blocks your way after you have traveled down the stairwell, you can either try to get back to your room or get to the rooftop exit, if one is available.
Not all stairwells have a rooftop exit, and even if you can get to the roof, be aware that the fire department may not have a ladder truck or helicopter readily available to reach you. What's more, the exit to the roof may be locked. If you checked it out earlier, you should know whether an exit is available.
If you're not sure, try to make it back to your room, where you can either wait for rescuers or attempt to jump from the window. If you are locked in the stairwell, or if the path to your room is unsafe, hope that you can get out on the roof. Once there, close the door behind you to avoid creating a chimney effect that will draw fire and smoke upward more rapidly.
Await rescuers on the windward side of the roof. Try to signal fire fighters and wait for help to come.

, Even if you feel fine once you escape, you could be injured or you may suffer complications from smoke inhalation or burns. After the adrenaline-pumping experience you've just been through, you may not even notice a potentially life-threatening injury.

Look for signs that mines are close.,
Stop immediately.,
Call out a warning to companions.,
Do not pick anything up.",How to Escape a Minefield1," Most mines are hidden, but if you know what to look for you'll have a better chance of avoiding them. Don't let your guard down, even for a moment, if you are in a mined area. Constantly be on the lookout for the following signs:


Trip wires. These aren't usually clearly visible, so you've got to look closely at the ground. Wires are usually thin enough to be almost impossible to see.

Signs of road repair. This includes paved areas, new fill, road patches, ditches, and so on. This could be a sign that mines were installed nearby.

Signs or markers on trees, stakes, or posts. The forces that place the mines may mark the minefields to protect their own soldiers.

Dead animals. Cattle and other animals frequently detonate mines.

Damaged vehicles. Abandoned cars, trucks or other vehicles may have detonated a mine, and more could be close by.

Suspicious objects in trees and bushes. Not all mines are buried, and not all UXO land on the ground.

Disturbances in previous tire tracks or tracks that stop inexplicably.

Wires leading away from the side of the road. They may be firing wires that are partially buried.

Odd features in the ground or patterns that are not present in nature. Plant growth may wilt or change color, rain may wash away some of the cover, the cover may sink or crack around the edges, or the material covering the mines may look like mounds of dirt.

Civilians staying away from certain places or out of certain buildings. Locals often know where mines or unexploded ordnance (UXO) are located. Question civilians to determine the exact locations.
;
, The moment you realize you may be in danger, freeze. Do not take another step. Take some time to assess your situation and formulate an escape plan. Your movements from now on need to be slow, careful and considered.

, As soon as you think you are in danger, make sure everyone knows so they can stop moving before someone detonates an explosive. Yell, ""freeze!"" and tell them to not to move their feet. If you're the leader in this situation, you'll have to coach them on how to leave the field safely; make sure everyone's on the same page, because one wrong move could get everyone killed.

, Many mines are booby-trapped. You think you're picking up a helmet, radio, or military artifact, and lo and behold, there's a mine inside. Even toys and food are used as bait. If you didn't drop it, don't pick it up.

Put cash in your mugger's wallet.,
Add an ID card which has already expired, or which can be easily replaced.,
Add an expired credit card.,
Add filler.,
Use the mugger's wallet for minor expenses.,
Tuck your real wallet in a less accessible and noticeable place, like the inside of your jacket, or elsewhere underneath your clothes.",How to Make a Mugger's Wallet," It should be enough that if a mugger thumbs through it, he won't suspect you're pulling one over on him. However, don't put in an amount that is too large, that you would regret losing to a mugger. Some people put a bigger bill in front of many smaller bills so that a hasty mugger thinks there's a lot of money in there. If possible, consider mixing fake money in with real bills. However, remember not to spend the fake bills, as this is considered counterfeiting and is punishable by jail time.;
, Any mugger will be skeptical if there is no form of ID in your wallet


A photo ID library card is good because it doesn't have your address and can be easily replaced. Plus, the mugger can't use it if he or she should decide to rack up overdue fees on your behalf for revenge.
An old driver's license with an old address is convincing as well, but keep in mind that someone might be living in a house by that address.

, When the mugger sees this, they might think they've hit the jackpot, and might hurry off to charge things before you report the card as stolen. Make sure that the account is closed, and write ""Please see ID"" clearly in the signature box in the back. A credit card with photo ID is preferred. Or if you have a realistic looking card from a credit offer, use that.

, Remember, you want this wallet to appear authentic, so shove any of the following in it:


old receipts
coupons
business cards

, This is especially important if you pay for something in public. Muggers might be watching, and you'll want them to see you using the decoy wallet, not your real one.

, Another good place is in your front pocket instead of your back pocket - you are much more likely to notice someone getting into your front pocket. Keep it light and streamlined. Some people purchase a money belt, or put their money and a credit card in a sock.

Backtrack your way out of a mined area.,
Probe the ground.,
Get help if you're in over your head.,
Pay attention for signs that a detonation may occur.,
Drop to the ground immediately if a detonation has been initiated.,
Mark the hazard, and report its location to the proper authorities.",How to Escape a Minefield2," Should you suspect that you have entered a minefield or mined area, either because you see warning signs, you see a mine or potential mine, or because a detonation occurs, remain calm and carefully back out of danger by stepping in your footsteps. If possible, do not turn around.


Look behind you as you walk, and slowly place your feet exactly where they were before.

Continue until you are sure you are out of danger, such as when you reach a road or other frequently traveled area.


, If you have to move forward for some reason, or you can't see your tracks to backtrack, you'll need to probe the ground for mines and move forward little by little. Probe the ground very carefully with your hands or feet; you can also use a knife or another object to gently probe the area inch by inch.


Probe at an angle, rather than straight down, since mines are usually detonated from top-down pressure.

Once you've cleared a small area, move forward and continue probing. It's safest to move through the field very slowly and on your belly, rather than walking through.

, If you're not absolutely sure where you stepped before, and you don't feel comfortable probing, don't risk moving. Inches can be the difference between life and death. Call for help or have people nearby do so.


If you are alone and can use a cell phone, call for help.

Do not use two-way radios unless absolutely necessary. The signal from the radio may cause certain types of mines or UXO to accidentally detonate.

If you have no way of reaching anyone, wait. Do not try to ""make a run for it"" and do not attempt to probe your way out unless you know what you are doing.


, When exiting a minefield be alert for signs that a mine may detonate. Listen for unusual noises. You may notice a faint click if a pressure plate has been depressed or a tilt rod has been moved, or, more likely, you may hear the pop of the exploding cap. Pay attention to what you can feel, as well. If you are very alert and proceed slowly you may be able to feel the tension of a trip wire, for example.

, Soldiers call this ""hitting the deck."" If you notice any of the signs from the last step, or if someone nearby cries out a warning that they have detonated a mine, drop to the ground as quickly as possible. You may have as little as a second before the mine explodes, but if you use that second wisely you may be able to escape serious injury or death. Mines explode upward, and it's safest close to the ground.


If possible, fall backward in order to shield your upper body from shrapnel as much as possible. While it's certainly possible to fall onto another mine, the area right behind you is the safest place to fall, because you were just walking there.

Do not try to outrun the explosion; projectiles will fly out from the mine at thousands of feet per second, and the casualty radius - the distance from the mine in which you can expect to be injured - can be up to 100 feet or more.


, If you find a mine, help make sure that other people avoid it by marking it. Use internationally recognized symbols or signs if possible, or use the customary local warning. Make sure you are in safe territory before attempting to erect a warning. Note the location of the danger, and report it to police, the military, or local de-miners.

Learn about land mines.,
Learn about the history of an area.,
Heed warning signs.,
Inquire locally.,
Don't stray off established paths.",How to Escape a Minefield3," Unexploded ordnance (UXO) is a term used to denote any kind of explosive weapons, such as bombs, grenades, and artillery shells, that have been used but have not yet exploded - ""duds,"" in other words - and that retain the potential to detonate. Landmines are sometimes considered a type of UXO, and while mines receive the most media attention, all UXOs are dangerous. In some parts of the world, UXO other than mines present the greatest hazard.

, Anytime that you are traveling to an unfamiliar area, it's wise to learn about the history of that area to determine if there is a landmine risk. Areas that are experiencing armed conflict are clearly high-risk, but landmines and UXOs remain dangerous long after the cessation of hostilities.


In Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, for example, millions of mines and dud bombs remain, and even in Belgium, long combat-free, crews have removed hundreds of tons of UXO, left over from WWI and WWII, in the past few years.

, While you can't always count on minefields being marked, you should definitely stay away from those that are. Internationally recognized symbols for minefields include a skull-and-crossbones and a red triangle. Signs are often, but not always, red, and they frequently say ""MINES"" or ""DANGER.""


Where signs are not present, improvised warnings are often used, such as painted rocks (red usually indicates the boundary of the minefield, and white indicates a safe path through it), piles of stones, flags in the ground, tied grass, or ribbons cordoning off an area.

Many minefields have no warning signs, so don't take the lack of a warning sign as an indication that the area is safe.


, Mine warnings often don't last long. Over time, plants, weather, animals and people dismantle or conceal signs. In some areas, metal signs are a valuable building material, and it's not uncommon to see a mine warning used, for example, to patch a metal roof. What's more, in many places, warnings are never installed. Local people, however, often know the general locations of mines and UXO, so your best bet when traveling in potentially dangerous territory is to ask the locals whether an area is safe, or better yet, get a guide.

, Except in active combat situations, if people regularly use a path, you can be sure it is not mined. Just off the path, however, danger may be lurking.

Avoid breaking local laws.,
Be aware of your actions.,
Find a site to explore.,
Walk the perimeter.,
Decide when to make an entrance.,
Find the easiest way in.,
Explore!,
Leave the structure the same way you found it.",How to Explore Abandoned Structures," Trespassing is illegal in many countries and jurisdictions. Private property laws vary from one place to another and you should not assume a legal action in one area is legal in another. At many larger structures, the caretakers will grant permission to view the premises they preserve.;
, Without speaking with a caretaker or owner, you could be perceived as a squatter, vandal, arsonist, or someone looking for salvage. Make your intentions clear to avoid unfounded accusations.

, In most cases, the structures you are looking to explore caught your interest during other activities, rather than by intentional scouting. However, unmentioned structures show their neglect and can be found simply by traveling around your town or city. You can also find structure locations from people with similar interests on internet forums.

, What are the possible entrances (or exits, if there is a need to escape)? Windows, unlocked doors, doors that can be opened by force (note laws), rooftops, tunnels, and holes are all possible entry points into abandoned buildings.

, Sometimes it's better to enter during the day for lighting purposes, but nighttime is usually better because you're less likely to be seen. Bring a flashlight and a friend along!

, Do you have to hop a barbed-wire fence, or can you squeeze through an opening instead? In many cases, you'll find infiltrating a structure is much easier than it looks. Barbed-wire, high walls, and locked doors are all good deterrents, but in many cases, there is a part of the structure that is much more vulnerable.

, Take pictures; look at old furniture, papers, machinery, or anything that catches your eye.

, You wouldn't want to ruin the experience for future explorers. You also don't want a police report filed if anything is destroyed or stolen.

Research the country you are going to before you go.,
Make three copies of everything before you leave.,
Get the addresses and phone numbers of your country's embassy and any military bases (if applicable) before your arrival to the foreign country.,

If you do take a taxi, do not sit in the front seat, especially if you are a woman.,
If driving, be alert to changes in the rules of the road.",How to Be Safe in a Foreign Country," The best and fastest way of researching is to search on the Internet for legal information and things you should know well in advance of traveling to that country. View travel advisories from reputable sources such as the US, UK, and Australian Governments, and take note of any potential issues you may encounter. A streetwise traveler should also know emergency numbers, and at least a bit of the language (like the word for ""help""). Also find out places to avoid, like alleys, bad neighborhoods, and red light districts. Your government may have resources available to travelers that will outline what you need to be prepared for.Know the local customs. There are many gestures that you may be accustomed to, but are frowned upon in other countries where they may be seen as the opposite of their intention. For instance, the thumbs up ""OK"" sign that is used in much of the West is a nasty hand gesture in other countries such as Greece. Your travel agent should be able to help you with determining the customs you're used to that might have the opposite effect in a different country.
Learn how the locals dress. If the locals are dressed in a moderate way, you should dress the same. You don't want to draw unwanted attention to yourself, especially at sites of religious importance.;
, Make copies of your passport, travel itinerary and tickets, credit cards, driver's license, and any other important documents. Copy the back of everything, as well. This can make it easier for you to recover if any of your documents are stolen, but keep the copies in separate locations, and keep them safe. You can also consider making scans of your documents and e-mailing them as attachments to yourself to be printed when and if needed. You may be able to store your important documents in an online ""safe"" for more security.

, For some countries, such as the USA and Australia, it is possible to register with a consulate online, ahead of travel. Once you have done this, if there arises any kind of natural disaster or military conflict, the consulate will know that you are in the country, which is the first step in being able to offer assistance.


Contact your country's embassy (or closest embassy) upon arriving. Advise them of your location and your name, especially if you are in a politically turbulent foreign country. If possible, travel to the embassy, or at least spot it on a map and know how you can get there if you need to.

, Generally, don't wear any of the following:


Excessive or expensive-looking jewelry
A nice pair of sneakers (especially white ones) - You might be tempted to because you might be doing a lot of walking, but a nice pair of sneakers will show people that you are indeed a tourist (which makes you look like a target to thieves).If you must wear sneakers, make sure that they are not the type that would attract attention.
Fanny pack - A pickpocket could easily unzip (or take a knife to) and empty the contents of the the fanny pack without you being aware.
Tote bags imprinted with a tour group operator name or symbol
Obviously new apparel
Electronics - If you must bring them, put them in the oldest, most beaten-up backpack you can find.

, Remember that the tap water may be treated with different chemicals from those in your home country and could still make you ill if you drink it, especially for children and the elderly.Also, when buying water from a vendor in the streets, make sure that the cap is still attached to its ring.

, Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are common to all cities across the world, even your own. The occurrence of STDs like AIDS and syphilis is higher in some cities, especially among prostitutes. Remember, the only guaranteed protection is not having sex in the first place, but if you do, wear or require your partner to wear protection that reduces the transmission of disease, and if necessary take precautions against date rape.

, No one but you needs to know where you are staying, where you are going, and when you are doing it. No matter how trustworthy a person seems, it's not important they know your personal information. If somebody asks where you are staying, then lie. When checking in a hotel, don't say your room number out loud at any time. Ideally, the hotel clerk should be discreet about it also (writing the room number on your key envelope) but if you think others heard your room number, simply ask to have it changed.

, Ask for a room that is not on the ground floor or near the elevator or fire stairs, as they tend to get thieved more often. Bring a rubber door wedge and put it under your door every night, just in case. If someone has a key or picks the lock, the rubber wedge will give you enough time to make a commotion and call for help. If you don't have a wedge, put the chair up against the doorknob. Put a ""do not disturb"" sign on your door when you leave so that people think you're in there. Leave the TV on at a moderate volume so that people cannot tell if your room is occupied or not. Keep your valuables out of sight in a safe or in a not-so-obvious container (like a bread box)., If you are quiet and respectful, you are less likely to draw attention to yourself through your behavior. Depending on the local customs, however, do not assume that being extra friendly is beneficial -- it may be interpreted as an invitation that you never meant to offer, especially if you are female. Avoid doing anything (having drinks, doing drugs) that makes you loud or belligerent in any way. Not only will you draw attention to yourself in a negative way, but you'll also be more vulnerable because you're not completely alert.

, Do not place your credit cards, cash, ID cards, and passport all in the same place.


Keep cash and credit cards separate from ID cards. By keeping things separated you eliminate the risk of having them all stolen.
Always have some cash stashed away in a shoe, a hidden pocket, or in yet another shoe, in case you need immediate cash for taxi ride or something fast to eat. Do not carry too much cash, and never flash it all when you pay.
If you have a wallet, wear it in your front pants pocket instead of in the back and your pocketbook close to the body. To be extra safe, prepare a mugger's wallet -- an inexpensive wallet with a small amount of real cash plus expired credit cards and fake IDs.

, Throw it towards them but aim for further than them. As they run to get the wallet, you have the chance to run the opposite way to get away from them. The muggers are more interested in the cash and won't take the time to examine the fake cards and IDs until later.

, This way, no cars can sneak up behind you and commit a crime. It has also been known for thieves on scooters to snatch handbags as they drive past. Keep your handbag/suitcase on the side of your body that is away from the traffic. By doing this, you can also minimize the risk of any accidents, which could arise from not seeing the speeding cars behind you.

, Steer clear of unlicensed taxis. Better still, hire a car, or get a bus or train. Try to get a seat at the front of the bus, as you will be near the driver. You should never go on the top floor of a bus late at night. If you are getting a train, try to find a seat in a busy carriage somewhere in the middle of the train. This means you will only have to walk down half a potentially lonely and poorly lit platform. If necessary, sit close to the emergency button/intercom.

, If it is a certified taxi driver, then make sure by asking for identification. If you find out too late that you are in an illegal taxi driver's car, break away through windows or the door.

, Make sure the doors open from the inside. When you arrive at your destination, have the money ready immediately and do not linger in the car.

, Some countries will drive on the left side of the road, others on the right. In the U.S., you drive on the right side; in Japan the UK, Australia or New Zealand you drive on the left side. Driving on the opposite side of the road to what you are accustomed is a significant adjustment; in particular, be very careful when turning to be sure you end up on the correct side of the road. Also, don't back up more than absolutely necessary. For example, back out of parking spaces, but don't back up if you missed a turn. Backing up on the wrong side of the road is even more difficult than driving on the wrong side of the road.

In many European cities, for example, pickpocketing is a problem, while some cities in South America and Asia may have issues with robberies. Be aware of what types of crime occur at your travel destination so you can stay safe and protect your belongings.


Refer to your favorite travel guide, travel blog, or travel website to see what types of crimes occur in the city or country you are traveling to.
Ask a friend or relative who has visited that country what their experience was like.;
, Before you go on your trip, check your government’s travel website to see if there are any alerts or travel warnings for that area. These alerts will let you know if there is an increase in crime, violence, theft, or civil unrest in that area., Travel insurance is a worthwhile investment for every traveler. If your research indicates that the area you are visiting has a high theft or crime rate, make sure your policy has theft coverage. If you are traveling with expensive items like a camera, a computer, a tablet, or other costly items, theft insurance can help ensure that you will be able to replace these items if they are lost or stolen. Plus, it will give you peace of mind as you explore your destination.The cost of travel insurance plans is determined by the length of your trip, your destination, and your age. It typically costs between 4% and 8% of your total trip cost.You can receive a free quote online from a variety of insurance companies, including Global Travel Insurance, Travelex, and Travel Guard., Before you leave for your trip, make sure you are able to lock-up your luggage securely. Invest in some baggage locks that allow you to secure the zippers on your luggage or backpack, and buy a padlock so you can lock away your possessions in a locker if you are staying in a hostel or a dormitory setting. A thief will be less likely to go after a backpack or a piece of luggage that is secured with a lock., If you are planning on carrying a backpack during the daytime, consider investing in an anti-theft backpack. These backpacks come equipped with tricky locks and zipper clips, making it difficult for a pickpocket to quickly and easily unzip your backpack. Anti-theft backpacks are often reinforced with a wire or plastic mesh within the material, making it difficult for someone to slash open the bottom with a pocket knife.Many brands, such as PacSafe and Travelon, sell anti-theft backpacks. These backpacks can cost between $60 and $250 dollars and can be purchased online or at sporting goods stores and recreational shops.

, If you are traveling overnight on a train or a bus, secure your backpack with a waterproof bag or sack. The sack will not only protect your bag from water or moisture, but it will also cover up all the pockets, zippers, and straps, making it more difficult to access the items inside.


Waterproof bags and sacks can be purchased online or at a local sporting goods store or a recreational shop. They can cost between $10 to $100, depending on the brand and size., In crowded and popular areas, like the Roman Coliseum or the Parthenon in Athens, pickpockets may be wandering around hoping to snatch something from an unsuspecting tourist in the crowd. If you are visiting a crowded landmark, are on a packed bus, or are standing on a busy metro station platform, make sure your belongings are safe and secure. Be alert and aware of what is going on around you at all times.Keep your backpack or purse in front of you when in a crowd. If it is left on your back or is dangling from your arm, someone can swiftly grab it or reach in and snatch your wallet.
Make sure that all zippers are secure and each flap is completely closed. Do not leave your purse or backpack open.

, Many hotels have a safe within your personal room. If there is a safe in your room, store your passport, some credit cards, and cash inside when you are out for the day. This will help ensure the safety of your most important items. Plus, if you do lose some of your cash, a credit card, or your purse or backpack during the day, you will have a secure stash back at your accommodation.

, Photocopy your ID and passport and keep the copies in a secure place. Give one to a friend or relative at home, and keep another with you while you travel. If you do lose your ID or passport while traveling, having copies will help make it easier for you to obtain a new one., Never keep all of your money in one place. If all of your cash is located in your backpack or purse and someone swipes either item, you will lose everything. Keep some of your money in your purse or backpack, but also store some of it in a secure pocket, a money belt, an inside jacket pocket, or in your shoe.

, Keep a second, cheap wallet in your pocket while traveling. Keep a small amount of cash in the dummy wallet and fill it with old membership cards or loyalty cards. If someone tries to rob you, hand over the dummy wallet. The thief will look inside and see some bills and cards that appear to be credit cards. They will make off with the fake wallet, and your real wallet with be safe with you., Keep your camera safe by attaching it to a wrist strap. While taking photos and exploring new scenery, it is easy to get caught up in the moment and to lose sight of what is happening around you. If your camera is secured at your wrist, a thief will be less likely to grab your camera out of your hand.

Do your homework.,
Hire a travel agent.,
Book early.,
Ask.,
Choose the right cabin.,
Decide on where you want to go.",How to Cruise Economically," Keep an eye on the travel section of the Sunday paper for deals and promotions, and browse the web for bargains. Checking cruise line websites frequently is also a good idea, as they may offer discount cruises to attract hesitant vacationers (especially around the holidays or slow travel seasons, which vary by destination).;
, While the industry of these folks may seem like a dying breed nowadays, you can still secure some great deals on cruising with their help. As professionals, they will know how to find you the best rates, based on the size of your party and the type of cruise you are interested in booking. Finding a travel agent or agency that specializes in booking cruises is both helpful and your best bet.


Alternatively, you could consider booking the cruise yourself. This method is quicker and easier than using a travel agent and is fairly common practice with today's advances in online travel reservations. However, you may find it helpful to book the cruise with an experienced professional to ensure you find the best deal available, especially if your cruise is transatlantic or makes stops in international ports.

, When cruising season reaches its peak, you'll be hard-pressed to find bargain deals. Reserving early allows you to choose from hundreds of available rooms at budget-friendly prices, as well as making reservations for meals at popular restaurants and amenities like spa treatments, shore excursions, and specialty classes.

, Often is the case that you won't be told of special offers or discounts by a cruise line unless you specifically ask for them, so feel free to inquire about any ongoing promotions when booking.

, Doing so could save you hundreds or even thousands of dollars. Just think to yourself - how much time will I be spending in my cabin anyway? Odds are you'll be out and about most of the day enjoying all the ship has to offer, or taking in a shore excursion. The cheapest cabins are typically small, windowless, and located on the lowest decks, but the benefits of cost outweigh the disadvantages. Unless money is no option or you'd like to splurge for a special occasion, don't even consider booking a suite. Large families or groups can save money by booking several rooms instead of one apartment-size suite.

, This should be the final step and your personal travel tastes will likely influence this decision. American cruise lines make voyages to hundreds of destinations around the world, everywhere from the sunny Bahamas to the famed canals of Venice, Italy. A mid-winter cruise to the Caribbean may seem like a good idea to escape the cold, but if an Alaskan cruise with a tour of the glaciers is cheaper, consider saving the former trip for a later date.

Depending on your style and which cruise you are taking there maybe nights when formal dress is required or suggested, you will find this information with your brochures.

, You may want to pack shorts and a t-shirt in your carry on if you are leaving somewhere cold and arriving somewhere warm so you can make a quick change at the airport upon arrival.

, It may be helpful to pack a collapsible bag inside another piece of luggage to use when coming home.

, Make sure you have all of the proper paperwork (passport, photo id, etc.) before getting in line to board to insure a smooth boarding.

,, Your luggage should be brought to your room by the staff.

, This is a must. You might want to be in a table for 2 to only find you're in a table of 8 or vice versa.

, There the staff will show everyone where the life boats and life jackets are and what to do in case of emergency.Please be considerate of your shipmates and don't be late for this meeting.

, These are for your benefit and come in handy in planning all the things you want to do. Port arrival and departure times will be listed there, as well as special activities on the ship; movies, classes, contests, shows, hours of service for services and amenities, etc. Some ships have a channel on the television in your room with all the information you need (weather, estimated times for arrival in port, etc.

, This is the time to take advantage of the beauty parlor, gym, and other amenities offered.

, The cruise director and his/her crew are in charge of most of the activities on board.

, You should keep track of the time you need to get back to the ship they will not wait for you if you miss the boat!

, Most excursions have to be reserved ahead of time. Depending on where you are cruising excursions may include things like snorkeling, para-sailing, helicopter rides, there should be plenty to choose from for everyone.

Remember to steer clear of the cruise ship's help desk right after boarding the cruise, as it will likely be swamped with passengers. Wait until that night or the next day to book your excursion, buy packages, etc.

Pick the time of year you want to travel.,
Search for ideal locations for the specific time of year.,
Figure out how many days your schedule permits you to take off.",How to Choose a Cruise1," Cruises are available year around. Your first step is figuring out when you would like to take cruise. Each destination has what is considered a high season and low season. Oftentimes, the summer months and around the holidays when children are out of school are high demand travel months. There are however perks to seeking a cruise during the lower season months. The high and low season months will vary between destinations.High season: The plus of traveling during the high season is that you will most likely have the best weather and the ideal conditions to go on excursions. The downside is that the high season is more expensive and a lot of times more crowded. If you are planning to travel during the high season, make your reservations further in advance.
Low season: The plus side is that you will likely score a bargain deal on a cruise during the low season. The downside is that the low season typically implies that the weather could be less than ideal and conditions might not be the best for certain excursions like animal sightings, snorkeling, or fishing.;
, Once you decide when you can travel, you can start looking at places that are best to travel to during that specific time of year. Where it is high season one place it is likely low season somewhere else.For example, the best time and weather to travel to Alaska is late-June through mid-July. On the flip side, those same months are considered the low season for Mexican cruises due to the heat.
If you are planning on doing more indoor activities, you might consider choosing a cruise that is operating during its low season, as you will likely find a cheaper ticket.
If you are planning on taking a lot of excursions and engaging in outdoor activities, you will want to find a cruise that is available during its higher season to ensure the best weather and conditions.

, Cruises range from a few days to a yearlong. If you only have a short amount of time, it is best to pick a destination in which you do not need to travel far. Unless you happen to live close to a major port, you will need to fly or drive first in order to catch your cruise.There are 24 major ports in the United States. If you live in Washington, it might be more time feasible to look for a cruise that leave on the western coast of the United States instead of flying all the way to Ft. Lauderdale, Florida.

"
"
Look for a cruise with family-friendly amenities if you are traveling with kids.,
Book a cruise line that is specifically for adults if you are not traveling with children or do not have children of your own.,
Decide what types of activities and excursions you might be interested in doing.,
Make a list of your non-negotiable features.",How to Choose a Cruise2," Family-friendly cruises provide an array of fun activities that kids can do on their own with other kids their age or that families can do together. A cruise can be fun for the entire family.For example, there are cruises that have family-sized staterooms with bunk beds, special mealtimes where kids can dine with their favorite Disney and DreamWorks characters, rock climbing walls, waterslides, and Olympics-style competitions.
There are a lot of kid-friendly cruises. Just search for that criteria and you check out the unique activities and programs that are offered. There will surely be a perfect match based on the ages and interests of your children.

, No one wants to go on a romantic getaway and spend the afternoon in a pool full of splashing kids.


There are tons of different types of cruises! There are cruises specifically for singles, couples, senior citizens, business groups, religious groups, special interests, and more. You name it and there is probably a cruise for it!
Search for adult only and or your specific criteria for a list of great options to check out. Your search might look something like this: adult-only cruise for honeymooners.

, Cruises offer a lot of onboard and off board activities. Each cruise is different though. You want to make sure the cruise you take offers activities and excursions that you would potentially be interested doing.


If you are interested in water activities, you will want to pick a cruise where the weather and water is warm. Caribbean cruises are ideal for those who want to spend their time poolside, in the ocean, snorkeling, deep-sea fishing, paddle boarding, and sunbathing.
If you are interested in outings that include tours through ancient cities and wine tastings overlooking historical landmarks, a European cruise might be what you are seeking.
If you want to marvel in the presence of giant glaciers and snow mobile over vast ice caps, an Alaskan cruise is calling your name.
An example of a good Internet search: kid-friendly Caribbean cruise

, It is your vacation and you should have everything you want and need. It is a good idea to think a little bit ahead about some the features and amenities that are most important to you. This will help you narrow down your choices. Answering the below questions will point you in a better direction.


Do you want to dress up every night or be able to wear jeans to dinner? Some cruises have a more formal dress code for dinner and events.
How important is food? Are you looking for a culinary experience every night or are you into more causal dining? There are cruises that are renowned for their exquisite dining options.
Are you a night owl and want exciting entertainment and party options or are you just looking to unwind and rejuvenate?
Do you need babysitting and child supervision services?
Do you mind crowds? If you are looking for a quieter and more intimate setting, a smaller cruise line might be a better option.
On the cruise website, you will easily be able to find out what amenities and features are offered for the specific ship you are checking out.

Stick to your budget.,
Calculate the cost of getting to and from your cruise.,
Acknowledge what is included and not included in your ticket price.",How to Choose a Cruise3," When planning a trip it is always a good idea to figure out how much money you can spend. Knowing your comfortable price range will be helpful when searching for your perfect cruise. If you are on a tight budget, you might want to avoid searching for luxury world-class cruises. You can find fantastic cruises that will meet your needs and expectations on a moderate budget.


Decide the amount of money that you are putting aside just for this cruise. What’s in your vacation fund?
Stay as close as you can to that number when searching, planning, and booking your vacation. A vacation isn’t supposed to be stressful.

, Your cruise will not include the price of transportation to and from the port. If you are flying within the United States, a flight will typically range from $200-$500. You might also need to stay the night in a hotel on the front or back end of your trip. Add these costs to your cruise price tag., Even if a cruise is advertised as all-inclusive, there will likely be some costs that you will incur. What is included and not included varies from cruise to cruise. Keep in mind that your overall price tag will be higher if you are paying for non-included food, drinks, services, and activities. It is better to know and be prepared than to be surprised when you get a bill.Accommodations, main dining room food, non-alcoholic non-specialty beverages, and onboard activities are typically included in the price of the cruise.
Alcohol, spa services, specialty dining, gratuities, and off ship excursions are typically not included in the price of the cruise.

"
"
Compare cruise lines.,
Read reviews.,
Consult friends, family, and co-workers who have taken a cruise in the past.",How to Choose a Cruise4," Once you have narrowed down your choices based on time of year, length of trip, traveling companions, important features, and price range, you can compare your choices side by side. Access the official websites of the cruises that you are interested in. Make a list of the pros and cons of each one.

, The same way we use reviews when deciding on a hotel, restaurant, or even a movie, reading reviews of cruises can offer some valuable insight. See what others who have taken the cruise you might be interested in have to say about their experience. Use reviews as an additional insight, not as the ultimate source.


Websites like Cruiseline and Cruise Critic are very useful when searching for cruise reviews. You can search reviews by cruise line or by ship.

, It is always nice to have some recommendations from people with whom you have a personal relationship. Experience often brings valuable tips and lessons. Asking those around you with cruise experience might save you a lot of time and the risk of choosing the wrong cruise.

Book early.,
Arrive in your departure city early.,
Choose a comfortable cabin.,
Choose a ship that suits your vacation style.,
Consider the holiday when reviewing itineraries.",How to Celebrate Christmas on a Cruise1," This will ensure you get the ship, cabin and itinerary that you desire. Many people book from 9 months to an entire year in advance.


Look for airfares in advance if you are sailing out of a port that requires you to travel. You can often find better deals when you book your flights early.
Look online for reduced fares.;
, Travel is unpredictable during the holiday season and a delayed flight could mean you miss your cruise if you book too closely to your departure.

, Whether you are traveling with your special someone or a group of family members, where you sleep will make a difference in how well you are able to celebrate Christmas.


Look for a family suite if you have children, or want to wake up together on Christmas morning.
Book adjoining cabins or suites if your group is larger. Don't be afraid to ask for upgrades. Cruise lines may be extra accommodating to large parties over the holidays.

, If you are traveling with children, you might want a cruise ship that has a playroom and a kids pool. If you are religious, look for a ship that has a chapel so you can attend a service on Christmas Day.

, Prepare for Christmas to be spent either at sea or in a specific port of call. This might affect what you do on the actual holiday.


Keep your itinerary flexible. You do not want to over schedule yourself while you are celebrating Christmas.

"
"
Pack a special outfit for Christmas dinner.,
Pack festive items.,
Plan your gift giving ahead of time.,
Check your cruise line's alcohol policy.",How to Celebrate Christmas on a Cruise2," Many cruise lines put together a special and more formal Christmas dining event.

, Have some fun with Santa hats, jingle bell socks and perhaps a stocking for the door of your cabin.


Leave the decorating to the cruise ship. Most cruises will have artificial Christmas trees on board, as well as wreaths and other festive décor. Packing your own tree and other items will take up space in both your luggage and your cabin.

, You might want to exchange gifts before you leave for your cruise.


Pack small items if you want to have something to open on Christmas. Gift cards, candy, jewelry, clothing and other small items are good things to exchange and will not take up a lot of room for you or the recipient.

, You might want to bring your own bottle of champagne or wine to celebrate the holiday. Some cruise lines will allow this and others will not.

"
"
Enjoy holiday menus and meals provided by the cruise ship.,
Participate in special Christmas activities on board.,
Look for church or religious services.,
Take part in local festivities at your ports of call.",How to Celebrate Christmas on a Cruise3," Cruise lines such as Royal Caribbean, Carnival and Norwegian provide complimentary eggnog and serve turkey and ham on Christmas.

, Many cruise lines will have Santa Claus show up, host holiday parties for adults and show seasonal movies for entertainment.

, Many ships will have a minister or priest to celebrate Christmas, and a rabbi to celebrate Hanukkah.

, Many Caribbean islands celebrate Christmas for weeks. There may be caroling, parades and fireworks to enjoy.


Ask your cruise line if you will be stopping at destinations that keep their commercial shops and attractions open on Christmas. Carnival Cruise Lines will only cruise to destinations that stay open on Christmas, for example.

Be careful what you eat and drink before going on a boat.,
Choose a seat associated with the least motion.,
Don't read while on a boat.,
Wear a specially designed wrist band.,
Consider taking some ginger.,
Try over-the-counter antihistamines.,
Ask your doctor about prescription anticholinergics.,
Ask your doctor what drugs may cause or worsen nausea.",How to Avoid Sea Sickness," Before boarding any boat (big or small) try to avoid consuming things that are likely to make your seasickness and nausea worse, such as alcohol, caffeine, fatty foods and spicy foods.Heavy, greasy meals contribute to the development of nausea, which will be worsened by the motion on the water. That being said, it's important not to travel/sail on an empty stomach either. Focus on drinking lots of purified water and eating small portions of low-fat, high-protein foods such as grilled turkey or chicken breast, lean fish, cottage cheese, or legumes.


Sea sickness most commonly affects young children, pregnant women, and migraine sufferers.;
, When booking travel on a cruise ship or boarding any other decent sized boat, try to get a berth or seat as close to the center point of the vessel as possible, because that area will experience the least amount of motion.Also try to get as close to the water as possible because the further away you get from the surface (the top decks of cruise ships, for example), the more motion you'll experience. In addition, try to seat yourself facing the direction of travel because you'll feel better orientated.


Seasickness symptoms arise due to conflicting sensory information between the inner ear, eyes, and brain.In essence, your brain thinks it's moving more than it actually is.
Sailing on large cruise ships doesn't pose as many problems for people because of their relative lack of bobbing motion and use of automated stabilizers.
To acclimate yourself aboard a cruise ship it's best to spend some time out on a lower deck, using the horizon as a point to maintain your equilibrium.
Having a window to look out will also give you a view of the horizon point.

, Just like reading while riding in a car, reading on a boat can increase your risk of getting sea sick.The problem is that your eyes are focused on the words in the book, which aren't moving, but your vestibular senses in your inner ears are picking up on all the movements caused by the boat — this conflicting information for the brain leads to feelings of disorientation, mild dizziness and nausea. As such, don't read books or magazines while on a boat if you're sensitive to seasickness. Instead, keep your gaze fixed on the horizon or on a fixed point until your inner ears and brain better synchronize with each other in terms of movement.


If you're very sensitive to seasickness but enjoy cruising, then book only port-intensive cruises with lots of stops and fewer days on the rougher open seas.
Consider reading prior to getting on a boat because it can make you drowsy and more prone to sleep. Sleeping on a boat, if that's appropriate, can negate the effects of seasickness.

, A particularly interesting approach to negating the nausea and dizziness associated with repetitive motion is acupressure, particularly of the ""P6 point"" near the wrist.Acupressure is an ancient Chinese art of healing that stimulates various points around the body to reduce symptoms and encourage healing. The P6 point is about one inch above the crease of your wrist and associated with controlling or reducing nausea. Specially designed wrist bands are available for this purpose and sold online or at travel stores. Anecdotal reports suggest they are quite effective for all types of motion sickness.


A new FDA-approved device for motion sickness, called the ReliefBand, uses weak electrical current to stimulate the P6 point.
Alternatively, consider simply stimulating the P6 point with your thumb when you begin to feel nauseous and see how it works.
Clinical trials have yielded mixed results concerning the value of acupressure in general, so your results may differ significantly from others.

, An old home remedy for the prevention of nausea involves taking the spice known as ginger. Ginger spice is made from the underground rhizome (similar to root) of the ginger plant — it has a pungent and zesty flavor. Ginger has a long history of being very effective in alleviating many types of gastrointestinal symptoms. Studies looking at sea sickness in naval cadets found that consuming ginger (before boarding) significantly reduces the symptoms of motion sickness, such as dizziness, nausea and vomiting.Medicinally, ginger is most commonly taken as a capsule (dried), but eating it fresh or pickled works also. You can also eat ginger chews or candies.
Take between one to two grams of ginger at least 30 minutes before boarding a boat in order to avoid or minimize nausea.
Numerous studies have confirmed that ginger is particularly effective in relieving nausea and vomiting during pregnancy., Drugs called antihistamines are the most frequently used and widely available medications for the symptoms of motion sickness.Antihistamines work by influencing the part of the brain that controls nausea and vomiting.The most common ones used for sea sickness include dimenhydrinate (Dramamine), cyclizine (Marezine), diphenhydramine (Benadryl), promethazine (Phenergan) and meclizine (Antivert).


Non-sedating antihistamines appear to be less effective, and besides, you may actually want to sleep your time away while on a boat. Promethazine causes the most sleepiness, whereas meclizine (also used to treat vertigo) is less sedating and can be taken as a single daily dose.Medications are most effective when taken prior to boarding a boat and less effective for symptom relief after the sea sickness has begun.

, Anticholinergics are another class of drugs commonly used to combat motion sickness and they work by slowing down the messages related to the involuntary nervous system that go back and forth between the brain, inner ears, and eyes.Scopolamine (Transderm-Scop) is the most well-known anticholinergic and is available as a skin patch meant to be applied behind your ear at least eight hours before boarding a boat. It's effectiveness for nausea prevention can last for up to three days.


Common side effects of scopolamine are the same as those of antihistamines (drowsiness, blurred vision, dry mouth, and confusion).
Scopolamine also has the ability to cause hallucinations and wipe out short-term memory, so extreme caution should be used with this drug. Pills tend to produce more side effects than the transdermal patch, but never use more than one patch at a time.
Other prescription medications sometimes used to manage sea sickness include: antidopaminergics (promethazine and metoclopramide), amphetamines, and benzodiazepines (Xanax and Valium).

, Some prescription drugs commonly cause nausea in sensitive users, so it's important to realize if yours are on that list. If they are and you're planning on a cruise or just going boating for the day, ask your doctor if you can discontinue or reduce the dose over the short-term. For example, some antidepressants, oral contraceptives, antibiotics (erythromycin), anti-parasitics and narcotics (codeine) are known to worsen the nausea of sea sickness.However, never change doses of prescription medication without your doctor's approval.


If you are taking prescription medications, avoid mixing them with alcohol, particularly while on a boat.
Over-the-counter anti-inflammatories, such as ibuprofen and naproxen, can also worsen the effects of motion sickness.

Pick a luxury cruise for comfort and sightseeing.,
Opt for a fly-cruise to avoid the sea passage.,
Go on a smaller ship for the best of both worlds.,
Decide on an itinerary.",How to Cruise to Antarctica1," Go with this to enjoy all the amenities of your classic luxury cruise ship, including room service, dining facilities, and spacious cabins. However, be aware that luxury ships are generally too big to actually land on Antarctica, so only decide on this if you’re content with just seeing it, rather than setting foot on it.In the meantime, enjoy lectures from experts on the continent and its wildlife to complement the breathtaking vistas., Obviously, traveling by plane isn’t what most people think of when they hear the word “cruise.” However, when travelling by boat, anticipate a two-day journey each way across the Drake Passage, which can be exceptionally rough even during mild weather. If your primary interest is actually visiting Antarctica, consider a roundtrip flight if you are prone to seasickness, phobic about rough seas, or simply pressed for time. Once there, you can stay on land or take a shorter cruise just offshore in milder seas., Choose a cruise ship that both sails to and around Antarctica while landing at points of interest along the way. Such ships hold no more than 200 passengers, which means they are small enough to “land” and allow passengers onshore. However, be aware that “landing” is a relative term, which here means that you will simply transfer to smaller inflatable craft to reach the shore, so keep in mind that you may get wet., Once you know which type of cruise you’d prefer, research the options offered by cruise operators. Expect individual cruises to vary by length and destination(s). If you’re already thinking about a trip to Antarctica, you probably have a good idea of what you hope to see and do there, so find a specific cruise that matches your interests. For example, if you love seals and penguins, make sure to book a cruise that visits South Georgia and the Falkland Islands, which both animals frequent in abundance."
"
Forget winter.,
Maximize the amount of visibility.,
Factor in the weather.,
Match your itinerary to wildlife’s.",How to Cruise to Antarctica2," As you may imagine, winter is an extreme event both in and around Antarctica, so don’t expect cruise lines to operate at this time of year. If you’re from the Northern Hemisphere, remember that seasons in the Southern Hemisphere occur at the opposite time of year. Plan your vacation for sometime between October and March., Remember that the closer you go toward either pole (in this case, the South Pole), the longer the days last around the summer solstice. To optimize the most amount of daylight available for sightseeing, go in December and/or January, when days last their longest. Depending on the cruise operators, this may also extend the amount of time you get to spend on shore each day before returning to the ship., Again, consider the amount of daylight available to determine when is the best time to go and beat the colder weather. Plan for December and January to enjoy the mildest conditions. Expect more severe changes in weather the earlier or later you go in the season, when nightfall occurs earlier., If you’re going specifically to see your favorite Antarctic animal in the wild, find out the best time of year to see them and synchronize your trip. For example, if you love fur seals, go in December, when they start crowding the beaches. If, on the other hand, you prefer bull elephant seals, go earlier, before the fur seals overcrowd them and force them out."
"
Ask about food.,
Research activities.,
Find out if they provide clothes and gear.,
Compare cabin and cruise prices.",How to Cruise to Antarctica3," Remember that you’re going to be stuck onboard for a number of days with nowhere else to get food. Contact each cruise operator that you’re interested in to find out if they can provide for your dietary needs if you have any specific restrictions or concerns. Although most if not all include meals in their ticket prices, double-check what this covers exactly. Expect the amount of courses offered per meal to vary, as well as the availability of snacks and certain beverages (like alcohol), which may only be offered at additional cost., Expect most cruises to offer a wide variety of onboard and onshore activities. However, anticipate that not all of these may be included in the ticket price. For instance, being transported from ship to shore may be part of the ticket price, but additional activities once you reach shore may involve rental fees for equipment on top of the initial ticket price., Keep in mind that the weather in Antarctica can be severe, even in the summer months. Prepare to dress accordingly. However, if budget is a concern, contact the operator before you go clothes-shopping. Although you will undoubtedly be responsible for items like thermal underwear and socks, find out if outer gear like parkas and rubber boots are covered by the ticket price or available to rent., Expect cabins onboard one ship to vary in price depending on their location, with cabins on lower decks usually being lower in price. Additionally, be aware that some companies offer the same itinerary on different ships with different prices. If one ship seems out of reach, find out if another ship with fewer amenities follows the same itinerary."

Understand that it is almost impossible to avoid eating more than you usually do on a cruise ship.,
Realize that you don't always have to take that fancy hors d'oeuvre or beverage which waiters will often come up and offer to you.,

Request a special or dietetic version of your meal.,
Limit your beverage intake.,
Eat lunch at the buffet restaurant.,
When eating at the buffet, don't overdo it.,
Skip the midnight buffets!,
Get creative by making a meal plan for your cruise and stick to it.,
Work off those desserts.,
Keep in mind that it's not a bad idea to splurge every now and then.,
Eat slowly it is a good way to try everything you like without feeling deprived; you will avoid overeating and will feel satisfied with less food.

",How to Avoid Overeating on a Cruise," Unless you have good self-control or are keeping to a strict diet, it will be difficult not to splurge on the foods you like.;
, One or two mini egg rolls and a margarita is fine every now and then, but you will quickly intake unnecessary calories if that literally becomes a fourth meal.

, This is because the meal is sit-down style and you will be waited on, instead of having the temptation to get up frequently for additional helpings. While there may be several courses, dining this way allows for portion control since you will only be receiving one plated serving.

, This includes low fat, low sodium, low carbohydrate, vegetarian or kosher. It may not be as plentiful or tasty as the full fat version, but it will save you calories and perhaps a visit to the ship's gym in the long run. Requests should be made when you make your cruise reservations if you want the best chances to receive a special meal, but they can also be made as soon as you board with the dining room maître d'.

, Soft drinks and other beverages will also contribute to weight gain aboard a cruise. Limit your soda, juice, sugary drink, and alcohol consumption and instead opt for water or sugar-free beverages.

, There aren't as many food choices for lunch as there are for breakfast and dinner, so you won't be tempted to take as much.

, Just because it may be ""all-you-can-eat"" doesn't mean you should stuff yourself until you feel like you're about to explode. Take a plate and fill it with one appetizer, one entrée, one side dish and one dessert. If you can manage to get full by finishing a meal served on a smaller plate, even better.

, Do you really need a heaping slice of chocolate cake or berry cobbler at two in the morning? Try to stick with regular mealtimes to avoid going to sleep uncomfortably with a full stomach. Instead, call it a day for snacking at least an hour before you go to bed.

, For example, try eating a large dinner on the first night but a small one the next, or get a room service breakfast one morning instead of a full-scale meal in the dining room. It will be difficult to keep to, but if you can it will save you lots of guilt and heartache.

, If you must have that fattening dessert or other snack, compromise by doing something to work it off later on. Tell yourself that if you're going to eat that double cheeseburger or banana split sundae now, you'll go to the gym before bed or sign up for that challenging hike excursion at the port-of-call tomorrow.

, You're on vacation, after all! You can and should have that extra appetizer or dessert at some point during your cruise, but don't go overboard. (No pun intended!) Set limits for yourself, build up your self-control and walk off the ship weighing the same you did when you stepped on - or less!

Stay away from companies asking you to call a foreign number.,
Avoid unsolicited or unrealistic offers for cruise jobs.,
Contact your financial institution if you've already been scammed.",How to Avoid Cruise Scams1," Terms like ""eligible to win"" or ""free"" are words that cruise scams use to draw victims to them. If a trip is indeed free, do not give out your credit card or banking information because you should not be charged anything.Other scam cruise lines will claim that the cruise is free but then charge port fees, taxes, staff gratuities, and a booking fee.These fees could all add up to be more expensive than booking a cruise with the liner.

A timeshare is when you obtain partial ownership over a vacation property and can use it a couple of weeks out of the year to vacation., Giving you an area code that appears to look like a local call but is actually a long distance number is another popular cruise scam. These calls can sometimes cost up to $5 per minute. If you are unsure of the origin of the number that the cruise line has asked you to call, do a quick search online to see where the call is located.


Avoid 900 numbers that begin in 876, 868, 809, 758, 784, 664, 473, 441, 284 or 246., Many cruise job scams exist online. Their aim is to gain your personal information and potentially steal your money. When looking for a cruise job, make sure that you use the cruise's official website rather than a job board. Legitimate cruise lines will almost never make an unsolicited offer to a private citizen, so beware of any jobs that give you an offer before you fill out an application or go on an interview.Legitimate cruise lines such as Royal Caribbean, Princess Cruises, Carnival Cruise Lines, Cunard Line, Disney Cruise Lines, and Crystal Cruises all warn job applicants of potential fraudulent postings from cruise scammers.

, Contact your bank or credit card provider and ask if you can get a stop payment on your money before it gets processed. If you paid with a card, it's possible that your financial institution can stop the unauthorized payment. If the scammers have stolen your identity, your card company may transfer you to the fraud department, where you'll have to give a statement as to how you were scammed.Once you do that, then it's also advisable you contact your local law enforcement authorities and report the scam.

Look at reported cruise scams online.,
Search for the company that sent the offer.,
Contact business affairs or consumer services.",How to Avoid Cruise Scams2," Royal Caribbean International has a comprehensive list of previously reported scams. If you've received an offer for a cruise, check their website and run a search. If you find the captain or liner is associated with a scam, avoid contact with that cruise company. If you are unsure if a cruise that contacted you is a scam, email the fraud department at Royal Caribbean International at scams@rccl.com to inquire.


Cruise scams include SEA MASTER CRUISES, Azamara Club Cruise Line Australia, Royal Caribbean Inc® The Anthem Of The Seas Cruises©, Royal Caribbean International® The Quantum Of The Seas Itinerary, and Norwegian Cruise Tourist Line Australia.Other scam cruise lines include Caribbean Princess Cruises, Crown Cruise Liners, Infinity Cruise Lines International, and Ramos Cruises Inc., If you received an offer for a discounted or free cruise, doing a quick online search may bring up surprising results. If you see any information on the company being a potential scam, stay away from the offer and delete the email. Make sure to copy and paste the name of the company directly into your search engine because often the names are similar to legitimate cruise companies.


Beware of websites that are a letter or two off from a legitimate cruise's website.Read online reviews for customer satisfaction on third party websites like Yelp.

, Another way to research the company that you want to book a cruise through is by contacting the government agency that regulates them. Do an online search for the state's business or consumer affairs office and find their phone number. Give them a call and inquire about the offer you received, and whether it's been reported as a scam before.


The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services phone number is 1-800-435-7352.When on the phone you can say something like, ""I've received an offer for a free cruise in my email, and I was calling to see if you have received complaints about it being a scam.""

Use a credit card.,
Use the cruise's official website to book the cruise.,
Use a travel agent to book your cruise.,
Decide what kind of cruise you want.",How to Avoid Cruise Scams3," Using a major credit card like Visa, Mastercard, or American Express will allow you to track your purchase and will provide a purchase history if the cruise is a scam. In addition, the Fair Credit Billing Act allows you to get a refund if the merchant fails to deliver on the cruise.This may not apply to debit or bank cards. Check with your bank to see if there is protection on your purchases.

, Using the cruise line's official website is a good way to avoid scams online. Beware of phishing emails that will route you to a website that looks similar and has the same layout, because they are trying to steal your personal information.Always go to the official website. If you don't know it, search for the cruise in a search engine and make sure that they have a legitimate company listing.


Some of the most popular legitimate cruise lines include Carnival Cruise Line, Princess Cruises, and Royal Caribbean International., Travel agents can be beneficial because they usually will have a lot of knowledge about the different cruises available and can cater your vacation to your desires and tastes. In addition, if they are a recognized travel agent who specializes in cruises, they may also get promotional offers or discounts that will be passed along to you. Do a search online for a reputable travel agent and talk to them one on one about what you're looking for on a cruise.


Some popular travel agencies online include Zicasso, smalTours, and Vantage Deluxe World Travel.Get booking confirmations from both the agency you're booking the cruise through and the cruise company itself. This will allow you to dispell any confusion that may happen between you and the travel agent.
Talk to your agent about the type of climate or weather you enjoy, the kind of cruise you want to go on, and what parts of the world you want to see.

, Climate, weather, and location are all critical aspects of a cruise. Other things you should take into consideration include the age of other passengers on the cruise, and whether the cruise is domestic or in another country. Select a trip that would be appropriate and fun for the other people that you're taking.


Types of cruises include romantic cruises, senior cruises, kid-friendly cruises, and nightlife and entertainment oriented cruises.
You can go on a cruise in the cold waters of Alaska or in the tropic climate of the Caribbean.

Find the volume of the submerged portion of the object.,
Find the density of your fluid.,
Find the force of gravity (or another downward force).,
Multiply volume × density × gravity.,
Find whether your object floats by comparing with its gravity force.,
Use the same approach when your fluid is a gas.",How to Calculate Buoyancy1," The force of buoyancy that acts on an object is directly proportional to the volume of the object that is submerged. In other words, the more of a solid object that is submerged, the greater the force of buoyancy that acts on it. This means that even objects that sink in liquid have a buoyancy force pushing upwards on them. To begin to calculate the buoyancy force acting on an object, your first step should generally be to determine the volume of the object that is submerged in fluid. For the buoyancy force equation, this value should be in meters3.


For objects that are completely submerged in fluid, the submerged volume will be equal to the volume of the object itself. For objects that are floating on the surface of a fluid, only the volume under the surface of the fluid is considered.
As an example, let's say that we want to find the buoyancy force acting on a rubber ball floating in water. If the ball is a perfect sphere with a diameter of 1 meter (3.3 ft) and it's floating exactly halfway submerged in the water, we can find the volume of the submerged portion by finding the volume of the entire ball and dividing it in half. Since the volume of a sphere is (4/3)π(radius)3 , we know our ball's volume is (4/3)π(0.5)3 = 0.524 meters3. 0.524/2 = 0.262 meters3 submerged.;
, The next step in the process of finding the buoyancy force is to define the density (in kilograms/meter3) of the liquid that the object is submerged in. Density is a measure of an object or substance's weight relative to its volume. Given two objects of equal volume, the object with the higher density will weigh more. As a rule, the higher the density of the fluid an object is submerged in, the greater the force of buoyancy. With fluids, it's generally easiest to determine density simply by looking it up in reference materials.


In our example, our ball is floating in water. By consulting an academic source, we can find that water has a density of about 1,000 kilograms/meter3.
The densities of many other common fluids are listed in engineering resources. One such list can be found here.

, Whether an object sinks or floats in the fluid it's submerged in, it's always subject to the force of gravity. In the real world, this constant downward force is equal to about 9.81 Newtons/kilogram. However, in situations in which another force, like centrifugal force, is acting on the fluid and the object submerged in it, this must also be taken into account to determine the total ""downward"" force for the entire system.


In our example, if we're dealing with an ordinary, stationary system, we can assume that the only downward force acting on the fluid and object is the standard force of gravity — 9.81 Newtons/kilogram.
However, what if our ball was floating in a bucket of water being swung at great speed in a horizontal circle? In this case, assuming the bucket is being swung fast enough to ensure that both the water and the ball don't fall out, the ""downward"" force in this situation would be derived from the centrifugal force created by swinging the bucket, not from the earth's gravity.

, When you have values for the volume of your object (in meters3), the density of your fluid (in kilograms/meter3), and the force of gravity (or the downward force of your system), finding the buoyancy force is easy. Simply multiply these three quantities to find the force of buoyancy in newtons.


Let's solve our example problem by plugging our values into the equation Fb = Vs × D × g. Fb = 0.262 meters3 × 1,000 kilograms/meter3 × 9.81 newtons/kilogram = 2,570 Newtons.

, Using the buoyancy force equation, it's easy to find the force that's pushing an object up out of the fluid it's submerged in. However, with a little extra work, it's also possible to determine whether the object will float or sink. Simply find the buoyancy force for the entire object (in other words, use its entire volume as Vs), then find the force of gravity pushing it down with the equation G = (mass of object)(9.81 meters/second2). If the force of buoyancy is greater than the force of gravity, the object will float. On the other hand, if the force of gravity is greater, it will sink. If they are equal, the object is said to be neutrally buoyant.


For example, let's say we want to know if a 20 kilogram cylindrical wooden barrel with a diameter of .75 meters (2.5 ft) and a height of 1.25 meters (4.1 ft) will float in water. This will take several steps:

We can find its volume with the cylindrical volume formula V = π(radius)2(height). V = π(.375)2(1.25) = 0.55 meters3.
Next, assuming ordinary gravity and water with ordinary density, we can solve for the force of buoyancy on the barrel. 0.55 meters3 × 1000 kilograms/meter3 × 9.81 newtons/kilogram = 5,395.5 Newtons.
Now, we'll need to find the force of gravity on the barrel. G = (20 kg)(9.81 meters/second2) = 196.2 Newtons. This is much less than the buoyancy force, so the barrel will float.



, When performing buoyancy problems, don't forget that the fluid that the object is submerged in doesn't necessarily have to be a liquid. Gases also count as fluids, and, although they have very low densities compared to other types of matter, can still support the weight of certain objects floating in them. A simple helium balloon is evidence of this. Because the gas in the balloon is less dense than the fluid around it (ordinary air), it floats!

Be careful when moving your bridge.",How to Build a Spaghetti Bridge," You will first need to build a structure that simulates the terrain on either side of the bridge. You can build a bridge across two, equally tall tables or build a structure out of wood to place your bridge on. It's usually best to build the structure so that you can hang a container of some type underneath the bridge.;
, Now that the support structure is in place, you need to measure the distance between the two sides of the support structure to determine the length that your bridge will need to span., Design your bridge on a sheet of graph paper first. Cover the paper with a clear plastic film and use it as a template. Lay the spaghetti strands over your drawn design to cut them to the right length and glue them together.


Draw a sketch of your bridge on the graph paper first before laying down the clear film covering.
Then lay your spaghetti over the lines you have drawn on the graph paper.
Once you have ensured that the spaghetti has been cut to the proper specifications outlined on your graph paper, remove the spaghetti from the clear film covering and carefully glue the pieces together.

, The type of glue you use will make or break your bridge. Regular craft glue is a poor choice, as it is water based, which causes the pasta to soften when the glue is applied, and it takes a long time to dry. Model airplane glue and hot glue from a glue gun are easy to apply, but are slightly more flexible when they dry. This is not ideal for reinforcing the joints of your bridge. Epoxy, although messy, is the ideal solution for maximizing the strength of your bridge. Epoxy dries up firmly and will provide the best support for your bridge joints. Many brands of epoxy dry in five minutes or less.When working with very young children, you can use marshmallows or even popcorn to hold the joints together, rather than glue for fun and safety.This obviously makes for a less sturdy bridge, but the same general principles of engineering can be gleaned from the exercise.

, Trusses are triangle-shaped support beams that attach point-side down to the roadbed of the bridge on either side. Attach the trusses to each other with glue. Trusses distribute the forces of the weight you will add to the bridge. Rectangular trusses will work, but will drastically decrease the weight or load your bridge can hold. Triangular trusses are ideal for building a spaghetti bridge. , You can do this by gluing several layers of spaghetti to each other to make a thick, flat roadbed. You may want to leave the strands unglued in some layers so they will naturally move and help redistribute the weight., Securely attach the trusses you have built to each side of the roadbed and to the trusses on the other side. The finished bridge will have a roadbed on the bottom with trusses rising above on both sides, like walls and a roof., Rather than setting the bridge itself on the scale, set it on something stable like a box and weigh both. Then, subtract the weight of the box. You can also use 2 scales, placing 1 underneath each edge of the bridge, and then add the weights together.


Weighing the bridge is optional. This is usually done as an instructive method. It allows a teacher to show the relationship between the bridge's total weight and the weight it can hold.

, Place your spaghetti bridge over the support structure you arranged or built and hang a lightweight container under the center of the bridge. The size of the container will necessarily depend on the size of the bridge you have built.


Alternatively, you can place the weight directly on the roadbed of the bridge. However, this will increase the chances of you accidentally collapsing the bridge when placing weights on it, so be very careful., Again, the size and density of the weighted objects will depend on the size of the bridge you built. For smaller bridges, coins will work as weighted objects. For larger bridges, consider using something like bags of sand or, if your bridge is quite large, actual weights from a weight set.


Make sure you know the actual weight of the objects you use so that you can accurately determine how much weight you’ve added to the bridge before it collapses.

, Begin to add weights to the container a little at a time. Take care not to jar the bridge or cause the container to swing. This can be a very nerve-wracking process.

, Eventually, you will have added too much weight for your bridge to hold and it will collapse. After enjoying the bridge’s destruction, determine how much weight the bridge held by calculating the sum of the weights you added to the bridge.

, You will now want to go through this process again making minor alterations to the materials or adjustments to how you constructed the bridge. The goal here is to see if you can build a stronger bridge capable of holding more weight. Like any good science experiment, a little trial and error will be necessary.

, If you want to make a bridge that can sustain large amounts of weight, you will need to use the best materials. As stated above, epoxy is the strongest bonding agent you can use. Also, you want to make sure you have plenty of pasta on-hand to make the necessary reinforcements to your bridge.


Consider the benefits and disadvantages of various types of pasta.Rounded spaghetti noodles may be better for some parts of your bridge while flattened noodles, like linguine, may be better for other parts., The purpose of building a spaghetti bridge is to apply the theoretical principles of engineering to a real-life construction project. As such, how you design the bridge deeply impacts the overall strength of the bridge. Some tips for building a stronger bridge include:


Use triangular rather than rectangular trusses.
Build the roadbed with multiple layers of pasta.
You should leave the middle layer of your pasta roadbed unglued. Some flexibility in the pasta helps to redistribute weight across your bridge., The longer the gap a bridge has to span, the harder it will be to redistribute the weight from one area across the entire bridge. So, if it is up to you, making a shorter bridge will help your bridge sustain more weight., There is relationship between the weight and strength of your bridge. Adding more pasta to your bridge during construction, when properly built, should add strength, but also adds more weight. The heavier your bridge is, the more likely it is that it will collapse when extra weight is applied. So, make sure you account for the weight of your bridge when designing your bridge., A number of schools, school districts, science museums, universities, and engineering-oriented groups hold spaghetti bridge building competitions. Find one in your area and sign up.Some competitions have various categories for different types of bridges. Make sure you identify what type of bridge you want to build for the competition and enter it into the correct category.

, Spaghetti bridge building contests have unique rules about sanctioned building materials, size limitations or restrictions, types and sizes of weights, etc… Be sure to read and follow all of the rules carefully. You don’t want to get disqualified., You can find inspiration for your spaghetti bridge by looking at actual bridges around the world. Bridges are unique feats of engineering, with each one being built to very exact specifications. As such, looking at real life bridges can give you some great ideas to outdo the competition when the time comes., Each spaghetti bridge building competition is different and, as such, will employ a different system of applying weight to the bridge to make it collapse. It is wise to start preparing early and to use the same type and placement of weights to test the strength of the bridge you will build. , While some bridge competitions require that you build your bridge on-site, others may require you to bring an already built bridge to the competition. If this is the case, make sure you have a safe and effective way to move your bridge from point A to point B without breaking or weakening your bridge. "

Place a small bowl or cup inside a bigger one.,
Fill the inner container to the brim.,
Submerge a small object.,
Collect and measure the water that spills over.,
Calculate the weight of the spilled water.,
Compare the displaced water's mass to the object's.",How to Calculate Buoyancy2," With a few household items, it's easy to see the principals of buoyancy in action! In this simple experiment, we'll demonstrate that a submerged object experiences buoyancy because it displaces a volume of fluid equal to the volume of the object submerged. As we do this, we'll also demonstrate how to practically find an object's buoyancy force with this experiment. To begin, place a small open container, like a bowl or a cup, inside a larger container, like large bowl or a bucket.

, Next, fill the small inner container with water. You want the water level to be at the very top of the container without spilling. Be careful here! If you spill any water, empty the larger container before trying again.


For the purposes of this experiment, it's safe to assume that water has a standard density of 1000 kilograms/meter3. Unless you're using saltwater or a different liquid entirely, most types of water will have a density close enough to this reference value that any minor difference won't alter our results.
If you have an eyedropper handy, this can be very helpful for precisely leveling off the water in the inner container.

, Next, find a small object that can fit inside the inner container and won't be damaged by water. Find this object's mass in kilograms (you may want to use a scale or balance which can give you grams and convert up to kilograms). Then, without letting your fingers get wet, slowly and steadily dip this into the water until it starts to float or you can just barely hold on to it, then let go. You should notice some of the water in the inner container spill over the edge into the outer container.


For the purposes of our example, let's say that we're lowering a toy car with a mass of 0.05 kilograms into the inner container. We don't need to know the volume of this car to calculate its buoyancy, as we'll see in the next step.

, When you submerge an object in water, it displaces some of the water — if it didn't, there wouldn't be any space for it to enter the water. When it pushes this water out of the way, the water pushes back, resulting in buoyancy. Take the water that spilled out of the inner container and pour it into a small glass measuring cup.The volume of water in the cup should be equal to volume of the submerged object.


In other words, if your object floats, the volume of the water that spills over will be equal to the volume of the object submerged under the surface of the water. If your object sank, the volume of the water that spills over will be equal to the volume of the entire object.

, Since you know the density of water and you can measure the volume of the water that spilled into the measuring cup, you can find its mass. Simply convert its volume to meters3 (an online conversion tool, such as this one, can be helpful here) and multiply it by the density of water (1,000 kilograms/meters3).


In our example, let' say that our toy car sunk into the inner container and displaced about two tablespoons (.00003 meters3). To find the mass of our water, we'd multiply this by its density: 1,000 kilograms/meters3 × .00003 meters3 = 0.03 kilograms.

, Now that you know the mass of both the object you submerged in water and the mass of the water it displaced, compare them to see which is greater. If the mass of the object submerged in the inner container is greater than that of the displaced water, it should have sunk. On the other hand, if the mass of the displaced water is greater, the object should have floated. This is the principle of buoyancy in action — for an object to be buoyant (float), it has to displace an amount of water with a mass greater than that of the object itself.


Thus, objects with low masses but big volumes are the most buoyant types of objects. This property means hollow objects are especially buoyant. Think of a canoe — it floats well because it's hollow in the inside, so it's able to displace a lot of water without having a very high mass. If canoes were solid, they wouldn't float very well at all.
In our example, the car has a higher mass (0.05 kilograms) than the water it displaced (0.03 kilograms). This lines up with what we observed: the car sank.

Participate fully in any muster drill.,
Seek out all fire/emergency information available on the ship for passengers, such as pamphlets, brochures, or maps.,
Walk the routes from your cabin door to fire exits, or other access to open air.,
Pack a flashlight or two with extra batteries in your luggage, in case the ship’s interior lights are not working during a fire and your room and corridor are dark.,
Consider the fact if a large amount of smoke is present in the hallway when you open your cabin door, you will have to crawl on the floor because smoke rises, and there should be better air quality at floor level.,
If no instruction has been given about where to go during an emergency for leaving the ship, inquire about how you can learn this information.,
Pack some food in your luggage that does not need to be refrigerated.,
Maintain calm by doing whatever coping activities you have learned which reduce your stress, such as deep breathing (if the air is clean) stretching, holding a positive attitude, being observant, listening rather than talking, and not panicking.

",How to Be Safe During a Cruise Ship Fire," This is an exercise designed for passengers to practice moving safely and quickly during an emergency to prevent injury and save lives. Passengers learn how to use life vests and about escape routes on their ships. Muster drills are required by international law and for good reason. While they may seem like a nuisance during a vacation they are done for your own safety and well-being. (Some people just try to hide out in their cabins, but their attitude is likely to increase their risk of injury.) Rehearsing your movements and safety precautions before an actual emergency could prove to be the difference between life and death. Imagine the chaos of thousands of panicking people. The muster drill is your chance to practice the things that could save your life.;
, You can also inquire about the availability of presentations from ship staff about what to do during a fire or other emergency. Accurate information you can read, or view in a video or listen to in a presentation should help prepare you in case you need to move rapidly away from smoke or fire.

, Make mental notes about the location of your cabin and the paths you will travel in order to get to fresh air. Then note the possibility a fire might begin at night and you might have to move in darkness from your cabin to the fire exits. If you are aware of this possibility and imagine it, there is less chance of panicking, and panicking generally causes people to make poor decisions and lose their ability to think clearly in an emergency. Make sure you have at least one back-up route from your cabin away from smoke or fire in case your first pathway is blocked.

, Cabin doors and corridors on ships look very similar and the experience of being of being on a very large cruise ship can be like walking in a large maze where it is easy to become confused and disoriented, even with normal lighting.

, Also carbon monoxide could be in the air, and staying low helps to avoid it. It should be avoided because breathing will cause a person to pass out, and it is odorless so it isn’t easily detected.

, Or if it has been given, but you were not paying attention, or unclear on some points, then ask for instruction again. Also, make sure you don’t blow off such safety training for a trip to the buffet or entertainments, because it could save your life.

, If power is lost on the ship, food that requires refrigeration will spoil quickly and you may have nothing to eat if the ship’s food supply also is spoiled and there is no way to cook properly. If you pack prepared foods such as crackers, cookies, granola bars, or dry cereal at least you will have safe food to get you through the ordeal. Having a reliable source of safe food can be very emotionally reassuring during a time of high stress.In addition you may want to bring some bottled water just in case drinking water is not available.

If you plan on exhibiting your model of DNA when you finish, prepare a base for it to sit on. This might be a small wooden board with a dowel running through the center for the DNA strand to be attached to.






You will need to bake the polymer clay when you finish shaping it, so make sure you have a working oven available too.






You may choose to use a flexible wire to give added support to your DNA model.





;
, Choose one of your polymer clay colors, and roll it out into pieces about one foot long and ½ an inch thick. These will form the sides of the strand of DNA, so make sure they are sturdy enough that other pieces can be attached without them falling apart.


To add extra support to your structure, you can wrap the clay around two long pieces of flexible wire.






You can freely alter the size of your DNA model strand to meet your personal preferences. To create a smaller DNA model, simply reduce the size of these double helix strands.

, The double helix strands of DNA are made up of two groups: sugars and phosphates. Use another one of your polymer clay colors to make the phosphate pieces on the double helix.


Roll out the color you’ve chosen for the phosphate group until it is flat. Cut strips of the clay ½ inch wide and ½ inch long.






Starting at the bottom of one of the long double helix strands, wrap a piece of the flat phosphate clay around the strand.






Make sure that it is pressed flat into the helix strand, so that it won’t fall off.
Leave half an inch of empty space on the strand, and then add another piece of the flat phosphate clay. The open area of the double helix represents the sugar groups.






Continue alternating the clay between the sugar and phosphate ½ an inch apart, until you’ve covered both of the double helix strands.







, There are four nitrogenous bases that make up a strand of DNA: cytosine, guanine, adenine, and thymine. They make up the “ladder” steps between the two double helix strands. Choose one color of polymer clay to represent each of these four bases.


Roll each color of clay into pieces ½ an inch long, and about ¼ of an inch thick. Use a knife to cut the edges of these, to give them a smooth finish.






Count how many sugar groups you have created on your double helix strand. This is the number of pairs of nitrogenous bases you will need to create.






Pair off your colors into the correct groups. Cytosine and guanine must always be paired together (in either order), and thymine and adenine must always be paired together (in either order).






If you want to give more support to your nitrogenous bases pairs, cut pieces of flexible wire to be just over 1 inch (2.5 cm) long, and use these in the centers of your clay.






Combine the pairs of colors by pinching the edges of two strands of your ½ inch pieces of clay together. Once the colors are attached in the center, gently roll the piece to create one smooth, continuous piece of clay.







, Once you’ve made all of your 1 inch (2.5 cm) sections of nitrogenous bases, you must stick them to your double helix.


Start at the first sugar group on your double helix. Use another small piece of clay the same color as the sugar group, around the size of a pea.
Attach one of the nitrogenous bases to the sugar group using the small piece of colored clay. Pinch the pieces together, and smooth the edges by rolling it between your fingers.
It may be easiest to attach all the nitrogenous base pieces on one side only to one strand of the double helix. Then, when you have all of the 1 inch (2.5 cm) sections sticking out from one side of the double helix, attach the other strand to the opposite side.
Make sure all the pieces are securely attached. If you inserted wire into the centers of your nitrogenous base groups, you can use stick the ends of the wire into the double helix strands to attach it better.

, To give your DNA model the classic spiral shape, hold your double helix at both ends and then twist them counter-clockwise.

, Follow the baking instructions on the polymer clay package, and then bake your model to set its shape.


If you have wax paper, set your model on this to make sure it doesn’t stick to your pan.
Always allow time for the model to cool after removing it from the oven to avoid burning yourself.

, Once the model has been baked and cooled, show off your hard work! Hang it with fishing wire from a mobile or your ceiling, or use a wooden base to attach it to.

, The straw will serve as your hydrometer. Note how far up the straw pokes from the top of the jar or graduated cylinder. You want the open end of the straw to poke no more than 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the top of the container of water. If it does poke up more than this, add weight to the straw to keep it from floating up too high and flipping onto its side.


You can add weight either by adding more clay, plasticine, or gum to the outside of the straw at the sealed end, or you can drop small weights such as BBs, split shot sinkers, small nails, or pebbles down the inside of the straw until it floats at the right level.

, This point is your zero line.

, Your hydrometer is now calibrated for ""pure"" water (either distilled or regular tap water). From here, if you wish, you can mark lines above and below this line. Ideally, each line should be 1 mm (about 1/32 inch) apart, or at least as close as the width of the point of your marker will allow.


You may want to use multiple colors for your lines, such as red for the zero and 10-mm lines, and black for the lines between them.

Gather your supplies.,
Make the double helix.,
Add the “ladder rungs”.,
Make your nitrogenous base groups.,
Bead your nitrogenous bases.,
Attach the other double helix strand.,
Cap the ends of your model.,
Twist the double-helix.,
Display your model.",How to Build a DNA Model2," For this project, you will need several feet of a flexible wire, wire cutters and pliers, and beads of your choice.


If you wanted to take this project one step further, you could use a soldering iron to attach all the pieces to each other permanently.






You can use any beads, although glass beads give the best appearance for this project. Add seed beads (the smallest type of beads) as spacers between larger beads if you prefer.






Have at least six colors of beads prepared in a large enough quantity to match the desired size of your project.






If you intend on mounting this project for display when you finish, create a base out of wood for your model to be attached to.







, These are the long strands on the sides that hold the ladder-shaped DNA molecule together. Cut two pieces of wire to an equal length; these pieces will make up the body of the DNA model, so make them whatever length you would like depending on how big or small your want your model to be.


Choose two colors of beads, and put one on one end of each piece of wire. Wrap the end of the wire through the bead a second time, creating a loop on the outside of the bead. This will prevent the beads from sliding off the end of the wire.






Add two colors of beads in an alternating pattern down the wire. The two colors represent the sugar and phosphate groups that make up the length of the double helix.






You can choose to use 1 bead of each color or multiple beads of each color, but make sure that you have the same amount of beads for both colors on the wire.
Do the same for your other double helix piece of wire, making sure that when the two pieces are set next to each other the colors (sugar and phosphate groups) line up.






Leave two inches of empty space at the top of the wire, so that you can attach the “ladder rungs” in the space between beads.

, Count the number of sugar groups you created on the double helix, and then cut pieces of wire 2.5 inches (6.4 cm) long in that number.


Wrap the ends of one piece of wire around the double helix wire near to your sugar group beads. Do this for all the pieces, so that you are left with one complete double helix with many pieces of wire sticking out from it.
If you want to make a more aesthetically pleasing and sturdier DNA model, use your soldering iron to weld the small pieces of wire to the long double helix strand.

, Choose four other colors of beads, and give them each one of the nitrogenous bases to represent. Guanine and cytosine are always a pair, and thymine and adenine are always a pair.


You will probably need multiple beads to fill each little piece of wire, so choose equal numbers of each nitrogenous base beads to attach to the wires.
Make sure that you keep your bead pairs in the correct groupings. Always put cytosine and guanine together, and thymine and adenine. You can put them in any order you want though, and have more of some pairs than of others.

, Once you’ve gotten all the beads separated out, place them onto the wire spikes you have sticking out from your one double-helix strand. Be sure to leave a about ½ inch of space at the end of the wire for it to be attached to the other double helix strand.

, With all the beads added to the nitrogenous base pieces, you can bring your other double helix strand over to attach. Line up the side so that it mirrors the first nitrogenous base, and then attach the small pieces of wire.


You can wrap the pieces of wire to the double helix strand using needle-nose pliers. Attach these small bits of wire to the same place you did on the opposing double helix strand.
If you are able, you can use your soldering iron to melt the last pieces of wire together, creating a very smooth-looking model.

, To prevent any beads from coming off your model, wrap the wire in a loop around the last bead on each of your double helix strands. You can also choose to solder the wire into a knot-shape to block beads from coming undone.

, To create the classic spiral shape of a DNA strand, hold the ends and gently spin them counter-clockwise.

, once you have added all the finishing touches, your model is complete! Hang it from a mobile or your ceiling using fishing wire, or attach it to a wooden base with a bit more wire or glue. Show off your handiwork!"

Add 1 g (0.004 oz.),
Put the hydrometer in the water.,
Remove the hydrometer and add more salt.",How to Build a Hydrometer2," of salt to the water. Stir the water to ensure the salt dissolves completely.


If you're doing this experiment in a home school setting and don't have a scale to measure out 1 g of salt, you can instead measure the salt by volume. One gram of salt takes up 0.89 ml (0.18 tsp.) volume, so you can get by using 1/4 tsp. of salt in place of 1 g.

, Note the level to which the hydrometer floats.


If you marked your hydrometer with measurement lines above and below the zero line, write down the measurement of the line which now floats at the water's surface.
If you didn't mark your hydrometer with measurement lines, mark a line at the point on your hydrometer that now floats on the water's surface. (You can also mark this point if you did mark your hydrometer with measurement lines by using a different color marker than those used to make your measurement lines.)

, Add the same amount of salt each time, repeating the above steps and recording the level to which the hydrometer now floats.

Know about all safety procedures.,
Report all spills, injuries, or broken equipment to your teacher.,
Dress for lab work.,
Wear proper protective equipment (PPE).,
Know where to find safety equipment.",How to Behave in a School Science Lab1," If an emergency does occur, it is important that you know the correct way to act. All safety and emergency procedures should be discussed at the beginning of the school year. In addition, relevant safety measures should be reviewed before each experiment.If you are unsure about a specific process, ask your teacher so that you will know exactly what to do.;
, Immediately after a spill or breakage occurs, it must be reported to your teacher. No matter how small it may seem, your teacher needs to know so that the proper cleanup procedure can be followed.Broken glass can have sharp edges that can lead to cuts so handle it with care. It must be disposed of in a special broken glass container.
Never try to clean up a chemical spill without consulting your teacher first.

, Do not wear bulky clothing as this will be difficult to manage and may come into contact with a flame or chemicals. Roll up your sleeves and keep long hair tied back. Wear shoes that are closed-toe, low heeled, and cover your entire foot.Wear clothes that cover your whole body, such as long pants or a long skirt.
Jewelry and contacts should not be worn in the lab., When working in a science lab, you must always wear a lab coat, gloves, and protective eyewear. The lab coat will protect you from chemical spills and gloves will protect your hands when handling chemicals or bacteria.Eyewear should cover both your eyes and the sides of your eyes to protect from splashes.
Disposable gloves of latex or nitrile should be used and removed before leaving the lab.

, Familiarize yourself with the location of any and all safety equipment which may be available, including the fire extinguisher and the eyewash station. If you have access to an emergency shower, know where this is located.You also need to know where the exits to the room are found and follow evacuation procedures quickly and quietly if needed.

Be diligent and persevere, because you’ve landed a tough gig.,
Have the need to always keep learning.,
Be patient, observation, and think outside of the box.",How to Become a Scientist," Starting in high school, and continuing into your undergraduate years in college, you should take classes that teach you the analytical and critical thinking skills you will need to be a scientist. This is a must to get a leg up later in life.


You'll need to be well specialised in mathematics. Scientists in the physical sciences use a great deal of mathematics, particularly algebra, calculus and analytical geometry, while those in the biological sciences use math less often. All scientists need a working knowledge of statistics, too.
Consider going to science camp during high school. You'll do more intensive projects than you do in your regular science classes in school.;
, While you will specialize in a particular discipline later, you'll need to take basic courses in biology, chemistry and physics to ground you in the basics of each science, as well as the scientific method of observing, making hypotheses and experimenting. You can also select elective courses based on areas of interest or to discover new areas of interest to help you define your specialty. In a year or two, you can commit to a more specific branch of science.


Skills in one or two foreign languages may be helpful as well, in order to read older scientific papers that haven't been translated into English. The most helpful languages to learn include French, German and Russian.

, After you’ve gotten your feet wet and you’re familiar with the directions this career could take you, declare a major in a more specific branch of science. Planetary? Medical? Psychological? Geneticist? Agricultural?


If you'd like or if your college's lack of options necessitates it, you can wait to declare something more specific later (aka grad school). A general major like chemistry is fine, too.

, It's best to start making connections and doing work as soon as possible. Contact one of your professors about an internship – you may be able to get your name associated with a paper your team publishes, too.


This will get you 100% certified lab experience, which is going to be helpful for going to grad school and looking for more serious jobs later. It shows you've been taking college seriously and have a grip on what's expected of you.

, You'll also need to write well as a scientist, both to obtain grants for your research and to publish your results in scientific journals. Classes in English in high school and technical writing in college will help you polish your skills.


Always be reading scientific journals and keeping up with the field. You'll be in those journals yourself, in time. Look to their work for structure and the basics of a good scientific paper.

, While some commercial and industrial positions are available to college graduates with a bachelor's degree, most scientists have at least a master's and more likely a doctorate. Graduate programs are geared more toward original research and development of new theories, working with a professor or other scientists, and possibly using cutting-edge technology. Most graduate programs take at least 4 years, and possibly longer, depending on the nature of the research.


At this time, you'll have to declare a specialty – something that greatly narrows down the field and allows you to have a concentration. This will make your work more unique and your field of competition smaller.

, In grad school, you'll need to look for a research internship for your specific area of interest. The amount of professors that are working on something that speaks to you is going to be quite small – which means you'll likely have to go elsewhere to find it.


Your professors and your school in general will be very helpful tools in finding which internships exist and where. Tap into all the connections you've made to find something that fits you like a glove.

, Post-doctoral programs provide additional training in whatever specialty you've chosen as a scientist. Originally lasting 2 years, these programs now usually last at least 4 years and possibly longer, depending on the field of study and other factors.


In addition to this, you'll be doing three or so years of post-doctorate research after this. If you've been counting that's 4 years of undergrad, around 5 years of higher education, and 3 years of research, which means it'll be a solid 12 years before you're actually working. This time-limit is something to be aware of as soon as possible.

, During your decade and more of education (and your career), it's wise to keep up-to-date in your field and related others by attending conferences and reading peer-reviewed journals. Science is constantly changing – in the blink of an eye you could be left behind.


In smaller fields (and some larger ones), you'll get to know all the names in these journals. Reading them will let you know who you should ask for research help or favors when the time comes.

, Scientists are always working on some project or idea. Regardless of how far up the career ladder you are, this is a given. But after your post-doctoral research, you'll likely need a job. Here are a few of the basic opportunities you'll find:



A science teacher. This one is pretty self-explanatory and doesn't always require upper education (depending on the level you want to teach). In some areas and fields, you'll need education credits, too.

A clinical research scientist. Many scientists work with a major company or the government. To start out, you’d be a clinical research associate. You would work on clinical trials, of say, emerging medications. You would gather date and monitor procedures making sure everything is up to protocol. Then, you get to perform analyses on whatever project you’re currently working on, developing products (like vaccines), or sometimes even working with patients, physicians, or technicians about laboratory procedures.

A professor. Many scientists, at least eventually, have the goal of becoming a professor and getting tenure. It's a well-paying gig with job security and you get to affect the lives of many. However, do know that it can take decades to get here.

, Scientists choose to become scientists because they are fundamentally curious about the world around them and how the things in it work. This curiosity leads them to investigate the how and why behind what they see, even if the investigation takes years to come to fruition.


Coupled with curiosity is an ability to reject preconceived notions and be open to new ideas. Frequently, an early hypothesis is not borne out by the evidence of later observations and experiments and must be modified or discarded.

, As briefly discussed above, becoming a scientist takes a long time. There are very few careers that take longer than this one. Even when you're doing with your education, you still have to get research under your belt. If you're an instant-gratification type of person, this may not be the gig for you.


Some jobs only require a bachelor's and sometimes a master's. If you're not in a place where you can spend a decade not making money, this could be a viable alternative.

, It's been said that ""taking IQ into account, quantitative skills, and working hours, jobs in science are the lowest paid in the US."" What this is getting at is that because of the long path to success, for a while you won't be living lavishly. Things are going to be tough for a while.


You'll also be meeting deadlines, often not determining your own hours, and working whenever your work says you need to. All of this combined makes it a difficult job, especially to stick with.

, Essentially what every scientist does it seek out knowledge. Whether it's reading peer-reviewed journals, attending seminars, or working toward getting yourself published, you'll always be learning. Does this sound like a normal Tuesday? Then you're probably made of the right stuff.

, No scientist's work is done in a day, a week, a month, and often even in a year. In many cases, like clinical trials for example, you won't get results for years. This can be very dissatisfying. A good scientist needs to be patient.


Observation skills are also necessary. In those years of waiting for results, you need to constantly be looking for the smallest changes in what you expect to see. Your eye needs to be focused and ready at all times.
And as for thinking outside of the box, think back to Newton's apple falling on his head or Archimedes jumping into his tub and displacing water. Most people would think nothing of these events, but these men saw something else, something no one else was seeing at the time. To make strides in human knowledge, you have to think differently.

Gather all of the necessary materials.,
Cut two 6-inch (15-centimeter) strips of platinum or platinum-coated wire.,
Wind each wire strip around a thin metal rod to shape it into a spring.,
Cut the leads from a 9-volt battery clip in half.,
Attach the exposed wire ends to the electrode coils.,
Tape the electrodes to a popsicle stick or dowel rod.,
Fill the glass with tap water or salt water.,
Lay the stick over the mouth of a glass of water.,
Connect the wires coming from the electrodes to a voltmeter or LED bulb.,
Touch the 9-volt battery terminals to the battery clip for one to two seconds.,
Remove the battery.,
Read the output on the voltmeter.",How to Build a Fuel Cell," To build a simple household fuel cell, you will need a 12 inches of platinum or platinum-coated wire, a popsicle stick, a 9-volt battery and battery clip, clear tape, a glass of water, salt (optional), and a volt meter.,A 9-volt battery and battery clip can be purchased at an electronics or hardware store.;
, You will need to purchase this wire from an electronics supply store, as platinum isn't used for common wiring purposes. The platinum serves as the catalyst for this reaction.


Platinum wires are recommended because other substances, such as copper, will react with the oxygen or the salt to pollute your solution with the products of this reaction.High quality stainless steel can also be used as it will not react as readily., These two springs will serve as the fuel cell's electrodes. Take the end of the wire and wrap it tightly around your shaping rod to form a coil. Remove the first wire from the shaping rod and wrap the second wire.


The shaping rod can be a nail, pick, wire coat hanger or lead on a battery tester.

, Using a wire cutter, snip both of the wires attached to the clip in half and strip the insulation off the leads.


Using the stripping portion of the wire cutters, strip the insulation off of one end of the cut wires. Only strip the ends of the leads you cut off the battery clip

, Attaching the wire leads to the electrodes allows you to hook up your power source (the battery via the battery clip) and the voltmeter for reading how much electricity the fuel cell is producing.


Twist the red battery clip lead and the red clipped wire lead around the top end of one of the coils, leaving most of the coil free.
Twist the black battery clip lead and black clipped wire lead around the top end of the remaining coil.

, The popsicle stick needs to be longer than the mouth of the container holding the water so it can rest on top. Tape the electrodes so that they hang down, away from the stick and can be easily submerged into the water.


You can use clear plastic tape or electrical tape. It doesn’t matter as long as the electrodes are firmly attached to the stick.

, In order to get a good reaction, the water solution needs electrolytes.Distilled water does not work well for this because there are no impurities to serve as electrolytes. Salt and baking soda dissolved in water serve as good electrolytes for the reaction.

Regular tap water has impurities in it such as minerals that can serve as electrolytes if you don’t have any salt handy.
Add a tablespoon of salt or baking soda for each cup of water. Stir until fully dissolved.

, The coil electrodes should be submerged in the water for most of their length, except where they're connected to the wires from the battery clip. Only the platinum should be submerged.


If necessary, tape the stick in place so the electrodes stay in the water.

, The voltmeter is to show electric current created by the fuel cell once it's activated. Connect the red wire to the meter's positive terminal and the black wire to the negative terminal.


You may see a small amount of voltage at this point, such as 0.01 volts, although the voltmeter should read zero at this point.
You can also connect a small bulb, such as a flashlight bulb, or a light-emitting diode (LED).

, The battery is needed only to send an initial current through the wire to cause the hydrogen in the water molecules touching the electrodes to separate from the oxygen, forming bubbles around the electrodes.This process is called electrolysis.


Notice the bubbles forming around each electrode. One electrode has bubbles of hydrogen, while the other electrode has oxygen bubbles.
The battery source does not need to be completely attached the clip, just touched to the battery terminals to begin the reaction.

, The battery is only needed to initiate the reaction. The separated hydrogen and oxygen will recombine into water, releasing the energy originally used to split them as electricity.The platinum in the electrode coils serves as a catalyst to speed the recombination of the hydrogen and oxygen into water molecules.

, Initially, the output may be as great as two volts, but will decline as the hydrogen bubbles dissipate, quickly at first and then gradually as the last of the bubbles pop.


A light bulb or LED may appear bright initially, but will quickly dim and then gradually fade away.

Abide by all of the classroom rules.,
Never run in the laboratory.,
Perform only the specified experiments.,
Listen carefully to your teacher at all times.,
Conduct yourself in a responsible and cautious manner at all times.",How to Behave in a School Science Lab2," A school science lab is just like any other classroom and you must follow all of the rules of conduct that you would in your classroom. Respect your teacher and listen when they are talking. Raise your hand to speak or ask questions.Listen to all instructions before beginning any experiments.

, There are many pieces of expensive and breakable equipment in a science lab. Microscopes, spectrometers, and glassware can be knocked off the edge of a workbench if you are running around. While it may be an accident, that equipment is expensive to replace once it is broken.Be aware of your surroundings and walk at all times when in the lab.

, When you are in the laboratory, you are there to focus on one or two specific experiments detailed by your teacher. This is not the time or the place to go off on your own and start mixing chemicals to see what happens. Follow the instructions for the lab of the day and only do those experiments.Performing your own experiments without supervision can be dangerous and lead to injury.

, When working with dangerous materials, injury or accident could easily occur if directions are not followed. Your teacher knows the proper way to handle everything and expects you to learn these procedures by listening to them.Learn the rules specific to your lab. In school labs, you will be forbidden from eating, drinking, or chewing gum while experiments are underway.

, At no time should anyone in the lab engage in roughhousing, pushing, running, jumping, or other risky behaviors. Be aware of your surroundings and avoid knocking things off lab benches.Never throw anything in the lab.

"
"
Check your equipment for breakage.,
Tilt test tubes away from you.,
Add acid to water, never water to acid.,
Never pipette by mouth.,
Turn off gas and heating equipment when not in use.,
Clean your lab station before departing.",How to Behave in a School Science Lab3," If you find a crack in a glass beaker or other container, dispose of the glass in the proper location. If you find a leak in a hose, get a replacement. Broken equipment is hazardous to work with and should always be replaced before starting an experiment.Tell your teach if notice that some of your equipment is damaged before the lab begins.

, This rule is particularly important when heating the test tube. If the tube cracks or breaks the solution inside will not be splashed on you because you held the tube away from you. This is also helpful to avoid inhaling fumes that may be coming from the solution in the tube.You should always know exactly what chemical you are working with and the hazards associated with it.

, When diluting acids, never add the water to the acid. When water and acid combine the reaction releases a lot heat and can rapidly boil causing an explosion. This rapid boil explosion can splash concentrated acid onto you or those around you. As long as you always add acid to the water, you can avoid this.A teacher should always be around to supervise when you dilute acids or bases.

, When using a suction pipette, always use the bulb of the pipette to take up the liquid. Pipetting by mouth can lead to accidental ingestion of the solution. This is particularly dangerous if the solution you are pipetting is hazardous.Always use the suction bulb or pump.

, If you are using a Bunsen burner or a hot plate for an experiment, make sure that it gets turned off immediately after you are done using it. A hot plate looks the same hot as it does cold so be careful around this equipment. Before leaving the lab, check around and make sure everything is turned off.Never place your hand directly on a hot plate. Hold it slightly above the plate to test the temperature.

, At the end of every experiment, clean all of the equipment you used and wipe down the lab bench. Dispose of all chemicals properly and remove your proper protective equipment.Leave the lab space as clean as or cleaner than you found it for the next student.

Due to the fact that there isn't an orthodox route to becoming an epidemiologist, many enter into epidemiological study after attaining a degree as a Doctor of Medicine (MD), Master of Public Health (MPH), Doctor of Public Health (DrPH), or Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD).Some medically oriented programs have started offering degrees for a Master of Science of Epidemiology.Admission into one of these programs could fast track you on your way to your goal of becoming an epidemiologist.;
, Epidemiologists are expected to process large amounts of statistical data about populations and the pathogens afflicting these populations. From this analysis, an epidemiologist might recommend or conduct research into the prevention, medication, or education about a particular health concern in a population., Epidemiologists make conclusions about health concerns by looking at large populations or data from case/cohort studies. Many epidemiological programs utilize the mathematical functions in Excel to make sense of and manipulate medical data. Facility with data analytic software will give you a leg up on your competition.

, By reading up on current health issues and how these are being handled, you will familiarize yourself with the trends in the epidemiological world. This kind of reading is also useful in the development of your professional intuition, which will help you react more competently to new information you may be confronted with., The statistical nature of most epidemiology programs all but ensures that application boards will want you to have a strong quantitative score on your GRE.Do practice tests, complete study guides, and take (or re-take) the test and achieve a competitive score.

, Even in an environment as removed as a laboratory, epidemiologists are expected to recognize and respond appropriately in emergency situations. Working in a clinical setting, like an ER, can help you further develop grace under pressure, which may be critical when working with dangerous pathogens.


This experience can also likely be used to strengthen your application to an epidemiology program.

, Many programs look for candidates who have attained a Masters degree in a related field, like public health.A degree in a medical field, like medicine or pharmacy, will open up doors to higher paying and responsibility positions as epidemiology, as these individuals will have the ability to work with, diagnose, and prescribe treatment.


PhD's, especially those in medical or medically related fields, often are strong candidates for working in larger facilities, like a medical laboratory or hospital., Most graduate programs in epidemiology will have courses specifically in biostatics, or the study/application of statistics to biological information and research.If there are any undergraduate courses related to biostatics, taking these before your graduate study will aid your future learning in this area.

, There are many factors that should be taken into account when selecting a graduate program for epidemiology. Take some time to think about the areas of the field that interest you most. If the epidemiology programs of prospective schools orient research in the direction of your interests, that might be an indication of a good fit.

, After you've narrowed down your prospects to a few programs, you can begin looking into the research of individual faculty members. These individuals will be experts in various aspects of epidemiology, and some may even end up being your faculty advisers, should you enter the program.


Look into blogs or professor rating sights to see what kind of reputation the faculty has. If many individuals complain there isn't enough direction in the program, or that graduate students are mistreated, you should take this into consideration.
You may want to select a few professors that you feel might be good graduate advisers while you study and perform your own research.

, Ultimately, your education is what you make of it. Some individuals do better in a smaller, more intimate setting, while others thrive in a larger context. This is a matter of taste, but the strength of a program is not. Some organizations have ranked top epidemiological programs on criteria for the purpose of helping young medical health professionals find the right fit. Take a look at the rankings as evaluated by Public Health Online at:


http://www.publichealthonline.org/epidemiology/masters-degree-programs/#context/api/listings/prefilter

, You will at least need your GRE test results in addition to your application form, though the GRE requirement may be waived for medical students who submit MCAT scores instead.Other requirements generally include:


Personal statement/statement of purpose
Curriculum Vitae
Transcripts (college/medical school)
Signed letters of recommendation, You will have to pay the credit hour fees associated with your program, but to even be considered for enrollment you will likely have to pay an application fee as well. These can differ significantly from program to program, but you should expect to pay anywhere between $60 - $100., The application process to many of these programs is very involved, and missing a step or document may disqualify you from being accepted. Pay close attention to the application process as outlined by the schools in which you are most interested.


If you are still a student, or are a recently graduated university student, you may want to talk with a guidance counselor about the application process. Counselors often have experience with these things, and in the event they do not, can point you in the direction of someone who can help.

, While you are taking your graduate courses in epidemiology, you will be expected to read a lot of literature on associated topics.This research will acquaint you with the methodologies and practices involved in specific areas of epidemiology, and whether or not you actually enjoy working in these areas.


Is there an aspect of implementation that you find tedious or unbearable? Do you find yourself anxious at the thought of working with viral pathogens in the field? Your reading will help you discern just what might be the best fit for you.

, Over the course of your epidemiology program, you will be expected to perform both research related and clinical tasks.You may even have an opportunity to do fieldwork. Your experiences with these kinds of situations should shed light on the kind of work environment you might want to pursue after graduation.

, It's easy to get carried away with romantic notions about the medical profession as seen in pop-culture, but the reality can differ greatly from expectations. Your colleagues and professors are a great resource for learning more about real-world epidemiology jobs. Some jobs you may want to inquire about:


Applied epidemiologist at a state agency
Infection control epidemiologist at a hospital or medical laboratory
PhD of epidemiology at a university
Veterinary epidemiologist, These can vary considerably between programs. Failure to perform to the standards established by your university may require you to re-take a course or rewrite a significant document, like a thesis or grant. The main areas you will focus on in your epidemiological studies are:


Biostatics
Quantitative methods for resolving public health and clinical medical problems
Data management
Clinical research methodologies
Disease screening methodologies, In addition to normal class requirements, the overwhelming majority of graduate programs will require you to complete a peer reviewed thesis intended for publication or a grant proposal.Once you have achieved this final condition, you will be ready to enter the epidemiological workforce.

, You may have had a mentor at your university or a professor that you worked closely with. These are often ideal people to consult about job opportunities. You might ask:


""Where have other graduates from our epidemiology program found work?""
""Is there anyone you can refer me to about continuing my research?""
""Do you happen to have a colleague at who I could talk to about employment opportunities?""

, This includes government agencies, like the Centers for Disease Control. Think back to research you particularly enjoyed while earning your degree. What organizations were those researchers affiliated with? This may put you on the track of your new workplace.

, The American College of Epidemiology has a comprehensive section of job postings for many different agencies. Check to see if these might be suitable for you.

, You have the opportunity to make many connections at these kind of conferences, and you may even reconnect with friends or previous colleagues who might be able to recommend you for work. You should also use these events to learn of any shifts in the epidemiological community that might influence your research or job-seeking.

, Some experts estimate that the highest paid jobs in epidemiology can be found in the fields of pharmaceuticals and medical manufacturing.You may be able to get this kind of job through the knowledge of specific pharmaceuticals you gained over the course of your study.

Budget for added expenses.,
Decide where you want to go.,
Determine whether a last minute booking is right for you.,
Figure out what kind of traveller you are.,
Read budget cruise reviews.",How to Avoid Being Disappointed by a Budget Cruise1," If you book a budget cruise and expect to pay little during your trip, you are more or less signing up for disappointment. Budget cruises will require you to pay for soda, water, yoga classes, spa treatments, excursions, and internet access, amongst other expenses. You can easily end up paying much more in added expenses than you paid for the cruise in the first place.Find out the cost for typical on-board items such as water, soda, and internet access, and then integrate these costs into your trip budget.
Find out the cost of your shore trips and integrate these into your overall trip budget.;
, If you have a particular destination or region in mind for your budget cruise, you should stick to it. If you end up compromising on your chosen destination in order to save money on a budget cruise, you may end up being disappointed. However, if you have no particular destination in mind, you should look into repositioning budget cruises that are typically available on a dime. These are budget cruises that go from one place to another in order to prepare for the next cruise season, such as crossing the Atlantic or going along a coast that is not especially noteworthy., One can find budget cruises by searching for last minute deals. As the departure date approaches, travel and cruise companies will begin lowering their prices to get people on board. If you have a flexible schedule, you might as well book last minute. However, there is no guarantee that a place on your chosen budget cruise will still be available. To avoid disappointment, you should either avoid booking last minute or set realistic expectations. There is no guarantee of getting on a budget cruise by booking last minute.A last minute booking may be a good option if you do not have a particular destination in mind.
You might also consider booking in low season. The low season will depend on the destination of your cruise. If you are going someplace that sees a lot of traffic like Bermuda, the low season is the first few weeks after the start of cruises and before the end of the season. In Northern Europe, it can be difficult to find any low season bookings., Think about whether you prefer to spend time napping and sitting by the pool or whether you prefer to have a lot of activities on a budget cruise. Depending on how you enjoy spending your time while travelling, you will have very different needs for a budget cruise.If you are an enthusiastic scuba diver, you will want to find a budget cruise that offers plenty of opportunity and time for scuba diving during shore excursions. Look for a cruise that stops at one of the ten best scuba diving ports. These ports include Cozumel, Roatan, Grand Cayman, Key West, Grand Turk, Kauai, St. Thomas, St. Maarten, Tortola, and Nassau.If you want to relax and read a book, you should avoid party cruises that cater to younger consumers and find a cruise that has a well-stocked library. Although many cruise ships will have libraries, some ships offer more extensive library collections and reading areas. For example, the Oceana Marina cruise ship has a beautiful library with leather chairs and mahogany book shelves., Visit cruise review websites and search for customer reviews by cruise line, ship, destination, and cruise style. Cruise review sites often also have articles on popular cruise ships and particular cruise destinations. Read articles and reviews to find out which budget cruise might best meet your needs.There are many different “cruise styles” available for specific kinds of customers. Common cruise styles include family cruises, entertainment cruises, fitness cruises, senior cruises, romantic cruises, gay and lesbian cruises, and spring break cruises. If you identify with any of these categories, the cruise critic website allows you to read cruise reviews for these cruise styles.If you find a budget cruise that meet many of your needs but is in a different cruise style than you would prefer, you should probably keep shopping. For example, if you find a budget fitness cruise and you are not a fitness fanatic, you might consider looking elsewhere.

Plan to arrive early for your port departure.,
Avoid scheduling too tightly on shore trips.,
Plan your excursions.,
Pre book your spa appointment.,
Set realistic expectations for your budget cruise.",How to Avoid Being Disappointed by a Budget Cruise2," If you are working within tight timeframes, avoid the mistake of booking your flight for the same day as your budget cruise departure. Although the timing might look fine on paper, this approach is risky because your baggage could end up being delayed or you could miss a connecting flight. To avoid the disappointment of a missed cruise, you should aim to fly in to your departure city at least a day prior to the start of your budget cruise., If your budget cruise stops at a port for a few hours or days, you should avoid scheduling your trip on shore too tightly. If you go too far from port or schedule too many activities or site visits while on shore, you run the risk of missing your cruise departure. Cruise boats will not wait for you. If you want to avoid the disappointment of a cruise that ends early and in a highly inconvenient manner, you should avoid tight scheduling of on shore activities.Add up the time for transportation, site seeing, eating, and any other activities you anticipate doing on your excursion. Once you have an estimated total for your excursion, add an extra two hours for unanticipated hold-ups such as flat tires or taxis that arrive late. Once you have the total time for your excursion plus an extra two hours leeway, plan to arrive back at your cruise ship an hour early so that you have time to get settled back onboard.The advantage of taking a ship-sponsored shore excursion is that you know the cruise ship won’t leave without you because so many of its passengers will be on the excursion.Consider booking a half-day tour and then relaxing for the rest of the day in fairly close proximity to the port., You should look into the packaged shore excursions and compare them with local options that are advertised online. You might even join an online discussion forum to find out about local tour options or find people on your budget cruise who might also be interested. You might be able to save money and get a better experience by booking yourself instead of with the cruise company., Spa treatments fill up fast on many budget cruises so you will want to pre book your spa treatments well ahead of time. As soon as you book your budget cruise, go ahead and book your spa treatments to avoid disappointment., If you manage your expectations, you will be less likely to experience disappointment. This includes expectations for yourself during your budget cruise, expectations for others such as cruise staff, and expectations for family members and friends. Be realistic about what you might expect from budget cruise staff, your family, friends and yourself.If you bring work on the cruise, be realistic about what you might reasonably be able to achieve while on a cruise. There will be limited internet and work space.There may not be the same level of service that is common on higher priced luxury cruises. Adjust your expectations accordingly.

Pack the essentials.,
Pack alcohol if you can.,
Leave some room in your bag for souvenirs.",How to Avoid Being Disappointed by a Budget Cruise3," It is important to pack your passport, personal identification, travel insurance card or phone number, prescription medicine, a first aid kit and seasickness medicine such as behind-the-ear patches. You should also make sure you have all of your toiletries, including conditioner, since these may not be stocked on budget cruises.Remember your passport. Remember to update and pack your passport, since most budget cruises will pass across nation states.
If you have to fly into your departure port, you should remember that anything you pack also has to get through airport security.

, Find out your cruise alcohol policy and bring alcohol if you desire it and the budget cruise allows. If you have a favorite wine or alcohol, find out if you can pack it yourself. Many companies allow you to bring a limited amount of your own wine or beer. This will prevent the disappointment of having to purchase poor quality wine or spending excessively at the cruise bar., If you pack your bags to the point of bursting, you may end up being disappointed upon the realization that you have no room for souvenirs. The simple solution is to leave a little space for souvenirs at the top of your bag.If you anticipate purchasing small trinkets, you can leave an extra inch or two of room at the top of your bag. However, if you anticipate purchasing larger souvenirs such as rugs or larger craft objects like masks, you may need to bring an extra bag. You can always pack an extra bag inside your check-in bag if you are an ambitious shopper.If you are an ambitious souvenir shopper and wish to avoid excess baggage fees, consider shipping your souvenirs from one of the ports. It will probably be cheaper than the excess baggage fee at the airport.Some common souvenirs that won’t make it through customs include Absinthe, meat based soups, objects made from ivory, larger souvenirs from Cuba, Iran or the Sudan, fruit and vegetable products, and many designer knockoffs. Look at the materials that your souvenir is made from and consider whether you have a good chance of getting it through customs."
"
Avoid work.,
Eat wisely.,
Schedule your internet time for the port.,
Skip the casino.",How to Avoid Being Disappointed by a Budget Cruise4," If you bring a lot of work with you and spend your days on your laptop or cell phone, the budget cruise may pass you by and end in disappointment. To avoid this scenario, you should try to get your work done prior to departure. If you absolutely must work on your cruise, try to schedule short periods of work and then enjoy the rest of your time relaxing., The all-you-can eat buffet is not a challenge to your eating abilities. Arrive early to the buffet and examine the items carefully. Food left out too long on buffet tables is a common cause of food poisoning, which is really not fun when you are out at sea., Internet access is often very poor on budget cruises, so you should avoid it as much as you can. You might end up spending too long getting little done online. Instead, you should check your email and do internet related activities when you come into port., The casino is a real cash grab that could easily end in disappointment. Instead of risking your savings at the on-board casino, save your money for souvenirs and on-board activities that are more likely to bring enjoyment."

Consider if forensic pathology is the right path for you.,
Prepare for your medical career in high school.,
Pursue a pre-med focus in college.,
Find a supportive advisor.,
Gain clinical experience.,
Take the Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT).,
Go to medical school.,
Get an internship in forensic pathology.,
Pursue a four-year residency as a forensic pathologist.,
Take a fellowship as a forensic pathologist.,
Get certified as a forensic pathologist.,
Run for the coroner's office.,
Embrace advanced in technology.,
Join the National Association of Medical Examiners (NAME).",How to Become a Forensic Pathologist," Before you pursue a specialized education, you should research the state of the profession. There is currently a shortage of forensic pathologists both in the U.S. and in many other countries. Demand for this job is high, but the pay is also low compared to other doctors who specialize in internal medicine.The average mid-career salary of a forensic pathologist is between $150,000 and $180,000. This pay is lower than even entry-level salaries for doctors entering into careers in hospital pathology.You should investigate the salaries of forensic pathologists in your area -- the salaries of state-employed coroners and research assistants should be publicly available. Given the high cost of medical school, you should consider if you can pay off your student loans with this salary.;
, It's never too early to think about what you might want to do as a doctor. In high school, take as many courses in biology, chemistry, physics and psychology as you can. If you enjoy these courses and can do well in them, then you might pursue a pre-med program in college.

, As you are researching colleges to attend, consider going to a school with a strong pre-med program. When you visit the college, ask members of the admissions team how many of its graduates are accepted into medical school. Although the requirements will vary between different medical schools, you should consider taking the following courses in college:


At least one full year of biology with labs. You will probably want to take at two years (four semesters) of biology in order to be a competitive candidate for medical school.Inorganic (general) chemistry and organic chemistry.
Two semesters of a physics course.
A mathematics course and a statistics course.
English literature and composition.
A course in behavioral sciences (such as psychology or sociology) to prepare for the Behavior section of the MCAT.
Take electives in forensic science, criminal justice, or other forensic pathology areas.

, If your university offers a focus on forensic pathology, consider working closely with a professor who focuses in this area. They will be able to help you find internships, take the lead on research projects, and also write letters of recommendation for medical school.

, You will want to show your prospective medical school that you are serious about working as a forensic pathologist. Consider finding an internship at a morgue or requesting to shadow a doctor who works as a medical examiner., In your sophomore year of college, you should discuss when you should plan to take the MCAT with your advisor. Generally you should take the exam in the calendar year before you plan to go to graduate school (so if you want to begin medical school in 2017, you would take it in 2016). The MCAT is divided into four sections:Biological and Biochemical Foundations of Living Systems (59 questions)
Chemical and Physical Foundations of Biological Systems (59 questions)
Psychological, Social, and Biological Foundations of Behavior (59 questions)
Critical Analysis and Reasoning Skills (53 questions)
The MCAT is not something you can cram for overnight. It will require you to synthesize much of the material you have studied in your coursework. The Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) offers a practice on-line test, which you should use to study.
Test prep businesses such as Kaplan also offer practice courses, but they can range between $1800-$2200.
Many pre-med programs will also offer study courses and guides to the MCAT. You should also form a study group with your classmates and friends to help prepare for the test.
Most test-takers who gained admission to medical school had an average score of 31.4 and a total GPA of 3.69. If your score was significantly below this, you might want to discuss with your advisor your plans for re-taking the test. Most re-takers only score between 1-3 points of their original score., If you are accepted into medical school, you should try to find a program that offers a forensic pathology focus. This will fall under the general umbrella of Anatomical and Clinical Pathology.


First Year in Medical School. There is a good chance this will be your most difficult year in medical school. You will be required to take a course in gross anatomy in which you will learn anatomy on cadavers. As a forensic pathologist, you will frequently work with corpses, so if this is something you detest in medical school, you should switch specializations. You will also take courses on histology, pathology, and biochemistry.Second Year in Medical School. Your second year will be a mix of course work and clinical experience. Here, you will learn about many diseases you will encounter in a hospital or while working in private practice. This might include things such as heart attacks, blood clots, congestive heart failure, etc.Third Year in Medical School. This year consists of clinical rotations in which you will practice in a variety of different medical specialties, such as internal medicine and obstetrics-gynecology. You should make sure that your program will help you arrange a clinical rotation in forensic pathology.Fourth Year in Medical School. In this year, you can spend an extended rotation in the field in which you want to specialize. This would be the year you could spend in a morgue or a county medical examiner's office. Here, you will truly get a sense of the daily life of a forensic pathologist and whether it is something you want to pursue long-term., Generally, the first position a doctor will get after graduating from medical school will be an internship. Most internships for new medical examiners will be located in morgues, the county examiner's office, or another publicly funded office. Some private hospitals also have forensic pathologists on staff.


Use your connections from your fourth-year rotations in medical school to find a position in this kind of setting. You will need to be supervised by a trained forensic pathologist.
Because there is such a shortage of forensic examiners, you might be faced with working very long hours and conducting hundreds of autopsies over the course of this year.

, Taking a residency is generally the next step for doctors after they have finished their internship.


In your residency, you might take on slightly more complicated or advanced work than as an intern. For instance, you might be responsible for analyzing toxicology reports or for preparing paperwork that is needed over the course of a death investigation.

, You will also generally need to complete a one-year fellowship at an approved medicolegal investigation facility in order to gain specialization in the field. Check with your local chapter of the American Board of Pathology to make sure the facility at which you are completing your fellowship is approved.

, After your fellowship, residency and internship, you can become board-certified as a forensic pathologist.You will need to have completed at least 50 autopsies in order to gain certification.
Certification will also involve taking an exam distributed by the American Board of Pathologies. It will test a combination of medical, anatomical and legal questions.Contact your local chapter of the ABP to find exam dates and further information on the test.
You will need to renew your certification once every ten years. Certification requirements also vary by region, so if you move, you may have to get re-certified.

, In many countries, the coroner is an elected position. In this role, you might be able to propose legislation on death investigation protocol or other laws related to your field.You will also generally have to sign off on death certificates as a coroner.

, Forensic pathology is a constantly shifting field with advances in biotechnology. Some medical examiner offices are currently testing ""virtual autopsy"" technology in addition to more traditional gross autopsies. You should consider if you have an interest in technology that would advance your work., Because the United States currently only has half of the number of forensic pathologists that it needs, joining a professional organization is especially important. It will be helpful to exchange professional knowledge and learn the latest developments in your field.


You should also be open to fostering new doctors and connecting with medical colleges so young med students know forensic pathology is a viable career path.

Take all the science and English classes you can while in high school.,
Read as many science-related publications as you can.,
Go to college.,
Apply for an internship.,
Join a professional association.,
Consider a graduate degree.",How to Become a Science Writer," High school science classes include classes in biology, chemistry, and physics. Here, you can develop a basic understanding of science topics and also identify which of the sciences interests you most. English classes will help you develop and sharpen your writing skills, particularly if a journalism class is available coupled with the opportunity to work on your high school newspaper.;
, Magazines such as Discover, National Geographic, Popular Science, Science, Science News, and Scientific American, as well as newspaper science articles can give you an idea of the breadth of science writing content and styles. Some science fiction magazines, such as Analog, Asimov's, and Omni, have also included science articles along with their science fiction stories.

, You'll need to continue taking both science classes and journalism classes in college. You can major in the science you plan to write about and minor in journalism, major in journalism and minor in the science, or go for a double major. Either way, you'll have plenty of writing opportunities, both in upper-level science classes and in journalism classes, as well as opportunities to become familiar with computers and multimedia.


If you find yourself more interested in being a scientist than in being a science writer at first, you can go the usual route of getting your bachelor's degree, followed by your master's and PhD. You'll do a fair amount of writing in upper level science classes, and you should take a number of English classes as well to enable you to write for various audiences.

, An internship will give you practice as a science writer so you can see if the career is for you, as well as provide you with samples of your work to present to a prospective employer after you graduate. You can intern with your college news office or as a stringer with the local newspaper in the city you're going to college in.


Another option is to write for an Internet news service such as Examiner.com. Check to see if the service you're interested in has a need for science writers and the level of experience required.

, Joining a science writing association provides you the opportunity to network with other science writers about science writing jobs and internships and be listed in the association's membership roster. Science writing associations include National Association of Science Writers (NASW) in the United States and the Indian Science Writers Association in India. Many associations offer memberships for both established science writers and students.

, Even if you decide not to become a scientist before turning to science writing, you may still want to consider a graduate degree in science writing or science and technology communication. If you pursue an advanced science degree instead, you can also apply for internships in science writing as a graduate student. Not every science writer position requires a graduate degree, however, although an advanced science degree is helpful if you want to write for other scientists and make you a better science writer by making you a better researcher.

Build rapport with the believer if you don't already know her or him.,
After you've determined what the believer believes, ask how certain they are that belief is true.,
Ask why they have decided their belief is true.,
Based on their reason for belief, ask a question that asks the believer to think whether or not this is the true reason for their belief.,
Give the person ample time to pause and reflect.,
Don't expect the person to change their mind on the spot.",How to Become a Street Epistemologist," It's important for the believer to feel comfortable rather than confronted.

Small talk enhances your ability to seem non-threatening, but it's also important the believer not feel held captive.
Some street epistemologists, such as Anthony Magnabosco begin with the prompt ""Would you like to have a 5 minute conversation?"" and set a timer, so that the believer will not feel trapped in conversation.;
, Some examples of beliefs are god, spirits, or supernatural phenomena, but any belief can, may, and should, be questioned.

Asking the believer for a confidence scale is a technique from Motivational Interviewing that can be helpful in SE.For example, if your believer believes in the Christian God with 97% confidence that belief is true, you may remark ""Wow, that's high. So, why didn't you say 100%?"" When prompted, they may begin to give their own reasons to doubt that belief. On the contrary, if they were to answer that they believe with 30% confidence, you may remark ""Hmm. That's low. What places you down there?""
If your believer has 0% confidence, you may not need to perform SE.
If your believer has 100% confidence, which is very likely, then still remain casual and friendly, remarking on the number, but put more emphasis on the following steps.

, Express genuine interest and curiosity in the reasons they give and maintain a friendly demeanor. It's important to slow down and give them time to think about their responses.,  

Using ""If-then"" logic can create useful questions about reasons for belief. For example, if the believer believes in the Christian God because they were raised to, you may ask ""If you were raised by a Hindu family, then would you believe in Hindu Gods?"" Generally, the question should try to take the reason they gave for believing out of the picture to see if they still believe.
Comparing a person's belief to that of a person who believes an alternative thing is especially useful for the topic of religion and other competing ideas. In our above example, you may proceed with ""If a Hindu is convinced that he has the truth, and he believes because of his upbringing, and you and he can't both be correct, then is believing what you were taught as a child a reliable way to arrive at the truth?"" This is the most difficult part of this technique. It takes study and practice on your part to know which questions will be most effective.
If your believers says she or he would still believe without that reason, then repeat that they said they wouldn't believe if that reason were true, so try to find a different reason, repeating the step. Example: ""If you said you'd still support Donald Trump for president, even if he were shown to have lied, then is it fair to say that maybe you support him for a different reason?""
If your believer can not name one reason, then it might be useful to ask for a pie chart of reasons, where they assign percentages to each reason.

, If you've asked the right questions, then the person may need some time to think about it.  Let them have this time.  Don't say anything while they stop to ponder what you just asked, even if they don't say anything for several minutes.  These moments are where the true progress is made.,  Your goal should be to plant a seed of doubt.  It may take years to grow.  End the conversation once you feel you've given the believer something to think about.

As much as people may dislike changing their minds, they dislike changing them in front of people even more. People come into beliefs much faster than they abandon them. Think of SE as planting a seed of doubt, which can grow over time.

Plan ahead and make sure you use the restroom at home before your trip.",How to Use the Bathroom on Public Transport," How long is your ride? How much did you drink? How badly do you need to go? If the result is that you have to go, then follow the steps bellow. If not, hold yourself and wait.;
, If you are on a bus that stops at gas stations, it is probably wise to go there if you are uncomfortable with the restrooms on board. You also want to be careful that you don't disturb other passengers, especially if it is during the night and they are trying to sleep.

, It is important that you don't disturb other passengers, so if you are planning to brush your teeth, wash your face or do other things in the bathroom, bring all your materials with you. It is always a good idea to bring hand sanitizer on public transport so you don't have to use the restroom.

, It can be rather embarrassing to have the door opened on you as the bus or ship is moving along and you are mid-business with a line waiting out there. Push or pull on the door to check it's properly locked.


You can touch the door by holding toilet paper if you're worried about germs.

, If you're moving, there is risk of falling or being tossed if the vehicle hits something, goes over something bumpy, hits turbulence, crashes on a wave, or whatever. It's a good idea to find any form of handle or device meant for hanging onto in the event of such a happening. For the most reassurance, hang onto it anyway.

, Some people aren't bothered by germs, but it is always a good idea to wipe off the seat on the toilet, or avoid touching too many things in the restroom. Take a piece of paper towel or toilet paper, put a bit of water on it (maybe soap) and wipe off anything you will be touching.

, Use the bathroom as intended and be quick about it. There is no point hanging around too long, it subjects you to an uncomfortable situation for a longer time and it can prolong the wait for other people outside.


It is probably a good idea to avoid touching too many things. In fact, if you can squat rather than sit on the seat, that's the best option.

, Wash your hands completely with soap. If there is none, at least wash them very well, rubbing your hands vigorously.


If you made a mess somewhere, be polite and clean it, imagine if you had to clean up after someone else before you used the bathroom. Pass on cleanliness, not germs.

, If you didn't mind it, well then it's your choice.

Create an emergency plan.",How to Travel Without Stress1," Things go wrong during travel all the time. Allow yourself extra time to plan all the details of your trip. Whether it’s budgeting your expenses or going to the airport, allow yourself more than enough time to get things done. You’ll avoid a lot of stress if you know that you have made the necessary reservations and feel confident that you will always arrive on time., It’s always good to know a bit about the place you are traveling to. Do some research and get a sense of what there is to do, transportation options, weather patterns, cultural customs, and anything else you might need to know for the purpose of your trip.


Consider finding an emergency contact in your destination. If possible, get contact information for people who live locally. They might be able to help you plan your trip and find your way around town.

, Check your bank account and decide how much money you are willing to spend on your trip. You may have to adjust your budget once you find out the true cost of everything, so it doesn’t hurt to give yourself a bit of extra money to spend. Once you have an estimate of what you’re working with, find out how much your transportation, accommodations, and food will cost. Explore many options so that you get the best prices!


Use travel websites to help you compare prices. For flights, car rentals, and hotels, try a website like Kayak.com.Compare options, and find what best fits your budget.

, Hotels are not the only option. If you’re willing to share a room, or just want something cheap, look for hostels in the area on websites like hostelworld.com. Airbnb.com is another option for those who prefer to stay in a (stranger’s) home away from home. Like hotels, Airbnb prices and quality vary.Also consider joining websites like couchsurfing.com. You may be able to stay somewhere for free, often in exchange for letting someone stay with you.Reserve in advance. Make a reservation with your hotel or host a few weeks in advance. Rooms go quickly during peak travel times. Although it can be easy to find hostels on the day of your stay in certain areas, you’ll avoid the anxiety of not knowing where you’ll be sleeping if you make your reservation before arriving.

, Credit cards can significantly reduce any stress you have about losing cash or getting your debit card stolen. Unlike with debit cards, a credit card left in the wrong hands won't expose your actual bank account. Credit cards can also help you track how much money you are spending.


Consider a travel credit card. There are many credit cards that are meant for travelers. Many cards offer bonus travel miles that can be used at a later date, and some cards waive any foreign transaction fees. If you plan to travel internationally, a travel card may be your best option., Make a plan for daily activities while on your trip. Create a schedule that includes a date and time for each activity. Remember to leave space for meals and travel time. Allow flexibility in your itinerary, as plans may change along the way.

, You may not want to plan every single activity before you arrive, but you’ll probably save time and money if you reserve special events in advance. Concert tickets, shows, or entrances to popular venues should be reserved before arrival. That way you won’t have to worry about stretching your budget or spending extra time searching for tickets., Avoid anxiety about not having what you need (or having too much) by packing appropriately. It’s usually easier to travel with fewer items so that moving your suitcase isn’t such a hassle. Check the weather before your go. Talk to the people you will be spending time with to see what clothes you’ll need. If you don’t know exactly what you’ll be doing, pack for both informal and formal occasions.Don't forget your passport. If you are traveling internationally, remember to bring your passport, visas, and any other important travel documents.

, Travel often becomes stressful when you don’t know where you are or where you’re going. Make sure you have access to a map or GPS, especially if you are in charge of navigating.


Use your smartphone. Download an application that helps you get around. If you are in another country, consider purchasing mobile internet access. This will give you access to the apps while you’re on the go.

, Part of the stress of travel is that you may not be familiar with the best choices to make in an emergency. Think about what supplies or information you might need if things go wrong — Do you know how to contact emergency services? If you are abroad, do you know how to contact your country's embassy? Do you know how to ask for help in the local language? Allow extra money in your budget in case you need to see a doctor or make an unforeseen purchase.


Check government warnings. Your government website has travel warnings for local and international locations. Check to see what kinds of political and environmental issues may affect you at the time of your travel.

Talk to your unit before doing anything (there will often be a person who specializes in transient dialysis).,
Choose your destination.,
Choose your accommodation.,
Write to the chosen hospital (where you will be getting your dialysis overseas), and ask for the following information:


Do they accept visitors?,
Some insurance companies will have you pay the foreign dialysis facility yourself, and then the insurance company will reimburse you.

",How to Travel While on Dialysis," You will need a letter from them confirming you are fit to travel in order to obtain holiday insurance, and their advice regarding immunisation. If you are on dialysis you will need help in planning your treatment while on holiday. You should start planning at least six to eight weeks in advance, more if you're going to a popular destination.;
, Whatever your treatment, it makes sense to ensure you are within reasonable reach of medical support in case of emergencies.

, Check that the accommodation you are considering is suitable for you and any special requirements that you may have. For example, if it is a hotel, do they cater for special diets?

,
Specify the date you would like to go.
(If in the European Union) Are they a state run hospital or a private clinic?
Will there be a charge? If so, how much per dialysis session?
Do they accept form E111 for dialysis?
Do they accept patients who have tested positive for Hepatitis, HIV or Aids? (It is not recommended that you dialyze in a unit which accepts these patients. All dialysis units in the United States accept such patients because it is illegal not to.)
If you are satisfied with the answers and wish to proceed, then ask your renal consultant to make the necessary arrangements. The receiving hospital will require medical details and there is a standard form E111D which should be completed by your hospital doctor. Some units have their own form instead of E111D.

Save a lot of money.,
Purchase insurance.,
Bring the bare necessities.,
Travel first class.,
Stay in a luxury hotel.,
Enjoy yourself.",How to Travel Without Stress2," No matter how you travel, you will need some money to survive along they way. The more money you have, the easier things can be, especially when you don’t know your way around town. Do some research and find out how much it will cost you to afford the luxury of comfort, safety, and fun.Check prices for everything. Since you’ll be away from home, you want to get a sense of how much money you’ll need to pay for all your desires. Use travel websites like tripadvisor.com or lonelyplanet.com for prices and reviews.Look into the cost of first class flight tickets, nice hotels, good restaurants, travel insurance, leisure activities, and souvenirs.

, Traveler’s insurance is generally not needed if you have other forms of insurance like life-insurance or insurance on your high-valued possessions (like your laptop, jewelry, or a nice camera). If you are planning to travel with highly valuable goods or you are worried about getting sick, consider purchasing insurance.


Go directly to the insurance company. Avoid buying insurance from a travel booking agency. They sometimes work off commission and do not always have your best interest at heart. Instead, contact an insurance company through a website like, insuremytrip.com. Ask them to explain exactly what is covered, the dates of your coverage, and any exceptions to the policy rules., Make sure you pack the necessary travel documents like an ID or passport. Don’t stress about packing too much or too little. You will probably be able to purchase things like clothes, electronics, and toiletries when you arrive.

, Whether you travel by boat, bus, or plane, traveling first class provides extra comfort and accommodation. Sitting in a small space, particularly on a long trip, can cause unwanted physical and mental discomfort. Avoid stress by paying the extra money for a first class ticket. You will be much more comfortable if you have space to relax.


Consider flying business class. First class tickets can be quite expensive. On large airlines, business class is another option that provides comfort and high quality service.

, Luxury hotels are not only pleasant, they often have extra services that make being away from home less stressful. Services include spas, entertainment centers, and more.

, No matter the reason for your travel, make time to do something that is fun for you. Go out to nice dinner, see a show, or hit the beach. Take as much time as you can to do things that are relaxing.

"
"
Let others plan the trip.,
Be flexible.,
Be open to new things.,
Expect bumps in the road and relax.",How to Travel Without Stress3," One way to avoid stress is to be uninvolved in planning and preparation. This works when you are traveling with a companion or a group of people. Let them make decisions about what to do, where to stay, and what to bring. Trust that everything will work out.


If you are on a business trip, for example, most logistics may have been planned for you. Avoid making any changes to the itinerary and simply focus on what you need to complete your job.

, The difference between a 12-hour bus ride and a two-hour plane ride can be a lot in terms of comfort and price. Look at the options and just pick whatever works in the moment. See the positive in whatever choice is made and enjoy the new experience.Be safe. Many accommodation or transportation options may present themselves, but this doesn’t mean that they are all good options. Even if your plan is to go with the flow, make your safety a priority when you move forward on decisions.
For example, you may see that a flight is twice the price of an overnight bus and you’ve already spent money on a nice dinner; however, you’re worried that the bus is in poor condition and the roads are icy. In that case, it might be best to go with your gut and take the flight.

, No matter how far you travel, you will likely encounter new foods, people, cultures, and climates. Step out of your comfort zone and be accepting of the new experiences that come your way.


Try getting food from the grocery store instead of always eating out.
Ask locals where they dine, buy clothes, and go for entertainment.
Try taking the bus or other forms of transportation.

, Some trips go quite smoothly, while others are filled with cancelled flights and illness. Expect to have one or two challenges along the way. Make every effort to keep a level head and make smart decisions.Have access to emergency contacts. If you encounter an emergency, find a way to contact authorities or family members.

This can help ensure that places you visit don’t present any serious health hazards and may minimize your risk of contracting an illness before you leave.The more information you gather and advance preparations you make, the the more you can minimize the risk for health problems.;
, One of the most integral parts of preparation is informing yourself about the conditions in the country or place to which you plan to travel. Reading about specific conditions can alert you to any health risks and other factors for which you need to prepare or avoid.You’ll want to look for general information about things such as water and food supply and general hygiene conditions.In addition, you’ll want to look for information about outbreaks of viruses and diseases such as Ebola, H1N1, or avian flu.You can find copious information about travel in specific countries, including general conditions and travel advisories, from sources including the World Health Organization, Centers for Disease Control, and United States Department of State.
If you book through a travel agent, she can also provide you vital information that you need before you travel. This includes vaccinations you need and food or water sources you should avoid.
Travel blogs also offer useful information that can help protect your health.

, It’s a good rule of thumb to arrange your travel as far in advance as possible. This help ensure that you have sufficient time to get supplies you may need ready and get any necessary vaccinations.You may want to hire a travel agent who specializes in travel to the tropics, as she can book places that she knows pose little health risk to you. Make sure to let her know about any medical conditions you have that could pose further risks to your health.
Book with major companies or chains if you can. These are more likely to follow health, hygiene and safety standard to which you are accustomed, in turn minimizing your risk for health problems while in the tropics.

, There are a host of diseases prevalent in the tropics, including malaria, dengue, hepatitis, typhoid, yellow fever, and rabies.Getting proper vaccinations can help prevent serious illness and may minimize your risk of exposure.It’s advisable to get vaccinations for Hepatitis A and B no matter where you are or are going.Consult sources including the WHO, CDC, and State Department to see which vaccinations are recommended for the country to which you are planning to travel., Make yourself a small kit of items you may need in the event of a health issue. Putting together anti-diarrheal medication, bandages, or water sterilization tablets can help minimize your risk of contracting an illness. Your kit should include:Prescription medications, including an extra supply in case you lose or run out and can’t get to a pharmacy or doctor.
A pain reliever and fever reducer such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen.
Allergy medication
An assortment of band-aids.
Moleskin or blister care.
Gauze.
Electrolyte solution or powder.
Antibiotic ointment.
Sunscreen.
Anti-malarials
A broad spectrum anti-biotic.Water purification tablets.
Anti-diarrhea medication.
A sewing kit to repair holes in clothing, which can deter insects from biting you., If you prepare carefully for your trip, you may not run into a problem, but it’s advisable carry information such as medications and phone numbers of in case an emergency arises. This can help people contact a doctor or administer proper treatment in a timely manner.


Keep a list of medications you take and any allergies you have.
Include the phone numbers for your doctor and emergency contacts like family members or the closest embassy or consulate.
You may also want to have contact information for a local doctor or hospital at each location.

, Hand hygiene is one excellent way to help prevent illness. Being scrupulous about your hygiene and washing hands before meals and after using the bathroom may help minimize your risk for contamination and illness.Use warm or hot water and mild soap if it is available.
You can use hand sanitizer if you can’t find water or soap.

, Many infectious diseases found in tropical regions are transmitted through contaminated food and water. By following some guidelines, you can minimize your risk of contracting most illnesses.These include:


Use bottled water for drinking and to brush your teeth if the sanitation is poor. If you are unsure, be safe and use bottled water. If bottled water isn’t available, you can use a water purification tablet.
Avoid getting ice in your drinks, which can also contain contaminants. Your safest bets for drinks are bottled and carbonated drinks with intact seals and drinks made of boiled water. You may also want to use straws that you have brought from home to drink beverages.
Avoid salads, and other uncooked fruits or vegetables unless you have washed and peeled them yourself.
Avoid food stored at room temperature or that has been exposed to flies.
Avoid unpasteurized dairy products and raw or undercooked seafood.
Eat only hard-cooked eggs and nothing with runny yolks or that is raw.
Do not eat “bush meat” or local wild animals such as bats or monkeys.
Eat food that is freshly prepared only if it is thoroughly cooked and served piping hot., Insect bites are another source of illness and disease in tropical countries. Deterring them from you may minimize your risk for contracting diseases or even just being uncomfortable from inflamed bites.You can avoid insect bites by:


Staying away from areas that are infested with insects that bite.
Staying indoors during the hours of dusk and dawn, which is when many insects bite.
Using products containing DEET, which studies have shown is the most effective insect repellant.
Wearing loose-fitting long pants and shirts. Many insects, especially mosquitoes, can bite through tight-fitting clothes.
Using a mosquito net may help keep mosquitos at bay in the evening., Unsafe sexual practices can expose any travelers to sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and HIV, as well as unwanted pregnancy. Using abstinence or safe sex practices can prevent a host of sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancy.Do not have sex with prostitutes while visiting another country. Not only does this put you at a higher risk of contracting an STD, but you may also end up supporting human trafficking or be found guilty of sex with a minor.Abstinence is the best way to ensure that you will not get an STD, so you may want to avoid sex altogether while you are in the tropics.
Always use a latex condom if you do decide to have sex with another consenting adult. If you are allergic to latex, then use a non-latex version but avoid natural membrane condoms, such as sheep's skin, because these will not protect against STDs.
If you are a woman, then you may also want to take birth control pills to prevent unwanted pregnancy. However, keep in mind that birth control pills will not protect you against STDs, so it is important to use a male latex condom as well., It’s vital to your health to stay hydrated by drinking enough. Women need at least nine cups of water a day and men should have at least 13 cups. However, because you often sweat more in tropical heat and humidity, you may need up to 16 cups a day.Make sure to follow the above guidelines on what to drink to prevent illness.
If you get dehydrated, get indoors and cool your skin as possible. You’ll also need to make sure you get enough water or other liquids.It’s also important to your health to stay hydrated. Women should drink at least 9 cups of water a day. Men should have at least 13 cups. You may need up to 16 cups of water a day if you are very active or pregnant., The sun in the tropics is generally stronger than in other regions of the world. Apply sunscreen regularly to help protect yourself from painful sunburn or sun poisoning.


Get a broad spectrum sunscreen that protects you from UVA and UVB.
Reapply sunscreen all over your body every two hours or more often if you sweat or go in the water."

Inform your child's transplant coordinator about the trip.,
Bring a copy of your child's medical records with you.,
Keep any necessary medications on you at all times.,
Visit the dialysis center before any scheduled treatments.",How to Travel with a Child on Hemodialysis," Check very early on in the trip-planning process about whether any special vaccinations are required for your travel destination and whether your child can receive these. Don’t wait too long to do this or you may have to postpone your trip.;
, Find out if your pediatric nephrologist is familiar with any centers or pediatric nephrologists at your destination. Getting a recommendation from a doctor that you know and trust will make your feel more at ease.


Within the US, you can search online for pediatric hemodialysis centers. You can even search using specific criteria (such as pediatrics, in center hemodialysis, transient patients). Just go to the Nephron Information Center website and enter the zip code for your destination.Identifying suitable hemodialysis centers abroad can be a little more challenging. Most pediatric nephrologists subscribe to a worldwide network of colleagues. You can ask your doctor to post a query on the network in order to identify a recommended center and physician in your foreign destination.

, Contact the dialysis center directly to ensure that they will be able to accommodate your child during your trip.


If there are specific dialysis scheduling needs during your trip, find out well ahead of time whether the dialysis center has appointments available. This is particularly important if you are visiting popular vacation areas during peak season.Also ask for the name and telephone number of a dialysis nurse or social worker contact at the center. You can then contact this person directly if your schedule changes or if an emergency arises during the trip.

, It is usually a good idea to touch base with your contact at the dialysis center at least a week before departing on your trip. Be sure that all of the requested and necessary information has been received. This usually includes a written medical summary and the most recent dialysis treatment run records. Also be sure to clarify any necessary details. For example you should:


Confirm the dialysis treatment schedule and usual duration of dialysis at this particular center.
Find out where you need to register once you get there and ask whether there is any additional information that you can provide ahead of time to make the registration process smoother.
Find out where you need to go and when to arrive for the first dialysis treatment.
If relevant, check if the center uses local anesthetic (e.g. lidocaine) for needle access.
Ask if patients are allowed to eat or drink during during dialysis.

, It's important to identify any potential problems with insurance coverage before you embark on you trip.


Be sure that you are covered by your primary and secondary insurer for transient dialysis.
Find out whether any upfront payments will be required at the dialysis center.
Ask if you will need a letter from your commercial insurer (if you have one) stating that they will cover your child's dialysis treatments while traveling. This is particularly important if you are traveling abroad.

, If you are traveling by plane, find out if it is possible to make special meal arrangements when you make your reservations. If not, make sure you bring any necessary meals or snacks with you.


Additionally, if your child requires any special assistance (such as a wheelchair, or extra leg room on board the plane) check that these needs can be accommodated.

, If your child is on the transplant recipient list, be sure your transplant coordinator is aware of your travel plans and that he/she knows whether to change the listing status while you are away.

, While traveling, keep a duplicate copy of the medical records that were sent to the dialysis center with you at all times. This way, if they happened to lose your child's records, you will be able to provide them with a copy

, Make sure that you are stocked up on any medications your child will need while traveling.


Bring along a supply of medications that will last for the entire time away, with some extra in case anything unexpected happens. You should also carry extra prescriptions for these medications in the event that the medications get lost or you need to extend your trip.
Remember that if you are traveling by air, you should keep the medications in your carry-on. Lost baggage can otherwise be a disaster.
Be sure that your child's medical records also list your child’s current medication and doses.

, When you arrive at your destination, you can help reduce any anxiety your child might have about treatment at an unfamiliar place by visiting the dialysis unit on the day before the first scheduled treatment.


At this point, you can also familiarize yourself with where you can park, where you need to register and where your child will be receiving the dialysis. This will help to ensure that everything runs smoothly on the day.
You should also ask about contact procedures at the dialysis center in the event of an emergency. Take note of any important contact names or numbers and keep them with you at all times when away.

Relax.",How to Take Care of Your Health During Business Travel," Today there are many options to avoid travel altogether. You might be able to have a satellite video conference, an online conference, a telephone conference or other technology aided conference choices. Consider whether or not these might work just as well as having people travel.;
, Arriving just before a conference when you travel across datelines should not occur unless you really cannot avoid it. And you should do your best to avoid it. Even if it means using your weekend to get to a place ahead of time, do so. You can use the time to sleep yourself into the new time zone and you can use the remaining time to set up a workspace environment using your laptop and other key technology tools. This means that your health is put first but your work does not suffer either.

, Read wikiHow's Stay Healthy when Traveling by Plane article for many helpful tips. It is important to not let plane travel get you off to an unhealthy start., Things will not always go to plan when you travel. But if you are organized, you can reduce the stress of delayed and cancelled transport, lost luggage and missing files or memory sticks. Use online storage for your important presentations, pack spare clothes in your carry-on luggage, be sure to ask for all reservations to be double-checked when one of them is shifted or cancelled. These simple considerations can go a long way to making the trip less stressful.

, When travelling for business, avoid overindulging and avoid eating anything that could make you sick. Look ahead on the internet to find restaurants, health food stores, supermarkets and other food places that can provide you with food that you like eating usually. That way, you will not be at the mercy of not knowing where to find what you need. Often, however, the reality is that your work schedule is so jam-packed that the eating choices are on the premises of where your work is happening, or in close vicinity. If this is likely to be the case, ring the caterers on the premise in advance and ask them to prepare meals that suit your needs. Another good trick is to take energy bars for long sessions that can drain your energy. These slip into briefcases with ease and can be eaten quickly, without mess and without people noticing too much.

, Do not neglect your daily exercise needs. Get up a little earlier if necessary to fit in a brisk walk, a gym work-out, a swim, or some other easily maintained exercise. Ask the concierge of your accommodation for details if you don't have any idea where to exercise, or what facilities are available to you. Exercise will help fight off any colds or other illnesses that might occur during the stress of travel.

, If you need to take medication, make sure to pack it and keep a schedule for when you need to take it. If you are travelling overseas, ask your doctor for a certificate to verify that you need the item, in order to avoid awkward questioning at airports, borders or ports. If you are due for a refill, be sure to do this before you leave.

, It has become very common to expect 110% from employees and managers who travel, to avoid any allusion to a ""junket"". This does not mean it is healthy to work from 7am to midnight every day without a break. Normal work days and some evening sessions are probably par for the course but also work in at least one night out or an afternoon off to take a stroll, see a film, go to the theater etc.

, Often away from work meet-ups are pressured. You have time limits, there are people you won't see again face-to-face for a long time, there are actions to be decided and deadlines to be fulfilled. This can create a lot of tension and concern for all present. It is important to relax, to realize that only the realistic is achievable and that often the real decisions will flow after everyone has had the opportunity to return home again and think through all the consequences and outcomes of the decisions reached or the work done.

Get vaccinated.,
Bring medications and supplies for pre-existing conditions.,
Pack a first aid kit.,
Look into your health coverage.,
Take care of jet lag before you board the ship.,
Tell the truth if you don’t feel well.,
Wash your hands obsessively.,
Limit contact with common surfaces.,
Practice food safety.,
Report sick passengers.,
Be ready for seasickness.,
Eat in moderation and drink lots of (safe) water.,
Protect your skin.",How to Stay Healthy on a Cruise Vacation," Before departure, make sure you have received all proper medical vaccinations to stay healthy onboard the ship and at ports-of-call. There are many infectious diseases and illnesses that can spread while onboard the ship or in foreign ports.Make sure you are up-to-date on all required or recommended vaccines in your home country. In addition, contact the cruise line and health organizations such as the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for vaccination recommendations for the specific countries you will visit on your cruise.
You might also want to consult the U.S. State Department’s travel advisory webpage. Its alerts regarding illnesses and health concerns in particular nations (along with concerns like terrorism) can help you plan your vaccination and healthcare strategies — or perhaps cause you to alter your cruise plans altogether.;
, Many of the same things that make a cruise vacation so appealing — the exotic locales, the new foods, the late nights, the unpredictability — can also exacerbate conditions like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or various chronic illnesses. Make sure you are well-prepared with the medications, supplies, and information you need to manage any pre-existing condition(s) during the cruise.For instance, if you have a history of heart disease, make sure you bring all your medications and also consider bringing along a copy of your most recent EKG. This can be used for comparison if you suffer symptoms and an EKG is done on the ship., Large cruise ships have health clinics available to passengers, but the hours may be limited, the lines long, and the cost exorbitant. You can save time, money, and aggravation by caring for minor scrapes and sickness in your cabin with a basic first-aid kit, which you can either purchase or assemble yourself before embarking.Include standard first aid items like bandages, gauze, sterilizing pads, etc., as well as medications for motion sickness, diarrhea, general pain, and so on. However, even if you are treating symptoms on your own, report signs of a gastrointestinal illness (or other communicable sickness) to the ship’s crew.

, A pricey cruise can quickly become extraordinarily expensive if you need a medical helicopter evacuation due to a serious injury or illness. Without insurance, the bills can easily be in the tens of thousands of dollars. Contact your health insurer and get clear answers on the type and amount of coverage you have (or don’t) when traveling abroad on a cruise.You may be able to purchase additional coverage from your health insurer, or you can look into buying separate travel insurance. Make sure that at very least you are covered for major expenses like medical evacuations.

, Most people have to fly to the departure port, and many end up dealing with jet lag for the first day or two of the cruise. If you have to fly in for your cruise, try to shake off your jet lag beforehand so you don’t have to waste valuable cruise time feeling groggy, sleepy, and cranky.If possible, fly into the port city one or two days early. Rest, relax, and get over your jet lag before embarking on the ship, so you can maximize your time and enjoyment on board.

, No one wants to have to reschedule or cancel a much-anticipated cruise due to an untimely bout of flu-like symptoms, but you owe it to yourself and everyone else to be honest if you aren’t feeling well. Display the same honesty if you fall ill after getting on the ship, so the crew can take proper measures to prevent any possible outbreaks.Being sick doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll have to miss the cruise. Visibly ill passengers may not be allowed to board, or they may be quarantined in their cabins for the first day or two of the cruise.

, This is the number one way to keep healthy during a cruise. Wash thoroughly and frequently for the best results. It's best to scrub your hands before and after eating, using the bathroom, touching your face, interacting with other passengers, touching common surfaces, coming onboard from a shore excursion, and every so often regardless of what you’re doing.Using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer is an acceptable alternative to washing your hands when the proper facilities are not available. Choose sanitizers with at least 60% alcohol for the best results, and use them only when a place to wash your hands is not accessible.

, You don’t need to walk around with rubber gloves on your hands, but you also don’t need to touch every handrail you come across. Common cruise ship illnesses like norovirus can last for days on surfaces like doorknobs, slot-machine levers, and elevator buttons, so don’t touch common surfaces unnecessarily and clean your hands quickly after touching them.Wave instead of shaking hands. Use clean silverware instead of common food serving utensils at the buffet. Push buttons or levers with your elbow or knuckle. Never touch your face before you have a chance to clean your hands first. Basically, take typical good hygiene practices to the next level.

, Consuming food that is undercooked, cooked in unsanitary conditions, or served cool or warm instead of cold or hot can cause food poisoning and a host of gastrointestinal illnesses. When eating in the ship’s dining room, and especially when eating on land at one of your stops, be very particular about what you eat.Your cruise line should prioritize food safety, but don’t take chances by eating food that’s been sitting at the buffet for a long time. When dining on shore, especially in less developed nations (and when eating street food anywhere), eat only food that is cooked and served hot (ideally in your presence), choose only sealed drinks with no ice, and only eat fruit that you can clean and peel yourself.

, No one wants to be the cruise ship “snitch,” but with how quickly a stomach virus can spread through an enclosed vessel, it is definitely a “see something, say something” situation. Discretely inform a crew member if you see a fellow passenger who looks ill. You will be doing everyone else on the ship a favor.Quickly identifying, treating, and possibly isolating a sick passenger may mean the difference between a few scattered illnesses and a ship-wide outbreak of norovirus-induced diarrhea, vomiting, etc.

, If you know you tend to get seasick, suspect you may become so, or are just concerned about it, talk to your doctor before leaving on your cruise. Some medications, such as certain antidepressants, painkillers, and birth control pills, can exacerbate seasickness, so discuss all medications you take with your doctor as well.There are several medications that can effectively deal with seasickness, as well as common remedies ranging from ginger chews (which do seem to help) to wristbands (which don’t).
Consider booking a mid-ship cabin on a lower level; you will experience less swaying of the ship there. Stand more often, keep your eyes open, and get fresh air to help combat seasickness as well., Cruise ships are famous for having grandiose buffets and meal service (that you’ve already paid for), so take little steps to help prevent overindulgence. At buffets for instance, use smaller side or salad plates for your main courses, take small amounts of multiple foods at a time and eat only what you really like, and eat a later dinner to help limit the temptation of the “midnight buffet.”Dehydration can be a problem on many cruises, what with the frequent combination of hot weather, elevated alcohol consumption, and concerns about water quality. Drink water frequently throughout the day, either from sources on the ship (so long as you trust them) or from bottles., Especially since many cruises travel to tropical locales, you should take precautions against illnesses transmitted by mosquitoes or other insects. Consult the CDC or similar health organization for current warnings and recommendations. Bring and use insect repellent, and cover bare skin when possible. Report rashes or unusual markings caused by insect bites, or symptoms of illness to the medical staff onboard.Covering exposed skin can also help reduce your likelihood of sunburn. Choose a wide-brimmed hat and regularly apply a full-spectrum sunscreen with UVA and UVB protection.

",How to Urban Camp," Will you be traveling through many towns and cities or just one? Do you have friends there? Is there a large or small population? What is the crime rate? Be sure you have a good idea of the environment your venturing into and plan accordingly.;
, Pack extra food in case something goes wrong or you are delayed. Of course, you don't really have to pack any food at all; you are in the city. Pack just like as if you were camping in the woods as almost all the same things will apply, save for money and a bus pass. And since it's usually not a good idea to start a fire in the city park or on the sidewalk, be sure you bring along a compact camping stove if you plan on doing any cooking.

, Move out of your house and on to the streets! Pack your bag or your car and head to the city! Do you have an idea of how long your camping adventure will last? It's good to plan ahead. Although this may sound like common sense, it's surprising how many people can forget small things like their toothbrush or band-aids.

,, This can mean anything from a city park to a sidewalk, a patch of undeveloped land, creek areas that run through town, parking lots, or anywhere else in the urban environment. Of course, the two most important factors when choosing a spot will be noticeability and safety. Try not to get woken by the police, sprinkler systems, tweekers, drunken bums or muggers. If possible, have people stand watch at night to guard your stuff. Or you can try to hide your stuff, but it's best of all if you are hidden yourself.

Trace your route to the fire exit and memorize it. It's always better to do it first thing when you check into your room, not when you need to evacuate in a fire.





;
, The less public access to your room, the better.

, Make sure you're alone by checking curtains, behind doors, closets, the bathroom, etc.

, If it doesn't, use your own padlock or at the very least, prop a sturdy chair against the door.

, Keep the curtains drawn at as well. If the breeze helps you sleep, consider bringing a small fan to put on the nightstand, or use the air conditioner.

, Never open it unless you personally know the person who is knocking. If someone claims to be sent from housekeeping, call the front desk to validate if a staff member was actually sent to your room.

, It will help make sure you find your way back, especially at night.

, Avoid leaving it locked in your car in the hotel parking lot.

Be ready for sharing your bedroom space.,
Don't be messy!,
Be polite.",How to Stay in Youth Hostels in Europe," There are some basic guiding rules that impact your choice of a youth hostel. First the location – the nearer it is to the top places that you want to visit, the better. If you want to book online, spend a little time reading a few of the comments about the hotel you're looking at. On many websites you can find user reviews on hotels before booking online.;
, Understand that you're not going to a 5 star resort, so the bathroom will probably be shared. Some hostels have separate bathrooms but many do not. Maintain your personal hygiene and avoid sharing toothbrushes, toothpaste, water glasses and towels. Also, if you want to take a shower, always wear flip flops, as you don't want to turn your feet into a fungus farm, or share your fungus with others.

, Perhaps you'll be sharing the bedroom with many people, some of them probably unknown to you, so you'll surely want to keep your personal objects out of other people's hands. If you have some valuable objects, ask at the hotel if there is a safe box where you can leave them. If not, try bringing a little box with a lock and hide it somewhere. If you have to carry a lot of money with you, use an old trick: put the money in a 3/4 panty (yes, the one your girlfriend uses) and put it inside your jeans or pants, then tie it up to the front button and there you go!

, It's not your room, so be tidy. You and your fellow travelers will benefit from this and you will avoid losing something on the way. The same goes for the kitchen and living spaces; clean up after yourself, just as you'd expect others to do.

, You're living with many other people from many parts of the world, so take care of your manners to make living together as pleasant as possible. If you're respectful, you'll see that you'll gain new friends and have a wonderful time!

Label your food.,
Be sure to use the designated storage spaces.,
Cook where it is allowed.,
Cook small.,
Keep it hygienic.,
Share a meal.,
Eat out.",How to Use a Communal Kitchen in a Youth Hostel," Sounds simple but many guests favour the ""trust"" factor. Hungry guests who have been tramping all over the ancient ruins or catching stinky public transport all day are not always into trust when their belly rumbles and may simply assume that unlabelled food is a free-for-all. It also helps you identify which of those cartons of milk is yours.;
, If there are specific rules about which cupboards and which fridge you can store food in, follow these rules. If you don't, you risk having your food removed and dumped.

, Most youth hostels are not that partial to the 'Trangia' being set up in your dorm. Not only is this a potential fire risk but it is also unfair on the other guests to be subjected to your cooking smells.

, Don't cook so much that you have leftovers to contend with unless you have freezer or fridge space and containers to store and you are staying more than one or two nights. If you cannot buy smaller amounts of food, see if other guests are willing to go halves with you in the purchasing costs.

, It is even more important to pay attention to food safety rules when using a communal kitchen. Never assume something has been washed before you use it; wash cutting boards in hot water and wash stirring utensils before using. When you cut raw meats, eggs and poultry, always do so on a washable surface away from others and clean up thoroughly after yourself. Cross-contamination can be very serious in a communal kitchen.

, This is a great way to get to know other guests. Offer them your culinary delights in exchange for some of theirs. Or offer to do mains whilst they do dessert. Be creative and friendly and you might just make friends for life or, at the very least, get a good yarn for the night.

, You're on vacation. Don't spend every night in the kitchen; get out and discover the local cuisine. Ask for cheap restaurant suggestions and deals at the hostel front desk and eat out with a group so that you can share the cost and the dishes.

Pick the right hotel/hostel for your purpose/destination.,
Check out the hostel's web page, if there is one.,
Book a bed in advance (at least one night, even you plan to move around and find a better one), especially if you are going to arrive at night.,
Do not hesitate to call them before you book.,
Listen carefully about regulations when you check in.,
When you enter the room, smile and say 'Hi' to all of the roommates if they are inside, but skip this at night if the room is dark.,
Have a small chitchat if your roommates are in a friendly mood.,
Do not leave things you would regret if you lose: sadly, some people do not feel guilty about stealing others' properties.,
Realize that some people snore or sleep talk.,
If other roommates are extremely noisy on purpose at night, go to the front desk and talk to the staff.",How to Stay in a Dormitory Hotel Without Trouble," For example, if the city you visit has a bad (not safe/expensive) public transportation, paying a few bucks more and staying in the city center means more time in there. Also, hard-to-reach location might mean a long walk after dark in unknown place for you.;
, Look for a method of payment, cancel policy, key system, and curfew. Photos and reviews by guests can be very tricky - people's tastes and what they expect to the place differs greatly. Always add a pinch of salt to them when you read the page.

, If the beds are fully booked and you do not know other place to inquire, it would cost much more.

, Of course you can call from the destination, but think about this: If you just exchanged money into the currency, you might not have small coins for the public phone. Plus, in some countries, you need to buy a phone card to call. What if the plane delayed and the kiosk you can buy a card is closed? Or closed for a national holiday you didn't know?

, These places are cheap for reason: you need to follow the certain rules, and keep it.

, Others might be asleep. Do not turn on the lights when you enter the room if you think there are people in their beds.

, It always helps you to stay in the room comfortably. Say your name and nice-to-meet-yous. If they have stayed longer than you there, they might give you some tips on the city. If they get to know you, they are more likely to help you when you are in trouble. But do not over-share: do not show them where your passport/money/cheque is or detailed information about you.

, Accessing to the hostel room is easier than you think. Leave your valuables in the lockers, and carry most-valuables (passport, money, ID etc) with you, even to the toilet, shower, or a bed, if you do not trust the safety box system of the hostel.

, You cannot stop or change it. So if you are sensitive to others' sound, carry earplugs and an eye-mask.

, They can talk to the others, or relocate you to the new room with less noise. If it fails, just grin and bear.

You may have a pair of travel earplugs that you usually use bring with you on trips. Or you may buy a pair of earplugs to bring with you so you can sleep better in the hotel, despite any noise. Pack your earplugs so you have a way to block out noise at night.You may invest in custom ear plugs that are made to fit your ears so they stay in and are comfortable. Look for custom ear plugs online.;
, You should also bring an eye shade that you can put on at night when going to bed to block out any light in your room. The eye shade should fit comfortably over your head and eyes. Look for an eye shade that is made of a soft material like silk or cotton so it lies nicely over your eyes.You can find eye shades online or in stores. If you are shopping for an eye shade in stores, try on a few first to make sure the eye shade fits comfortably around your head and over your eyes.

, You may find you get a better sleep if you bring your own set of sheets with you when you stay at the hotel. The smell and feel of your sheets can help you feel like you are sleeping at home. Pack a top sheet from home that you can slide onto the bed or bring pillowcases that you can slide onto the pillows on the hotel room bed.If you have enough space in your travel bag, you may bring your own pillow form home with you. Bringing your own pillow can help you feel more comfortable sleeping in the hotel bed.

, If you know you sleep better with certain sleep aids that you can pack, you should bring them with you. This could be packets of calming tea that you can prepare in the hotel room, sleeping pills, or a spray to make the hotel bed smell good.You may also sleep better with a sound machine on in your room. You may pack the sound machine if it is small or use an App on your phone to simulate the sound machine.

, When you call to book your room at the hotel, ask for a room that is in a quiet area. The concierge should be able to recommend several room options that are in the quieter spots in the hotel. If possible, book a room that is midway down a hallway, as this is often the quietest part of the floor, away from the ice and vending machines as well as the exits. You may also request a room that is located at the back of the hotel if it is low rise, as they are often quieter.You should also ask the hotel if there is a room on the concierge or suite level as these rooms often have taller ceilings and allow for more space between you and the room above you.

, Steer clear of a room that is by the hotel pool, as there may be noise at night from people using the pool or hanging out by the pool. You should also avoid a room above the banquet room or hall in the hotel or above the hotel bar, as they are often noisy.You may want to confirm with reception that your room is not near a dumpster or trash bin area, as you may end up being woken up by noises from this area. This is especially likely if your room has a window that faces the dumpster or the trash bin area.

, To ensure you get the best sleep at the hotel, go for a room that comes with black out curtains or shades. Many hotels have rooms with this feature, tailored for people who find it hard to sleep in a bright room.You should also go for a non-smoking room as you do not want to be irritated by lingering cigarette smoke in the room during your stay.

, If possible, try to get a mattress that is as close to the same size as the one you sleep on at home. For example, if you have a queen mattress at home, you may go for a queen sized mattress for your hotel room. Often, you sleep better on a bed that is similar in size to your own.You may also find you prefer a soft mattress or you get a better night’s sleep on a hard mattress. Speak to the hotel about how soft or hard the mattresses are there. They may use a mattress brand that is similar to your own. If they do not, you may try requesting a room that has a mattress that will fit your needs.

, When you book the hotel room, you should ask reception if there are any conferences, weddings, or large gatherings planned during your stay. If there are, you should be prepared for noise issues and pack accordingly. If you feel you will be too disturbed due to the noise, you may reschedule your booking for a time when the hotel is less full and will be less noisy.If you know there are going to be lots of people and lots of activity in the hotel, you may let reception know that you are a light sleeper. You may tell them that you will complain if the noise gets too loud and interrupts your sleep so they are aware of your needs.

, To ensure you sleep soundly in your hotel room, you should avoid eating a heavy meal close to bedtime. You may have a light meal for dinner so your stomach is settled when you go to bed. Or you may have a light snack a few hours before bed so your stomach is not too full when you finally turn in.Try having a cup of herbal tea before you go to bed to settle your stomach and get into sleep mode. Tea like chamomile, peppermint, and lemon can all help to calm your nerves and your digestive system.

, Hotel rooms can be stuffy and musty, making it difficult for you to get to sleep. Air out the room by opening the windows and letting in fresh air. If the windows don’t open in the room, turn on the fan on the air conditioning unit to circulate the air. You can also run the hot water in the shower to get some moisture in the air and make the room less dry.If there is a thermostat in the hotel room, adjust the temperature so it is comfortable for you. Having good air quality and good room temperature can help you get a good night’s sleep.

, To prepare for bed, do a relaxing activity that you enjoy doing at home at bedtime. This could be a warm bath, a cup of hot tea, or reading a good book in bed. You may also try watching television in bed to wind down and get your mind ready for sleep.If you find calming music helps you sleep, you may play it on your phone or on your computer to help you fall asleep.

, Before you turn in, you may let the front desk know you need a wake up call at a certain time. Having a wake up call set can help you sleep better and be less stressed about getting up tomorrow at the right time on your own.You may set your own wake up call on your phone so you are doubly prepared for the following day. Sometimes, the habit of setting your own alarm can also help you get into sleep mode.

, Once you are ready to go to sleep in your hotel room, make sure there is a “Do not Disturb” sign on the front of your room door. This will let others on the floor know you are trying to sleep and require quiet.If there are any noise issues that disrupt your sleep, do not be afraid to report them. Call down to the front desk and ask that they address the issue. A hotel with good customer service will often remedy the noise issue so you can get back to sleep in peace.

Airbnb’s simple “Where,” “When,” and “Who” boxes make this easy and intuitive. Click “Search” once you have the information down., You’ll then see a list of all the available rentals for your chosen locations and dates. You can narrow these down by selecting only those with a certain number of rooms, or within a certain price range.Since you’re traveling with a family, it might be very helpful to look for rentals with multiple rooms available, or entire houses/apartments.
After doing a general search for listings in a location, click on ""Filters"" below the results to narrow things down by these categories.

, Traveling with a family means more people that want to be entertained. Luckily, Airbnb also lets you sort properties based on whether things like televisions, wi-fi, or a kitchen are available. Take advantage of these to find just what each of your family members wants.These options will also be available via the ""Filters"" menu shown below the search results.

, Airbnb rentals that are happy to accommodate children can be labeled as such. However, this can mean lots of different things. If might mean that the host has games, toys, or other things that might keep children happy, or it might just mean that the host is willing to allow children in the home.There is also a filter specifically for the ""Family/Kid-friendly"" label.

, You can book Airbnb through a Facebook account, or use an email address. When you sign in, follow the prompts to create a profile. You can then access your account to use Airbnb’s communications features. If you’re looking for specific needs, like no staircases (to help keep a toddler safe), contact the host directly and ask about this.

Even if a listing does not have a “Family/Kid-Friendly” label, let the host know you are traveling with family. They may have games, movies, or other things that will make your stay great. They might also have tips about good places for families to visit in the area.

, Once you’ve found the listing that will make your whole family happy, enter your card information to book the home. You should then receive an email confirmation that includes the details of your upcoming stay, and information about how to contact the host and Airbnb., Many Airbnb rentals provide guests with access to a kitchen. Try cooking some meals during your vacation instead of eating out all the time. This will cut down on a major vacation expense, and also give your family opportunities to relax and spend more time together.Visit some markets in the area and pick up a few local delicacies to make the cooking experience more special.

, A nice perk of Airbnb is getting to spend time in a home that’s a different type than yours. Make the most of this during your vacation. For instance:If you’re staying in a suburban home with a big backyard, use it as an opportunity to play catch with your family. If
If you’re staying in a high-rise apartment, take some time out to look at the city lights at night while sharing ice cream with everyone.

, Airbnb’s motto is “Don’t go there. Live there.” Many Airbnb listings are located away from popular tourist areas. This gives you the opportunity to soak up more of the local flavor of your area. Go off the beaten path and look for some family fun near your Airbnb home. For instance:Look for family-friendly restaurants nearby that cater to locals more than tourists.
Visit fun attractions that might be overlooked by sightseeing guides. Maybe there’s a great putt putt course or park just around the corner!

, Airbnb gives guests opportunities to review the homes they stay in. You can read these online as you search for listings. They can give you a good sense of what a home and host are like. The reviews tend to be positive, so if you do see something negative about a home, take it seriously. Contact the host if you have any questions., Listings on Airbnb may include guidelines that the host sets for how you are permitted to use their home. You are expected to abide by these, so if there’s something in the rules that won’t work for your family, choose another location.For example, if the house rules ask guests not to touch a priceless pottery collection on display, you might want to choose a different location if you’re traveling with a toddler.

, Airbnb does its best to vet and verify hosts and accommodations. A few bad apples might show up, however. When communicating with a potential host about a listing, think twice if they do things like ask you to pay off site (which is against Airbnb’s policy). If you sense anything that feels like a scam, chose another listing., Listings on Airbnb will include pictures so that potential guests can get a sense of what’s being offered. Since you’re relying on the hosts to be truthful about the listing, you can double-check any important things. For instance, if the listing says it includes two bedrooms, but the pictures only show one, ask the host to send a picture of the other one before you book., Every booking on Airbnb includes a free 24-hour concierge service. If you need any help during your stay, or if you run into issues with the host or the accommodations, call this service right away. The number should be included in the confirmation information you received after booking.Airbnb wants customers to be satisfied and to have a great experience. You can request a refund if the accommodations were not as described.

Look for an atmosphere that will match your interests.,
Book off season.,
Find out what extras are included.,
Read the fine print.",How to Stay at an All Inclusive Resort1," While most all-inclusive resorts are enjoyed by vacationers of all sorts, some cater to a certain type of clientele. For instance, a relaxing, romantic getaway may be more likely at some locations than others. Meanwhile, other resorts may occupy children more happily.Look online or contact customer service questions with questions about a resort’s atmosphere.
You can use amenities or activities lists to get an idea of what demographic a particular resort caters to. For instance, if a resort has half a dozen water slides and daily puppet shows, it’s unlikely to be calm and quiet around the pool.;
, Booking price aside, you’ll likely find your time at an all-inclusive resort to be more enjoyable outside of the most popular seasons. In particular, some of the drawbacks associated with all-inclusive resorts will be much less likely when the resort is not fully booked.For instance, less guests means lower chances of crowded pools, heavily booked activities, etc.
Try for a trip just after spring break. Mid-April through June are usually great options.

, Most all-inclusive resorts will offer recreational or dining options that aren’t actually included. For instance, while there may be a gym you have access to, there may also be a charge to attend the daily yoga session. Of course, many resorts do include many more activities than you’ll be able to enjoy.Plan ahead to ensure you’re going to a resort that includes the types of activities that interest you. For instance, one resort might cost a bit more overall, but offer far more activity options at no additional charge.
Other included activities might be additional exercise classes, non-motorized water sports, and evening entertainment.

, More often than not, something you’ll want will cost you extra. This is where the fine print really kicks in. For instance, your resort may offer free alcoholic drinks, but only with well liquor. If you want premium liquor, or food from the restaurant instead of the buffet, it may come at an additional price."
"
Spend time comparing your options.,
Book a vacation that includes airfare.,
Compare prices on different dates.",How to Stay at an All Inclusive Resort2," Make sure you check prices through multiple different sources. Furthermore, consider multiple different resorts, as well as multiple destinations. Use travel sites like Expedia, Travelocity, and Priceline, which can help you find vacation deals that include airfare.Even if your initial thought is to stay in the Caribbean, it’s worth checking prices for resorts in another location, such as Mexico.
Note that prices may vary widely, even between resorts that are located in the same general destination.

, Even if your deal doesn’t include airfare, bundling flights with the hotel often results in an additional discount to your overall costs. Be sure to check prices for flights on their own too, to determine whether it may actually be cheaper to book separately.Travel agents can also help you find package deals that include not only your stay at the resort, but your flight and travel to and from the airport to the resort.
While package deals aren't necessarily the cheapest option, it's always worth checking to see what's available through several different avenues. At the very least, call resorts directly and ask about any deals they offer.

, Flexibility in terms of scheduling can help you find the best price. For instance, mid-week arrivals and departures will likely be less expensive than weekends options.Likewise, trips outside of peak vacation season will be cheaper as well. Avoid spring break and summer weekend dates.
If you have lots of flexibility regarding your schedule, search for a sale. Many resorts will offer especially good prices during certain times of the year.

Make meal reservations.,
Plan and schedule activities ahead of time.,
Cozy up to the concierge.,
Get food to-go.,
Ask for what you want.",How to Stay at an All Inclusive Resort3," Especially for dinner, it’s important to book your table ahead of time. If your resort has multiple dining options, check them each out early on and book your meals at the one you prefer as early as possible. You may even want to make multiple reservations at the same spot, if you prefer it strongly to the other options., In much the same way that the most desirable dining options will fill up quickly, the most intriguing activities will too. In fact, the better the amenity, the quicker it will get booked. These activities can include nightly entertainment with a capped audience, or daytime outdoor activities.For instance, if the resort offers sunset cruises or other popular activities, see what it takes to get yourself a spot.
The resort may compile a list of interested guests for each activity, each day. If so, get your name on the list first thing in the morning on the day you'd like to participate.

, Many resorts will have concierge staff to help you plan your day or explore the area. In particular, they will be the best folks to talk to about shuttles, tours, attractions, and more.It may even pay off to introduce yourself warmly upon arrival. Say something like, “Hey! We’re really excited to be here. I just wanted to say hello and introduce myself. What’s your name?”

, Not all restaurants at all-inclusive resorts will allow it, but it’s always worth it to ask. Getting your food to go means your crew can stay on the beach while one of you goes to pick up the food, and everyone can eat at their own speed while you continuing enjoying yourselves.Better yet, some resorts may even include room service.

, All-inclusive resorts will do what they can to make you happy, especially in terms of your dining experience. If the buffet keeps running out of the one dish you find appealing, feel free to mention it to staff. You may even wind up with a fresh portion straight from the kitchen.Most resorts will be ready and willing to accommodate dietary preferences. That said, it’s worth reaching out beforehand if you have a serious dietary restriction, such as Celiac disease, or are vegan.

Pack light.,
Research the hostel you're planning to stay at in advance.,
Take careful note of hostel rules.,
Get to the hostel during daylight hours if possible.,
Ask to see the room (or bed) you're paying for before you finish checking in.,
If you're staying in a dorm room, opt for the bottom bunk.,
Bring your own towel, soap and shampoo--they're not always available in a hostel and, if they are, they usually cost.,
Try socializing with others in the hostel's common areas, and don't be put off if they join your conversations unexpectedly.",How to Make the Most of Hosteling," Storage space is often limited, and lugging a large suitcase around gets old fast. Try to confine yourself to one small wheeled suitcase or, even better, a medium-sized backpack.


Limit your valuables as much as possible, and keep them on your person when you can. If you're carrying a computer or other valuable item that you can't keep with you, only stay in hostels that have secure storage available. Although most hostelers are honest, it only takes one dishonest person in the same dorm room to ruin your trip.;
, Read user reviews online, scan through guidebooks and ask fellow travelers for their impressions. Word of mouth will both help you avoid unclean or unsafe hostels and steer you toward gems hidden off the beaten path.

, If no rules are listed online or in guidebooks, call and inquire. Some hostels have nightly curfews, or close during certain hours of the day. Alcohol is not allowed in some hostels. Take careful note of check-in and check-out times.

, Finding your way to a new hostel in the dark can be an exercise in frustration, and in some places wandering around after dark is downright unsafe.

, Pay attention to whether you'll feel safe walking to and from the room--which might even be in a separate building--after dark. Don't be shy about asking to see the bathroom, too. If the accommodates aren't clean and safe you can usually walk away from the booking, although you will probably lose any advance deposit you've made.

, You won't have to climb over anyone else to get into bed, and you'll be able to store items under the bunk.

, While you're at it, bring earplugs in case your roommates snore, and flip-flops to protect your feet in what will probably be a shared shower.


Plan on wearing pajamas during your hostel stay, even if that's not your normal routine. Your new roommates will thank you.

, Some people stay in hostels specifically for the social aspect of the experience.

Provide the required deposit. If your plans may change and you do not want to pay for the full cost of your stay, book a hotel that only requires a deposit. When you pay the deposit required by the hotel, which is often the equivalent of one night's stay, you can usually still change your travel dates without a penalty.

Israel is a state in the Middle East by the Mediterranean and the Sinai Peninsula, created in 1947 by UN order. Before that it was a mandate state under British control after the Ottoman (Turkish) Empire collapsed during World War I.Palestine is a historical name of the same region - between the Mediterranean Sea and Jordan River. Palestine is the birth place of two major religions: Judaism and Christianity.Israelis refer to the citizens of the modern state Israel.
Palestinians refer to Arabs living in the West Bank and Gaza Strip - an independent Arab state co-existing with Israel.;
,


Palestine was under Ottoman (Turkish) rule between 1517-1920, until World War I when the Ottoman Empire collapsed.
After that the region was under British control (British Mandate or Mandatory of Palestine).Hundreds of thousands of Jews immigrated to British Palestine, escaping World War I and II, and the Nazi Holocaust (genocide murdering millions of Jews), alarming local citizens and compromising a promise to form an independent Arab state.In 1915-1916 Britain had made promises to Arab nationalists in the region, offering them a free Arab state after the World War I if they fought alongside to conquer the Ottoman Empire.However, in 1917 Britain also promised Jews an independent Jewish state in the region, conflicting with the promises made earlier to Arabs.This is the starting point of the conflict.
After the World War II in 1947 UN declared a plan to form an ""Independent Arab state alongside a Jewish State, and the Special International Regime for the City of Jerusalem"". The Jewish leaders accepted it while Palestinian Arab leaders rejected it, alongside all independent Arab and Muslim states.A civil war erupted as neighboring countries attacked Israel, but it won and gained its independence. As a result Israel occupied much of the land designated to the Palestinian Arab State, and over 700 000 Palestinian Arabs fled or were expelled from their homes. Arabs call this ""the Palestinian exodus"", known as Al-Nakba (The Catastrophe).All this has caused bitter feelings in Arabs.In 1967, the Six-Day War broke out between Israel and its neighboring Egypt, Jordan and Syria. As a result, Israel occupied the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, the Golan Heights and the Sinai Peninsula.,


The Jewish Bible claims that ""the Land of Israel"" is a holy land promised by God to the descendants of Abraham. That's why many Jewish people believe that the land belongs to them by ""God's order"". That is also why the conflict is hard to solve because claiming a land by referring to religious texts is controversial.However, there's freedom of religion in modern Israel and many Israelis are also secular in their religious practices. Also, Muslim Arabs live in Israel and are thus Israelis by nationality. In 2017 the population of Israel was estimated to be around 8,6 million of which 74.8% were Jewish and 20.8% Arabs.Jerusalem is an important religious city to Jews, Christians and Muslims. The Temple Mount is particularly significant; it is thought to be the place where Abraham offered to sacrifice his son Isaac to God, where King Solomon built the First Temple to house the Ten Commandments, where Muhammad visited Heaven, and where also Jesus is thought to have prayed and taught.Jerusalem is the holiest city to Jews, and the third holiest after Mecca and Medina to Muslims.
The Temple Mount is where two major Islamic sites are located: The Dome of the Rock and Al-Aqsa Mosque.
In 1967, Israel took over the Old City and the Temple Mount - but Muslims still manage the site while Israeli soldiers patrol there, causing tension between all groups.

, For years there have been attempts to prevail peace in the region, often with meager results.The word Intifada refers to Palestinian uprisings against the Israeli occupation of Palestinian regions.The Roadmap for Peace refers to 2002 plan proposed by the Quartet on the Middle East,comprising of the UN (United Nations), the United States, EU (European Union) and Russia. It proposed creating an independent Palestinian State living side by side with Israel.The Israeli Settlements refer to illegal housing in the occupied Palestinian regions, condemned by the international community.As of February 2013, 131 of the 193 member states of the United Nations have recognized the State of Palestine.,


Zionism refers to Jewish nationalist ideology claiming that Judaism isn't just a religion but a nationality and thus that Jews belong and have a right to their ancient land of Israel or Palestine.Many Arabs have a very negative impression of Zionism, seeing it as imperialist and racist movement against Arabs or Muslims.Yasser Arafat (1929-2004) was the Chairman of PLO (The Palestine Liberation Organization, the official representative of Palestinian people) and the founder of the political party Fatah.He received the Nobel Peace Prize, together with Israeli President and Prime Minister Shimon Peres, for their efforts for peace.
After Arafat, Mahmoud Abbas took over as the leader of PLO and as President of the Palestinians. He also is a member of the Fatah party.Hamas is another Palestinian party that started as an offshoot of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood (a religious extremist movement) and is considered a terrorist organization by several countries and international organizations.When Hamas won the 2006 Palestinian election, Hamas and Fatah were driven into conflict, as Hamas has called for the destruction of Israel and does not recognize its right to exist.Benjamin Netanyahu is the Prime Minister of Israel and the Chairman of the right-wing Likud party. He has executed harsh policies against Palestinians including expanding the illegal Jewish settlements.Knesset refers to the legislative branch of the Israeli government. It passes all laws and elects the president., Both parties have turned to violence in various instances and the conflict seems to be never-ending.During the civil war in 1948, around 85% of the Palestinian Arab population was displaced, and as of now some of the survivors and their descendants still live in refugee camps. There are now 5 million people considered as Palestinian Refugees, living in neighboring Syria, Jordan and Lebanon and in Israeli occupied Palestinian regions of Gaza and West Bank. They have now lived in the camps for decades and for generations, and this causes major resentment among Arabs towards Israelis and Israeli politics.Israel severely restricts the movement of Palestinian nationals in the occupied Palestinian regions of Gaza and West Bank. People have to go through various checkpoints even to get to work and the Israeli officials can be rude and violent.Israel has also forbidden the use of certain roads and water supplies from Palestinians, reserving these to illegal settlers, which even further escalates the conflict.The Israeli West Bank barrier or wall was built to isolate the people of West Bank from the Israelis. It is 700 km long and Israel claims it to be a security measure against terrorism, but Palestinians see it as a racial segregation or apartheid wall, even further restricting people's movement.The Gaza Barrier entirely separates the district from Israel and it has only five land check points.Palestinian Extremists have carried out many attacks and bombings over the years against Israeli citizens, mainly organized by Hamas.People are frustrated with the high unemployment rate and poor living conditions in the occupied regions, so even small children are known to turn to violence and throw stones at Israeli soldiers, citizens and settlers, causing real damage. The Israeli soldiers are known to use harsh force and intimidating raids to locate the perpetrators, and even arrest minors and children.Both parties only see the wrongdoings of their enemies, claiming themselves to be innocent.
Inside West Bank and Gaza, harsh Islamic laws are implemented, thus restricting freedom of expression, the rights of women and children, and implementing torture and harsh punishments for things like same-sex relationships.Also Israelis are reported to torture people, especially Palestinians, on a regular basis.After Hamas won the 2006 elections and took over Gaza, it started regular rocket attacks on Israel, escalating the situation into a full-blown conflict. Because of the violent militant actions Egypt is also building a wall on its Gaza border., The hatred between Israelis and Palestinians has escalated to such extremity that many people don't want to have anything to do with the ""enemy"". Children are discouraged to interact with each other or considered ""traitors"", and a marriage between ""enemies"" is unheard-of.The political leaders of both sides fuel the conflict: The Israelis expand the hated settlements and continue to occupy and monitor the Palestinian territory and restrict the movement of Palestinian people and goods. Hamas has control over Gaza, does rocket and terror attacks and doesn't want to recognize the state of Israel - until just recently it called for destruction of Israel.Fatah controls the West Bank and does not agree with Hamas' violent practices.
Ordinary people pay the price: The Israelis suffer under Hamas rocket attacks and people living in Gaza suffer under the Israeli blockade.Millions of Palestinian refugees who fled the 1948 war have not much hope to ever return to their homes and still continue to live on refugee camps that were meant to be temporary. People on both sides are frustrated to their political leaders fueling the hatred instead of working towards peace.
The Israeli view is that it's protecting its citizens from terror and thus controlling the Palestinian territories is absolutely necessary. The Palestinians view its practices as occupying and controlling the legally recognized state of Arab Palestine that was supposed to exist side by side Israel. (And of course Hamas doesn't want to co-exist with Israel at all.) There's no easy solution to this.
Majority of Arabs don't agree that Israel has a moral right to exist based on the Bible - but many have learned to accept the reality that Israel as a state is here to stay, and thus (have to) recognize it.Luckily there are people who defy the hate-speech and seriously want to have peace in the region so they can continue to live their lives and raise their children in peace.According to a 2015 poll over 50% of people on both sides wanted a peaceful solution to the conflict and accepted the two-state model."

Visit public history attractions.,
Talk to veterans of the war.,
Talk to civilians who lived through the war.",How to Understand the Vietnam War2," They are the raw materials of history. For instance, you might read the Pentagon Papers – a collection of documents produced by the U.S. Department of Defense – to learn what the American government was thinking during the Vietnam War. You could also investigate the Central Intelligence Agency’s Vietnam action histories.


Links to these and other sources are available online at http://shsulibraryguides.org/c.php?g=86715&p=559000.
Don’t neglect photographic sources. The image of Kim Phuc running down the street after her village was napalmed is one of the most powerful images in modern history.
Similarly, Eddie Adams’ 1968 photo of the summary execution of a suspected communist demonstrates the lawlessness that came to characterize the war., There are several museums and monuments dedicated to the Vietnam War, both in the U.S. and in Vietnam. Visiting these museums or monuments, especially on a guided tour with a subject expert, can provide greater insight into the war. These museums offer a mixture of artifacts, displays, videos, and placards to explore the war and its effects. You might visit:


The National Vietnam War Museum in Texas.The War Remnants Museum in Ho Chi Minh City. This museum, like the National Vietnam War Museum in the U.S., has many tanks and vehicles used in the war.
The Vietnam War Memorial, designed by Maya Lin, in Washington, D.C. The monument can improve understanding of the war’s meaning. It has the name of every soldier who was killed during the war etched onto it.

, Prepare a list of questions you want to ask before beginning your conversation. Use care when talking to people who survived war, especially veterans.Do not assume vets are proud of their service. For many veterans, their military experience was traumatic and remains difficult to talk about.
For instance, do not ask, “How many people did you kill?” or say “I would have killed many enemy soldiers.” These statements might make veterans uncomfortable or even angry.
For similar reasons, do not say to a vet, “I’m glad you made it home okay.” Even if veterans are physically unharmed, they might feel a great deal of psychic pain and emotional frustration about what they did or saw in Vietnam.
Start with easy questions like, “When did you serve in Vietnam?” and work your way up through more difficult questions like, “Did you see many battles?”
Arrange a meeting with a Vietnam vet in your area by contacting Vietnam Veterans against the War or the Wounded Warriors Project to learn more about the military experience of the war.

, During the Vietnam War, civilians suffered terribly.Their experiences can help you understand how people who lived through the war talked and thought about it. Prepare a list of questions you want to ask before beginning your conversation.


Find out where the civilian lived during the war. People who lived in North Vietnam will likely remember the conflict differently than people who lived in South Vietnam.
You might want to ask about the attitude toward the war and how it changed over time.

Understand the Cold War.,
Recognize Vietnam’s history of colonization.,
Understand the Tonkin Bay incident.,
Think about the escalation of the war.,
Reflect on the draw-down and end of the war.",How to Understand the Vietnam War3," The Cold War was the ongoing conflict between the 20th century’s two great superpowers, the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. The U.S. was a capitalist democracy, while the U.S.S.R. was a communist dictatorship. The two nations saw each other as mortal enemies. Instead of fighting each other directly, though, they fought a series of indirect proxy wars and conflicts around the world in Vietnam, Nicaragua, Cuba, Angola, and elsewhere.China was the other emerging superpower, and it officially sided with the U.S.S.R., though the two countries often disagreed. China and the U.S.S.R. both aided North Vietnam.
Ask a grandparent (or parent, if they are old enough to remember) what the Cold War was like. Ask questions like, “What did Americans think of the U.S.S.R.?” or “Did you know anyone who fought in Vietnam?”

, Vietnam had a long history of colonization. In the 1800s, France took over Indochina (what is today Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia). During World War II, they were pushed out by Japan, who then instituted an even more brutal colonization regime, resulting in the starvation of around 2 million Vietnamese people.France took over again briefly after World War II ended, but struggled to maintain control, and left in 1954 after their defeat in the Battle of Dien Bien Phu.


When France left, the peace treaty divided the country into two parts (North Vietnam and South Vietnam). Elections and reunification were scheduled, but did not occur.
In 1959, North Vietnam declared war on the South.
Vietnam’s struggle for unity and independence was part of a global struggle against colonial rule. India, Algeria, and Indonesia all fought anti-colonial wars following World War II.
Learning about colonization in Vietnam will help you understand why the Vietnamese were so suspicious and opposed to American intervention in their country.

, In 1964, two American battleships reported they had been fired upon by North Vietnam. Following these alleged attacks, President Lyndon Johnson sought approval to expand American military presence in Vietnam. After this incident, American involvement in Vietnam began to increase.Later reports revealed that there had been a small conflict between U.S. and North Vietnamese forces several days before the incident that President Johnson suggested demanded military response. Later, it was discovered that American ships had not been fired upon during this incident.

, The Gulf of Tonkin incident caused President Johnson to increase the number of U.S. troops in Vietnam. By 1967 there were about half a million U.S. troops in the country.One of the major turning points was the Tet Offensive, a large-scale military against U.S. and South Vietnamese forces. After the attack, Americans increasingly believed that they could not win the war and that new leadership was needed to take America out of Vietnam.

, As the war dragged on, it became less and less popular.President Johnson's high disapproval due to his stance on the war led him to decline seeking re-election in 1968. Richard Nixon was then elected President on a platform that promised to end the war. Finally, in 1973, American forces withdrew. North Vietnam finally prevailed over South Vietnam in 1975, and the country was reunified.

Think about the American reaction.,
Reflect on how the Vietnamese people felt.,
Identify what was unique in the war.,
Think about the impact of TV.",How to Understand the Vietnam War4," The Vietnam War was very unpopular. As more and more U.S. soldiers died, Americans began to question the validity of the war. Many Americans dodged the draft by going to Canada or getting married in order to avoid military service in what they considered a pointless conflict. Others protested the war by marching and engaging in anti-war actions. College campuses were hotbeds of antiwar activity.


Many people publicly burned their draft cards in opposition to the war.
At Kent State University in 1970, Army National Guardsmen fired on students during an anti-war protest. Four students died and nine were wounded.Try to imagine yourself being shot at by your own country’s military simply for exercising your freedom of speech. How would you feel?
In order to understand the Vietnam War, it is important to consider why it was so unpopular. Compare reactions to the Vietnam War to reactions to World War II. How were they different and why?

, The war was equally unpopular in Vietnam. America gave support to the government of South Vietnam, but that government was very unpopular. One of the most visible symbols of Vietnamese opposition to their own government -- and, by extension, their allies and the war – was when Thich Quang Duc burned himself alive in Saigon in 1963., The war was unique in a few ways. It used new kinds of weapons (napalm and Agent Orange) and was fought against a different kind of enemy.To fully understand the civilian response, it is important to understand these unique aspects.


Napalm was a flammable liquid that caused massive burns across anything it touched. During the Vietnamese War, it was used extensively by the U.S. to burn forests where enemy soldiers were hiding, but it also caused many civilian deaths.
Agent Orange was a chemical weapon developed by two companies, Dow Chemical and the Monsanto Corporation. This chemical caused widespread birth defects, immune deficiency, and an increased rate of cancer for the Vietnamese people. It also produced adverse health impacts for U.S. soldiers who were exposed.
Traditional wars involve two armies facing off on a battlefield. This rarely occurred in Vietnam. Instead, American soldiers had to contend with guerrillas – soldiers who did not wear uniforms and who would attack small groups of soldiers from a distance, rather than engage them in direct battle. Many of these guerillas moved freely between North and South Vietnam. Guerrillas also used traps and mines to cause damage to American soldiers without confronting them directly.

, Unlike prior conflicts, Americans saw the impact of the Vietnam War directly each night on TV. As the war dragged on, support declined as audiences saw firsthand the horrors of the war. Understanding the war requires recognizing the impact of TV footage on American attitudes."

, It's up to you to find someone willing to mentor you for the next four years without receiving any pay or even continuing education credit.


The attorney or judge you choose must be admitted to the active practice of law in California, and have been in good standing for at least five years.
You will not be working for your mentor. Rather, you will be following a course of study proposed by the attorney or judge, who will personally supervise you at least five hours a week.Try to study law under an attorney who practices the same type of law you want to practice after you pass the bar exam.Your mentor also must examine you at least once a month on the material you studied that month.
Once every six months, your mentor will report to the Committee of Bar Examiners the hours you studied each week and the subjects and materials you studied., Before you submit any other forms, you must apply with the State Bar of California Office of Admissions to register as a law student.Your application for registration must include a $113 fee., Within 30 daysof the day you start your study program, you must submit the state's form along with a $150 fee., Since you have to pass the Bar exam before you can start practicing law, your study should focus primarily on Bar subjects.

The report may include the hours you studied, the areas of law you covered and course materials you used, cases you read, exercises you completed, and evaluation of your performance on monthly exams., After you've completed one year of legal education, you must take and pass the FYLSX, also known as the ""Baby Bar.""The FYLSX takes one day. During the morning session you have approximately four hours to answer four essay questions. After a lunch break, the test day concludes with a three-hour afternoon session during which you'll answer 100 multiple-choice questions.Since the exam covers contracts, criminal law, and torts, these subjects should be the focus of your first year of study.Study aids and sample essay exam questions with answers are available from the Office of Admissions of the California Bar.

, The exam is offered in June and October each year, and must be taken either in Los Angeles or San Francisco.Your application must be accompanied by a fee of $566.If you file your application after the regular deadline passes, expect to pay additional late filing fees which can be as much as $200.After you apply, your mentor will be sent a certification form to prove you've completed a year of law study.

Your converted essay scores and converted multiple-choice scores are added together to produce your total score.If you don't pass the Baby Bar on the first try, you can try again. The California Bar gives you a total of three chances to pass the exam. If it takes you more than three attempts, you only get credit for a single year of legal education – which means you wouldn't get credit for any time you spent studying while you were retaking the FYLSX., The Committee conducts a thorough and intense background examination before determining you have sufficient moral character to practice law in California.


For example, to complete the application you will need to list employment history going back to your 18th birthday. You may not recall the addresses of places you worked part-time, or the names of your supervisors.

Search for hotel deals.,
Determine the dollar and reward miles cost of the hotel.,
Make the calculation.,
Decide if a hotel has a good redemption value.",How to Save on Hotels Using Airline Rewards1," If your airline rewards program has a dedicated website, you can use this website to search for hotels. Typically, this website will list the cost of the hotels in points as well as dollars. If you are a member of two or more rewards programs, try opening up their respective websites, searching for deals and comparing across the sites. You can also try using one of the aggregate travel deal websites and search for good deals at your chosen destination. Once you find a good deal, you can inquire with the hotel about the cost in points., Search for hotels in your destination and determine the dollar and reward miles cost of the available hotels. If you are searching under your profile on an airline or credit card rewards website, the search findings should include both dollar and reward points price.

, Divide the cost of the hotel in dollars by the number of reward miles or points you would need to redeem. If a hotel you are interested in is listed as $500 or 25,000 points, you would end up with a value of two cents per point. This value is commonly referred to as cents per mile or CPM., Generally, a good price per mile for hotels is 1.2. If you are not an elite reward program member, you might be looking more at .6 cents per mile or less. However, the redemption value of the hotel should be assessed by comparing the price per mile of the chosen hotel with other available options at your destination. If the price per mile of your chosen hotel is a good value in comparison to other options at your chosen destination and you would rather spend the points than the cash, you may consider it a good redemption value.If one hotel is listed at $300 per night or 25,000, it has a redemption value of 1.2 cents. This is a good redemption value, but you should still compare it to the redemption value of neighboring hotels. If there is another hotel listed for $500 or 35,000 points, which has a redemption value of 1.4 cents, you should consider spending the extra points for a slightly better redemption value and a fancier hotel. If you don’t want to part with the extra 10,000 points and are happy with the hotel listed at $300 or 25,000 points, you are still getting a good redemption value.

Compare the redemption value of various hotels.",How to Save on Hotels Using Airline Rewards2," Compare the available hotels at your chosen destination in terms of location, amenities, comfort, and price. Once you identify your preferred hotel options, figure out how much you would have to spend in cash or points., If you are a member of multiple airline rewards programs, look at which programs you are earning the most from. If you earn points more easily from one of these programs, consider using them to purchase your hotel. By using your preferred rewards program, you will more easily be able to earn back the points., If you are an elite member of an airline rewards program, you should be able to get a much better redemption value. Use this elite status to get the best deal on hotels. If you are an elite member of multiple rewards programs, you should compare the redemption value that you are able to get from your respective programs at your chosen destination.

, You can sometimes get a good redemption value on package deals such as hotel and airplane ticket deals or hotel and car rental deals. If you are also considering spending points on a flight or a car rental, you should look at whether you can get a good redemption value on package deals., Now that you have calculated the redemption values of the hotels on your list, you should compare them. If you will be able to redeem more cents per mile with one hotel, you should consider going for it."

Close by repeating your request for relief.",How to Present an Oral Argument," After submitting a brief or motion to the court, you have the option to present oral argument. The purpose of oral argument is to help clarify the issues for judges and address any concerns that they have.You should think about oral argument as a dialogue that you will be having with the judges. The judges are not the enemy. Judges may ask hard questions because those are the issues they are grappling with. Not every hard question is an attempt to trip you up.
Oral argument is most associated with appeals. After a trial court renders a decision, the losing party can appeal. This person is called the “appellant.” The other party is the “appellee.” Appeals are usually heard in front of a panel of at least three judges.
Trial courts will also hold oral arguments for critical motions (such as a motion for summary judgment) or on a motion for a new trial.;
, Some appellate courts will list rules that attorneys must follow during oral arguments. You should look for these rules on the court’s website. If you have a question, call the court clerk and be sure to ask.


If you are preparing for a Moot Court competition, then you will definitely be given a list of rules.
Always follow the rules. If anything in the rules conflicts with anything you read here, follow the court’s rules instead.

, You need to read all briefs—not just the ones you wrote. Going into oral argument, you need to know the legal issues in the case and any disagreements the two parties have about what the law means.


You also need to know the facts inside and out. Even though you will not present a summary of the facts at oral argument, you should anticipate being asked any question about the record. Take out the record (the transcripts, trial motions, jury instructions, etc.) and become as familiar with it as you can., In the briefs, you cited various court opinions, statutes, treatises, and law review articles as legal authority. You need to re-read all of this material so that you can discuss it and answer questions judges may have about how it relates to your case.


Also re-read all of the authority cited by the other party. You will need to know their cases as well as they do.

, You should create a short outline of your argument. Ideally, the argument will follow the order of the arguments in your brief. However, you may have sandwiched your weakest argument in the brief between your stronger ones. Because time is limited in oral argument, you may want to reorder your arguments from strongest to weakest, so that you will be assured of discussing your strongest arguments first.


You cannot introduce new arguments into oral argument. If you forgot to make an argument in the briefs, you cannot spring it on the other side during oral argument. The purpose of oral argument is to address the arguments actually made in the briefs.
Write your outline on the inside of a manila folder that you take up to the podium with you. Include the legal argument: “The conviction should be reversed because the lineup was unduly prejudicial.” Then include a few bullet points of either relevant facts or legal rules.

For example, relevant facts with respect to a lineup could be that all of the other fillers in the lineup were of a different race or much taller than you.
You may also want to write down the name of a legal case that was similar to yours that you are citing for legal authority that filling a lineup with people of a different race is unduly prejudicial.
If you are lost as to what to put in your outline, then look at your brief. You already included an outline of your legal arguments in the Table of Contents to your brief.


The amount of detail you include in your outline will depend on how well you know your argument. Write out topic sentences for each legal argument you make. Then practice making your argument. If you don’t know what to say in support of your argument, then you need to revisit your brief, the record, and the legal authority you cited.

, If you forget the name of a case when delivering your argument, you will want to have a “cheat sheet” that lists the names of cases and then a few relevant facts. This sheet can jog your memory.


You can put the cheat sheet on the other half of the manila folder, across from your outline. This way, you can just glance down at the podium if you are asked a question and need help remembering the case.
Write the case name or statute and then a relevant fact or two to jog your memory. Also write down what point of law you cited it for.

, Pretend that you are a judge and come up with questions. Having re-read the briefs, you should be well aware of the weaknesses of your case. You can write each question on a separate index card. In this way, you can practice whenever you have a spare moment by shuffling the cards and then answering each question that you draw from the deck.


You should also write down answers to the questions.Strive to keep answers brief—preferably one or two sentences. A short answer is easier to remember and also saves you time that can be spent talking about all of the issues.
Compare these two answers. Suppose you are arguing that a lineup was unduly prejudicial and that the eye-witnesses identification should have been thrown out. The government argues that the witness never identified the defendant so the issue is moot. A judge asks you about this: “How can you say the identification was unconstitutional when there wasn’t really an identification? The witness never said, ‘He’s the one.’”


Answer One: “Well, your honor, it may be technically true that the government didn’t get an eyewitness identification. But I don’t think we need to rely on formalities. It doesn’t really matter what label we use. It’s probably better to look and see what the witness said. And the witness said, ‘I think it looks like him.’ And I would argue that’s close enough to an identification, especially when the government presented her as a witness in its case.”

Answer Two: “It may not have been technically an identification, but the government treated it as one. If they want to offer it to the jury as an identification, then they need to follow the Constitution when they get it.”


Work hard to refine your answers. Revisit your answers repeatedly and try phrasing the differently.

, You should give your list of questions to a friend and do several practice runs. Have the friend ask you the questions and work at honing your answers so that they are sharp, short, and persuasive.


Also work on transitioning between arguments. You may have three issues you want to raise in oral argument. Preferably, you would present them in a one, two, three order. However, the judges may immediately want to take you to issue three. You need to practice transitioning from three to one.
Practice every combination. Start with the second argument and work on how to transition to your first argument.
Also prepare for a “cold bench.” When judges ask a lot of questions, it is called a “hot bench” or “hot panel.”A “cold bench” occurs when no judge has a question and you must simply deliver your argument uninterrupted. You should also practice delivering an argument to a cold bench., Many courts now put their oral arguments on websites or stream them live. If you cannot visit the court to observe an oral argument in person, then you should listen to several recorded arguments to get a feel for the rhythm of oral argument and how attorneys answer questions.


Find oral arguments for the court you will be arguing in. Supreme Court arguments may be great, but they may not be anything like an argument in your court.

, You need to be dressed in business attire when presenting an oral argument. You should pick conservative styles and colors. Dark colors, such as navy blue or gray, are best.Women should wear a two piece suit: a pant suit or a skirt suit. No dresses.
Men should wear a business suit with matching jacket and pants. Leave “fun” ties at home. Instead, opt for a solid tie in blue or red.

, Before entering the court room, you should turn off all cellular phones and pagers, or set them to silent mode.Make sure any electronic device that could make a “beep” is turned off.


Some people have watches that beep. They sometimes forget this, only to have the watch beep while they are at the podium.

, Each party will have a separate table or different end of a bench to sit at.You should understand where you are supposed to place yourself.


Facing the judges, the person bringing the appeal typically sits on the left, while the appellee sits to the right.If you don’t know where you are supposed to go, try to sit in on at least one day of oral argument to watch what counsel do.

, Many courtrooms have microphones now (although not all will). You should speak directly into the microphone using a comfortable speaking style. Do not feel as if you have to project your voice, but speak loud enough so that the court can hear you.


Do not apologize for being nervous. Also, try to speak at a normal speed no matter how nervous you are.Avoid saying “Umm….” or “Ah…” If you need a second to think or look at your cheat sheet, then take a breath instead of using filler words or sounds.

, Begin your argument by saying, “May it please the court, my name is and I represent .”If you are representing yourself pro se, you can state, “May it please the court, my name is and I am representing myself in this action.”
Always refer to judges as “Your Honor” and to the court as a whole as “the court.”You do not have to introduce yourself individually to each judge.Instead, introduce yourself to the judges collectively.

, If you are the appellant (the party bringing the appeal), then you may reserve some of your time to use for rebuttal.Some courts will require you to tell them ahead of argument how you will divide your time. Other courts will request that you tell them at the beginning of your argument.


If you are given 20 minutes, then you should reserve at least five for rebuttal.

, After introducing yourself, you should tell the court what relief you are requesting and why. Create a roadmap by laying out your arguments, in the order you will present them. Also be sure to tell the court what you want it to do.For example, if you are asking for a criminal defendant’s conviction to be overturned, then you would say, “We ask the court to overturn Mr. Smith’s conviction for three reasons. First, the police lineup was unduly suggestive and violated Mr. Smith’s Due Process rights. Second, the government’s introduction of guilt-by-association evidence prejudiced Mr. Smith. And third, the court’s refusal to allow Mr. Smith to present an alibi witness denied him a fair trial.”
Realize that the judges can cut you off with a question at any time. If they are particularly interested in an issue, they may even cut you off before you finish reciting your roadmap.

, The judges have already read the briefs and are familiar with the facts of the case. You should not launch into a discussion of the facts unless a judge asks for clarification of the facts.Refer to facts confidently, as if you assume the judges know what you are talking about. You don’t have to say, “As I’m sure the court knows, the defendant was arrested on a Friday but not arraigned until Monday.” Simply state facts and tie them to your argument: “Because my client had to wait two days to be arraigned, he couldn’t meet with his lawyer.”

, You should make eye contact. Look from judge to judge as you make your argument. When answering a judge’s question, you should look at the judge who asked it.


Do not address your argument to opposing counsel., You should avoid being theatrical when delivering an oral argument. Instead, stand still with your hands at your side or resting on the podium in front of you. You should not pace back and forth, the way a lawyer sometimes does in a Hollywood movie when delivering a closing argument to a jury.Don’t waive your arms around or punctuate thoughts by pointing fingers or other gestures.
Also avoid bringing a lot of material up to the podium with you. You won’t have time to riffle through binders full of paper or thumb through your brief. If you need help remembering a fact or case name, refer to your cheat sheet in front of you on the podium.

, An oral argument is not a presentation to a jury. Accordingly, you should not rely on exhibits during your argument. If you do need an exhibit to help clarify something, then make sure the exhibit is no larger than an 8.5x11” piece of paper.Preferably, the exhibit should have been included in your brief as an appendix. You could then simply refer to the appendix in your argument.


Remember that you cannot introduce new evidence during the oral argument.So scrutinize any exhibit you think you must use to be sure it does not contain new facts or interpretations not made in the briefs.

, If you are the appellant, then you should raise all of your arguments in your opening argument. Do not save arguments to introduce for the first time on rebuttal.Mention an argument in a single sentence if you have to. Just be sure to raise all of your issues in the opening argument.

, You don’t want to waste time by answering a question that hasn’t been asked. Listen closely to the question.You are not supposed to ask judges questions, so don’t clarify by asking the judge what he or she means.If you don’t understand the question, then instead begin your answer with, “If I understand Your Honor correctly….”Should you be on the wrong track, the judge can correct you.

, You should not dodge a question because you don’t have a good answer. Instead, directly answer the question asked. If it is a question you have anticipated, then you should have a decent answer.


If the judge asks a “yes or no” question, then answer “yes or no.” After doing so, attempt to clarify briefly, to provide context to your answer.For example, if the judge asks, “Didn’t you admit that you were guilty to the prosecutor?” you can say, “I did. But as explained in my brief, I was under duress because I hadn’t seen any of my family in three days and was worried.”
Answering questions directly signals to the judges that you are honest and confident in your argument.Sometimes judges will make arguments neither party made. Although you are prohibited from introducing arguments at oral argument that you didn’t make in the briefs, you must always answer the judge’s question. If you have to speculate to answer the question, then speculate. Say, “That wasn’t in the record, Your Honor. But if I have to speculate, then I would say….”

, If the judge’s has the facts wrong, then you should gently correct the error.You can say, “Actually, Your Honor, the record says….” And then provide the correct information.
If the judge persists, you can simply say, “I disagree with that” and try to move on. You will not win an argument with a judge. However, you do not want to waste too much time haggling over details. Refer the judges to your brief, which should have the correct factual information.

, When a judge interrupts you to ask a question, you should immediately stop talking.The judge may be particularly anxious to ask you a question, or she may not like your argument. Do not get flustered or upset, especially as you can’t know why you were interrupted.


If the judge interrupted an important point you wanted to make, then try to weave it back into one of your answers after directly answering the question the judge has interrupted you to ask., Sometimes judges will identify legal issues that neither attorney has. In this case, you may be asked a question you have never thought of. Rather than try to come up with an answer on the spot, you can offer to provide supplemental briefing.The court may not allow it, but it is a good idea to offer, especially if you think the issue is critical to the case. However, supplemental briefing must be for an issue raised by the judges. It is not another attempt for you to write a compelling brief or make arguments you should have made in the briefing.

, The appellee may simply repeat what is in their brief. Or, the appellee may respond creatively to your arguments. Listen closely to hear what the appellee is really saying. In rebuttal, you need to respond to the arguments made.

, Take out a blank piece of paper and draw a line down the center. On the left-hand side, write out arguments the appellee makes that seem very strong. Also, write down any misrepresentations the appellee makes.


Don’t write out every argument the appellee makes. You won’t have time for that. Instead, focus on arguments your gut tells you that you must respond to.

, As you listen to the appellee, write out counterpoints you want to make on the right-hand side of the paper. Write the counterpoints beside the corresponding argument.


In a few words, write down what you want to say. If the appellee quotes a wrong number, write down the correct number. If the appellee mistakes the holding of a case, note the correct holding.

, As the appellee wraps up their argument, quickly rank the counterarguments, from most pressing to least. You may only have five minutes or so of rebuttal, and some of that time will be eaten up answering judge’s questions.


By ranking the arguments, you can be sure to address the most important in what little time you have remaining.

, Remind the judges of what the appellee argued. Then counter the argument or clarify it.


For example: “First, I want to clarify that my client spent five nights in jail, not two, as you just heard.”
Or: “The state claims that the Supreme Court doesn’t require Miranda warnings each new time the police interrogate a suspect. But that’s not what the Court actually held. Instead….”

, You may make it through the rebuttal with time to spare, or you may run out of time halfway through a sentence. If the latter, complete your sentence but stop making arguments.


If your time runs out on you, then say, “I see my time has run out. May I conclude briefly?”If you are granted time, then simply state your requested relief. Do not continue making substantive argument as part of your brief conclusion.

Open a web browser and type in “statute” and then the subject matter you are looking for.
For example, if you want to find out the city’s law on a dog barking at night, type “statute dog bark” and then your city.;
, Local ordinances are often difficult to find. However, you can visit MuniCode.com and browse. Select your state and then select the town or city from the alphabetical list.You can also find municipal codes by visiting your town clerk’s office and asking if you can get a copy., If you can’t find a statute online, then you might want to visit a local law library and ask the librarian for help. Statutes should be kept in bound volumes. Law libraries can usually be found at your local county courthouse. If your county does not have a library, then ask the court clerk where the nearest law library is located.


You can find your local courthouse by looking in the phone book or by searching online.
At the law library, look for an Annotated Code. This version of statutes will include information on court cases that interpreted the statute.Once a court case interprets an aspect of the statute, then that interpretation will control future applications of the law. For this reason, you should try to see the annotated version of a law.

, Lawyers, law students, and paralegals should all have access to either Westlaw or LexisNexis. You can find the text of a statute on these search engines in a couple of ways:


Click on a hyperlink. If you are reading a court opinion, then any referenced statute should be hyperlinked. Clicking on the link will take you to the statute.
You can also search by clicking on “Statutes and Legislation.” You then can search by search term, e.g., “Rules of Evidence.” In Lexis, the Chapter Heading will be given, along with the highlighted text. Read the heading to see if it relates to your search.
Don’t forget to check for annotations. The annotations should appear underneath the statutory text. By reading the annotations, you can find court opinions that define and apply the statute.

, Statutes are often grouped by subject matter. For example, there will be a section for Rules of Evidence or a section for Housing. You should be able to recognize the layout of a section:Title
Subtitle
Chapter
Subchapter
Part

, You should always look for any “Definition” section. Usually, these come at the front of the statutory section. Sometimes, even common words like “firearm” can be given specific definitions by the legislature. You should find out the statutory meaning of words since these will often have a specific meaning.


Also circle any words that you do not understand. Don’t skip anything. You need to understand every sentence in the relevant section of the statute.
After circling words you don’t know, look them up in a dictionary. Once you have defined all words, read the statute another couple of times.

, Statutes often use the words “shall” and “may.” Their meaning is different. For example, when a statute states that you “shall” do something, then the action is obligatory. However, where “may” is used, then you have discretion.Also pay attention to the word “notwithstanding.” It means “in spite of” and is used to create exceptions to the rule.For example, a law may state that all dogs must be registered with the city. However, it might create an exception: “Notwithstanding the registration requirement, all dog owners have a 60 day grace period to register.”
Understand “if…then” constructions. A statutory provision may only apply if a certain condition has been satisfied. For example, a statute may say, “If a party to a lawsuit requests a jury, then each party shall contribute $150 in costs.” Here, a party will only need to pay $150 if one of the parties requests a jury.

, Some words, like “reasonable” or “good cause,” will be impossible to define simply by looking at the statute. Even if these terms are included in the definitions, the real meaning will be determined on a case-by-case basis.In this situation, you need to find an annotated version of the statute so that you can see what situations have qualified as “reasonable” or as a “good cause.”

, A statute might reference another statute. By doing so, the statute incorporates the meaning of the referenced statute. Accordingly, you will need to find all statutes referenced and read them.Finding cross-references should be easy if you search using Lexis or Westlaw. Simply click on the hyperlink.
If you are searching for statutes using books, then write down the title and subtitle numbers and then find the relevant bound volume of statutes. Make sure to photocopy all relevant sections. Photocopies are easier to access than bulky books. You can also highlight or make notes on your photocopies.

, Once you understand the statutory definitions, read it straight through. You should read every statute at least three times so that you can understand it fully.Be sure to read more than just the relevant part. Also, read the subchapter and chapter so that you understand the context for the statute.


If the statute’s meaning is “plain,” then that meaning will be the meaning that a court applies.
Nevertheless, you should avoid absurdity. A court will not apply a statute if it leads to an absurd result.For example, a statute may state, “No animals are allowed in the hospital.” However, it would be absurd to apply the statute to humans, who are technically animals.

, Understand that not all statutes are plain. If all statutes were clear, there would be fewer lawyers. The law is as much an art as a science. If a statute is vague or ambiguous, then you will need to anticipate how a judge would apply the statute. This is not always easy; however, keep the following in mind:


Try to figure out the law’s purpose.Most laws are passed to address a social problem, such as drug use or other crimes, or to provide a framework for how government agencies are to act. You should try to figure out the purpose of the law. If what you want to do does not violate the law’s purpose, then you have a strong argument that the statute doesn’t apply to you.
Read the legislative history. This information can be difficult to find. Nevertheless, read newspaper accounts from the time period when the legislation was considered and then passed. You will often find quotes from legislators stating why they are passing the law. This can help establish the law’s purpose.

, A qualified attorney can give you an educated opinion as to how a government official or a court will interpret a statute. You can explain the facts of your situation and the lawyer can advise whether or not your proposed conduct violates the law.


You might worry about the costs of an attorney. However, realize that many states now allow lawyers to offer “limited scope representation.” Under this arrangement, the lawyer will not take over your entire case. Instead, he or she will only do the tasks you assign. For example, the lawyer might offer advice for a flat fee.If you are interested in this arrangement, then ask whether the attorney offers limited scope representation when you call for a consultation.

For example, if you were involved in a car accident and want to sue the driver of the other car, you'll want case law that deals with the duty of care of other drivers that relates specifically to the circumstances surrounding your accident. If the other driver hit you because she ran a stop sign, you should look for cases that involve accidents that occurred when one party ran a stop sign.
Cases provide stronger support that have facts that are more closely related to the facts in your situation. All facts potentially are relevant in finding the most similar case, so you can argue that the rule the court applied in that case also applies to your situation.
To continue the stop-sign example, if the accident occurred at night, you should be looking for cases where the accident occurred at night – even if visibility wasn't a serious issue in your case. The courts may have established a different rule for night driving that doesn't apply during the day.
You also want to be on the lookout for underlying or tertiary issues. For example, if you want to research case law relevant to your divorce, there may be other issues involving property ownership, retirement accounts, or child custody. Those issues typically would have to be researched separately.;
, The relationship of the parties prior to filing a lawsuit can affect the legal remedies available to the party who sued as well as the duties and obligations both parties have to each other.


For example, some parties have a fiduciary relationship, which means one party owes the other a higher standard of care. Financial advisors and home-care providers are examples of professionals who have a fiduciary duty to their clients.
A contractual relationship is another type of relationship that may be present. If the parties signed a contract, that document likely defines their relationship and their duties to one another.

, To find cases that relate to the legal issues you've found and support your arguments, you must have an ultimate goal in mind, such as an award of money or legal recognition of rights.


For example, suppose you want to know whether you can ask a court to order specific performance under a contract you entered in which the other party breached. While cases similar to yours that stand for the principal that the actions of the other party amount to breach of contract, you also want to focus on the remedy – whether the party who sued was entitled to anything other than monetary damages as a result of the breach.
Similarly, if you're interested in what the maximum monetary award might be for a case such as yours, you would want to look for cases in which the amount of monetary damages was one of the issues before the court that issued the decision.

, Because you want to make sure that the cases you find have value to your legal argument, you must look for cases decided by courts in the state where the dispute occurred that deal with similar problems.


In many ways, doing legal research is similar to researching anything else. The search limits you set at this stage are mostly based on common sense.
For example, if you were doing research on a historical event, you might limit your search to the year the event took place or the geographical area where the event occurred.
Similarly, if you're researching a legal issue, you want to limit your research to the relevant state or geographic area, and to relatively recent cases. Although it may be interesting, you probably won't get much value from a case decided 100 years ago.

, Most county courthouses have a public law library, where you can use most assets free of charge as well as get research assistance from the law librarians who work there.

In addition to print resources, the public law library also may have subscriptions to legal research databases and search engines, which typically allow you to conduct case law research more efficiently.
Major online research databases include Westlaw, Lexis, and Bloomberg Law. Through these databases you should be able to find most of the published opinions for federal and state appellate courts. These databases are only available with a subscription, but the library you visit may have one so patrons can conduct research.
There also are several online databases that can be searched for free, such as Findlaw and Google Scholar. These databases typically have more limited offerings than the subscription databases, and their search engines may be clunkier and less intuitive.
You can work with many of these free online resources on your computer at home, but you won't have the benefit of a law librarian to help you if you get stuck.

, Particularly if you aren't well versed in the legal issues you've identified, a secondary source such as a legal treatise or a law review article can help you focus your research on cases most likely to support your argument.


Secondary sources also can help you become more familiar with legal phrases and terms of art that are frequently mentioned in judicial opinions or other discussions of your research topic.
For example, you may be researching merchandising agreements, but be unaware that these agreements also are referred to simply as ""licensing agreements,"" since they typically deal with trademarked intellectual property. Including this information in your searches can produce more targeted search results.

, If your legal issues concern a particular state or federal law, the annotations of that law can provide you with names and citations of cases that include a court's interpretation of it.


If your legal issue relates to a particular law, you always should start with the text of the law itself. However, if the law was passed recently, you may be able to find news articles or other information about the law that can aid in your understanding of it.
Look up the statute in an annotated reporter, and you'll see citations for articles and court cases that discuss that particular law.
The context of the annotation should give you some idea of why the law was referenced and what was said about it.

, Since many words or descriptive terms aren't used universally, expanding or narrowing the words you use in your search can help you find related cases that you might not have found otherwise.


For example, if you're looking for cases involving car accidents, you may want to search using a word like ""vehicle"" as well. Not only would that word also include trucks and SUVs, but it's a word more likely used in statutes and police reports, which means it's also more likely to show up in court opinions.
In other situations, you may need a narrower word. For example, searching for intellectual property cases may turn up cases involving copyrights, patents, and trademarks – each of which is subject to different laws and licensing schemes. If you're only interested in copyright infringement cases, you should use the word ""copyright"" instead of ""intellectual property.""

, The major cases related to the legal issues you're researching – those that seem to come up over and over again – can serve as a starting point for your research. Typically these cases establish a significant interpretation that is essential to understanding the issue.

To locate a case you've found using print volumes, look at the citation. The name of the case will be first.
After the name of the case, there will be a name surrounded by numbers. The name is the case reporter where that opinion is found.
The number before the case reporter's name is the volume number, while the number following the reporter's name is the page number where that case is printed within that volume.
For example, suppose you see the case Smith v. California come up frequently in your reading. The first part of the citation for that case is ""Smith v. California, 22 U.S. 248."" This tells you that the case is a U.S. Supreme Court case, published in the U.S. Reporter, and that you'll find the case on page 248 of volume 22.
If you're searching for a case online, you can enter the same information into the search bar of the legal search engine you're using to pull up the case.
If you don't yet have a citation and you're trying to find cases relevant to an issue, you can use basic search terms online to find cases, but keep in mind there's no guarantee that these cases will actually have value for you.
If you search using key words, you'll have to read the cases you find to know if they actually have anything to do with the topic or issue you're researching. Even though they're not officially part of the court's decision, the summary and head notes can be helpful here by enabling you to quickly skim and determine if a case has enough relevance to your issue to justify reading further.
Keep the hierarchy of courts in mind. A U.S. Supreme Court case is binding on all lower courts, but an appellate court decision is only binding within its own district. Outside of that territory, these cases are referred to as ""persuasive"" authority, meaning a court in another district may consider them is not bound to follow them.
The strongest case you can find to support your argument is one with facts similar to yours that is binding over the courts in the geographic area where your case will be heard. Make sure the holding itself falls in line with the reasoning of your argument.

, Each case in a reporter begins with a series of numbered paragraphs called ""headnotes"" that identify and describe particular topics or rules mentioned in the text of the opinion. You can follow the headnotes that relate directly to the issue you're researching to find other cases.

Keep in mind that the headnotes are created by the editors of the volumes in which the cases are published – they aren't part of the decision itself, but they can help you focus your research.
Each publisher has its own system for organizing headnotes, so you have to stay within the same publisher when you're following headnotes or the numbers won't match up.
For example, if you're using West's reporters and you're researching case law on a property line dispute you have with your neighbor, you might look under the West key number 15, which corresponds to ""adjoining landowners.""
Most print publishers also have their own online case research services, so be careful not to get confused if you're using more than one online service.
For example, the publisher West also operates Westlaw, so the key numbers there are the same as the ones in West's print reporters, but wouldn't match up with the headnotes used by another publisher – either online or in print.
Consider the information in the headnotes to be research assistance, but always read the entire opinion if you think you're going to use it for your argument. The headnotes can sometimes misrepresent the holding of the case, and courts don't consider them authoritative anyway.

, The term ""Shepardize"" comes from the title of the Shepard's Citations volumes, books which list cases decided by a given court along with cross references to every other case that cites that case, and why.

Keep in mind that Shepard's is a particular citator service, which is owned by Lexis. Competing legal publishers such as Bloomberg Law and West have their own citator services that go by different names, but follow the same basic process and lead to similar results.
Technically, you'll want to Shepardize any case you plan to use or reference in legal documents to make sure it's still ""good law."" This means the case is still cited by other courts for that rule or principal, and hasn't been overturned by a later court.
When you Shepardize a case, you look it up in the appropriate volume of Shepard's Citations, and evaluate the stream of cites listed for your case.
If you're using an online database, it typically will have a method to Shepardize the case that will provide you with the same information as if you'd used the print volumes. An online database also often includes a summary of the results that will tell you more immediately if the case is still considered good law.

, Shepard's Citations includes signals that provide information regarding how each citation is related to the initial case you looked up. These signals can help you determine whether the case you've found is still good law.Looking up a case using a citator service helps you ascertain the status of the case and its precedential value –whether it is binding on other courts, and to what extent. You do this by finding out what happened to the case after the decision you found, and how other courts treated the decision once it was published.
For example, if you're reading a case from a federal circuit court of appeals, that case won't have any information on what happened to it afterward. If the losing party appealed to a higher court, and that higher court reversed the lower court decision you read, the case you read is not good law.
However, if the lower court ruling was affirmed on appeal, it's potentially a stronger case. You'll have to read the higher court case to determine if the reasoning was the same.
In the line of citations, look for words or codes used as signals to tell you how the case was treated in the citations that follow. For example, you might see the word (or abbreviation for the word) ""criticized,"" followed by a citation to another case. This tells you that the court in the cited case criticized the holding of the case you read.
If you see any negative treatment of a case you plan to use, you need to read those cases to figure out how they affect your case. If an opinion is roundly criticized by other courts and is never followed, it typically isn't a strong case to cite for that legal principal.

, Once you've found other cases, read through them to learn the state of the law and court interpretation for the issue you're researching. Those cases may in turn lead you to other cases that could be important to your argument.

It is always best to cite published cases. A judge may order a case unpublished for a variety of reasons, but in many cases an unpublished opinion is not seen as binding authority.
If you find an unpublished opinion that you want to cite, check the local rules of the court that issued the opinion to try to figure out why it wasn't published.
Whenever you find a case that you think you want to use, you must go through the same process you did with the first cases you found, in terms of running the citation of the case through a citator service and confirming that it is still good law.

Students who performed well in law school and are taking the Bar exam for the first time, as well as those who failed the Bar previously by only a few points, are the most likely to succeed with a generalized study plan, like a commercial Bar preparation course. Such courses are designed with the needs of the average student in mind.Repeat-takers (especially those who received low scores on past tests) or students who performed poorly in law school should seriously consider an individualized study plan, such as working with a tutor, to address their unique needs. If you are working a full-time job or caring for small children, choose an approach that allows you to maximize your available study time. A traditional Bar preparation course may not be right for you as it typically requires a significant daily time commitment and assigns a broad range of exercises, some of which may not be necessary for your success on the exam. ;
,


The only section of the Bar exam that is the same in nearly every jurisdiction is the MBE, a six-hour 200-question multiple choice exam, which tests the following subjects: Constitutional Law, Civil Procedure, Contracts, Evidence, Real Property, Criminal Law and Procedure and Torts.The subjects tested on the essay portion of the Bar exam are specific to each jurisdiction. For example, New York tests 11 subjects, in addition to those also tested on the MBE, including Administrative Law, Business Relationships, Family Law and UCC Articles 2 and 9while California tests eight state-specific subjects, including Community Property.Some states test practical skills through a section known as the Performance Test. Several, including Texas, New York and Illinois, have adopted the Multistate Performance Test.Others, like California, administer their own version of the performance test.The difficulty of the exam varies dramatically, with California tending to have the lowest passage rate (47.8% in July 2014 ) and other states like, Wisconsin and Minnesota boasting passage rates well above 80%., Students who performed well in law school or failed the Bar exam the first time by only a few points may be a good match for a commercial Bar preparation course. If this is your situation, you will have a plethora of courses from which to choose. In selecting one, pay close attention to the price, format and emphasis of the course to determine whether it is right for you.BarBri (www.barbri.com) provides a comprehensive overview to the entire exam, including the essay, MBE and performance test portions. It is a popular course, but also one of the most expensive, with prices ranges from $3895 in California, New York, Texas and Illinois, $2995 in Wisconsin, Washington and Tennessee and only $1400 in Iowa.PMBR (www.kaptest.com) and AdaptiBar (www.adaptibar.com) are excellent choices for MBE preparation. PMBR is part of the full bar review course offered by Kaptest, a course that is similar to BarBri in terms of scope but slightly cheaper, with prices ranging from around $2000 to $3000 depending on the state.AdaptiBar is an online supplemental Bar prep program that provides only licensed questions from the NCBE and advanced technology that adapts to your individual strengths and weaknesses.AdaptiBar costs $395 for complete access to the website during the months leading up to the exam.LLMBarExam (http://www.llmbarexam.com) is designed specifically for international LLM students preparing for the Bar in New York, California and Texas. The course costs $3450 regardless of the state., Not everyone needs a tutor to pass the Bar exam. However, some test-takers, especially those who graduated near the bottom of their classes in law school or who have already failed the Bar exam, are likely to benefit from the individualized help a tutor can provide.If this is your case, keep these tips in mind in looking for a tutor:


Ask the academic support office at your law school or friends who have had to re-take the Bar exam for tutors they recommend.Interview prospective tutors to determine which would be the best fit for you. Ask them about pricing, their approach to helping students pass the Bar exam and testimonials from other students they have helped.Choose a tutor experienced and sensitive enough to pin-point your particular weaknesses and formulate a study plan that addresses those weaknesses.Choose a tutor you feel you can trust and who will support you, especially if you are studying for the exam after having already failed. , Test-takers who choose to work on their own, and some who work with tutors, will need to obtain their own materials. There are two types of materials you will need: 1) outlines or summaries of black letter law and 2) practice questions for all sections of the exam (i.e. essays, MBE and performance test).For outlines and summaries of black letter law, there is no need to purchase brand new study materials. Borrow them second-hand from friends or buy them on Craigslist, Amazon or Ebay. Look for fairly recent editions, as jurisdictions periodically update the subjects tested on the Bar exam.For practice essay and performance tests, print out questions from past exams free of charge on your jurisdiction's Bar website. Be sure to also print out model answers from the same website so that you have a basis for analyzing how your own answers can be improved.For practice MBE questions, buy or borrow an MBE practice book or supplement your individual study program by enrolling in the online course offered by AdaptiBar (www.adaptibar.com)., If you are studying on your own, you will need to create a schedule that ensures you allocate sufficient time to reviewing and preparing outlines for every subject, taking practice tests and memorizing your outlines.


To determine how many weeks you will need to study for the Bar exam, first identify how many hours you can set aside for studying per week. If you will be studying full-time, then about eight weeks should be sufficient. If, on the other hand, you will only be able to study about ten hours a week, you will need much longer and should plan to start studying several months before the exam.Allow yourself breaks. Avoid burnout by giving yourself time to recuperate from hours of study., The amount of material tested on the Bar exam is so vast that it will not be possible for you to learn it all. If you try to memorize every detail, you will likely learn only a portion of the total material and miss major areas of the law that are critical to passing the exam. If, on the other hand, you focus on learning the overall structure of the law, you will acquire sufficient knowledge to answer the variety of questions that come up on your exam., To ensure you learn only the overall structure of the law, instead of wasting time on tiny details, you will need to simply your study materials by creating succinct outlines for each subject tested.Select one master outline from which to gather material for your outlines. This could be the notes from the lectures at your commercial Bar preparation course or the outline of black letter law that comes with your Bar study materials. Whatever source you choose, make sure it is comprehensive in its coverage of the law.Limit each subject outline to less than ten pages so that it is short enough for you to actually learn.Include only must-know material, such as the rules you will need to analyze specific issues., In addition to having a sufficient knowledge of the law, your success on the Bar exam will depend on your ability to convincingly apply that knowledge in response to tricky essay and multiple choice questions. For this reason, you must set aside ample time for practice questions.Once you have completed an outline for a particular subject, immediately practice individual essay and MBE questions related to that subject. This will guide you in improving your outline by highlighting information that is missing or unclear, while also helping you learn the material in the way in which you will be tested on it.
If the exam given in your jurisdiction includes performance tests, set aside time in your schedule for doing a practice performance test at least once a week.As the date of the Bar exam near, practice full-length Bar exams. It may be a good idea to occasionally take practice exams under less-than-ideal circumstances so that your are better prepared for unexpected problems that may arise during the actual test.Get feedback by comparing your practice essays and performance tests to the model answers. Keep in mind your own answers do not need to be as perfect as the model answers-- you only need to obtain a minimal passing score on each question to pass the exam overall.Practice between 1500 to 3000 MBE questions during your period of study. If you are a week away from taking the test and have not devoted enough time to practice MBE questions, you may be able to catch up by answering between 150 and 300 questions every day through the weekend before the exam., The most common mistake made on essays is to recite boilerplate law at the expense of thoroughly analyzing the facts. Instead, aim to incorporate as many facts as possible into your answer and link each fact to the relevant law. As you practice responding to essay questions, keep these tips in mind:Read the fact pattern very carefully. Make a mark next to each fact (a little box or star).Take quick notes in the margins regarding the major legal issues you spot.
Prepare an outline with a structure based on the major legal issues (i.e. Was Dave negligent?) followed by sub-issues (i.e. Dave's duty, breach of duty, causation, harm).Review each fact you marked and find a way to incorporate it into your outline.Write out your response using the IRAC (issue, rule, analysis, conclusion) formula. State the issue or sub-issue and underline it as a heading in the essay. Follow with a concise rule statement. Then, insert a brief but sufficient analysis that references specific facts from the question. Finally, write a conclusion. Time yourself to make sure you finish within the allotted time.
When you are finished, compare your response to the model answer. Look for legal issues you missed and examples of how you could have boosted your analysis.

, While you will only achieve a true understanding of the subject matter tested by reviewing and applying it repeatedly over a period of several weeks or months, the same is not true for memorization. Most memory experts agree that short-term memory is measured in hours and days, not weeks. For this reason, it is best to wait until the last five to ten days before the exam to memorize the material.Aim to memorize about two subjects per day, starting with the MBE subjects, since these are the areas in which you will need to know the most detail.
Memorize only the most important points for each subject, ideally taken from succinct outlines you prepared while reviewing the material., In most cases, you will have the option of either taking the written portion of the Bar exam on a laptop or responding to the questions by hand. Many test takers prefer to use a laptop because it allows them to write faster and organize their responses more easily by cutting and pasting as they work. It is best to choose the option with which you feel most comfortable, while keeping these factors in mind:The main disadvantage to typing is that your computer could malfunction, causing you to lose precious time and possibly fail the exam. If you know that your laptop is prone to crashes, you should either consider handwriting the exam or borrowing or buying a new laptop.The disadvantages to writing are that your handwriting may not be legible enough for the Bar grader to read, you may be slower at writing than typing and that the amount of writing you do may cause your hand to cramp. If you do choose to handwrite the exam, practice writing continuously for the same increments during which you will have to write when you take the test.If you decide to take the exam on your laptop, load the exam software used in your jurisdiction as soon as possible before the exam date. Test out the software by taking a practice exam to confirm that it works.If handwriting, practice writing with different pens before exam day to find the one that works best for you. Also, allot more time to outlining your responses as it will be difficult to reorganize your response once you have started writing., Many Bar takers choose to stay in a hotel near the test center, even if they live in the same city or metropolitan area, so that they don't have to worry about commuting or arriving late to the test.


If you choose to stay in a hotel, book your room as early as possible. Hotels near test centers tend to book up quickly.If you are concerned about the cost of staying in a hotel, consider saving money by renting a room or apartment through Airbnb., Each jurisdiction has strict rules for taking the exam, including the items that can be brought into the exam room, the times by which applicants must enter the test center and be seated at their desks and the form of ID that one must carry and be ready to show at any time during the exam.


Cell phones, hats, water bottles and digital timers are examples of items that may be prohibited.
Be sure to consider what items you will need during the test (i.e. highlighters, pencils, inhalers, wheelchair) and confirm that you will be permitted to bring them with you on exam day.

, To ensure you stay alert and focused during the exam, it is important that you eat enough before each session to keep you full, while not making you sleepy or moody. Try out different foods before the test to see which work the best for you.If you are staying in a hotel, consider renting a mini refrigerator or taking an ice chest so that you have full control over what you eat rather than relying on the meals offered by the hotel.

, Taking the Bar exam is physically exhausting. It lasts about two to three days and requires that you perform at a high level under stressful circumstances. To ensure that you are physically strong enough to endure the exam, it is important that you take care of your health throughout your study period through regular exercise, sleep and healthy meals.Schedule exercise into your daily routine by committing to work with a trainer or attend yoga classes. This will guarantee you make time for exercise, even when you are feeling overwhelmed or behind in your studies.For optimal mental clarity and performance during the exam and throughout your study period, eat foods that will stabilize your glucose levels, such as healthy fats and proteins. Carbohydrate laden meals will have the unintended consequence of provoking a rise and subsequent crash in your blood sugar that can impair your concentration., The Bar exam is as mentally taxing as it is physically exhausting. Once the exam begins, you will need to be fully present and focused for six hours a day for either two or three days. Long hours of studying and worrying over the outcome of the exam can take their toll on you mentally and emotionally. Preserving your mental clarity and emotional well-being throughout the study period is key to passing the exam.Take study breaks. Allow yourself time to play and do activities that put you at ease.If you notice that your anxiety or fear of failure becomes so paralyzing that it is preventing you from studying, seek out help.Take practice tests under less than ideal circumstances to prepare yourself for distractions during the exam.

, Many students live in fear of failing the Bar exam. This is unnecessary and counterproductive to maintaining the healthy mental and emotional state you will need to perform your best on exam day.


Remind yourself that you are entirely capable of passing this exam. You only need a minimal passing score on each section to pass the exam overall. Even if you have failed before, there is still hope for you to pass if you identify your weaknesses and modify your study plan in a way that allows you to overcome them.
Come to terms with the worst-case scenario. The worst that can happen is you will fail and have to re-take the exam. This would not be the end of the world, nor the end of your career. You will still have the opportunity to pass the exam in the future and practice law in the way that you had hoped. Many intelligent and successful lawyers failed the Bar exam at least once."

The other party's motion will be filed with the court and served on you. The motion will contain various documents including a notice, a memorandum of points and authorities, and a declaration in support of the motion.


The most important document in the motion is the other party's memorandum of points and authorities. This document will lay out their legal basis and arguments that support their motion.
The notice will inform you of the hearing date and the type of motion that is being filed.Read these documents carefully so you know how to respond. Any response you file with the court will need to counter the motion that was served on you.;
, Within the other party's motion will be a memorandum with a table of authorities he or she used to argue their motion. Researching the law in the other party's motion is a great place to start to help you understand what you are up against. Look up the cases and statutes the other party cited to and build your own picture of the law on motions for directed verdicts. When you read the applicable authorities, think about how the other party framed the law and how you might be able to frame it differently.


When you research cases and statutes, you might need to visit a local law library to get access to full cases and accurate statutes. While basic internet searches can be a good start, you will usually need to conduct more in depth research to find the information you need.
In general, the law on motions for directed verdict state that the motion can be granted if the moving party persuades the judge that you failed to present sufficient evidence to meet your burden of proof. In other words, the other party must show that no reasonable juror could reach an outcome favorable to you. When a judge looks at the motion, he or she will make every factual assumption in your favor., Once you have a basic understanding of the law surrounding motions for directed verdict, you need to do some additional research to find court cases and other legal authorities that help your argument that the motion should be denied. Specifically, try to find cases where motions for directed verdict have been denied under circumstances similar to your case. Try to find cases that discuss how narrow the circumstances are in which motions for directed verdict are granted. Apart from court cases, you might also look to statutes, practice guides, or other persuasive material that can help you make your case.


For example, in Michigan, the moving party must present ""specific"" grounds in support of their motion. You might look for cases that define ""specific"" and shed light on just how much support needs to be provided. You might find cases that tell you conclusory arguments do not equate to specific grounds.This sort of information will help you down the road when you draft your response.
If you are having trouble conducting proper legal research, talk with the librarian at your local law library. While they cannot give you legal advice, they can usually help you find what you are looking for. If you are really struggling, you might consider hiring someone to help (e.g., a paralegal, research expert, or lawyer).

, In addition to attacking the other party's motion on its content, you can also attack a motion that is filed improperly. All court motions must be filed in accordance to local rules, which can usually be found on the court's website or by visiting the courthouse in person. In general, motions for directed verdict can be filed after you present your evidence at trial. Additionally, the type of motion the other party is required to file will vary depending on whether they are the plaintiff or defendant and whether you are in criminal or civil court.If the other party files their motion at an improper time or under the wrong legal standards, you can attack the motion by telling the court about these shortcomings.
It is also important to know the local rules as they will tell you when your response must be filed, how long your response can be, what format you must use, what font you must have, and how it must be spaced.If you fail to follow the rules, your opposition might be disregarded.

, Once you have an understanding of the law of motions for directed verdict, you can begin to develop the legal arguments you will use to combat the motion. The arguments you present will be dictated by what the other party has said in their motion. Your job is to defend your position and counter the factual and legal arguments the other party makes. For example:If the other party includes facts you believe aren't true, correct this in your response.
If the other party omits critical facts, state those facts in your response to help create a more complete picture.
If the other party cites to legal authorities you do not think apply to your case, point that out and explain why it doesn't apply.
If the other party applies or analyzes a legal authority in a way you don't agree with, provide your own analysis and apply the law the way you believe is appropriate.

, Your opposition to the motion for directed verdict will contain three distinct documents. The first document, which is the most important, is the memorandum of points and authorities in opposition to the motion. This document includes legal authorities and arguments that support your opposition. It will start with a caption page that identifies the court, the parties, the case number, and the title of the document. Local rules might require you to add additional information to your caption (e.g., the judge's name and hearing information). The title of your memorandum should be: ""Memorandum in Opposition to Motion for Directed Verdict.""Be aware that your caption needs to be formatted in a specific manner. Look for templates from your local court to help you. Caption templates can usually be found online or by asking the court for help.

, Directly following the caption page should be a table of authorities, which is a list of citations to all the legal authorities you relied on in making your arguments. The list should be broken up into separate sections for cases, statutes, and other authorities. Each citation should conform to the legal standard set out in the local rules. Alongside each citation should be the page numbers where each citation is found within your memorandum.


This table of authorities helps the judge understand what legal authorities you are citing to and what types of legal arguments you are making. The table provides the judge with an easy guide should he or she have to look up any of the laws you cite to.

, The introduction of your memorandum in opposition should provide the court with the legal, factual, and procedural background that has led to your opposition being filed. You should include all of the legally relevant facts at this point and those facts should amount to a story about your case. You also want to provide the court with the procedural posture of the case by explaining that the motion for directed verdict was filed and you are now opposing it before the trial continues.


Do not make any of your legal arguments at this point. They will be drafted after the introduction. At this point you simply want to make the court aware of your memorandum and why you are filing it.

, This is the meat of your memorandum. In this section you will create arguments and counter-arguments to help persuade the court that the motion should be denied. Each argument you make should contain appropriate citations to authorities, an explanation of the law, and your persuasive analysis that incorporates important facts. One common way to organize your argument is to state your request, state the law that applies to your request, and apply the law to the facts of your case.You can make as may arguments as you want so long as they are made in good faith and have some basis in law. With that said, try to include only your strongest arguments. Do not worry about making contradictory statements because each argument will be looked at independently by the judge.
When you create your arguments section, place your strongest argument at the beginning. Fill in the middle with your weakest arguments and end on a strong note with another strong argument.

, After your arguments are drafted you need to provide space for signatures and dates.Every party able to appear in court in an official manner who helped you draft your opposition needs a signature space (e.g., you and your attorney). Make sure you include each individual's title next to their signature line.

, In addition to drafting a memorandum, you also need to create a declarations page. A declaration is a sworn statement to the court where you will write all of the facts you relied on to make your arguments opposing the motion. The declaration, like your memorandum, will begin with a caption page. It will contain all of the required information but the title will be changed to something like: ""Declaration in Support of Opposition to Motion for Directed Verdict.""


The body of the declaration will state that you are a party to the case and you declare that you have personal knowledge of the facts. You will then list the facts you used in your memorandum to support your positions.
Be sure to provide a line for your signature at the end of the document., The last document you will need to draft is a proof of service sheet, which requires your server to swear to the court that service was completed in accordance with the law. As usual, the document will start with a caption page with the title, ""Proof of Service."" The body of the document will ask the server to declare that he or she has served the other party properly on all interested parties. At the end, leave space for your server to sign., Once your opposition is drafted, you need to acquire the required signatures before you can serve the other party and file it with the court. These signatures play varying roles but all of them need to be obtained.


The memorandum must be signed by you and your attorney. The signature is used to attest that you have made the legal arguments in good faith and that you have not lied in your memorandum.
The declaration must be signed by you and the signature is used to declare that you have personal knowledge of the facts you laid out in your memorandum.
The proof of service sheet does not need to be signed until your server has completed service.

, Once the appropriate signatures have been obtained, you will need to provide a copy of your opposition to the other party. At this point in the litigation, you can usually serve the other party by having someone over the age of 18 who is unrelated to the case mail a copy of your documents to the other party or their attorney. Do not mail your originals because those must be filed with the court.Remember to get your server's signature once he or she serves the other party.

, Your opposition to the motion for directed verdict must be filed with the court where your trial is currently taking place. To file your documents, take them to the courthouse and hand them to the clerk of courts. Your documents must be filed within a certain time period, which is dictated by the hearing date set by the other party. For example, in the Central District of California, your opposition must be filed at least 21 days before the hearing date.


In addition to filing in a timely manner, you also need to make sure you file the correct amount of copies. some courts do not require copies to be filed while other courts require two or three copies to be filed. In the Central District of California, for example, you must file the originals plus two copies., The other party will usually have an opportunity to reply to your opposition before the hearing date. You usually will not, however, have the opportunity to reply to the reply unless the court gives you permission.If the other party chooses to reply to your opposition, read it carefully before your hearing. This reply will give you great insight into how the other party is going to argue their side during the hearing. The more you understand their arguments and come up with counter-arguments, the better your chances will be of defeating the motion.

, Your original hearing date is the date indicated on the other party's motion for directed verdict. However, the hearing date is often pushed back if you, the other party, or the judge has scheduling problems. Additionally, the judge can usually choose to cancel the hearing if he or she believes they can make a decision based solely on the written documents.If a hearing is scheduled, make sure you arrive at the courthouse early so you have time to park and get through security.


Once inside you will need to find the courtroom where your hearing will be held. Each courtroom usually has a schedule posted outside so you can find your case. If you need help you can always ask courthouse staff for assistance.
Be sure you bring copies of all documents related to the motion in case the other party or the court needs them., When your case is called, go to the front of the courtroom and address the judge. He or she will ask you questions about your opposition memorandum and the arguments you made. Answer the judge's questions completely and concisely. Be extremely polite to the judge and the other party. If the judge is talking, do not interrupt. Be prepared to offer counter-arguments to the other party's arguments or to any points the judge might bring up. Do not get nervous if the judge tries to poke holes in your arguments. Answer the questions as best as possible and move forward., During the hearing, the judge will also ask questions of the other party. While the other party is talking, do not interrupt. If you want to respond to something the other party says, wait until they are finished and then ask the judge if you can respond. Never talk directly to the other party unless you are instructed to do so.


Listen carefully to questions being asked and answers being given. In all likelihood you will be asked similar questions or you will be asked to respond., Once the judge has finished the hearing, he or she will need to make a decision about the motion for directed verdict. In some circumstances, if the judge has a good grasp on the arguments, he or she may make a decision immediately after the hearing while you and the other party are still present. In other circumstances, if the judge needs more time to consider things, he or she will make a decision at a later date. You will then be made aware by mail or by visiting the courthouse.If the judge agrees with your opposition, the motion for directed verdict will be denied and the trial will continue. If, however, the judge grants the other party's motion, the trial (or pieces of it) will be decided in their favor immediately.

Once you receive it, read through the document and look to see why the defendant seeks dismissal. Generally, a defendant seeks to have a case dismissed for the following reasons:You didn’t serve the complaint properly on the defendant.
You haven’t stated a valid legal claim in your complaint. For example, you might have sued a neighbor because they painted their house an ugly color. However, your state probably doesn’t allow you to sue for this reason.
You forgot to allege a required element of a claim. For example, if you sue someone for negligence, you need to allege four elements in your complaint: (1) the defendant owed you a duty of reasonable care, (2) the defendant breached that duty by falling below the standard of care, (3) that breach was the cause of (4) your injuries. If you forgot to allege causation—the third element—then your complaint is defective.
The court doesn’t have power over the defendant (“jurisdiction”) because the defendant lacks sufficient minimum contacts with the state where the case has been filed.
The venue is improper. This means the defendant has insufficient contacts with the county or district where the case was filed.;
, Before sitting down to draft your motion in opposition, you should think about what you want to argue. You are limited in the counterarguments you can make. Basically, you will simply disagree with whatever the defendant claims. For example, you can argue:


You did serve notice on the defendant properly. Find your Proof of Service (or Affidavit of Service).
You have stated a valid legal claim. Go through your complaint and make sure you alleged all necessary elements for the cause of action you have brought.
The court has jurisdiction over the defendant. You will need to point out the “minimum contacts” the defendant has with the state where you brought the lawsuit.
The venue is proper. Venue is proper where the defendant does business there or is a resident., If the defendant argues that service was improper, then you should find your Proof of Service form. Also talk to the person who made service. This person may need to testify at the hearing on the motion to dismiss.


Tell the server when the court hearing is, if you need their attendance.

, To help develop your counterarguments, you need to do some research. For example, the defendant might claim he can’t be sued in your state because he only has a business office in the state but doesn’t live there. You will need to find out whether or not that amount of contact is sufficient “minimum contacts” for jurisdiction.


Get a copy of any court opinion cited by the defendant. You can find court opinions at your nearest law library, which may be at your courthouse or at a law school.
You can also find court opinions on Google Scholar.Click “Case law” and then type in the case citations, e.g. 322 2Fd. 265. Read the cases to make sure the defendant has summarized them accurately.
Also find cases that support your position. You can search Google Scholar. Select the courts you want to research and then create relevant search strings. For example, “minimum contacts business office” is a search string.

, You might feel overwhelmed trying to figure out how to respond to a motion to dismiss. If you need help, or if you have legal questions you need answered, then schedule an appointment with an attorney. Only a qualified attorney can listen to your individual circumstances and offer properly tailored advice.


You can get a referral by contacting your local or state bar association.Once you have a referral, call up the attorney and ask to set up a meeting. Also ask the attorney’s fee and briefly describe your problem.

, Each court or individual judge probably has rules specifically for their court. These rules will often explain what must go into a motion, such as its form, length, content, etc. You need to follow these local rules.You can usually find them on the court’s website or by contacting the judge’s chambers specifically and asking for a copy.
As soon as you get the local rules, read them closely.

, Begin by inserting your caption. The caption contains the name of the court, the names of the parties, the case number, and the judge’s name. You can find this information on the defendant’s motion to dismiss.


Your local rules should contain information about formatting. For example, in many state courts you have to print your motion on “pleading paper.” This is paper which is numbered down the left-hand margin.
You should set the font to 14 point, either Times New Roman or Arial.Remember to title your document. You can title your motion “Plaintiff’s Opposition to Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss” or something similar.

, You can use the first paragraph to briefly explain why you are opposing the motion to dismiss. You should mention that you satisfy the rule of civil procedure regarding complaints. In federal court, this is Rule 8.


A sample introduction could read: “Plaintiff, , hereby submits its opposition to Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss the Complaint. The Plaintiff’s Complaint not only meets but exceeds the standards governing the form of a complaint as required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a). Specifically, this Court has personal jurisdiction over the Defendant, and the complaint sufficiently alleges causation and harm. Accordingly, Defendant’s motion should be denied.”, Your argument will depend on why the defendant is seeking to have the case dismissed. If the defendant believes you haven’t alleged a proper cause of action, then be sure to refer to your complaint and point out where the required information appears. Use the heading “Argument” underlined to set off this portion of the motion.


If the defendant claimed you didn’t allege all elements of a claim, then you could write, “Plaintiff’s complaint properly alleges causation and damages in paragraphs 20 through 23, as well as in paragraph 33 and 36.”If the defendant claims the court doesn’t have jurisdiction, you should explain why the court does: “Defendant’s claim that the court lacks personal jurisdiction also fails. As the Supreme Court has held, a court has personal jurisdiction when a defendant has sufficient ‘minimum contacts’ with the forum state. International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310 (1954). Here, the Defendant maintains an office in this state, from which he performs regular business, which is sufficient for the court to maintain jurisdiction.”

, After the argument, you can insert a brief conclusion. You simply need to request that the court deny the defendant’s motion to dismiss. For example, you could write the following:


“For the foregoing reasons and all the others discussed in Plaintiff’s Complaint, the present Motion to Dismiss should be denied.”, You must send the defendant a copy of your motion before you file it. A certificate of service is how you let the court know that you sent a copy of the motion, as is required by your court’s rules.


A basic certificate of service might read: “I hereby certify that on a copy of the document entitled Plaintiff’s Opposition to Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss was to: .” Then include lines for the date and for your signature.If you file electronically in federal court, then your certificate should read: “I hereby certify that on I will electronically file the foregoing with the Clerk of Court using the CM/ECF system, which will then send a notification of such filing (NEF) to the following: ., You might need to support your motion in opposition with an affidavit.An affidavit is a notarized (“sworn”) statement as to various facts in support of your opposition motion.


For example, you might need to point out that the defendant has a summer home in your county and that he or she spends time there. This affidavit could help you support your argument that the venue is proper or that the court has jurisdiction.
See Write an Affidavit for more information about how to prepare this document.

, Once you have completed the motion, you should assemble it and make several copies. You can file the original with the court clerk. If you are in federal court, then you might file electronically.

, At your hearing, the judge might ask you anything—even questions about the defendant’s motion to dismiss. Accordingly, you need to fully understand the issues in dispute. Sit down and reread all of the motions filed.


After you filed your opposition, the defendant might have filed a “reply” motion. If so, then there are three motions you need to read.
Also go back over your research. Make sure to reread any case you or the defendant rely on.

, If you’ve never argued a motion before, then you should try to watch the judge run a motions hearing. Check the judge’s calendar (which is often online) or contact the court clerk and ask when the judge is holding hearings on the motions.Pay attention to where the parties sit or stand when making their argument.
Also note how much time the judge gives each side. If you find that the judge only wants to hear a couple minutes of argument, then you will know to keep your own remarks brief.
Listen to the questions that the judge asks. Try to come up with answers if the judge asks these same questions of you.

, The defendant will speak first. Listen quietly to his or her arguments. The defendant shouldn’t make any arguments that haven’t been made in the motion to dismiss. If they try to sneak in new arguments, write them down and draw them to the judge’s attention when it is your time to speak: “Your Honor, that’s a new argument that wasn’t made in the motions.”


You should probably respond to the defendant’s arguments in the order they were made unless the judge seems particularly interested in one issue.
Remember to speak clearly and to address the judge as “Your Honor.”When the judge asks a question, be sure to listen quietly. If you don’t know the answer to a question, don’t guess. Always be honest with the judge.

, The defendant might win his or her motion to dismiss. In this situation, you can probably refile the lawsuit if the lawsuit was dismissed “without prejudice.” Be sure to check the following:


Check that the statute of limitations hasn’t expired. For example, you get three years to file a lawsuit for copyright infringement. The clock starts running from the date of the infringement.You can refile your lawsuit so long as the statute of limitations hasn’t expired.
Find what you forgot to allege in your original complaint. The judge might dismiss the lawsuit because you didn’t properly allege a cause of action. Type up a new complaint and include the missing allegations.
Find the correct court to file the lawsuit. If the judge dismisses the lawsuit for lack of jurisdiction, you need to find the correct court to sue in. For example, you may have to file the lawsuit in the county where the defendant lives.
Meet with a lawyer. You might not know what your next steps should be if the case is dismissed. Promptly schedule a meeting with a lawyer. Don’t delay as the statute of limitations clock continues to tick.

Graduate.",How to Obtain a Degree in Criminal Justice," While you may not have this offered at your local high school, ethics are an important of the criminal justice field; you'll be faced with all sorts of situations where you need to make a choice that falls in line with an ethical code.You can start developing your skills by taking a class in criminal ethics or just basic ethics at a local community college.;
, While you don't need a perfect GPA to go into criminal justice, you do need to do well in a wide variety of subjects. Sciences, social sciences, and humanities are all beneficial to those wishing to enter the criminal justice field. Sciences can help when you're analyzing a crime scene, while social sciences help you to analyze the mind of someone you're interviewing. Humanities gives you the background you need to put what's happening in the criminal justice world in context., Critical thinking skills involve being able to interpret, analyze, reason, and evaluate. One way you can begin to develop critical thinking skills is to learn to back up your arguments.For instance, say you want to take a stance on a hot-button issue, such as a flat tax rate or abortion. Don't just make up your mind based on what others have told you. Research the issue, and look at both sides. Pick resources that look at both sides of the issue without making a judgement. Once you've gathered your information, take a stance; you may even find that both sides have merit, and you don't want to pick a side. Now you're able to back up that stance based on what you've gathered.
You can also learn to think critically if you analyze while you're reading. Look for what assumptions the author is basing his or her writing on. Constantly question the assumptions that are made to see if they are valid. For instance, say you're reading an article online that draws conclusions about two things because they happened at the same time, such as the rise in eating aspartame being connected to a rise in brain tumors. While it's possible that the two are linked, the rise in brain tumors could have been caused by a number of other factors.If you're in school, your teachers should be helping you to learn how to think critically. You can help by taking more advanced classes that are more on-par with college courses.

, Many people take computer literacy for granted these days. However, if you haven't kept up with computers as much as you should, take some time to learn. So much of the professions in criminal justice these days are done primarily on the computer that you must learn. Most libraries offer basic classes, and you can always take a class at a community college to increase your skill., You need to be able to talk to people to find out information or to speak to a group of people about a case. Public speaking classes can help you with the second part of that.You also need to know how to read people. When you're talking to witnesses and suspects, you need to be able to interpret body language; maybe they're saying one thing with their mouths, but their body language is saying they aren't being entirely truthful. Psychology classes can help you with body language, but you can also learn to read body language by observing people more closely. When you're out in public, watch how people use their bodies to communicate things that they aren't saying., While this isn't an absolute necessary for all criminal justice jobs, you do need to be physically able to do the job in fields such as law enforcement.Develop a regimen of aerobic exercise, flexibility-increasing exercise, and strength training to get in the shape you need to be. If you're not sure where to get started, join a local gym and take advantage of their classes.

, You can use a database specifically designed for this purpose. For instance, Big Future by The College Board is one option. You have a number of choices to make when deciding on a school.For instance, you'll need to decide whether you want to go to a big public university, a smaller private school, or a community college. Big public universities are cheaper in state than private school, but classes will also be a lot bigger at the public schools. Community colleges are cheap and generally smaller, but you can usually only get an associate's degree, not a bachelor's degree.Decide if you want to go big or small. Even though public universities tend to be bigger than private, that's not always the case. Decide if you want a large, medium, or small school. You'll get more personal attention at a smaller school, but you'll have more opportunities to get involved at a bigger school.You'll also be able to sort by other factors, if they're important to you. For example, you can narrow by how selective a school is, what sports they provide, or how diverse the school is., Most traditional schools, such as state schools and private schools, are nonprofit, meaning the goal is not to make a profit. However, today, many for-profit universities are available, such as Kaplan University, University of Phoenix, and DeVry University. One good thing about for-profits is they offer more flexible options for students, often having more night and weekend classes.Many non-profit universities are accredited by the same organizations as non-profits. For instance, University of Phoenix is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission.However, some for-profits are not accredited, which takes some of the credibility away from your degree.In addition, some employers do not view for-profit degrees in as favorable a light as nonprofit universities.
For-profit universities often cost more than comparable nonprofit schools.For-profits tend to spend less per student on instruction and have substantially lower graduation rates.Nonprofits often have more ""extras"" than for-profits, such as extensive libraries, gyms, and campuses; many for-profits use office buildings for classrooms., Online will offer you more flexibility.However, you may get more out of the experience in person, since you will be able to interact with other students and the professors more without the filter of the internet.

, That is, your top choice may be a long shot, and that's fine. However, you also need to apply to schools that you are more likely to get into. You don't want to miss out on going to school just because you only applied to one or two schools.

, Each school will offer specializations in your field. Decide what's important to you, as that can affect your choice of schools. For instance, Penn State offers a minor in Homeland Security, which could be helpful if you want to go into protective services on the national level., For each school, the application will be a little different. However, you'll always need things like biographical information, your social security, and your GPA.You'll also need a high school transcript, which your school should provide for you.Most schools require letters of recommendation. It's best to ask early. You can ask teachers, coaches, pastors, mentors, or any other non-family adult who knows you well.
You'll also need to write an essay or personal statement. This statement should represent who you are to the college admissions people and why you want to be in this field. Convince them that you belong at the school., Most schools require either the SAT or ACT. Some schools will make you take one or the other, but most will accept either one. Your high school or local library likely has classes available to help you prep for these tests; if not, both tests have websites that provide you with study materials, or you can purchase a study guide in a book form. Most books come with a way to take practice tests online, so that you can practice. If you don't do well, you can retake the exams, but be aware it costs each time., Though it may not be all that beneficial to apply early, it does benefit you to start early. Applications will take longer than you think, so you should leave yourself as much time as possible to finish them.

, Some schools allow you to use what's known as the common application. Essentially, this application is one that you can fill out once and use at as many as 525 schools. Check to see if the schools you're applying to accept this application., It can take awhile to be accepted. In fact, most schools will push it to their final deadline, usually in March or April. You'll likely need to make a decision by early May., At almost any school you go to, you'll need to complete some general education courses, which include classes like composition, western literature, government, economics, and American history. Most of the time, you'll spend at least your first year only doing general education, although you may also start an introduction to criminal justice.Often, you'll get to decide what to take when. However, some schools prescribe exactly what you will take each year with little wiggle room., Most schools have specific courses you must take in your field. For instance, at Penn State, you'll need to take courses such as Criminology, Introduction to Criminal Justice, Policing in America, and Corrections in America., You will be required to take more classes in your field, beyond the ones that are exactly prescribed. In other words, you'll be required to round out your major with classes you are interested in, allowing you to focus on what you want to do even if you don't pick a specialization or your school doesn't offer them. For instance, if you're interested in environmental crimes, you could choose a few classes focused in that area rather than corporate crimes., Most universities also allow you so many hours to take extra classes on whatever you want, in your major or not. You can take classes just for your enjoyment, such as guitar or art. However, you can also use the time to take more major classes or to take classes outside of your major that would benefit you, such as psychology or philosophy classes., You may struggle at first to maintain good grades, but as you shift into the college environment, you should begin to adapt. You'll need to learn good study habits to stay on top of your work. For instance, it's essential to make out a schedule of all the work you have ahead for the semester so you know exactly what you need to do.Try to enjoy what you are studying. It makes a big difference in how much you take in. Always try to find something interesting in everything you're studying.Use what you have. That is, don't be afraid to make up memory games to help you remember what you need to know. You can put what you're studying to song or make crazy acronyms. Also, you can also make study groups to discuss the material and quiz each other.When you're studying, focus on studying. Pick a quiet place where you can weed out distractions, and only have around you what you need to study. Put your phone and any other distractions away.Take good notes in class. One of the best ways to learn the material is to take notes while your professor is talking, as she will likely point out what's most important. Don't try to take down every word; stick to making an outline.

, Once you've put in all the hard work, it's time to graduate from your program. At most schools, you must apply for graduation. The registrar's office will review your transcript to make sure you've completed all the necessary coursework. Usually, you must pay a fee to apply."

Determine if both parties have fully performed the requirements of the contract.,
Base contract fulfillment upon obligations, not upon time.,
Check the contract for a stipulated end date.,
Recognize that contracts can be continued by verbal agreement.,
Put a new contract in writing.,
Look for an existing agreement between the parties.,
Determine if a contract has ended through abandonment.,
Identify a material breach of contract.,
Be realistic about minor breaches of contract.,
Assess whether there has been non-fulfillment of a contingent condition.,
Determine if a contract has been terminated through impossibility.A contract may be terminated if the terms of the contract become impossible to complete, or if it would cause one party an extreme hardship to complete.Common situations in which a party’s performance of a contract is impossible include:



Destruction or unavailability of the subject matter of the contract.,
Identify a contract that should be terminated due to impracticality.,
Identify illegality in a contract.,
Consider other means of terminating a contract.",How to Know when a Contract Comes to an End by Termination," A contract will typically specify what “completion” of the contract requires. The document should define all of the terms of a party’s obligations.


For example, if you entered into a contract stating that you would sell a car to another party for $500 on July 1, 2014, the contract was fulfilled when the exchange of car and money occurred on the specified date. Both parties performed your obligations under the contract when you tendered the car, received the payment, and relinquished ownership of the car.
When the obligations of the contract are fulfilled, the contract is complete. There is nothing further for either of you to do.;
, A contract is completed when both parties have met their obligations, even if the terms estimated a longer completion time than was necessary. For example, you may hire a contractor to repaint your house. The contract may call for him to complete the job within a month, but he actually finishes in two weeks. The painter is not required to continue working for you for the remaining weeks of the month.
The contract is fulfilled once the job is complete and you have paid for the services, even if the completion date is in advance of the original estimate.

, If the contract is supposed to end on a specified date, the contract will terminate on that date.Parties can override the ending date written in a contract. If the parties continue on as though the contract is still in effect, even after the specified termination date, the contract could continue past that date.


For instance, if you subscribe to a monthly magazine for a 12-month term, the contract should end after that period. If, however, you receive a magazine on the 13th and 14th months and take no action to return them or contact the company about the error, the contract will continue. As long as you accept the magazines, and the company keeps sending them, both parties are continuing with the contract, and you will be required to continue paying for the magazines.

, A contract may continue under verbal agreement if you and the other party verbally agree to extend or continue the contract. If the contract has continued under verbal agreement, it may be difficult to determine the new termination date.For example, imagine you contract to employ a tutor for three months. At the end of that period, you and the tutor have a conversation and agree to continue the contract. You have continued the contract under verbal agreement. You could agree upon a new ending date or could agree that either party can terminate the contract at any time.

, Ideally, if you would like to extend a contract, you should do so in writing rather than verbally. You can either complete a new contract for the new term or modify the existing contract to reflect the new end date. Verbal agreements are usually binding, but they can be difficult to prove in court. Having the contract in written form protects all parties., Sometimes parties to a contract will mutually decide to end the contract. If both parties agree without coercion, then the contract may be terminated as of the date of the parties’ agreement.


Such a mutual agreement to end the contract may occur for several reasons. For example, a mutual agreement might be reached if neither party wants what the other party has offered under the contract. Other examples include a situation in which neither party enjoys working with the other party and would like to enter into a contract with someone else, or one where the contract is not profitable for either party.
For example, if you and a business partner contracted to operate a business together, but later both decided to go separate ways, you could mutually agree to terminate your contract.
If one party to the contract forces the other party to agree to the termination using threats or intimidation, the termination will not be valid and the contract will remain in effect.

, Abandonment occurs when neither party completes their obligations under the contract, whether purposefully or inadvertently, by the time the contract specifies. If both parties abandon a contract, the contract is terminated and ceases to have any legal effect.


For instance, imagine you contract with a friend to sell your car for $500 on July 1, 2014, at 10 am. On that day, neither of you show up (you don’t bring the car and your friend doesn’t bring the money). This contract has been abandoned because neither party did what they were supposed to under the contract. It is not termination by mutual agreement because you did not agree together to terminate the contract.
Because abandonment occurs without any express agreement between the parties (unlike a mutual termination agreement), it may be difficult to tell whether the contract has been abandoned.
If one party abandons the contract but the other party does not, the contract will remain in effect and the non-performing party may be liable for breach of contract.

, If one party breaches a contract, the other party may terminate the contract and refuse to abide by its terms.A material breach of contract occurs if one party receives some act, good, performance, or service substantially different from what is specified in the contract. In these cases, the nonbreaching party is justified in terminating the contract because of a breach. She is also entitled to damages or remedies for breach of contract.For example, if you hired a children’s birthday party clown and were sent a Benjamin Franklin impersonator instead, this would be a material breach of contract.
As another example, if you hire a contractor to paint your home, and the contractor shows up one month after the contracted start date, you would be justified in terminating the contract because of the contractor’s material breach.

, A minor breach occurs when one party fails to perform some element of the contract, but the rest of the contract is fulfilled. In the case of minor breach, the nonbreaching party is not permitted to terminate the rest of the contract. In most cases a minor breach does not cause a significant loss, but if the nonbreaching party has some losses, he or she may be eligible to recover damages or remedies.For example, if you hire a contractor who shows up 20 minutes late on the first day, the breach is not serious enough to warrant termination.
If you believe a breach is serious enough to warrant termination, be sure to keep all documents and materials related to the contract and the breach. If the other party tries to fight the termination, calling it a minor breach, you’ll have documentation to support your claim of a major breach.

, The obligations of a contract may be contingent on a particular condition occurring. Conditions may be acts or events.Failure to meet a condition will terminate the parties’ obligations under the contract. If a contingent condition does not occur, the contract is immediately terminated unless the parties affirmatively agree that the condition is excused and that the contract will remain in effect. There are two common types of conditions: conditions precedent and conditions subsequent.A condition precedent means that the contract does not become binding until a contingent act or event occurs.

For example, many home sale contracts include a contingent condition that the sale will not be finalized until the house passes a building inspection. If the house does not pass the building inspection, the contract of sale is terminated.A condition subsequent means that a previously binding contract will end upon the occurrence (or non-occurrence) of the contingent act or event.

For example, an employer hires an employee with the condition that the employee finish college and get her degree within six months of her hire date. If the employee does not finish college and get her degree within six months, the contract is terminated.



, For example, if you hire someone to paint your house and your house burns down, the subject matter of the contract (the house) is destroyed and the contract is impossible. The contract is thus terminated.

Death or incapacitating illness. If one of the parties to the contract suffers death or an incapacitating illness (physical or mental), the contract may be terminated.

Supervening illegality. Supervening illegality occurs if a contract is legal when entered into, but a subsequent change in the law has made its performance illegal. For example, imagine that you are a farmer who has contracted to sell your carrots to your local supermarket. If your city passes a law that makes the sale of local produce to supermarkets illegal, your contract is terminated because you can no longer legally complete the terms., A contract can be terminated if the performance of the obligation has become highly impractical or difficult by the occurrence of events that were not caused by an involved party. For example, if a book publisher goes out of business, it is impossible for them to continue publishing books. Therefore, the contracts they currently have with writers may be terminated.

, In some cases, a “defense of illegality” may be used as a defense against breach of contract suits.A contract that requires one or more parties to do something illegal is void. This is different from some other types of termination, because the court considers the contract to never have existed. Neither party is entitled to damages or remedy if one party breaches the contract.For example, if you contract to hire a poker dealer to run a game in a state where gambling is not legal, the contract is void because the service cannot legally be performed.

, In addition to the situations listed above, there are other circumstances that could enable a party to terminate a contract. Some have to do with whether the contract was legally enforceable to begin with. Some situations which may lead to contract termination include:



Fraudulent misrepresentation. If the content or execution of the contract was misrepresented (lied about) in order to defraud (trick or mislead) the other party, you can terminate the contract.

For example, if you enter a contract to sell your car to another person but you know that the car does not run and you do not disclose that information in the contract, you have committed fraudulent misrepresentation and the contract may be thrown out.



Duress. If one of the parties to the contract was forced to enter the contract against her will, the contract is void and may be terminated.

For example, if someone is blackmailed or threatened into signing a contract, the contract will not hold up in court.



Undue Influence. If one of the parties to the contract has considerable influence over the other party, the contract may not have been entered into fairly.

For example, a person who enters into a contract unrelated to the workplace with her boss may have experienced undue influence and felt as though she did not have an option about the contract.

Graduate with a law degree.",How to Obtain a Law Degree," In almost every state, a four-year bachelor's degree is required to gain admittance into law school. However, in Michigan for example, you can attend law school so long as you have completed a certain number of college credits from a four-year institution, or have obtained an associates degree.In every state where a bachelor's degree is required, go to school and major in anything you are interested in. Law schools do not require you to have any particular focus.


With that said, a lot of law students will have obtained a bachelor's degree in political science, business, or government to help them with their legal studies.;
, While you are in college, meet with the prelaw advisor on your campus. These advisors will help you plan for success in college and help you make the best impressions for law schools as possible. Advisors will keep you up-to-date on law school visits and will help you through the application process.To meet with an advisor, visit your career services department and ask if they have any prelaw personnel that can help you.
When you meet with an advisor, ask them to honestly assess the legal profession. While a law degree can be rewarding, a lot of people end up leaving the profession within ten years of entering the legal field. Law is not for everyone.
The decision to go to law school should not be taken lightly and you should make sure you do your research before making the decision. Your prelaw advisor can help you with this.

, One of the things law schools will look at during the application process is your grades as an undergraduate student. In particular, your undergraduate grade point average (GPA) will play a large role in where you will be accepted into law school. Therefore, it is incredibly important to focus during your undergraduate years and get the best grades you can.


You can do this by going to class, studying for exams, and getting help from professors when you need it.

, Another part of the law school admissions process is getting letters of recommendation. In order to get these letters, you will need to build relationships with professors and other community members while you are in school. The more you know these people, the more likely it is they will write you a letter of recommendation when you need it. Visit your professor during office hours, talk about your goal of going to law school, and let them know you are interested in doing well in their classes.


In addition to building these relationships for the purpose of getting letters of recommendation, you should also do so for the purpose of professional development. Your professors and community members may help you get internships, jobs, and experience both while in school and when you have graduated.

, After obtaining your bachelor's degree, you need to set up an LSAC account, which is the online service you will use for everything from registering for the LSAT to applying to law schools. To create an LSAC account, visit the LSAC website. Click on the ""Future JD Students"" link and click ""Create an Account"".From there you will need to provide LSAC with your:Personal information
Permanent address
Citizenship status
Contact information
Bachelor's degree information
Account information (e.g., a username and password)

, The LSAT is standardized test meant to measure your reading and verbal reasoning skills.It is required for admission to almost every accredited law school in the United States. Log-in to your newly created LSAC account and click on the link to register for the LSAT. You will be able to choose from about four annual test dates (usually in February, June, September, and December).Pick the test date that best suits your schedule.


When you register for the test, you will have to pay a fee. As of 2016, the fee for registering is $180. The LSAC website accepts most major credit cards.If you are absolutely unable to pay the fee to take the LSAT, you can ask for a fee waiver from LSAC., To be successful, you need to prepare for what you will encounter on test day. The LSAT consists of five 35-minute multiple choice sections. Different sections will assess different skills, which include your reading comprehension, analytical reasoning, and logical reasoning. There is also an un-scored 35 minute writing sample administered at the end of the test.To study properly, consider taking a commercial preparation class online or in-person. These classes will help you learn the material, deal with the time constraints, and offer test taking tips.
If you cannot afford to pay for a commercial class, at least take a few practice tests under actual time constraints. You can find practice tests on the LSAC website., Your LSAT Admission Ticket, which is sent to you once you successfully register for the test, will have all of the information you need for the day of your test. On that day, arrive at your testing location early. Dress comfortably, in layers, so you are able to take off or add clothing depending on the room's temperature. Make sure you bring your admission ticket, pencils, and photo identification. Use the restroom before you enter the testing room. Plan on being around the testing facility for about seven hours on the day of your test.When you start your test, stay calm and remember all of the preparation you did. Listen to the proctor's directions and answer each question to the best of your ability. There is no deduction for answering questions incorrectly.

, Your test scores will be emailed to you about three weeks after you take the test.When you receive your LSAT results, your score will range from 120 to 180. Your results will also give you a percentile rank, which shows you what percentage of people scored lower than you. A satisfactory test score will depend on what law school you want to go to and what score you think you are capable of getting. For example, a prestigious law school might look for an LSAT score above 170 while a lower tier law school might accept a 150.


Before retaking the test, make sure you understand how law schools assess multiple test scores. Some law schools might only look at your highest test score while others might average your scores. If you want to go to a school that averages your test scores, you need to think carefully about taking the test again., CAS, which is a service offered by LSAC, is the program you will use to apply to every American Bar Association (ABA) accredited law school in the United States. Instead of sending individual law school applications to every law school, CAS allows you to send your application materials to LSAC once, and CAS will distribute the materials to the schools of your choice.


As of 2016, the cost of the CAS service is $175. Once you pay your CAS fee, your account will remain active for five years., Once you pay for CAS, log-in to your LSAC account and check to make sure your LSAT scores are on file. Having a reportable score is generally a prerequisite to applying to any law school., Have every undergraduate and graduate institution send LSAC a separate, official transcript on your behalf. LSAC must receive your transcripts directly. No transcript that was sent to you first will be accepted. You will request transcripts by using your LSAC account. After you log-in, click on the ""Add or Submit Institutions"" button under the CAS heading. Once you add information about each institution you need a transcript from, click ""Continue"" and ""Confirm"". You will then be able to visit the transcripts page of your account and fill out a transcript request form, which will be sent to your school.


Most of your schools will charge you to send a transcript.
LSAC will usually process your transcript within two weeks of receiving them., After all of your transcripts have been processed by LSAC, view your Academic Summary Report and make sure all of the information is complete and accurate. This information will be sent to the law schools you apply to., Use the connections you gained while in college to get professors and work supervisors to write letters of recommendation on your behalf. Ask them early in the process so they have enough time to create an effective letter. Tell the people you are asking that the letters should reflect your academic, personal, or professional achievements and your potential with candor, detail, and objectivity. If possible, your letters should compare you to your peers.


When you ask someone to write you a letter of recommendation, make sure you tell them how to submit it. In general, you will ask them to submit their letters directly to LSAC. You can find the address and other information on your LSAC account., Most law schools will ask you to submit a a short writing sample on a subject of your choosing (most often why you want to go to law school).However, if the law schools you plan on applying to have different requirements, make sure you follow them. For example, if they want you to write on a particular subject, or if they have a word limit, make sure you know about these things.

, Begin your search as broadly as possible and look at any law school you think you might be interested in. At this point, find law schools in different states and different part of the country. Do not limit yourself early on. You can gather information about law schools by:


Visiting their individual websites
Visiting your prelaw advisor
Conducting internet searches
Looking through resources on LSAC's website
Downloading publications (e.g., U.S. News, Princeton Review)

, Most law schools will feed lawyers into the local markets. Therefore, if you attend school in Boston, Massachusetts, chances are you will end up getting a job there as well. This is especially true for public institutions. When you are looking at schools, think about where you want to work.

However, this might not be the case if you end up going to a highly ranked law school (e.g., Harvard or Yale). If you attend some of these schools, you may be able to obtain jobs on a national level based on the school you attended.

, Law school forums, presented by LSAC, allow you to talk with between 150 and 185 law schools, in-person, depending on where your forum is located.When you attend a forum, you can ask questions about finances, admissions standards, and the application process. You might also be able to talk with practicing attorneys about their law school experience.


These events are free to attend and you can register directly with LSAC., By signing up with CRS, you allow LSAC to distribute your credentials to different law schools, agencies, and individuals in the legal community. By using this service, you can have law schools recruit you based on your LSAT scores, GPA, or personal background.


It is free to sign up and you can do so through your LSAC account., Once you have a large list of potential schools, you need to start narrowing that list down. The first step in this process is crossing off all the schools that are not accredited by the ABA. While it is possible to obtain a JD from a non-accredited school, it is very difficult to sit for the bar exam, become licensed to practice, and get a job after graduation. If you want to be a lawyer, you need to go to an ABA accredited school.


You can find a complete list of accredited law schools by visiting the ABA website.Cross-reference the ABA list with your list and cross of any school that is not on the ABA list.

, Due to the decline in law school admissions as of 2016, a lot of law schools are not bringing in the cash they once did. As a result, a lot of schools are running into serious financial problems. You need to do research and make sure the school you are looking at is still viable long-term.

Start by looking at the U.S. Department of Education's Financial Responsibility Composite Scores. These are scores given to private and proprietary schools (i.e., not public schools) that gauge the financial health of the institution.You can also look at the enrollment history of each school over the past 10 or 15 years. If enrollment has dropped drastically over that time, it may be an indication that the school is not in good financial health. If you see this, it may mean that some of the programs you are interested in might be underfunded and could disappear.

, Next, narrow your list by finding the schools with admissions statistics that most closely fit your credentials. You can find these statistics on the LSAC website. You will be able to search each law school to determine what the average undergraduate GPA and LSAT score was for admitted students. Your GPA and LSAT score should be close to that average if you want to apply.


However, you should also apply to a couple of ""reach"" schools and a couple of ""safety"" schools. Due to declining enrollments, ""reach"" schools may currently be easier to get into than they once were. Take this into consideration when applying.
Reach schools are schools you would like to go to but you may not have a high enough LSAT score or GPA to compete. You should apply to a couple of these schools because your GPA and LSAT score are not the only things schools look it. You might surprisingly get accepted if you have an outstanding personal statement or letters of recommendation.
Safety schools are schools you apply to where you have a high chance of being accepted. Look for schools where you exceed the average GPA and LSAT score.

, To further refine your list, look for schools on your list that have highly ranked, national programs and specialty programs you would like to take advantage of. While a lot of law schools will tell you not to focus on rankings, the fact is they are important. Law school rankings are published every year by U.S. News and World Reports. Try to apply to schools that rank in the top 100. Additionally, U.S. News and World Reports ranks school specialties as well. Find schools that have highly ranked programs that you would like to be a part of.


For example, if you are interested in environmental law, look for schools with great environmental programs. If you are interested in legal research and writing, find schools that rank highly there.

, To narrow your list again, look at the schools remaining on your list and determine their graduate bar passage rate and rate of employment. At the end of the day, if you want to be a lawyer, you want to go to a school that prepares you to sit for and pass the bar exam. Additionally, you want to find a school that will help you get employed.


These statistics can be found on the ABA's website.As of late 2016, the legal job market is still a mess. While it seems to be improving, there are still a lot of graduates who are unable to find jobs.Some schools have even created legal clinic programs for recent graduates. Before you choose a school, make sure you look into their ability to place graduates in paid legal positions.

, Some law schools cost more than others and the amount you pay for your education will depend on the school's affiliation (i.e., a public vs. a private institution), the school's reputation, and the school's location. On average, law school graduates take on about $100,000 in debt.In a lot of cases, graduates can have well over $175,000 in student loans. Therefore, you need to consider how much you can afford.

In addition to thinking about the cost of attendance, you also need to consider if that cost justifies the degree. For example, as of 2014, the average law school graduate has a starting salary of less than $62,000 per year (if they can even find a job). If you are making that amount of money, it will be difficult to ever pay off your student debts., Your final list can be as big or small as you want it to be. It is usually recommended that you apply to about ten schools. Once you have your final list, log-in to your LSAC account and send applications to each of the schools you have chosen. When you apply, the law school will request your package from LSAC. You will also have to pay an application fee for each school you apply to. The fee usually ranges from $50 to $100. Some schools will waive this fee if you ask.


When you apply, LSAC will send your LSAST score, transcripts, personal statement, letters of recommendation, and your application., As you continue to apply, keep track of everything you are doing through your LSAC account. There you will be able to see what applications have gone through and whether you need to take any additional action to complete others. Visit your account daily to make sure you are completing all of the necessary steps., As your applications are processed, you will receive decisions from the law schools. Some law schools will accept you, others will put you on a wait list, and others will deny your application. Disregard the schools that deny your application and focus on the schools that have accepted or wait listed you. If you want to attend a school that has wait listed you, contact them and ask about their process for getting accepted. In most cases, you will have to wait until accepted applicants accept or reject the school’s offer.


When the process is done, choose to attend the law school that best fits your needs. You should consider, among other things, the program you want to be a part of, the school’s rankings, and the financial burden you will incur.

, Once you accept a law school’s offer of attendance, you will need to work with the school to determine if you are eligible for financial aid. Tuition can be as much as $60,000 at some schools, and if you are taking out loans, you may have to take out more than that to pay for living expenses. In a lot of cases, you can graduate from law school with as much as $200,000 in debt.


To help lessen your financial burden, ask the school about scholarship and grant opportunities. If available, these opportunities will lessen he amount of money you have to borrow and pay back.
You can also ask about establishing residency if you are going to a public school. In most cases, in-state students receive cheaper tuition than out-of-state students.

, Law school can be a shock for some individuals that are not used to the rigorous routine you will undertake. Make sure you understand the focus and organization you will need to succeed. Work to create a manageable routine and study habit to give yourself the best chance at success.


Even before your first day of class, eat well, exercise, and read daily. Get your mind and body prepared for the task ahead., Unlike some college courses, attendance in law school is extremely important. Professors will expand on ideas in your reading, ask you questions, and interact in order to help you learn. If you miss class, it will be tough to pass exams. To get the most out of class, participate when you can and pay attention. Take complete notes and review them weekly.


Before each class, make sure you complete the required reading. If you do not, you will not know what is going on during class time.
After each class, review your notes and create an outline. These things will help you when it comes time to study for the exams., The law school experience can be daunting, but it can also be enjoyable. Law schools offer a number of things you can get involved in. For example, you might choose to take part in moot court or law review. You might join a law group and get involved in your community. Not only will these things help you after graduation, they will also help you during law school.


It is in these groups that you will meet friends, get help studying, and get away from the stress of school.

, Most law school grades are based solely on one or two exams. These exams are usually three or four hours long and consist of multiple choice and essay questions. To be successful, you need to prepare and study throughout the semester, not just the week before the exam. To prepare for exams, go through your class notes weekly and condense them into an outline. Include information as you go along. In the last month of the semester, spend some time each week reading through your outlines to start getting in the exam mindset.On the day of your exams, get to class early and come prepared. Do not stress out and answer the questions to the best of your ability.

, Most JD programs last three years. However, some law schools offer part-time programs as well as accelerated programs. Once you complete the required number of credits, you will be able to graduate with a law degree.

Find the facts and statistics.",How to Identify Inartistic Proofs," Rhetoric, in this particular context, is communication that is meant to persuade. The idea of rhetoric was created in ancient Greece when the rise of democracies meant citizens needed a way to participate in government., If you have an understanding of rhetoric you can begin to construct and deconstruct people's arguments, which will lead to more critical thinking and more informed decision making.


If you understand rhetoric, you will be able to create persuasive arguments by arranging words and facts together while thinking critically about your audience.
Apart from creating persuasive arguments, having an understanding of rhetoric will give you the ability to deconstruct and analyze other people's arguments. When someone is trying to persuade you, you will be able to dig deeper, think critically, and analyze the strength of their rhetoric., In today's world, rhetoric is all around you and takes many forms. For example, political communication (e.g. political debates, speeches, and advertisements) can be considered rhetoric because it is an argument meant to persuade you to vote a certain way. Another example could be marketing communication (e.g., television commercials, magazine commercials, billboards, etc.), which are arguments meant to persuade you to buy something.If you can recognize and understand the rhetoric around you in today's world, you will be able to think critically about what is being said in order to make informed decisions.

, Rhetoric generally contains two types of ""proofs"", which is another word for an appeal or argument. The first type of proof is the artistic proof. Artistic proofs are invented and crafted by you, the author of the rhetoric.They appeal to emotions and logic but do not necessarily contain facts or statistics.

, On the other hand, the second type of proof, inartistic proofs, includes anything factual and pre-existing that you can use to bolster and enhance your rhetoric. Unlike artistic proofs, inartistic proofs are not created but are found.Inartistic proofs include laws, contracts, expert testimony, oaths, witnesses, statistics, and any other form of data.

, A complete argument emerges when you combine artistic and inartistic proofs. In order to identify inartistic proofs, it is first necessary to understand the distinction between them and artistic proofs. Without an understanding of that distinction, telling the difference between artistic and inartistic proofs may prove difficult.

, To help you grasp the idea of rhetoric and inartistic proofs, it is important to understand how to construct a complete argument. In doing so, you will learn how to find inartistic proofs and incorporate them into rhetoric. Once you know how to construct an argument, you will be able to deconstruct one for the purpose of identifying the inartistic proofs within it.

, Once you know what rhetoric is and how it is used today, you can start creating arguments using specific pieces of information. To start, you will create a series of artistic proofs that will be the base of your rhetoric. They are created by you and should combine good logic and appropriate appeals to passion, and should emphasize your trustworthiness.Artistic proofs take three main forms, all of which should be included in a complete argument:



Logos, which are appeals to reason and logic. An example of a logos artistic proof may look something like this: We do not have enough money to pay for improvements to our roads. Without these improvements, our transportation systems will falter and our economy will suffer. Therefore, we should raise taxes in order to improve our roads.In this example, you are appealing to reason and logic. If good roads are necessary to the economy, and if there is not enough money to fix the bad roads, then money should be raised in order to help fix the bad roads.



Pathos, which are appeals to the emotions of your audience. An example of a pathos artistic proof might read: John Doe wants to hurt students by raising interest rates on educational loans.

In this example, you are making an appeal to the emotions of your audience. By telling your audience John Doe wants to hurt students, you are stirring their emotions and causing them to feel angry, sad, and possibly resentment.Ethos, which are appeals to the credibility of yourself, the speaker.An example of an ethos artistic proof may take the following form: I am a husband, father, and taxpayer. I have served in Congress for 20 years. I deserve your vote for reelection.

As you can see, this type of argument attempts to persuade by calling attention to your own character., You should include inartistic proofs alongside artistic ones. The inartistic proofs you use can take the form of laws, contracts, expert testimony, oaths, witnesses, statistics, and any other form of data.

, One form of an inartistic proof is a statistic. An example of a statistical inartistic proof is: ""88% of political advertising in the 2012 election has been spent creating negative ads."", Another form of an inartistic proof is a law. An example of a law related inartistic proof is: Under federal law, the punishment for first degree murder is life in prison.

, If you are creating an argument in part based on the terms of a contract, you can use those terms as an inartistic proof. For example, you might say: Under the contract, the price of the vehicle is $10,000.

, Once you have created a number of persuasive artistic proofs and backed them up with inartistic proofs, you will combine all of your proofs to create a persuasive argument (i.e., rhetoric).


A complete argument looks like this: Presidential candidates have spent over $2 billion so far during the 2012 election cycle. Having researched and sponsored a bill in Congress regarding campaign spending, I have a unique perspective on this issue. Taxpayer money should be from political campaigns and should be used for more important things like educating our children so America doesn't fall behind in the world., If you are trying to analyze an argument and find inartistic proofs, you will start by deconstructing the entire argument. To do this, you will separate the argument into its' individual sentences. When you read the argument, you may find that even individual sentences contain multiple types of proofs. If this is the case, separate the argument even more.

, Once you have deconstructed the rhetoric into its' individual parts, you can begin to analyze the argument piece by piece. When you do this, try and set all of the artistic proofs aside. Then you can begin to analyze all of the artistic proofs in order to identify the different kinds that are present (i.e., ethos, logos, pathos).


For example, if you break apart a complete argument, you might find the following types of proofs:

An ethos artistic proof when the argument states: ""Having researched and sponsored a bill in Congress regarding campaign spending, I have a unique perspective on this issue.""
A logos artistic proof when the argument states: ""Taxpayer money should be from political campaigns and should be used for more important things like educating our children...""
A pathos artistic proof when the argument states: ""...so America doesn't fall behind in the world.""


As you can see, arguments will contain various types of artistic proofs and some single sentences may contain more than one type of proof. Look for these things when you are identifying artistic proofs.

, Once you have identified all the artistic proofs, you should be left with a series of inartistic proofs. To check your work, analyze the sentences you are left with and make sure they all contain factual and statistical arguments. If they do, you have identified your inartistic proofs.


For example, once you have identified all the artistic proofs in an argument, you may be left with an inartistic proof stating: ""Presidential candidates have spent over $2 billion so far during the 2012 election cycle.""

As you can see, this argument is an inartistic proof because it contains an appeal to facts and statistics.

Forms also may be available at the websites of state legal aid societies.
Paper forms typically are available at the clerk's offices of individual courts.;
, You must use the correct size paper with the correct margins for all court documents.


You typically can find these state or local rules on the court's website. The rules also may have a sample or document template that you can use as a guide.Generally, you should use standard 8.5 x 11 white paper with one-inch margins all the way around.Some courts may have different margin specifications for the first page.
Some courts may require you to use a special ""pleading paper,"" which contains line numbers down the left-hand side. Most word processing applications such as Microsoft Word have pleading paper templates you can use.Set up your footer to print consecutive page numbers at the bottom of each page.Use a common font such as Times New Roman or Arial in a 12-point size, and double-space your text. Make sure you're set to print your document using black ink., Your caption identifies the case to which your document applies, and must be identical to the caption for the complaint in the case.


The caption includes the court name and location, the names of the parties in the case, and the case or file number assigned by the court.You also can copy the format of the caption on the complaint so everything is in the right place on the page.

, At the top of your motion you must include a title that identifies the purpose of the document for the court.


The title can be as simple as ""Defendant's Motion to Dismiss"" or can include the reason you want the court to dismiss the case, such as ""Defendant's Motion to Dismiss for Failure to State a Claim.""Traditionally, the title is centered on the page in all caps. It also may be bolded or underlined. Check the court's rules or look at other documents filed in the same court to get a sense of the style that court uses., Your signature block gives you space to sign your motion and provides your legal name and contact information.


Typically you want to leave about four lines, or two double-spaced lines, for your signature. Make a solid black line to sign, then type your name directly below the line.Under your name, you should type your address. You also may want to include your phone number and your email address.Your signature block also should include a line and space for you to write the date on which you signed the motion., Depending on the court, you may need to attach other documents such as a certificate of service or a notice of hearing. These forms generally are available in the clerk's office.


If you've found a packet of court-approved forms to use for your motion to dismiss, any additional documents should be included.Certificates of service and notices of hearing always use the same format, but you'll have to put in the name and address of the other party, as well as your own name and address.Leave the date and time of the hearing on the notice blank. The clerk of court will fill those in when the hearing is scheduled., You must have sufficient legal grounds to request that the judge dismiss the complaint against you.


In most cases, if you're early in the proceedings, your motion to dismiss will be for procedural reasons such as a lack of jurisdiction. Your state's rules of civil procedure will determine which of these reasons applies to your case.You typically can access these rules by going to the website for your state court system. Specific court websites often have information about jurisdiction as well.
Keep in mind that some reasons for dismissing a lawsuit must be mentioned in your first filing with the court, or the court will consider them waived.For more substantive grounds, you must look at the law that governs the plaintiff's claim. For example, if you were in a car accident, you should look at your state's personal injury law. That law will list all the elements the plaintiff must prove to state a valid claim against you. If he or she has failed to include one or more of those elements in the complaint, you have grounds to request that the judge dismiss the case.
It also may be that the complaint lists something for which there is no legal remedy. For example, suppose your neighbor sued you because you didn't say ""good morning"" to him when he passed by your house as you were sitting on the porch. Since there's no law requiring you to say ""good morning"" to your neighbor, your neighbor's complaint fails to state a claim for which the court can award him damages.If the legal research becomes too intense, you might consider hiring an attorney to research and draft your motion for you. In most states you can hire an attorney to perform unbundled legal services, through which he or she will conduct your research or draft your motion without taking you on as a client for full-scale representation., The first lines of your motion should state your name and role in the case, and what you are asking the judge to do.


Traditionally, the first line begins ""Comes now the defendant,"" followed by your name. Then you state that you're asking the court to dismiss the plaintiff's complaint.After this, you can write a line such as ""In support of its motion, Defendant states as follows."" The body of your motion then continues in paragraph form as you lay out the reasons you believe the complaint should be dismissed., Using the information you've gathered from your research, tell the judge the reasons the complaint is legally or procedurally insufficient and should be dismissed.


If you're using a procedural rule, you may want to reference the rule of procedure that the complaint violates. If your argument is that the complaint fails to state a claim, you should refer to the applicable law if possible.Some forms may include a list of reasons, and you simply have to check off the ones that apply in your case. Make sure you read each of these reasons carefully and mark each one that applies., Once you've finished listing the reasons the complaint should be dismissed, you end your motion by asking the judge to dismiss the case.


Typically the closing would say something like ""For the foregoing reasons, the defendant respectfully requests the court dismiss the complaint in this case."", If you have any documentation that supports your motion, you should attach it to the motion and submit it to the court.If your motion to dismiss is supported by an affidavit, it should be sworn under oath and signed before a notary public.For example, if your landlord has sued you for failure to pay your rent, but you've already paid it, you might include a copy of the cancelled check or a receipt from your landlord as evidence that the rent was paid., Some jurisdictions may require you to sign your motion or other documents in front of a notary public.


After you've signed and notarized your paperwork, make at least two copies of everything you plan to file with the court. You will need one copy for your own records and one for the other party in the case. The court will keep the originals., You must file your motion with the clerk of the court where the case was originally filed.You will have a deadline by which you must file your motion, particularly if it is the first thing you've filed in the case. This deadline typically is about 20 calendar days from the day you are served with the complaint and summons.You can find the deadline by looking at the summons you received, or by calling the clerk's office. Get this deadline as soon as possible after you are served and write it down so you can make sure you don't miss it.
You will have to pay a fee to file your motion with the court. This fee varies among jurisdictions and based on whether the motion is the first thing you've filed in the case. The fee for your first filing may be several hundred dollars, while the fee for a later motion is less than a hundred.If you don't think you can afford the filing fees, you can apply with the court to have the fees waived. You will have to disclose details about your income and assets, which the court will compare to a set minimum threshold. If your finances fall below that threshold, you typically will qualify to have the fees waived., Once you've filed your motion, the other party must have notice of the action you've asked the judge to take.


You may choose personal service, in which you get a sheriff's deputy or private process server to hand-deliver the motion to the other party. Typically, though, you also have the option to mail the motion using certified mail with returned receipt requested.If you have the option of using certified mail, keep in mind that typically will be the easiest and most cost-effective way for you to complete service.

, The other party has a period of time before the hearing to respond to your motion.


In some jurisdictions, the party has a certain number of days after they are served with your motion to respond. This deadline may be extended if you served them by mailing the motion rather than hand-delivering it using a sheriff's deputy or other process server.This period also may defined with reference to the date of the hearing. If the other side is going to respond to your motion, it must be filed and served within a certain number of days before the hearing is set. For example, if the lawsuit was filed in federal court, the plaintiff must file and serve a response to your motion to dismiss no later than 21 days before the date the hearing of the motion is scheduled., The judge will hear arguments from both sides regarding your motion to dismiss in open court and make his or her decision based on the evidence presented.


While you can begin your preparation before you receive a response from the other side, if you do receive a response you should use that to finesse your argument. Knowing how the other side plans to oppose your argument means you can address the points they plan to make.
Organize the paperwork you've filed as well as any other documents you plan to present to the court to support your claim that the case should be dismissed.
Write out an outline to plan what you will say to the judge to present your case. Focus on the facts in the case that support dismissal.

Some courts offer forms or templates you can use specifically for an interpleader.For example, the federal district courts have a copy of a fillable document that you can download and complete to file an interpleader without an attorney.
Even if you're filing in state court, you can use this document as a guide for the information that will be required. However, keep in mind that the jurisdictional issues will differ in state court.
You also can review your state's rules of civil procedure to find a general outline of the information that must be included in an interpleader complaint.;
, Given the complexity of an interpleader and the issues at stake, it typically is in your best interests to hire an attorney to represent you. Under federal law and the law of most states, you are entitled to reasonable attorney's fees and court costs if you are successful.Search for an attorney who has experience filing interpleader complaints on behalf of clients in situations similar to yours.
You also want to make sure any attorney you hire has experience dealing with cases that involve the underlying dispute over the money or property at stake.
For example, if you're holding property in trust for several individuals who all claim they have a complete right to it, you want an attorney with experience in property law as well.
Generally, when you file an interpleader you're saying that you fear several parties will come after you for the money or property, and since you don't have any underlying interest in it yourself, you shouldn't be involved in the dispute.
An attorney with experience in that type of dispute can evaluate your interests and position and advise you on the risk of suit you face and the liability issues for you personally.

, Your complaint must include facts about the adverse claims to the money or property you have in your possession, and you must include all parties who are claiming the money or property or have an interest in it.You need to have sufficient information for each of the individuals or businesses that hold a claim to the money or property in your possession that they can be properly named as defendants and served with your complaint.
Since by the act of filing an interpleader you are asserting that you fear multiple liability because of these conflicting claims against the property or money in your possession, you must present facts that indicate at least two of the defendants you name have come after you in some way or made a demand for the money or property.
If any of the defendants you name have filed a lawsuit seeking the money or property you hold, you should get copies of the complaint and other pleadings in that lawsuit so you can include those facts in your interpleader complaint.

, Either on your own or with your attorney, you must create a complaint and all other documents required by the court to initiate a civil lawsuit, such as summons, notice and service forms.In some courts, you must file a complaint as well as a motion for interlocutory judgement. The motion asks the judge to make an initial ruling on whether the interpleader is rightfully with the court.
Ask the clerk for some samples of interpleader documents from other cases and read the court's rules carefully to find out which procedure is followed by the court you need to use.
At a minimum, your interpleader complaint should describe the money or property you're holding on behalf of others, state facts indicating there is are multiple adverse claims to the same money or property, and that you have no personal interest in that money or property.
You also should include a request for reasonable attorney's fees and reimbursement of any court costs incurred in pursuing the interpleader action.

, Once you've finalized your documents, contact the clerk to find out if any special procedures are required for signing. In some courts, if you don't have an attorney you must sign your court documents at the clerk's office or in the presence of a notary public.Some courts require witnesses or verification of identification if you're signing court documents yourself and don't have an attorney, because a private person's signature doesn't carry the same oath and authority that an attorney's does.
After you've signed your documents, make one copy for your own records and one copy for each of the people or businesses you've named as a defendant.

, You typically must initiate your interpleader action by filing your complaint with the clerk of the court in the county where the money or property at issue is located. Depending on the defendants and the amount of money at stake, federal court may be proper.Expect to pay a filing fee of several hundred dollars to file your complaint. You may want to call the clerk ahead of time and find out what methods of payment are accepted.
After you've paid your filing fee and assuming all your documents are in order, the clerk will stamp them ""filed"" with the date, assign a case number, and return the copies to you.
Make note of the case number because you will have to use it on all other documents you file in the case. You also will need it if you call the clerk's office to schedule or confirm a hearing date, or to check on the status of any court orders or other filings related to your interpleader.

, Everyone you listed in your complaint as defendants – any person or business entity that has an adverse claim to the money or property in your possession – must be provided with a copy of the complaint and summons so they have official legal notice of your interpleader action and the opportunity to respond.You typically can choose between personal service and mail service. Personal service involves having someone not involved in the case, typically a sheriff's deputy or private process server, hand-deliver the documents to each of the defendants.
Mail service tends to be cheaper and easier for you. Simply use certified mail with returned receipt requested to deliver the documents to each defendant you named.
If you use mail service, you'll get a green card in the mail when the documents have been successfully delivered.

, Most courts have a specific form that must be completed by the individual that completes service once your complaint has been delivered. This certificate or proof of service form must then be filed with the clerk.If you hired a sheriff's deputy or private process-serving company to personally serve the defendants, they typically will fill out the certificate or proof of service form. They may file it directly with the court or return those forms to you to file.
If you use certified mail, it's your responsibility to complete the forms and file them after you get the green card back for each defendant. Attach the green card or a photocopy to your court form.
There typically isn't a fee to file the proof of service forms.

, There are a number of different responses that may be appropriate to a complaint for interpleader, depending on the party and the interests involved. A defendant may file an answer, just as they would in response to a complaint in a regular civil action.Responses may include waivers of any claim to the money or property, statements of claim over others, or defenses against your ability to file an interpleader.
For example, a defendant may argue that you aren't entitled to interpleader because you aren't truly disinterested in the money or property you're holding, or that you can't disclaim liability.
The defendants also may argue that you aren't truly in doubt as to which of them has a valid claim to the money or property you're holding, or that you aren't at risk of multiple liability because the defendants' claims aren't truly adverse.

, Before your hearing, review the documents you've filed with the court and create an outline of the facts that support your interpleader, including any evidence you wish to submit to the court.In this regard, you also want to carefully review any responses filed by the defendants. Any issues or facts they've raised will be discussed at the hearing.
Make sure you have a copy of all documents filed to take with you to the hearing. These documents may be referenced by any of the parties or by the judge, and you want to be able to follow along.
You also should have copies of any statutes or rules that you're relying on to support your interpleader action.

, Your interpleader hearing may be scheduled at a specific date and time, or it may be scheduled on the judge's general motion day during which motions on numerous cases are heard.If the court holds two hearings, the first being a hearing on an interlocutory motion, it's more likely your first hearing will be scheduled on a motion day.
Even if you're represented by an attorney, you typically must show up for any hearings regarding your interpleader complaint. Although your attorney will present your case, you may be called upon as a witness.
This is especially true given that the court must establish your disinterest in the money or property you are holding in order to find that interpleader is proper.

, Using your outline and your interpleader complaint to guide you, explain to the judge why you've filed an interpleader and detail the facts that support interpleader being granted in your situation.If you're representing yourself, remember to speak only to the judge, not to the defendants directly.
Since interpleader is an equitable remedy, there won't be a jury, nor is there any right to one. Interpleader is a legal matter that only a judge can decide.
At the same time, you still must present facts to make a case that interpleader is proper. These facts may relate to the validity of the adverse claims to the money or property you hold, or to your disinterest in that money or property.
For example, if you are holding funds in an escrow account, your status as an escrow agent can be used to show your disinterest and lack of liability for those funds.
You typically would need to present documentation to the court regarding the creation of the escrow account or establishing you as an escrow agent.
After you've finished your arguments, anyone you named as a defendant has the right to appear and argue that interpleader isn't proper in the situation. If they bring up facts or evidence that you didn't mention in your argument, you may have an additional opportunity to respond.

, After the judge has heard from all sides regarding the disputed claims over the money or property you have in your possession, he or she will either issue an order granting or denying your interpleader or schedule another hearing.Often interpleader actions are the subject of two hearings: one to determine whether the interpleader is rightfully before the court, and a second to determine the rights of the various defendants who have competing claims to the money or property in your possession.
If a second hearing is called, typically you will deposit the money or property in the court's registry before the second hearing, subject to the judge's decision that the interpleader is rightfully before the court.
This type of ruling is called an interlocutory order because it is not a final order and does not dispose of all the issues raised in your complaint.
Additionally, the judge may opt to take the matter under advisement, meaning he or she will take some time to look at the complaint and responsive pleadings again before making a final ruling.
Typically courts don't require you to place the funds or property in dispute in the court's registry until after a decision is made that interpleader is proper.
Some courts don't require you to deposit the funds or property at all, simply identify the location where the funds or deeds are stored. However, judges in those jurisdictions retain the right to order that those funds or property be formally turned over to the court's registry.

Check with your court clerk if there is a form available.If not, then you would draft your cross-claim and include it as part of your answer or create a separate document.;
, If you are the defendant, then you can typically insert a section called “Cross-Claims” underneath your affirmative defenses as part of your answer to the lawsuit.See Answer a Civil Lawsuit for more information about how to draft your answer.


If you are a plaintiff bringing a cross-claim, then you would draft a new complaint and title it something like “Plaintiff Abe Smith’s Cross-Claim Against Plaintiff Mary Smith.”

, The first thing you need to do is identify yourself and the party you are suing. If the party is a corporation, then identify the state of incorporation as well as where it has its principal place of business.If the parties are people, then identify their state of residence.

, Give the judge some information about the background of the dispute. You do not have to go into extensive detail. Nevertheless, you need to give the judge some idea of what happened.


Draft the cross-claim like a complaint. Number each factual allegation and generally try to include only one factual allegation per number., A “cause of action” is a legal claim. For example, “fraud” is a legal claim. If you think a co-defendant defrauded you, then you can cross-claim for fraud.


You should list your cross-claims individually. Identify who you are suing in the cross-claim heading. For example, you could write “Cross-Claim Against Defendant, Jon Jones.”If you are bringing more than one cause of action, then each gets listed individually. Title the cross-claims “First Cause of Action Against Defendant, Jon Jones, for Negligence,” “Second Cause of Action Against Defendant, Jon Jones, for Fraud,” etc.

, You need to allege enough facts that, if true, could support a jury finding for you. This means you can’t forget to allege an element of each cause of action. If you did, then your cross-claim could be dismissed.

, You must tell the judge what kind of remedy you want to be given. Generally, you can request the following:Compensatory damages for the injury suffered. You can list an estimated amount of damages (e.g., $45,000) or you could just state that you want compensatory damages which will be calculated at trial.
Punitive damages, if allowed. Punitive damages are meant to punish intentional, harmful conduct. If someone committed fraud or deliberately injured you, then your state might allow you to sue for punitive damages.
Attorney’s fees, costs, and other expenses if permitted by law.
Further relief as may be just and proper.

, At the bottom of your document, insert the words “Respectfully Submitted” just above your signature line.Underneath the line, include your name, address, and contact information.

, You need to file the pleading in the court where the lawsuit has been filed. Make several copies of your answer or complaint and take them all to the court clerk. Ask to file.The clerk can stamp your copies with the date.
You probably have to pay a filing fee, which will depend on the court. Call ahead of time and ask the amount and acceptable methods of payment.

, You need to give all parties to the lawsuit notice of the cross-claim. You can provide notice by serving a copy of your cross-claim or a copy of the answer that contains your cross-claim. Remember to make service on the other parties’ attorneys, if they have attorneys.Generally, you can have someone 18 or older make hand-delivery on the parties. In many courts, you can also have someone mail a copy of the document.

, You should read your relevant Rules of Civil Procedure to check if you can bring a cross-claim. Generally, you can bring a cross-claim against a co-party if the claim arises from the same factual circumstances as the lawsuit, but this will vary by state.


In federal court, you should read Rule 13 of the Rules of Civil Procedure. It is available online.In federal court, you can generally bring a cross-claim that arises out of the same “transaction or occurrence” that is the subject of the original lawsuit.
State courts may be different. In some courts, plaintiffs cannot bring cross-claims against each other.You can typically find your state’s Rules of Civil Procedure online., When you make your cross-claim, you need to allege each element for the cause of action. Pattern jury instructions (also called “model” jury instructions) are a good source for finding out what elements you need to prove for your cross-claim. Many states post these online.You can search “your state” and “jury instructions” along with the cause of action, such as “fraud.”
Read the pattern instruction. It should identify what you need to prove in order to win the claim.

, You can also perform additional research by visiting a law library. Your nearest one might be at your local courthouse or at a nearby law school. You can also find pattern jury instructions at the law library if you couldn’t find them online.


The Internet also has a lot of legal information. Visit Google Scholar and click on “case law.” Then select the state where your court is located. For example, if you are in Nebraska state court, click on Nebraska. However, if you are in Nebraska federal court, then click on “Eighth Circuit” because the District Court for Nebraska is in that Circuit.Court opinions often describe the legal elements you need to prove for each cause of action. Once you have selected the right court, type in your cause of action (e.g., “fraud”) and then read through court opinions.

, You could potentially bring many different causes of action, depending on the circumstances of your dispute. However, you should recognize some of the more common:



Negligence: when someone injures you because they are careless. Generally, there are four elements: (1) the person you are suing owed you a duty of due care, (2) they breached that duty by not being sufficiently careful, (3) the breach caused your injury, and (4) you suffered damages as a result of the injury.Fraud: when someone lies to you and you rely on the lie. Generally, the elements are: (1) a statement was made; (2) the statement was false; (3) the person who made the statement knew it was false or made it recklessly without knowledge of the truth; (4) the statement was made with the intent that you rely on it; (5) you did rely on it; (6) you suffered damages as a result.Breach of contract: you can sue when you had a contract and the other party to the contract failed to perform their obligations. Generally, the elements are: (1) a valid contract existed; (2) you performed your obligations under the contract or were excused from performing; (3) the other party breached the contract by failing to perform their obligations; (4) you were damaged because of the breach., You might feel overwhelmed and not know what possible causes of action you could bring as part of your cross-claim. For this reason, you might benefit by meeting with a lawyer for a consultation. At the consultation, you could describe the dispute and ask what you could sue for.


You can find the name of a lawyer by contacting your local or state bar association and asking for a referral.If you are low-income, then you might want to contact a legal aid organization. Legal aid provides free legal services to people in financial need. You can find the nearest legal aid organization by visiting the Legal Services Corporation’s website., If you were injured physically, then gather doctor or hospital records that explain the extent of your injury.You should also think about taking color photographs of your injuries.Color photographs are helpful because your injuries may have healed by the time you go to trial.

, You can be compensated for any financial injury you have suffered. For example, if you had to pay money to fix a problem, then you could be reimbursed. Hold onto documents that show how much you spent.


Get medical bills if you suffered a physical injury. Medical bills include doctor/hospital bills as well as the cost of therapy or rehabilitation. Also hold onto receipts for prescription drugs purchased and diagnostic tests performed.If your property was damaged, hold onto estimates for fixing the damage as well as any money spent.
You can also be compensated for lost work.You should get proof that you missed work in the form of an affidavit from your boss. You also need to establish how much you made with pay stubs, your W-2 form, or other forms.

, In a personal injury lawsuit, you should document your daily experience of living with your injury.You should note how the injury has affected you, including how much pain you feel. This journal will help you establish both “pain and suffering” and “emotional distress.” You can generally be compensated for both.


Identify where you feel pain on your body and how often you feel it.
Document the intensity of the pain: a dull, throbbing ache or acute, shooting pain.
Describe how the injury has impacted your life. Are you depressed? Has your mobility worsened? Can you sleep at night?

, If you were injured in an accident, then you should take photographs of the scene as soon as possible. Return to the scene during the same time and day, and take pictures from many different angles., Eyewitnesses could be critical to winning your cross-claim. If you are too injured during the accident, then have a friend or family member try to get the names of witnesses to the incident.


You can also get a copy of the police report, which often contains witness names."

Avoid sugar-coating or downplaying your reasons for seeking treatment. Keep in mind that if you're honest about your reasons for entering the rehab program, you won't need to remember what you wrote on your application if you're asked about it later on.
The voluntary nature of your decision to go into rehab can work in your favor. Emphasize that the decision was yours, and that you wanted to make a change in your life.

, Most law schools require you to send a cover letter along with your application. You'll also typically have to write a personal statement.You may want to downplay rehab as a negative experience, but you will present yourself as a stronger applicant if you don't shy away from it.
The admissions staff reviewing your application want to know that your problems with drug abuse are in the past – that you are strong, capable, and in control now, and know when to seek help before things go to far.
When addressing your drug rehabilitation in your personal statement, try to think of two or three lessons you learned as a result of the experience, or ways in which the experience made you a stronger or better person.
Focus on the future, and how you've moved on from the past. You don't want to dwell on it. Rather, present it as a challenge that you've overcome – in part because you were smart enough to recognize when you needed help and humble enough to seek that help.

, Law schools typically ask for a few academic or character references along with each application. Make sure those you choose know about the challenges you've faced.This is especially true since you're mentioning it in your application and personal statement. It's a significant experience in your life – your references won't seem authentic if they have no knowledge of it.
If you have professors writing references for you who aren't aware that you were in drug rehabilitation, make an appointment during office hours to talk to them about it.
Give them a brief explanation of what happened, and the dates you were in treatment. Be prepared to answer any questions they may have about your experience or your current situation.
Practicing lawyers who've agreed to write references for you may have more, and different, questions than professors do. They will be focused on your current and future ability to continue to maintain a drug-free life.
Attorneys probably will discuss with you how stressful and intense law school and the practice of law will be. They will want to make sure you're prepared and confident in your ability to handle it before they recommend you.

, Many law schools have an interview as part of the application process, which takes place either in person or online. If you're contacted for an interview, choose your clothing and accessories appropriately.Generally, you want to wear non-revealing, conservative clothing. You don't necessarily have to wear a suit, but if you have one it would be a good bet.
Groom yourself conservatively as well. If you have long hair, you may want to pull it back – especially if you have a tendency to play with your hair.
If the law school is doing the interview online, set up your system beforehand so you're not rushing to download necessary software at the time of the interview.
Check the area around your computer and get rid of anything vulgar, suggestive, or controversial.
During the interview, look at the camera to simulate eye contact. Don't look down at the keyboard or anywhere else. It might help to move the image of the person calling in so that it's near to your camera.

, The interviewer will have looked over your application and marked anything of interest. While you can expect questions about anything you included, your rehab experience probably will be at the top of the list.Answer the interviewer's questions in a calm, straightforward manner. Focus on the fact that you took charge of your life and got help when you needed it.
As hard as it may be, avoid seeming ashamed of your experiences. It takes a lot of strength to admit you have a problem and seek help to deal with that problem. You will impress the interviewer by showing that strength.

, When you're asked questions about your previous drug use or rehabilitation, provide a direct, factual answer and then move on to something else. There's no need to belabor the point.Stick to the facts, and try to connect the experience to a lesson you learned or a strength you found in yourself that you will bring to your legal studies and your eventual practice of law.
If your experience is part of your motivation for wanting to go to law school or practice law, mention that. For example, maybe you want to bring your experience to bear in representing disadvantaged clients.
Resist the urge to tell horror stories. They won't help you or impress the interviewer, and may hurt you.

, For the purposes of your law school application, the most important part of your drug rehabilitation is the fact that you recognized you had a problem and took steps to correct it.Undergoing rehabilitation empowered you to take control of your life and make something of yourself, which is what you're trying to do by going to law school.
During the interview, focus forward rather than dwelling on the past. Any problems you've had in the past aren't going to disadvantage you relative to other law school applicants, provided you can demonstrate that you've risen above those difficulties.
The interview is your chance to show the interviewer that you've moved on from a relatively low point in your life, and that going into rehab helped you to do that.
The way you present yourself and the way you speak can demonstrate this to the interviewer. Speak in clear, short sentences and keep your language positive and focused on the future.

, Law schools want to admit students who have the potential to become good lawyers. Good lawyers are confident and secure with themselves. Show your confidence by owning your past choices and mistakes.Your confidence also shows in your body language and presentation. Even if your interview is online, the interviewer will be able to tell if you are slumping in your chair or distracted by other things.
When you make excuses for your actions, this sends a message to the interviewer that you are trying to evade responsibility.
The interviewer will be impressed if you take responsibility and ownership for your past actions and mistakes, and focus on your effort to constantly improve and do better.

, Asking about substance abuse resources won't make you look weak. On the contrary, it shows the interviewer that you are realistic and are prepared to seek help if necessary to keep from getting into problems again.Asking what resources and support programs are available at the law school also sends a message to the interviewer that you understand how challenging and potentially stressful law school can be.
You don't want to make the mistake of thinking that after everything you've experienced in your life, law school will be easy – it won't. You likely won't endear yourself to the interviewer by giving off that impression.

, Law school is characterized by intense workloads and competition among students that can be grueling. The grinding stress caused by the demands of teachers and fellow students alike can cause difficulties for even the most balanced students.Law school can be particularly difficult if you got relatively good grades by coasting through undergrad, without having to study a lot.
Law school professors expect you to know the material well, and they typically aren't going to move on to someone else just because you miss a question or seem unprepared.
On the contrary, they'll often stick with you – much to the consternation of your classmates – to hammer home the lesson that you should be prepared for class.
This means that after classes are over, you typically face several hours worth of intense reading to prepare for the next day.

, You probably learned during rehab that one of the most important ways to avoid a relapse is to eliminate people who abuse drugs from your life. Carry this same attitude and commitment with you to law school.Study groups can be a big part of law school, as well as social anchors. Stay away from study groups with members who seem like the ""partying"" types.
By the same token, law schools often have social events and mixers at local bars or wineries. Alcohol is frequently served at legal social functions.
If you have a problem with alcohol, you'll want to either avoid these events or find a sober buddy you can go with.

, Most law schools sponsor support groups to help students cope with the demands of law school, as well as additional resources for people struggling with alcohol or drug addiction.You should get information about support groups during orientation for first years. These groups can be especially valuable if you're going to school far away from home, in a strange city where you don't know anyone.
A support group connects you to people you can trust, and lets you know that you're not alone.

, Despite the significant time commitment of law school, there are activities that can reinvigorate you and help you release stress in productive, fulfilling ways without resorting to drugs or alcohol to escape.Don't let law school become your entire life and identity. You were more than a student before you entered law school – you are more than a law student while you are in law school.
Find opportunities to do some of the things that you enjoyed doing before you went to law school, even if you can't do them as often because of the demands of school.
For example, take the time to go out to a movie once in awhile, or visit a nearby museum.
Many law schools have intramural sports and other activities in which you can take part. Since your team members also are law school students, the demands of law school are taken into account.
Exercise can be one of the best ways to combat the negative effects of stress, so make time in your busy schedule and make a morning walk or jog a part of your regular routine.

, Many law school students develop problems with drugs or alcohol and resist getting help. Typically, they are afraid admitting they have a problem will harm their chances of being accepted to the bar after they graduate.Keep in mind that bar examiners are more concerned with your current activities than those that happened in your past.
You won't be penalized for seeking help or support when you need it. Better to err on the side of caution and get help, rather than try to stick it out on your own and risk a relapse or other problems.
Throughout law school, maintain your focus on yourself, your mental stability, and your health.

Compare similar statutes in other states.",How to Interpret Statutes," The primary rule of statutory interpretation is to assume words and phrases have the same meaning a reasonable person would assume them to have.If the statute makes sense on its face, you generally don't need to look any further.The other tools of statutory interpretation only apply to words and phrases that are ambiguous or could have several meanings.When you read the statute, avoid reading anything into it that isn't present in the language of the statute itself, or reading a word or phrase to imply something other than the plain meaning of the words themselves.Presume that each word, and each punctuation mark, have meaning and were put there intentionally – unless it's an obvious clerical error.;
, If the statute you're reading references another statute, you can look to it to gain an understanding of some words or phrases that may be unclear.In some situations, the statute also may borrow definitions from another statute – particularly if the subject matter of the statute is complex or highly technical. This avoids redundancy and eliminates the ambiguity over whether, by redefining a term already defined in a previous law, the legislature meant the new definition to be different from the earlier one.
Pay attention to whether the reference to the statute is general or specific. General references typically should be interpreted to include any later amendments to the statute, while specific references refer only to the particular section or clause indicated., The entire statute is a whole unit with multiple parts or clauses, all of which work together.


The same context applies to key words or phrases that are used throughout the statute. The ""whole act"" rule of statutory interpretation guides you to use consistent definitions of a word or phrase throughout the text.For example, interpreting a word one way might make sense in all but one clause of the statute. However, in that one clause, the interpretation leads to a silly or outlandish result. Therefore, that can't be the correct interpretation of that word.
Most statutes have a preamble, or a clause that states the purpose of the law and what the legislature intends it to achieve. This clause can help guide your interpretation of the statute, because you can generally assume that the legislators would not include another clause in the statute itself that was at odds with or undermined the stated purpose of the statute.Although the preamble generally is not considered to be part of the statute itself, it provides information about the purpose of the law and can help resolve ambiguities in the language of the statute., Several doctrines of statutory interpretation focus on finding the meaning of ambiguous words by looking at the words or phrases that surround them.


Keep in mind that generally, courts interpreting a statute assume that every word is meaningful. Even if a phrase sounds redundant to you, each word in that phrase must mean something different, or the legislature would not have included all of them.Often you can discover the meaning of a term by looking at the words associated with it in the statute.This is particularly helpful if there is a term that could be interpreted broadly, but the context within which it appears indicates it should have a more limited definition.
For example, suppose you own a food truck specializing in cupcakes, and you're interpreting a statute to determine whether it prohibits you from using strawberry icing on your cupcakes. The clause banning strawberry icing states it covers ""any cupcakes made or sold in the city,"" but the entire clause repeatedly refers to standing bakeries in brick-and-mortar locations. Additionally, the statute elsewhere excludes food trucks from its definition of ""bakery."" Thus, you would be justified in concluding that the statute does not apply to your food truck, and you can make and sell cupcakes with strawberry icing to your heart's content.
If the statute explicitly lists items that are included (or excluded) within its scope, pay attention to the type or category of items listed. Generally, the statute doesn't apply to something that falls wholly outside the categories of listed items.For example, if a statute prohibits horses, goats, mules, hogs, and sheep in the town square, you can safely assume that the statute does not apply to chickens. All of the listed animals have hooves, and chickens don't have hooves. You could find additional support for this interpretation in the preamble's discussion of how the hooves tear up the grass in the square.

, Some words signify the scope of a condition, indicate exceptions, or limit other terms.


Some words are commonly used in statutes. For example, if a statute states that an individual ""shall"" or ""must"" do something, this typically means that action is required by the law. In contrast, if the statute states the individual ""may"" do something, it indicates that the individual has discretion in whether to complete that action.Words such as ""unless"" or ""except"" typically signal an exception to a general rule the statute has already set forth.Keep in mind that courts tend to interpret exceptions narrowly.Pay attention to whether the statute connects terms with ""and"" or ""or."" Using ""and"" generally indicates that both terms the word connects must be together for the condition to apply. Using ""or,"" on the other hand, means that the condition applies to each term individually.For example, if the cupcake statute defines bakeries as places where cupcakes are made and sold, this means both must apply. If the business only sells cupcakes baked somewhere else or by another company, that business would not qualify as a bakery for the purposes of the statute.
Other words such as ""each,"" ""only,"" ""every,"" or ""all"" can indicate the scope of the statutory provision, while words such as ""if,"" ""before,"" or ""after"" typically indicate that a precondition must be met before the statutory provision can apply., Diagramming a sentence from a statute can help you understand how the words work together.


Basic rules of statutory interpretation assume that words and phrases should be analyzed according to proper grammar, usage, and punctuation.By diagramming the sentence, you apply the rules of grammar to your statutory interpretation.

, Most statutes have a section that provides specific definitions for key words that are used throughout the statute.


Definitions typically are one of the first sections of the entire statute. Specific terms only used in one section, or that the legislature intends to have a slightly different definition for the purposes of that section, may be defined at the beginning of that section.For example, an employment statute may define the word ""employee"" to exclude contract or freelance employees. However, there may be one section in which contractors and freelancers are included as employees for that section only.
Statutory definitions typically are used to streamline the text and avoid repeating long phrases and series. The definition of a term lists everything included as well as anything the legislature intends specifically to exclude from the understanding of the term.
Often the application of a statute depends on how certain words are defined. For example, a statute may state that employers must provide health insurance for all employees. Although that sentence's meaning seems straightforward, you have to know who is considered an employee (and who is considered an employer) under the statute if you want to understand how that statute would apply to a particular set of circumstances.
If you hired a local high school student to babysit your kids, you may wonder if under that statute you are required by law to provide health insurance to that student. However, by reading the statutory definition, you discover that employees are defined as anyone who works more than 30 hours a week, and for whom a W-2 is filed with the IRS. Since neither of those things are true for your babysitter, she isn't covered by the law.
Even if the statute itself does not define a word, the word may have a particular definition as a ""term of art"" in the field covered by the statute. Similarly, the legislature may have borrowed the word from another law, incorporating the definition used there., Supreme Court and Court of Appeals decisions provide definitive interpretations of many statutes.


If you're interpreting a state law, look for decisions from the state's highest court. Decisions from lower courts have less value; only the highest court's interpretation becomes a matter of law.
Generally, if you're looking at a criminal statute, courts will resolve any ambiguity in the law in the defendant's favor.Keep in mind that parts of the statute may have been limited or repealed by a court's interpretation.For example, if the Supreme Court decides that a particular part of a statute violates the Constitution, that part of the statute is repealed. If the legislature still wants to achieve the same goal, it must pass a new law that doesn't violate the Constitution.
Court decisions also may discuss alternative interpretations and provide some reasoning about why the court believes those interpretations are invalid.You can research many court decisions online for free by using search engines such as Google Scholar. To find a court decision that talked about the statute you're interpreting, conduct a search that includes the statute's citation. 

, Government agencies charged with enforcing a law often must interpret that law to fulfill their duties.


These regulations may include specific instructions on how the statute should be interpreted or applied to particular cases and situations.If you're reading an annotated statute, these regulations may be mentioned in the statute's footnotes.Otherwise, you can look through the statute itself to find out which agency is charged with enforcing it, then search for regulations and other information related to the statute at the agency's website.
Keep in mind that courts employ a basic presumption that an agency's interpretation of its own regulations is correct. Courts also give extreme deference to agency interpretations of a statute if the statute grants that agency explicit power to enforce that law., By studying the minutes of legislative sessions you can uncover key information that can shed light on legislative intent.Legislative history typically includes floor statements about the statute while it was being debated, proposed amendments, and reports or statements from committee meetings or hearings.Previous versions of the law before it was passed also can help with statutory interpretation.For example, if an early version of the cupcake statute contained language that limited the application of the law to within a five-mile radius of the town square, but the statute that became law did not include any geographic limitations, you can presume the legislature didn't intend the operation of the statute to be limited to that small area.
Keep in mind that in some cases you might read conflicting interpretations of a statute from different committees, or different legislative bodies. For example, the House's interpretation of a law may differ from the Senate's interpretation. In these situations, neither should be taken as definitive., News reports can give you a better understanding of why the law was proposed and the issues surrounding it.


Scholarly treatises and law review articles also might give you a better sense of the statute or argue for a particular interpretation. You should pay particular attention to anything mentioned in the legislative history. If the legislators read an article while they were drafting the law, it can provide additional clues into how the statute should be interpreted., Since you want to rely on the plain language of the statute, dictionaries can provide some insight into the best definition for a word or phrase with which you're unfamiliar.


For example, suppose you're interpreting a statute that gives health and safety inspectors the power to modify state health and safety regulations for restaurants able to show a good cause for doing so. If you looked up the definition of the word ""modify,"" you'd see that it allows the inspectors to alter or change the requirements, but the definition does not include the idea that the requirements can be eliminated entirely. This is assuming that the word ""modify"" is not specifically defined elsewhere in the statute.
Additionally, keep in mind that if a statute is dealing with technical or scientific regulations, a word may have a particular definition within that industry or scientific community that differs from the general dictionary definition of the term. In these situations, you also may want to look at industry reports or scientific papers to see how the word is used there.
If you're interpreting an older statute, you might want to look at dictionaries published during that time period rather than one in use today. A dictionary published contemporaneously with the law will give you an idea of how the word or phrase was being used at the time the law was written, and what it meant to people then., Although another state's interpretation isn't authoritative, if you know the legislature based its law on one in another state to discern the legislature's intent.


Other legal documents such as the Constitution also can assist in your statutory interpretation. If you assume the legislature would not have wanted to create an unconstitutional law, but one interpretation would lead to that result, it probably isn't the correct interpretation under your assumption.
One basic rule of interpretation used by the courts assumes that similar statutes should be interpreted similarly, unless something in the legislative history suggests otherwise.For example, another state's statute regulating cupcake sales and distribution may have been discussed, but the legislature agreed that its statute had an entirely different purpose.

"
"
Specify deadlines for performance of all stages of the agreement.,
State that delays at any stage constitute a material breach of the contract.,
Define what sorts of delays are included under the clause.,
Decide whose performance falls under the clause.,
Require as much advance notice as possible in the event of a delay.",How to Draft a Contract Clause Dealing With Delay in Performance1," Many courts won’t award damages for delay if your contract doesn’t have a specified end date, or particular deadlines for each phase of the project.In the absence of specific dates of completion, contract law requires work to be completed in a reasonable amount of time. However, what is considered “reasonable” could vary widely from person to person.For each deadline, you should detail exactly what you expect to be finished by that date. For example, suppose you’re building your dream home and have hired a contractor. His first deadline is to clear and grade the lot and pour the foundation. He must be finished by May 30 because the materials for the framing of the house are being delivered June 1.
Sometimes it’s not necessary for a phase to be completely finished before another begins, but it needs to be mostly completed. If this is the case, make sure you define exactly what constitutes substantial completion for the purposes of your contract. For example, your contractor needs to have the plumbing and electricity completed before the interior doors and trim are installed. However, he doesn’t have to be 100 percent finished because he can finish up his work on the first floor while the doors and trim are installed on the second floor.
When you have a project with multiple phases, the most important thing is to make sure that later phases aren’t pushed back because an early phase takes too long to complete.
You might also consider including a sentence requiring the contractor use specific scheduling methods to track his progress and ensure the deadlines of all phases are met, or to provide weekly or monthly status reports.;
, A material breach goes to the very core of the contract, meaning if the schedule isn't met the contract might as well not even exist.This sort of clause typically is called a ""time is of the essence"" clause.


By saying time is of the essence, you’re saying that the deadlines and schedules included in the contract are of absolute importance to its existence.
Absent any other clause regarding a delay in performance, if you include a provision that time is of the essence, the contractor will be liable for all damages resulting from a delay, even if the delay was not his fault., Generally speaking, you don’t want to include delays that are caused by third parties, by events outside the control of either the owner or the contractor, or delays that happen because the owner changes his mind regarding something like a schedule of events or a type of material.A “time is of the essence” provision typically states that all delays are included unless excluded elsewhere in the contract. This way you can draft other clauses to deal more specifically with various types of delays that may come up over the course of the contract.
""Time is of the essence"" clauses don't have to be complex. For example, your clause might simply say: ""Time is of the essence with respect to all provisions within this Agreement. Any delay in performance by either party shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement.""

, A “time is of the essence” clause can apply solely to the contractor, or can apply to the owner’s responsibility to provide the contractor with timely payments and materials as well.

, All parties should be required to notify each other if even an excusable delay occurs.


How much notice should be provided may depend on the reason for the delay or the length of the delay. For example, if the contractor learns key building materials have been back-ordered and won't be delivered for three weeks, he should alert the owner as soon as he finds that out rather than waiting to see what happens. The owner may want to pull the order or find a different supplier, and he needs as much time as possible to pursue alternatives.
On the other hand, if severe thunderstorms mean the contractor has to suspend work for an afternoon but plans to return the next morning, a phone call to the owner as he sends the workers home is probably sufficient.
Contractors may forfeit any damages or right to ask for an extension of time under the contract if they fail to give the owner proper notice.
If the owner’s actions have caused the delay, a court may refuse to award the contractor damages unless the contractor gave the owner proper notice. Without notice, it’s possible the owner didn’t realize that he was causing a delay, and in any event he hasn’t been given the opportunity to correct the problem.Contractors should keep a daily log of project conditions and events so they can notify the owner of any potential for delay as soon as possible."

Apply to multiple graduate programs.",How to Become a Clinical Laboratory Scientist," Chemistry and biology are particularly important to understand as a lab scientist. If possible, invest time early in your career to cultivating a strong foundation in these subjects. Math is also an important subject to understand. If you truly understand and enjoy these subjects, this might be a good career for you.


If you’re already out of high school, look for opportunities to improve your knowledge of these subjects online or at the library.;
, Clinical laboratory scientists usually have a bachelor's degree with a major in medical technology or in one of the life sciences; clinical laboratory technicians generally need either an associate degree or a certificate.Lab scientists have a more extensive knowledge of molecular biology and microbiology techniques. Also, they are more likely to obtain management positions.Lab technicians prepare samples, perform basic lab tests, and maintain instruments.

, Gather information on universities that have programs specific to training clinical lab scientists. Take into account the cost to attend, the job placement statistics of graduated students, and research availability.


Attending a university is a very expensive endeavor. Public schools in the state you reside may be cheaper than private schools, but public schools outside of your resident state may cost just as much as the private school.
Schools should be able to provide you with data and job placement following graduation. Look into these statistics while trying to decide which school to attend.
To be more competitive following graduation, try to find an internship or research opportunity during school. Not all universities have these available, so keep this in mind when deciding where to apply.
Apply to multiple undergraduate universities to increase the probability that you will be accepted.

, Such organizations include the National Accrediting Agency for Clinical Laboratory Sciences (NAACLS), the Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs (CAAHEP), or the Accrediting Bureau of Health Education Schools.


Degrees from schools with these accreditations are nationally recognized and will make you more competitive as a job candidate.

, Being a CLS requires that you learn the proper subjects before entering the workforce: biology, immunology, hematology, chemistry (organic, physical, and analytical), biochemistry, and physics (light and electricity).These courses represent the core type of work you will be doing on a daily basis. If you find these classes don’t interest you, consider a different career path or speak to a counselor about other options.

, Hospitals are the leading employers, but clinical laboratory technologists are also employed by independent laboratories, physician offices and clinics, and manufacturers of lab equipment and diagnostic supplies.,Look at websites such as the American Society for Clinical Laboratory Science for job postings.,
Analyze chemical content and reactions necessary for finding out cholesterol levels and matching blood for transfusions.
Measure types and levels of drugs in the system for treatment or to assess response to treatment.

, Microscopes, cell counters and computerized equipment are all used by clinical laboratory scientists. In the process of obtaining your degree, you will be trained on these devices. Volunteer in a lab for additional experience and to decide if this is the right career for you.


Internships are also a good way to learn how to use these instruments.

, Clinical lab technicians and technologists often have to handle infectious material. Knowing about and wearing proper protective equipment (PPE) is essential in this field. Training in basic lab safety and bloodborne pathogens is also necessary.


Gloves and a lab coat are mandatory in the laboratory.
Masks or goggles may be required in certain situations.

, If you want to practice in a particular field, you will need to do some additional work. Research the different specialties and choose the one that is the best fit for you.


Examples of specializations are: clinical chemistry technologists, microbiology technologists, immunohematology technologists, immunology technologists, cytotechnologists and molecular biology technologists.

, Right now, not every state in the United States requires a license, but it can be beneficial to obtain a license to be more employable. States that don’t currently have licenses may have them in the coming years. Before you apply for a job, make sure you have all the necessary licenses and certification required at the time of application.


The states that currently require licensure are California, Tennessee, Florida, Hawaii, Louisiana, Montana, Nevada, New York, North Dakota, Rhode Island, West Virginia, and Puerto Rico.Licenses also vary depending on specialty. If you are going into a very specific field, you will need to obtain a license for that specialty., Before you can be licensed as a CLS, you must first earn a bachelor’s degree with specific course requirements. Number of semesters required may vary by state, but you must at least have the following coursework covered:Chemistry units including clinical chemistry or analytical and biochemistry.
Biology units must include immunology, hematology, and medical microbiology.
Physics units including light and electricity.

, Obtaining a license requires that you have at least one year of work experience or training in a clinical laboratory. You must also have verification of this experience before applying for the license. The training must be comprehensive in terms of the duties of a clinical scientist.Some states may require more work experience before becoming licensed. Each state has its own regulations so be sure to look up the specifics for where you will be working.
Experience may also vary if you are seeking a license for a specialty.

, Not all states require the exam to be licensed, but some do and it is important to do well on it. The exam is called the Clinical Laboratory Scientist generalist licensure exam. There are three organizations certified to give the exam: ASCP (American Society for Clinical Pathology), ASCPi (international license), and AAB (American Association of Bioanalysts).Failure to pass the written exam twice requires a waiting period of one year before you may try again.

, Applications can be submitted online for the license once you have met all of the minimum requirements. Have the paperwork certifying your degree, your work experience, and passing the exam before applying. There is usually an application fee (up to $300) associated with licensure, so make sure you have the proper funds before you apply., Look at CLS/MT (Clinical Laboratory Scientist/Medical Technologist) or CLT/MLT (Clinical Laboratory Technician/Medical Laboratory Technician) programs. American Medical Technologists, the National Credentialing Agency for Laboratory Personnel or the Board of Registry of the American Society for Clinical Pathology are some of the better known certification bodies.


Professional associations vary in certification requirements for lab scientists, therefore check with each association.
Employers may require specific certifications.

, Gather all of your important documents verifying your work and training experience (employer documentation, letters of authenticity, certificates, etc) and your education (transcripts and degrees). You must also apply to take the exam, paying an application fee between $100-200.


Different certification organizations may have slightly different requirements and application fees.

, Following the approval process of your application, you will be able to schedule the date of your exam. For some licensing bodies, you have a three-month window to schedule the exam.


Start studying as soon as you finish the application so you have plenty of time.

, There are many online practice tests and review courses available to help you study. If you know other people taking the exam around the same time, try forming a study group. Practice tests are the best way to gauge your knowledge. Take one every few weeks to see how you’re improving.


Study early and often. Don’t try to learn too many things at once or you may get study fatigue.
Focus on one or two topics each day to study in depth. Review the same subjects every few days to keep them fresh.

, On the day of the exam, make sure you aren’t hungry and have eaten a decent meal. The exam is taken on the computer and is called an adaptive test: the exam gets harder as you get more questions correct.Make sure you have the basic computer skills necessary to take an exam on the computer.

, Graduate school takes many more years of hard work and is not the right choice for everyone. Graduate degrees can provide more opportunities for advancement into administrative positions. Lab scientists often have master’s degrees and directors usually have a doctorate.


Pursuing a master’s degree takes about 2 years to complete. Most master’s programs require that you pay your own tuition.
Pursuing a doctorate takes an average of 5.5 years to complete. Many PhD programs provide a stipend and pay for your tuition in exchange for your work in a lab.

, Once you have decided to pursue an advance degree, you must choose a graduate program. If you have been in the workforce for a few years, you may have a specialty in mind already. Choose a program that focuses on that specialty and is well-known for job placement. Many of the factors to consider are similar to those of choosing an undergraduate university.


Attending a university is a very expensive endeavor. Public schools in the state you reside may be cheaper than private schools, but public schools outside of your resident state may cost just as much as the private school.
Schools should be able to provide you with data and job placement following graduation. You should look into these statistics while trying to decide which school to attend.
Where does the program you’re looking at rank compared to other schools? You don’t need to go to the number one program, but choose a school that has the ability to get you the type of job you’re hoping to achieve.

, Graduate school applications require reference letters. You want to make sure they are going to be positive letters. If you ask someone and they hesitate, they may not be the best person to write a recommendation for you. Ask professors you had a strong bond with or someone you did research with. Employers also make good references if they are in the correct field.


A retail manager is not the ideal reference, but can work if you are trying to change fields.
Friends and family are not generally accepted as valid references.
Give your references a few months to complete their letters. Gently remind them closer to the deadline if you know they haven’t been submitted yet.

, The GRE is the standard entrance exam into graduate school. The test takes almost four hours to complete and is administered on a computer.You must have basic computer skills to take the exam.


Spend an appropriate amount of time studying for the exam. You can purchase study aid books or you can take a special class to prepare for it.
Consider taking the test a second time if you didn’t achieve the score necessary for the school to which you’re applying.

, It’s good to be confident, but you want to make sure you get into a program after spending all of that time preparing. Apply to more than one program to increase your chances of being accepted into at least one.


Make sure you get your applications in by the deadline.
Check with your references to make sure they have submitted their letters of recommendation on time.

List the types of events included in a “force majeure” clause.,
Decide what will happen if one of these events occurs.,
Consider including other excusable delays.,
Provide for cancellation of the contract without penalty if the event continues beyond a specified period of time.",How to Draft a Contract Clause Dealing With Delay in Performance2," This clause excuses performance if a major event occurs that completely transforms the circumstances of the agreement in a way neither party could possibly have anticipated.


Force majeure events typically include natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes, or tornadoes, and political events such as wars, riots, government orders, or trade embargoes. Strikes and labor shortages also may fall into a force majeure clause.
Typically, the events listed have catastrophic and unavoidable consequences that would make performance under the contract impossible.In some states such as Virginia, force majeure clauses are required in all construction contracts.For example, your force majeure clause might state ""A party shall not be liable for any failure of or delay in the performance of this Agreement for the period that such failure or delay is due to causes beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God, war, strikes or labor disputes, embargoes, government orders or any other force majeure event.""

, Typically, the contractor won’t need to pay the owner any damages for the delay, and may be entitled to a reasonable extension of time to complete the project.Without a force majeure clause, the parties are left at the mercy of common law rules that only excuse performance rarely under a narrow set of circumstances., While they may not rise to the “force majeure” level, you might want to include provision for delays that occur through no fault of the contractor.


If the contract mentions nothing specifically, courts will only consider a delay excusable if it was caused by circumstances beyond anyone’s control and was unforeseeable by the parties at the time the contract was made.Examples of excusable delays include unforeseen weather events that don’t rise to the level of a catastrophe, strikes, design errors, or material shortages.If the delay results from something in the control of the owner, such as an error in the design or architectural plans, it may be appropriate for the owner to compensate the contractor for any costs he incurred as a result., For example, a hurricane that only impacts a small coastal area near your build site may only cause a brief delay in construction. However, a massive hurricane resulting in the area being flooded for months would render performance impossible.


If a force majeure event renders performance impossible, the clause should allow the parties essentially to walk away from the contract as though it never happened.

"
"
Include a clause that allows performance to be accelerated to meet the schedule despite delays.,
Provide for liquidated damages in the event performance is delayed and deadlines aren’t met.,
Allow a party to terminate the agreement if there are excessive delays.",How to Draft a Contract Clause Dealing With Delay in Performance3," If the contractor’s fault or neglect causes the delay, this clause would allow you to require the contractor to work more hours to complete the project on time.If an owner forces a contractor to complete a project despite excusable delays for which the contractor was entitled to a time extension, the contractor may be able to sue the owner for damages if the acceleration caused additional cost. For example, the contractor may have needed to hire two more laborers to help complete the last phase of the project in a shorter time period., Because it’s difficult to predict when drafting a contract what damages might be caused by delays during the project, many construction contracts include a clause providing for liquidated or pre-set damages for delays.Damages for delay, in particular, are difficult to prove, and for this reason a liquidated damages clause is often favored.Some contractors believe they are not liable for damages for delay unless there is a liquidated damages clause. However, they still may be liable for actual damages caused by a delay that was reasonably foreseeable when the agreement was made.For example, if an apartment building was supposed to be completed in 500 days, but it took the contractor 600 days due to rain, the contractor would be liable to the building owner for actual damages caused by his delay. It wouldn’t be reasonable for him to believe that it wouldn’t rain for 500 days.
Liquidated damages clauses are only enforceable if actual damages would be difficult or impossible to estimate. The amount set forth in the clause must be a reasonable estimate of what actual damages might be, and can’t be intended to punish the other party for delaying.For example, a restaurateur may hire a contractor to build a new restaurant by a certain date. The restaurateur and the contractor have no idea how much business the new restaurant might have after it opens, so liquidated damages for any delay would be appropriate in this instance.An owner cannot recover both actual damages and liquidated damages from a contractor who delays his performance.Liquidated damages can be escalated to reflect the increasing costs of a delay that lasts for an extended period of time.For example, a liquidated damages clause might say: ""If the Contractor fails to complete the work within the contract time, the Contractor agrees to pay the Owner $300 per day as liquidated damages to cover losses, expenses and damages, not to exceed $10,000.""

, Drafting a contract involves planning for all contingencies, so consider including a clause that allows the owner to escape the contract in a worst-case scenario where the contractor is responsible for repeated and significant inexcusable delays."
"
Allow the owner to suspend or delay work without paying compensation through a “suspension of work” clause.,
Check to make sure a “no damage for delay” clause is enforceable in your state.,
Include a statement that the contractor cannot file a claim for additional costs if actions by the owner cause the project to be delayed.",How to Draft a Contract Clause Dealing With Delay in Performance4," If delays are anticipated for business or other economic reasons, a suspension-of-work clause allows the owner to temporarily pause construction.


Typically suspension-of-work clauses provide for some payment to the contractor during the down time, or some adjustment of the final contract price depending on how long construction is put on hold.For example, a suspension-of-work clause might say: ""The Owner may, without cause, order the Contractor in writing to suspend, delay or interrupt the Work in whole or in part for such period of time as the Owner may determine."" That clause would be followed by any adjustments made to the payment or the schedule as a result of the delay.

, Some states, such as California and Virginia, have laws limiting the enforceability of these clauses, and Ohio has banned them entirely.Even in states where these clauses are not banned, courts dislike them and give little latitude to the party seeking to enforce them. Courts typically decline to enforce them if the cause for the delay was unforeseeable when the contract was made, or if the owner’s intentional acts caused the delay.Courts often throw out a “no damage for delay” clause if your contract also includes a “time is of the essence” clause. If an owner requires a contractor to complete a project as quickly as possible, the reasoning goes, he shouldn’t also be able to deny liability for expenses the contractor incurs because of his own actions., Typically this statement will include a requirement that the contractor provide notice to the owner that his progress is being hindered and request more time to complete the job.


Contractors can still get around these clauses and sue the owner for costs incurred if the owner causes delays through actions that are particularly malicious or done in bad faith."

In other words, a motion for directed verdict should be used if the other party has not presented enough evidence to meet their burden of proof. The judge will grant your motion for directed verdict if no reasonable juror could honestly reach a different conclusion than the one you are putting forward (i.e., that not enough evidence was submitted to prove the other party's case). The judge will weigh all of the facts in favor of the other party., Each court will have different rules regarding the use and submission of motions for directed verdict. These court rules can usually be found online on the courts website. If you cannot find the local rule online, contact the court where your trial is being held and ask for a copy of the local rules. In general, motions for directed verdict must state specific grounds to support your arguments.


Be aware that different courts call these motions different things. For example, in criminal court, this motion may be called a motion for directed verdict of acquittal. In a non-jury civil trial, this motion may be called a motion for involuntary dismissal., Your motion for directed verdict will be submitted to the court at different times depending on what party you are and what your trial strategy is. Motions for directed verdict can only be filed after your opponent has presented their evidence. If you are in a jury trial, your motion should always be presented outside of the jury's view. If you present your motion while the jury is still present, the court may find your actions prejudicial and your case may be dismissed or delayed.


If you are the plaintiff in a civil suit, your motion will usually be submitted after the defendant has presented their case. If you are the defendant in a civil case, you can submit your motion after the plaintiff rests (i.e., right before you present your case).
If you are the defendant in a criminal case, you can submit your motion after the prosecution has presented their case. If you are the prosecution in a criminal case, you are not allowed to submit a motion for directed verdict (because defendants have an overriding constitutional right to a jury trial).
If you are the defendant and your motion is denied during trial, you can renew your motion after you present your case and rest., Before you start drafting your motion for directed verdict, look online for valuable forms and templates you can use to help you write. A lot of courts will have blank motion forms available on their websites. Also, a lot of nonprofit legal organizations will offer forms to low income individuals. Conduct online searches for ""motion forms"" or ""directed verdict forms"" and see what comes up. If you cannot find forms that match the requirements you need, you may have to create your motion from scratch.

, A complete motion for directed verdict is a compilation of multiple documents. The first document you will need to create is the notice of motion, which explains to the court that you are asking for a directed verdict. The notice will begin with a caption page, which will need to identify the court, the parties, the case number and the title of your document. Some local rules might require additional information in the caption. In this instance, the title can be something like: ""Notice of Motion for Directed Verdict.""


The body of your notice will state that you are filing a motion for directed verdict based upon the other documents that will be attached to the notice (i.e., the memorandum and declaration).
The end of your notice will leave space for you to sign and date., The second, and most important document you will draft, is the memorandum of points and authorities in support of your motion. This document lays out the law and your legal arguments that support your motion. The memorandum will start with a caption page, which will need to identify the court, the parties, the case number and the title of your document. Some local rules may require additional information (e.g., hearing information or the identity of the presiding judge)., After the caption (or after the table of contents if you created one) you will want to include a table of authorities, which is a list of all the legal authorities you cited to in your memorandum. The list should be separated by court cases, statutes, and other authoritative documents. When you draft your citations, make sure you transcribe them correctly. Next to each citation, include a list of page numbers where the citation can be found in your memorandum.


The table of authorities provides the judge with an easily identifiable list of the laws you used to base your motion on. The judge will appreciate having these citations in one place and it will allow him or her an easy way to look up cases and statutes if they have any questions.

, The introduction to your memorandum will directly follow the table of authorities. The introduction will lay the factual, legal, and procedural foundation of your motion for directed verdict. You should explain that the facts presented by the other party during trial did not meet the required burden of proof. You should explain that, under the law, you are able to file a motion for directed verdict and that it should be granted in this scenario. Make sure to include all of the important facts here in the introduction.


Do not make your legal arguments in the introduction. Leave the legal standards and the legal citations for the body of your memorandum.

, This is the most important part of your entire memorandum (and motion). When you create each argument, identify the appropriate legal authority, the opponent's burden of proof, and an explanation of why the other party did not satisfy that burden.The best way to organize each argument is usually to state your request, articulate the law, summarize the facts, and apply them in your argument.For example, assume you are a civil defendant and you believe a motion for directed verdict should be granted because the plaintiff did not meet his or her burden of proof during a negligence case. Your argument might be an expanded version of the following: ""The motion for directed verdict should be granted because plaintiff failed to adequately establish damages by a preponderance of the evidence. During plaintiff's case, he or she failed to introduce any evidence of damages caused as a result of any alleged breached duty. In a case for negligence, if no cognizable damages were sustained by plaintiff, no case can move forward.""

, The end of your memorandum needs to include a space for signatures and dates.Make sure you leave space for the signatures of everyone who helped you write the motion (e.g., attorneys). Every person who is eligible to appear in court and argue must sign the memorandum if they helped you create it.

, In addition to your notice and memorandum, you also need to draft a declaration, which is a sworn statement to the court promising that the facts you include in the declaration are true and accurate. The declaration will begin with a caption page that includes all of the required information. The title might be: ""Declaration in Support of Motion for Directed Verdict.""


The body of the declaration needs to provide your name and a declaration that the facts you are about to provide are true and accurate. The rest of the declaration will list the facts you are relying on in making the motion., This is an order the judge can sign if he or she decides to grant your motion for directed verdict. You will not sign this document and you only need to leave space for the judge to sign. The proposed order will begin with another caption page. The title can be: ""Proposed Order Granting Motion for Directed Verdict.""


The remainder of the proposed order can state something similar to the following: ""Having considered motion and finding good cause therefore, it is hereby ordered that motion for directed verdict is granted."", The final document in your motion will be a proof of service sheet that requires your server to swear that service was completed in accordance with the law. It will contain a caption page with an appropriate title (i.e., ""Proof of Service""). The body of the proof of service sheet will simply state that your server served the documents in the manner provided for by law. You will leave a space for your server to sign and date., Once all of the required documents that make up your motion have been drafted, you will need to collect the appropriate signatures in the appropriate spots. The proper signatures will be required before the motion is considered complete.


The notice will need to be signed by you and/or your attorney.
The memorandum will need to be signed by you and anyone that helped you create the memorandum.
The declaration will need to be signed by you.
The proposed order will not be signed.
The proof of service sheet will be signed by your server as soon as he or she completes service.

, Every document you file with the court will usually need to be served on the other party to your lawsuit. Before you file your motion for directed verdict, copies of the motion need to be served on the other party. At this stage of the litigation, it is usually sufficient to have someone over the age of 18 who is unrelated to the case mail a copy of the motion to the other party or his or her attorney.


Remember, once the server mails copies of the motion to the opposing party, make sure he or she signs the proof of service sheet and returns it to you.

, Once service is complete, you need to take the original motion and file it with the court where your trial is taking place. Be sure you look at the local rules to determine if the court requires you to file copies in addition to the original. For example, in the Central District of California, you are required to file the original plus two copies., At the time of filing you will also set a hearing date so the judge can hear arguments on your motion. The hearing date will also be used to set deadlines for the other party's response. The hearing date cannot be scheduled within a certain window of when you filed your motion. For example, in the Central District of California, the hearing date must be at least 31 days after the date you file your motion and serve the other party.


Some courts will allow you to schedule your hearing online while others may require you to call in or schedule in person., The other party will have an opportunity to respond to your motion by filing a memorandum in opposition. The other party's memorandum will look similar to yours but will contain counter-arguments to the arguments you provided in your motion. Read the response carefully as it will give you insight into how the other party is combating your motion.


Before you argue your positions in court, make sure you understand exactly why the other party thinks the motion should be denied. Take some time to create counter-arguments that you can use during oral arguments.

, The hearing you set may or may not be rescheduled or cancelled depending on your judge's schedule and opinion on the motion. Sometimes a judge will simply cancel the oral arguments and decide the motion on the written documents you and the other party provide.However, if the hearing is still on, make sure you arrive early so you have time to park and get through security. Once you get through security you will have to find the correct courtroom and wait for your case to get called.


Make sure you come prepared and bring copies of all documents relating to the motion., When the judge calls your case, walk to the front of the courtroom and prepare to argue your motion. The judge will likely ask questions about your motion and the other party's response. Speak clearly and be polite to the judge and the other party.Answer every questions completely and concisely. Be prepared to expand upon your arguments and make counter-arguments. Do not become flustered if the judge tries to poke holes in your arguments.

, The judge will also want the other party's perspective on your motion for directed verdict. When the judge asks the other party questions, listen carefully to the other party's answers and be prepared to counter them. However, never interrupt the other party while they are speaking. Wait until they are done and then ask the judge if you can respond., When the judge is finished hearing arguments, he or she will make a decision about your motion. Sometimes the judge will make a decision immediately while you and the other party are still in court. In other circumstances, the judge may want to take some time to deliberate. When the judge does make a decision, you will hear about it in court, through the mail, or by visiting the courthouse.If your motion for directed verdict is granted, the trial, or a portion of it, will end and judgment will be entered in your favor. If you lose, the trial will continue and the jury will have an opportunity to decide your case.

Be open to failure.,
Take charge of your ideas.,
Set goals.,
Collaborate and build strong partnerships.,
Practice your writing and reading skills.,
Develop your presentation skills.,
Maintain a balance between hard work and rest.",How to Be a Good Scientist," This is perhaps the most important step, as a love for science will motivate you to study, learn, and develop your ideas with passion and curiosity.No matter the profession, almost no one will be good at their job if they don’t go home at the end of the day feeling fulfilled by the work and feeling like they’ve contributed to something bigger than themselves.
If you love science and exploration, you are already one big step closer to becoming a good scientist, as it is always better to be yourself and do work within a niche that you enjoy and find fascinating.;
, A significant fraction of scientific discovery is the result of hard work and serendipity, or more bluntly, sheer luck. From the discovery of penicillin by Fleming to the discovery of new ionization techniques such as MALDI, luck has frequently played a large role in scientific discovery. So, don’t be afraid to tinker or play around with new ideas or with a new approach to an existing theory. You never know when experimentation and luck will collide to create a significant discovery.Often big discoveries come from noticing an inconsistency or oddity and then working hard to figure out what caused it. Avoid focusing on developing “genius” by approaching experiments the way you think they should be done and be willing to pursue the unusual or a new approach to a problem.
Maximize your exposure to chance occurrences and events, and don’t ignore little inconsistencies in your work. Instead, consider them and pursue them further to see where the unexpected might lead.

, Almost no scientific discovery just happens or occurs, in fact, as a scientist you need to have the patience to go through years of work, performing experiment after experiment, to prove your theory and verify your results.It’s important to also notice tiny observations and record them promptly. Categorizing and analyzing data is a huge part of being a scientist, so ensure you can do this efficiently and correctly.

, A good scientist will accept whatever outcome their work has and not try to force the results of an experiment into a predetermined opinion or theory. It is also essential that to bear in mind the facts and hypotheses from work done by other scientists as a resource to inform the results of your experiments.A good scientist will have good ethics and will not give false results or shade an experiment to fulfill the expected outcome. They should be open to the solutions made by others in their field, even when they conflict with their own theories., Though you may think a scientist should be brilliant, skilled in mathematics, and incredibly precise, one of the most important skills a good scientist should have is a willingness to fail.In today’s scientific world of limited scientific funding and competition for tenure-track jobs or a secure income, young scientists will likely be rejected more than accepted in the early stages of their career. It’s important to be prepared for failed experiments and time spent on research that does not get funding or lead to a definite theory.
Time that is seemingly wasted on a theory that goes nowhere may later prove to be time well spent. Through failure, you can build a strong work ethic, develop a creative approach to scientific study and be prepared for the moment when you succeed, rather than fail.

, Challenge yourself to come up with one idea related to your project a day. Though some of them will be bad or not as useful as others, many will be good and could lead to a new experiment or theory.Don’t be passive or shy about your ideas. As a scientist in a competitive field, you need to create your own opportunities by owning your ideas and working hard to develop them further.

, Take out a piece of paper or open a Word doc on your computer and create a list of goals based on the project you are investigating or experimenting with.Prioritize your goals by ranking them in order of importance. Though you may be tempted to go off on a tangent or deviate from your list of goals (which is also part of the exploratory nature of scientific discovery), try to home in on experiments that will get you closer to completing your goals.
As with any work, there are only so many hours in a day, so make smart decisions about how you spend your time achieving your scientific goals. This help you develop your time management skills and use your time efficiently and effectively., Debunk the idea of a lone genius toiling away at secret experiments, and look around the lab, the department, or in the field for someone you think you might want to work with and learn from. More often than not, you will do better work if you collaborate with someone else, or seek the advice of a mentor.In the scientific world, you will be expected to be able to work well independently and as part of a team, so having good participation and communication skills will only help you further your career and be successful.Examine your projects for areas where you don’t have the time or expertise to push them forward, and be willing to partner with someone to develop your project.Not only will building strong partnerships with other colleagues, peers, and professionals be mutually beneficial, it will also keep you humble and help you put your project or idea into perspective by sharing it with someone else., Create a writing process that works for you, like going into an area with peace and quiet or putting on Classical music to help you focus, and stick to it. Try to do a little writing every day, and put your ideas or thoughts down on the page so you get into the habit of recording your ideas, which could later end up in a published paper or in a lecture about your latest scientific theory.


It’s important to also read up on the work being done in your field of study, whether it’s a more specific publication like Astronomical Journal or a more general one like Science Today. Stay informed on the current topics in science and consider how you can build on the work of others in your field.

, Avoid a dry, boring talk full of complicated data and try to tell a story that is personal while also being informative and valuable.One technique is to start by discussing the reasons why you are doing scientific work, then lead into details about your failures and false starts, and then end with a dramatic conclusion that will leave the audience thinking about a theory or field of study in a new way.
A good scientist should be capable of explaining scientific ideas to a person who is not a scientist.So always consider your audience and try to demonstrate your enthusiasm for your field of study without being overly complicated or hard to understand.

, Though hard work is essential to being a good scientist, it’s important to strike a balance between professional work and personal down time.It may be tempting to spend 20 hours a day in the lab, developing your ideas, but sometimes the best thoughts come when the mind is at rest, or engaged in other activities that challenge your brain in a different way.
Making time for a hobby or activity outside of scientific work will allow you to de stress and perhaps also lead to a fresh perspective on a theory or thought you have been working on or struggling to solve."

The members of the legislative branch of government, who are responsible for creating laws, must be elected by the citizens of their states or districts. This includes legislators for the federal government and the governments of the state.The legislative branch of the federal government consists of the Senate and the House of Representatives.
There are 100 senators, two from each state, who are each elected to six-year terms. Candidates for Senate must be at least 30 years of age and a resident of the state they are running to represent. They also must have been U.S. citizens for at least seven years.
Senate terms are staggered so that every two years, voters have the opportunity to elect approximately one-third of the members of the Senate.
Seats in the House of Representatives are apportioned based on the populations of each state. While some states only have two representatives, more populous states can have as many as 40.
Representatives in the House serve two-year terms. The citizenship and residency requirements for representatives are the same as those for senators, but a candidate for the House only has to be 25 years old.;
, Representatives propose bills that they would like to see made into law. These bills may respond to the needs of the constituents they represent, or address problems in the state or country at large.Just because a bill is introduced by a particular member of congress doesn't necessarily mean that member wrote the bill.
While anyone can write a bill – even an ordinary citizen – it must be sponsored by sitting members of congress who can introduce the bill during a regular session.
Members of the executive branch, such as the President of the United States, also can author bills, but only a member of congress can introduce them.

, Once a bill is introduced, it is evaluated by a committee who specializes in that particular of law – for example, the bill may address economic or security issues. Each representative serves on committees according to their interests and areas of expertise.The number of committees, as well as their size and form, may change with each congressional session. The committees are organized to make the process of passing legislation more efficient.
Bills typically are first reviewed by a smaller, more specific subcommittee, which works on the bill before passing it up to the full committee along with their report on the bill.
Committees may accept a bill as it is, but they also have the ability to amend the bill or reject it entirely. As part of their deliberations, committees often engage in extensive investigations as to the costs and benefits of the bill as introduced.
If the committee approves the bill, it is forwarded to the majority party leadership, which decides whether and when to place the bill on the legislative body's calendar for consideration.

, After a bill makes it through the committee, it is debated on the floor of the legislative body in which it was introduced. These debates are a matter of public record and can get quite contentious, going on for several days.Many of these debates are broadcast free of charge. Watching a debate on television or online can give you a good understanding of a legislator's job and help you distinguish the legislative branch from the other two branches of government.
Debate is very structured in the House of Representatives, and many limits are imposed on how long a representative can speak, either for or against the pending legislation. Types of amendments that can be proposed from the House floor also are limited.
In contrast, Senate debate is a much looser process, with little to no restrictions on who can take the floor and for how long.
Senators also can introduce any amendment to the pending legislation, including those that would effectively nullify much of what the legislation attempts to do.

, When debate on a bill is closed, the bill is submitted to a vote. If a majority of the members vote to pass that bill, it is submitted either to the other legislative body or to the executive branch for signature into law.The Constitution requires bills to be passed by both the House and the Senate before they are submitted to the President.
Even though the bill will pass through committee and voting in both congressional bodies, the President is only supposed to have one bill on his or her desk – not two. However, both senators and representatives have the power to introduce amendments independent of each other.
In most cases, this means a joint committee must work with a version of the bill approved by the House and another one approved by the Senate to merge the two bills into one bill that represents the will of the majority of both legislative bodies.
Once the joint committee works up a report, both the House and the Senate will have the opportunity to vote on that final joint bill. If approved by both houses, this is the text of the bill that will be sent to the President for approval.

, Legislators confirm executive appointments and investigate wrongdoing by public officials. The legislative branch holds these powers as part of the checks and balances among the three branches that are built into the federal government by the Constitution.While the executive branch, through the office of the President, has the power to appoint judges and executive officials, these appointments must be confirmed by the Senate.
Most appointments are routine confirmations with little to no debate. However, confirmation hearings for certain positions, such as a seat on the Supreme Court, can last for weeks.
The legislature also has broad investigatory powers which may end in impeachment proceedings. An impeachment is a trial-like procedure in which the House takes on the role of prosecutor and the Senate becomes judge and jury.
Two-thirds of the Senators must vote to impeach an elected official. However, this is not a trial, and the only penalty imposed for impeachment is removal from office.
If the impeached official has violated civil or criminal laws, the judicial branch takes over to evaluate those violations and impose civil or criminal sanctions, which may include fines or jail time. However, this is separate from the impeachment process, which is fundamentally a legislative process despite its trial-like characteristics.

, After a bill is passed by the legislative branch, it is submitted to the executive branch – the President of the United States or the Governor of the state – for approval. The bill may be signed into law or vetoed.When the President signs a bill into law, their often is an elaborate ceremony which may be televised. The President typically gives a short speech explaining the benefits of the law.
The President doesn't have the authority to change the bill approved by Congress. Although he or she can suggest changes, those changes must be passed by the legislature.
The President also doesn't have the power to only veto portions of the bill – which would be tantamount to changing the bill that was passed by the legislature. He or she must either sign the entire bill into law, or veto the entire bill.
Some governors, however, do have the ability to veto specific portions of a bill and sign the remainder of the bill into law.
If the President vetoes a bill, Congress may attempt to override that veto and pass the bill into law anyway. Doing so requires the votes of two-thirds of the members of both houses.

, As the chief executive of the government, the President is responsible for nominating executive department officials and federal judges. Governors have similar responsibilities in their state governments.The President and vice President are the only members of the executive branch of government that are elected officials. Other high-ranking executives, such as the heads of departments, are appointed by the President.
Employees of the various departments are hired through a process similar to that of any other job. At some level above each employee in the hierarchy, however, there is someone who was appointed by the President.
While the President technically can nominate anyone for these offices that he or she wants, these appointments must be confirmed by the Senate. This is one of the ""checks"" the legislative branch has over the executive branch.
For this reason, the President typically chooses individuals who have a proven record of expertise and experience in the area the department governs, and who are more politically neutral.
However, keep in mind that only the executive branch can appoint these officials. While the legislative branch can deny confirmation, legislators cannot appoint someone else in their place.

, While the legislative branch is responsible for writing laws, various executive departments are responsible for enforcing those laws. This may include passing specific regulations that individuals and businesses must follow.In many areas, federal agencies work together with their state counterparts. For example, the Department of Education administers federal funding for state schools, and works together with state and local education authorities to regulate educational quality.
Other federal executive departments, such as the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Defense, deal with issues of national security, including domestic security as well as military actions.
Agencies such as the Department of Commerce and the Department of Labor handle business activities and employment relations. These departments frequently issue regulations that may have the force of law in terms of dictating the actions of business owners and other individuals.
The fact that executive departments can issue regulations can be confusing. However, you can distinguish this from traditional legislative activities in the sense that executive departments can only create regulations if they have been granted authority by a specific law passed by Congress.
In other words, executive departments can't just create any regulation they want – it must fall under the authority specifically granted to them by Congress. Laws may provide a general mandate, but Congress leaves it up to the executive departments to issue regulations to implement those general mandates in a specific way.

, State and federal law enforcement agencies, from the FBI down to local police departments, are considered a part of the executive branch of the government. These officers investigate and enforce criminal laws.To distinguish law enforcement officials in the executive branch from the legislative branch, remember that they are charged with enforcing the law as it stands on the books – not creating new laws or interpreting the law.
For example, if a police officer believes that a particular state law is unconstitutional, he still is duty-bound to enforce that law. It isn't his role to refuse on the grounds that the law is unconstitutional.
He could lobby to have the law repealed or changed, but this would be in his role as a private citizen and not considered part of his duties as a law enforcement officer. In fact, such activities may be restricted in some jurisdictions.
In some states and counties, sheriffs are elected by the population of the county in which the sheriff serves. However, the sheriff remains a law enforcement official – in many cases the highest law enforcement official in the county – and is not considered a member of the legislature.
While high-ranking officials in federal law enforcement may be appointed by the President, they typically serve longer terms than the President does to lend them independence from political motivations.
It's important to distinguish the investigation and prosecution of criminal activity through the executive branch from the legal activities of the judicial branch.
While prosecutors are lawyers, they are not judges, and they don't enter verdicts in criminal cases. Rather, they argue before the judge that the defendant is guilty.

, Executive departments administer various public benefits programs that have been established by law. This includes assessing eligibility of individuals as well as distributing those benefits.Public benefits such as Medicare and Social Security are distributed by government agencies under the executive branch.
Some benefits and services, such as food stamps, are administered by federal agencies, but distributed by comparable state agencies. The federal money is dispensed to the states, which are responsible for the ultimate dispersal to eligible individuals.
Eligibility for these programs is defined by laws, and the executive department that administers each program reviews applications and determines which individuals meet the eligibility requirements on a case-by-case basis.

, While some local judges are elected, most judges are appointed to serve by an executive official. In the federal judicial system, these are lifetime appointments made by the President and confirmed by the Senate.The lifetime appointment of federal judges is designed to shield them from political whims that may infiltrate both the legislative process and even enforcement of laws within the executive branch.
Once appointed, a federal judge can only be removed from office through the congressional impeachment process. Of course, a federal judge can opt to retire rather than serving until death – and many often do retire, although typically at a much older age than most people in private enterprise retire.
Congress also has the power to shape the size and structure of the federal judiciary, including establishing new courts as necessary.

, Trial court judges hear civil and criminal cases that are filed in their courts. This distinguishes the judicial branch from both the executive and the legislative branch, because they have no control over the facts that come before them or the issues they can decide.Courts typically are open to the public, and you can sit in on a court case if you want to observe a trial in session and learn more about the judicial process.
A judge can only make a decision on a case if someone files a complaint alleging that they have been wronged in some way. In contrast, the legislature can pass a law regardless of whether the issue they are legislating actually has any impact on anyone's life specifically.
Generally, federal courts hear cases involving federal law, while state courts hear cases involving state law.
Federal courts also may hear cases involving state law if the litigants involved are residents of different states, or if the amount of money in controversy is extremely large.

, After hearing evidence in a case, judges in the judicial branch identify the legal issues involved in the case. For jury trials, a jury made up of citizens makes a decision on the facts of the case.While the legislative branch enacts the laws, and the executive branch enforces the laws that have been enacted, the judicial branch interprets those laws and applies that interpretation to the facts of individual cases.
In jury trials, the judge provides that interpretation to the jury in the form of jury instructions. These instructions explain to the jury what their ruling should be based on the facts that either side has proven.
In this respect, juries don't make any legal decisions – they merely decide whether either party has met their applicable burden of proof.
For example, if a jury decides a criminal defendant is guilty, this means the prosecution has proven beyond a reasonable doubt the facts necessary to show a violation of the law.

, Appellate court judges examine the legal issues presented in lower court cases, where one of the parties alleges the lower court judge made a mistake in the law when the original decision was handed down.Judicial interpretation generally is governed by the legal principal of ""stare decisis,"" which is a Latin phrase meaning literally ""to stand by things decided."" This means courts generally adhere to their own precedents, or prior decisions.
If the court has already made a decision regarding the application of the law in question to similar facts, the court will follow that decision in the new case before it.
Much of the work of an appellate attorney consists of distinguishing their case from other cases the court has already decided. The attorney will point to ways in which the present case is different, and argue that those differences indicate the case is not governed by precedent.
The Supreme Court of the United States is the highest court in the country, and primarily reviews decisions that implicate issues of Constitutional interpretation.

Use a t table to evaluate significance.,
Consider a follow up study.",How to Assess Statistical Significance," The first step in assessing statistical significance is defining the question you want to answer and stating your hypothesis. The hypothesis is a statement about your experimental data and the differences that may be occurring in the population. For any experiment, there is both a null and an alternative hypothesis.Generally, you will be comparing two groups to see if they are the same or different.


The null hypothesis (H0) generally states that there is no difference between your two data sets. For example: Students who read the material before class do not get better final grades.
The alternative hypothesis (Ha) is the opposite of the null hypothesis and is the statement you are trying to support with your experimental data. For example: Students who read the material before class do get better final grades.;
, The significance level (also called alpha) is the threshold that you set to determine significance. If your p-value is less than or equal to the set significance level, the data is considered statistically significant.As a general rule, the significance level (or alpha) is commonly set to 0.05, meaning that the probability of observing the differences seen in your data by chance is just 5%.
A higher confidence level (and, thus, a lower p-value) means the results are more significant.
If you want higher confidence in your data, set the p-value lower to 0.01. Lower p-values are generally used in manufacturing when detecting flaws in products. It is very important to have high confidence that every part will work exactly as it is supposed to.
For most hypothesis-driven experiments, a significance level of 0.05 is acceptable.

, One of the assumptions a t-test makes is that your data is distributed normally. A normal distribution of data forms a bell curve with the majority of the samples falling in the middle.The t-test is a mathematical test to see if your data falls outside of the normal distribution, either above or below, in the “tails” of the curve.


If you are not sure if your data will be above or below the control group, use a two-tailed test. This allows you to test for significance in either direction.
If you know which direction you are expecting your data to trend towards, use a one-tailed test. In the given example, you expect the student’s grades to improve; therefore, you will use a one-tailed test.

, The power of a test is the probability of observing the expected result, given a specific sample size.The common threshold for power (or β) is 80%. A power analysis can be a bit tricky without some preliminary data, as you need some information about your expected means between each group and their standard deviations. Use a power analysis calculator online to determine the optimal sample size for your data.Researchers usually do a small pilot study to inform their power analysis and determine the sample size needed for a larger, comprehensive study.
If you do not have the means to do a complex pilot study, make some estimations about possible means based on reading the literature and studies that other individuals may have performed. This will give you a good place to start for sample size.

, The standard deviation is a measure of how spread out your data is. It gives you information on how similar each data point is within your sample. At first glance, the equation may seem a bit complicated, but these steps will walk you through the process of the calculation. The formula is s = √∑((xi – µ)2/(N – 1)).


s is the standard deviation.
∑ indicates that you will sum all of the sample values collected.
xi represents each individual value from your data.
µ is the average (or mean) of your data for each group.
N is the total sample number.

, To calculate the standard deviation, first you must take the average of the samples in the individual groups. The average is designated with the Greek letter mu or µ. To do this, simply add each sample together and then divide by the total number of samples.For example, to find the average grade of the group that read the material before class, let’s look at some data. For simplicity, we will use a dataset of 5 points: 90, 91, 85, 83, and 94.
Add all the samples together: 90 + 91 + 85 + 83 + 94 = 443.
Divide the sum by the sample number, N = 5: 443/5 = 88.6.
The average grade for this group is 88.6.

, The next part of the calculation involves the (xi – µ) portion of the equation. You will subtract each sample from the average just calculated. For our example you will end up with five subtractions.


(90 – 88.6), (91- 88.6), (85 – 88.6), (83 – 88.6), and (94 – 88.6).
The calculated numbers are now 1.4, 2.4, -3.6, -5.6, and 5.4.

, Each of the new numbers you have just calculated will now be squared. This step will also take care of any negative signs. If you have a negative sign after this step or at the end of your calculation, you may have forgotten this step.


In our example, we are now working with 1.96, 5.76, 12.96, 31.36, and 29.16.
Summing these squares together yields: 1.96 + 5.76 + 12.96 + 31.36 + 29.16 = 81.2.

, The formula divides by N – 1 because it is correcting for the fact that you haven’t counted an entire population; you are taking a sample of the population of all students to make an estimation.Subtract: N – 1 = 5 – 1 = 4
Divide: 81.2/4 = 20.3

, Once you have divided by the sample number minus one, take the square root of this final number. This is the last step in calculating the standard deviation. There are statistical programs that will do this calculation for you after inputting the raw data.


For our example, the standard deviation of the final grades of students who read before class is: s =√20.3 = 4.51.

, Up to this point, the example has only dealt with one of the sample groups. If you are trying to compare two groups, you will obviously have data from both. Calculate the standard deviation of the second group of samples and use that to calculate the variance between the two experimental groups. The formula for variance is sd = √((s1/N1) + (s2/N2)).sd is the variance between your groups.
s1 is the standard deviation of group 1 and N1 is the sample size of group 1.
s2 is the standard deviation of group 2 and N2 is the sample size of group 2.
For our example, let’s say the data from group 2 (students who didn’t read before class) had a sample size of 5 and a standard deviation of 5.81. The variance is:

sd = √((s1)2/N1) + ((s2)2/N2))
sd = √(((4.51)2/5) + ((5.81)2/5)) = √((20.34/5) + (33.76/5)) = √(4.07 + 6.75) = √10.82 = 3.29.



, A t-score allows you to convert your data into a form that allows you to compare it to other data. T-scores allow you to perform a t-test that lets you calculate the probability of two groups being significantly different from each other. The formula for a t-score is: t = (µ1 – µ2)/sd.µ1 is the average of the first group.
µ2 is the average of the second group.
sd is the variance between your samples.
Use the larger average as µ1 so you will not have a negative t-value.
For our example, let’s say the sample average for group 2 (those who didn’t read) was 80. The t-score is: t = (µ1 – µ2)/sd = (88.6 – 80)/3.29 = 2.61.

, When using the t-score, the number of degrees of freedom is determined using the sample size. Add up the number of samples from each group and then subtract two. For our example, the degrees of freedom (d.f.) are 8 because there are five samples in the first group and five samples in the second group ((5 + 5) – 2 = 8)., A table of t-scoresand degrees of freedom can be found in a standard statistics book or online. Look at the row containing the degrees of freedom for your data and find the p-value that corresponds to your t-score.


With 8 d.f. and a t-score of 2.61, the p-value for a one-tailed test falls between 0.01 and 0.025. Because we set our significance level less than or equal to 0.05, our data is statistically significant. With this data, we reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis:students who read the material before class get better final grades.

, Many researchers do a small pilot study with a few measurements to help them understand how to design a larger study. Doing another study, with more measurements, will help increase your confidence about your conclusion.

Change your footwear.,
Be careful about fabrics.,
Invest in anti-static wristbands.",How to Avoid (Static) Electric Shock1," Static electricity is generated whenever two materials come into contact with one another.Oftentimes, footwear scraping across fabrics and other surfaces generates electric shock. People tend to build up electrostatic charge when they walk around, but certain types of shoes can reduce the risk of shock.


Rubber is a powerful insulator. If you have carpeted floors, or work in a carpeted office, wearing rubber soled shoes greatly increases your chance of experiencing static shock. Opt for leather-soled shoes instead.Wool is also a good conductor, and can rub against fabrics to generate static charge. Try going for cotton socks over wool socks.;
, The type of clothing you wear can increase your risk of static shock. Certain fabrics are better at conducting electricity than others and should be avoided.


Layering in general, even with similar materials, can increase the likelihood of static shock as materials with different electron charges can interact to produce static shock.Synthetic fabrics, like polyester, conduct electricity well. Limiting the use of such materials in your personal wardrobe can reduce risk of static shock.Wool sweaters and wool clothing in general, tend to produce a more static shock. Opt for cotton when possible., Some companies sell wristbands you can wear to reduce your risk of static shock. If altering your clothing and footwear does not work, this might be a wise investment.


Static shock bracelets work using a process called passive ionization. The conductive fibers found in the bracelet will flow off the strings and into your wrist, reducing the voltage in your body, and therefore, the intensity of static shocks.Static shock bracelets are relatively inexpensive. They usually cost under $10.

Test your hypothesis.",How to Write a Hypothesis," Pick a topic that interests you, and that you think it would be good to know more about.


If you are writing a hypothesis for a school assignment, this step may be taken care of for you.;
, Gather all the information you can about the topic you've selected. You'll need to become an expert on the subject and develop a good grasp of what is already known about the topic.


Focus on academic and scholarly writing. You need to be certain that your information is unbiased, accurate, and comprehensive.
You can find information in textbooks, at a library, and online. If you are in school, you can also ask for help from teachers, librarians, and your peers.

, Spend some time reading the materials you've collected. As you do so, look for and make note of unanswered questions in the literature. These can provide excellent ideas for areas to investigate.


For example, if you are interested in the effects of caffeine on the human body, but notice that nobody seems to have explored whether caffeine affects males differently than it does females, this could be something to formulate a hypothesis about. Or, if you are interested in organic farming, you might notice that no one has tested whether organic fertilizer results in different growth rates for plants than non-organic fertilizer.
You can sometimes find holes in the existing literature by looking for statements like “it is unknown” or places where information is clearly missing. You might also find a claim in the literature that seems far-fetched, unlikely, or too good to be true, like that caffeine improves math skills. If the claim is testable, you could provide a great service to scientific knowledge by doing your own investigation. If you confirm the claim, the claim becomes even more credible. If you do not find support for the claim, you are helping with the necessary self-correcting aspect of science.
Examining these types of questions provides an excellent way for you to set yourself apart by filling in important gaps in a field of study.

, After studying the literature on your topic, generate one or more unanswered questions you'd be interested in exploring further. These are your research questions.


Following the examples above, you might ask: ""How does caffeine affect females as compared to males?"" or ""How does organic fertilizer affect plant growth compared to non-organic fertilizer?"" The rest of your research will be aimed at answering these questions.

, Once you have generated your research question or questions, look in the literature to see if the existing findings and/or theories about the topic provide any clues that would allow you to come up with ideas about what the answers to your research questions might be. If so, these clues can form the basis for your hypothesis.

Following the examples above, if you discover in the literature that there is a pattern that some other types of stimulants seem to affect females more than males, this could be a clue that the same pattern might be true for caffeine. Similarly, if you observe the pattern that organic fertilizer seems to be associated with smaller plants overall, you might explain this pattern with the hypothesis that plants exposed to organic fertilizer grow more slowly than plants exposed to non-organic fertilizer.

, A generalizing hypothesis describes a pattern you think may exist between two variables: an independent variable and a dependent variable. If your experiments confirm the pattern, you may decide to suggest a reason that the pattern exists or a mechanism that generates the pattern. The reason or mechanism you suggest is an explanatory hypothesis.


You can think of the independent variable as the one that is causing some kind of difference or effect to occur. In the examples, the independent variable would be biological sex, i.e. whether a person is male or female, and fertilizer type, i.e. whether the fertilizer is organic or non-organically-based.
The dependent variable is what is affected by (i.e. ""depends"" on) the independent variable. In the examples above, the dependent variable would be the measured impact of caffeine or fertilizer.
Your hypothesis should only suggest one relationship. Most importantly, it should only have one independent variable. If you have more than one, you won't be able to determine which one is actually the source of any effects you might observe.

, Once you've spent some time thinking about your research question and variables, write down your initial idea about how the variables might be related as a simple declarative statement.


Don't worry too much at this point about being precise or detailed.
In the examples above, one hypothesis would make a statement about whether a person's biological sex might impact the way the person is affected by caffeine; for example, at this point, your hypothesis might simply be: ""a person's biological sex is related to how caffeine affects his or her heart rate."" The other hypothesis would make a general statement about plant growth and fertilizer; for example your simple explanatory hypothesis might be ""plants given different types of fertilizer are different sizes because they grow at different rates.""

, Hypotheses can either be directional or non-directional. A non-directional hypothesis simply says that one variable affects the other in some way, but does not say specifically in what way. A directional hypothesis provides more information about the nature (or ""direction"") of the relationship, stating specifically how one variable affects the other.


Using our example, our non-directional hypotheses would be ""there is a relationship between a person's biological sex and how much caffeine increases the person's heart rate,"" and ""there is a relationship between fertilizer type and the speed at which plants grow.""
Directional predictions using the same example hypotheses above would be : ""Females will experience a greater increase in heart rate after consuming caffeine than will males,"" and ""plants fertilized with non-organic fertilizer will grow faster than those fertilized with organic fertilizer."" Indeed, these predictions and the hypotheses that allow for them are very different kinds of statements. More on this distinction below.
If the literature provides any basis for making a directional prediction, it is better to do so, because it provides more information. Especially in the physical sciences, non-directional predictions are often seen as inadequate.

, Once you have an initial idea on paper, it's time to start refining. Make your hypotheses as specific as you can, so it's clear exactly what ideas you will be testing and make your predictions specific and measurable so that they provide evidence of a relationship between the variables.


Where necessary, specify the population (i.e. the people or things) about which you hope to uncover new knowledge. For example, if you were only interested the effects of caffeine on elderly people, your prediction might read: ""Females over the age of 65 will experience a greater increase in heart rate than will males of the same age."" If you were interested only in how fertilizer affects tomato plants, your prediction might read: ""Tomato plants treated with non-organic fertilizer will grow faster in the first three months than will tomato plants treated with organic fertilizer.""

, Your hypothesis must suggest a relationship between two variables or a reason that two variables are related that can feasibly be observed and measured in the real and observable world.


For example, you would not want to make the hypothesis: ""red is the prettiest color."" This statement is an opinion and it cannot be tested with an experiment. However, proposing the generalizing hypothesis that red is the most popular color is testable with a simple random survey. If you do indeed confirm that red is the most popular color, your next step may be to ask: Why is red the most popular color? The answer you propose is your explanatory hypothesis.
Often, hypotheses are stated in the form of if-then sentences. For example, ""if children are given caffeine, then their heart rates will increase."" This statement is not a hypothesis. This kind of statement is a brief description of an experimental method followed by a prediction and is the most common way that hypotheses are misrepresented in science education. An easy way to get to the hypothesis for this method and prediction is to ask yourself why you think heart rates will increase if children are given caffeine. Your explanatory hypothesis in this case may be that caffeine is a stimulant. At this point, some scientists write what is called a research hypothesis, a statement that includes the hypothesis, the experiment, and the prediction all in one statement: If caffeine is a stimulant, and some children are given a drink with caffeine while others are given a drink without caffeine, then the heart rates of those children given a caffeinated drink will increase more than the heart rate of children given a non-caffeinated drink.

It may sound strange, but researchers rarely ever prove that a hypothesis is right or wrong. Instead, they look for evidence that the opposite of their hypotheses is probably not true. If the opposite (caffeine is not a stimulant) is probably not true, the hypothesis (caffeine is a stimulant) probably is true.
Using the above example, if you were to test the effects of caffeine on the heart rates of children, evidence that your hypothesis is not true, sometimes called the null hypothesis, could occur if the heart rates of both the children given the caffeinated drink and the children given the non-caffeinated drink (called the placebo control) did not change, or lowered or raised with the same magnitude, if there was no difference between the two groups of children. If you wanted to test the effects of different fertilizer types, evidence that your hypothesis was not true would be that the plants grew at the same rate, regardless of fertilizer, or if plants treated with organic fertilizer grew faster. It is important to note here that the null hypothesis actually becomes much more useful when researchers test the significance of their results with statistics. When statistics are used on the results of an experiment, a researcher is testing the idea of the null statistical hypothesis. For example, that there is no relationship between two variables or that there is no difference between two groups., Make your observations or conduct your experiment. Your evidence may allow you to reject your null hypotheses, thus lending support to your experimental hypothesis. However, your evidence may not allow you to reject your null hypothesis and this is okay. Any result is important, even when your result sends you back to the drawing board. Constantly having to go ""back to the drawing board"" and refine your ideas is how authentic science really works!"

Choose the right isotope.,
Get enough of the isotope to ensure fission will continue after the first atom is split.,
Fire one atomic nucleus of the same isotope at another.,
Bombard the nuclei of the fissile isotope with subatomic particles.",How to Split an Atom1," Some elements or isotopes of elements undergo radioactive decay. Not all isotopes are created equal when it comes to being readily split, however. The most common isotope of uranium has an atomic weight of 238, consisting of 92 protons and 146 neutrons, but these nuclei tend to absorb neutrons without being split into smaller nuclei of other elements. An isotope of uranium with three fewer neutrons, 235U, can much more readily be split apart than can 238U; such an isotope is called fissile.When uranium splits (undergoes fission) it releases three neutrons that collide with other uranium atoms, thus creating a chain reaction.
Some isotopes can be split too readily, so fast that a continuous fission reaction can’t be maintained. This is called spontaneous fission; the plutonium isotope 240Pu is such an isotope, unlike the isotope 239Pu with its slower fission rate.;
, This requires having a certain minimum amount of the fissile isotope to make the fission reaction sustainable; this is called critical mass. Achieving critical mass requires enough of source material for the isotope to increase the chances of fission occurring., Because loose subatomic particles are difficult to come by, it’s often necessary to force them out of the atoms they’re part of. One method of doing this is firing atoms of a given isotope against other atoms of that same isotope.This method was used to create the 235U atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima. A gun-like weapon with a uranium core fired 235U atoms at another piece of 235U bearing material fast enough to have the neutrons they released naturally slam into the nuclei of other 235U atoms and break them apart. The neutrons released when the atoms split would, in turn, strike and split other 235U atoms.

, A single subatomic particle can strike an atom of 235U, splitting it into two separate atoms of other elements and releasing three neutrons. These particles can come from a moderated source (e.g. a neutron gun) or can be generated when nuclei collide. Three types of subatomic particles are commonly used.Protons. These subatomic particles have mass and a positive charge. The number of protons in an atom determines what element the atom is.
Neutrons. These subatomic particles have the mass as protons but no charge.
Alpha particles. These particles are the nuclei of helium atoms, shorn of their orbiting electrons. They consist of two protons and two neutrons.

Humidify your home.,
Treat your carpeting.,
Adjust your bedsheets.",How to Avoid (Static) Electric Shock2," Static shocks are more likely to occur in dry environments. Keeping your home humid can reduce your risk.


Ideally, your home should be above 30% rh, or relative humidity. You can measure the humidity of your home by purchasing a humidity thermometer online or at a hardware or grocery store.Raising the air humidity to 40 or 50% rh can help reduce static shock. You should aim for this range.Humidifiers range in price. Large humidifiers, designed to work in a large space, can cost over $100. However, a humidifier for a single room might only be $10 or $20.

, Having carpeting at home instead of wood floors puts you at greater risk for static shock. Certain measures can be taken to make your carpet less conductive to static electricity.


Rubbing fabric softener sheets over the carpet can prevent the build up of static electricity but such methods do not have a permanent effect. Try repeating the process once a week.You can also place cotton rugs on areas of the carpet that you walk across frequently as cotton is less likely than certain fabrics to conduct electricity and cause static shock., If you're getting electric shocks in bed, adjusting your bedding might help.


Opt for materials like cotton over synthetic fabrics or wool.Try not to layer sheets, as fabrics rubbing together can cause static buildup. If your bedroom is warm enough, you may be able to ditch your top sheet or blanket.

Moisturize your skin before going out.,
Take precautions shopping.,
Avoid static shock when getting out of the car.",How to Avoid (Static) Electric Shock3," Excessively dry skin, especially dry hands, increases the risk of static shock. Always moisturize your skin before you go out.


If you wear panty hoes or silk lining, make sure you moisturize your legs before getting dressed to go out.Keep a travel sized bottle of lotion in your purse or backpack in case your skin gets dry at work or school. Be especially careful to remember lotion during months, where dry skin is a common ailment.

, Many people experience static shock when shopping. There are measures you can take to reduce the effect.


When pushing a cart, hold onto to something metal like your house keys. This discharges any energy you build up walking before you touch anything with your bare hands.Wear leather soled shoes over rubber soled shoes when shopping, as the former are less likely to conduct electricity., Static shock is common in cars. There are ways you can avoid getting shocked when leaving your car.


Sitting in the car generates electrostatic charges because of the constant friction and motion caused by the movement of the car itself. When you leave the seat of your car, you take some of this charge with you. Your body voltage ends up rising when you exit a car.The voltage discharges when you touch the car door, causing a painful static shock. You can prevent this by holding onto a metal part of the door frame as you leave your seat. The voltage will dissipate into the metal painlessly.You can also hold your keys before touching the car door, allowing the voltage to move to the metal in your keys without causing you any pain."

Obtain a critical mass of a radioactive isotope.,
Enrich the isotope.,
Squeeze the atomic sample tight, bringing fissile atoms closer together.",How to Split an Atom2," You will need enough raw material to make sure that the fission continues. Keep in mind that in a given sample of some element (plutonium for example), you will have more than one isotope. Make sure that you have calculated how much of the desired fissile isotope is in your sample., Sometimes, it is necessary to increase the relative amount of fissile isotope in a sample to ensure a sustainable fission reaction occurs. This is called enrichment. There are several ways to enrich radioactive materials. Some of these are:Gas Diffusion
Centrifuge
Electromagnetic Separation
Liquid Thermal Diffusion

, Sometimes, atoms decay too fast on their own to be fired at one another. In this case, bringing the atoms closer together increases the chance of released subatomic particles striking and splitting other atoms. This can be done by using explosives to force the fissile atoms close together.239Pu atoms.This method was used to create the 239Pu atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki. Conventional explosives ringed a mass of plutonium; when detonated, they pushed the plutonium mass together, bringing the 239Pu atoms close enough together that the neutrons they released would continuously strike and split other plutonium atoms.

Encase radioactive materials in metal.,
Excite electrons with laser light.,
Stop the laser.",How to Split an Atom3," Place your radioactive material in a gold casing. Use a copper holder to fasten the casing into place. Keep in mind that both the fissile and the metals will become radioactive once fission takes place., With the development of petawatt (1015 watt) lasers, it is now possible to split atoms by using laser light to excite electrons in metals encasing a radioactive substance. Similarly, you could use a 50 terawatt (5 x 1012 watt) laser to excite the electrons in the metal., When the electrons return to their regular orbits, they release high-energy gamma radiation that penetrates the gold and copper nuclei. This will liberate neutrons from those nuclei. Those neutrons will then collide with the uranium underneath the gold splitting the uranium atoms. "

Choose your style.,
Give yourself a quirky hair style.,
Be outgoing and charming.One variation of the mad scientist is not a recluse, but is instead an outgoing, extroverted, smooth talker.,
Be driven.Mad scientists direct their focus on at least one problem that really engages their attention.",How to Act Like a Mad Scientist1," When asked what a mad scientist looks like, many people envision a wild-eyed fellow in a tattered lab coat. However, mad scientists actually have a wide variety of stylish options open to them.Mad scientists usually conform to one of two distinct styles:


Dapper and well-dressed, like Nikola Tesla. Tesla was one of the finest scientific minds of his day, but he also believed he had contacted aliens and believed he was in a mutual love affair with a pigeon.
A typical mad scientist of the type described above. Dress in a shabby lab coat. This style evokes Mary Shelley’s classic character Dr. Frankenstein, as well as certain incarnations of Spiderman’s foe Doctor Octopus.
If you do not wish to adjust your style of clothing to act like a mad scientist, that’s okay. If you’re trying to act like a mad scientist for a Halloween party or a theater production, though, dressing the part will help you get into the role.;
, Albert Einstein, for instance, was not a mad scientist, but his hair was often mussed and wild-looking.Capture this eccentricity when acting like a mad scientist. Grow your hair out to at least a medium length. Pull your hair up and out to give yourself a zany look. Fix it in place with hair gel or hair spray.

, Learn to listen to others and talk to them about what they want to talk about. Be persuasive. Ask people what they need and how you can help. Compliment others on their ideas and style. Make yourself someone that others want to be around because you are so pleasant and intriguing.Don’t dominate a conversation. Nod when others talk to show you are listening.
Do not your powers of persuasion and social skills to manipulate others.
This type of mad scientist cons people into thinking he is harmless when in fact, he has diabolical schemes in the works.
Certain incarnations of Lex Luthor best exemplify how this characteristic looks in mad scientists.

, To capture or recreate this feeling for yourself, identify an area of your own life that you wish was different. Devote yourself to making a positive change.


You might realize that your community has widespread poverty and decide to volunteer regularly at your local soup kitchen.
Perhaps you’ll realize that your school is underfunded and start a crowdfunding effort or engage in other entrepreneurial activity to help improve the quality of your school.
Instead of following the mad scientist method of correcting the wrong or meeting your goals no matter what, use a reasonable, measured approach when acting on whatever it is that really drives you.

The most common fields for mad scientists are biology, mechanical engineering, and biotechnology.
On the other hand, relatively few mad scientists have backgrounds in chemistry, psychology, and neuroscience.
If you don’t want to take your act all the way and get a PhD in the scientific field of your choice, that’s understandable.

, In this respect, mad scientists are not so different from regular scientists. Look for areas in your own research where you could try some outside-the-box thinking and experimentation (within limits).


What makes the mad scientist a despised and evil character is their tendency to pursue research even when it is unethical or causes harm. Mad scientists pursue new research and experiments not for the good of all mankind, but to accumulate power and satisfy their own desire to know or do something just because they can.
Do not take unreasonable or unnecessary risks. Remember, acting like a mad scientist doesn’t mean actually becoming a mad scientist.

Use this method to find the height of a tree without doing any math.,
Fold a piece of paper in half so that it forms a triangle.,
Hold the triangle in front of one eye.,
Move back from the tree until you can sight the top of the tree at the top tip of the triangle.,
Mark this spot and measure the distance from it to the base of the tree.",How to Measure the Height of a Tree1," All you need for this method is a piece of paper and a tape measure. No calculations are necessary; however, if you're interested in how this works, you might need to know a little trigonometry.


The method Using a Clinometer or Transit goes into the full calculations and reasons why this work, but you don't need to go into it to find the height using this method.;
, If the paper is rectangular (not square), you'll have to make a rectangular sheet of paper into a square. Fold one corner over so it forms a triangle with the opposite side, then cut off the extra paper above the triangle. You should be left with the triangle you need.


The triangle will have one right (90 degree) angle and two 45 degree angles.

, Hold the square corner (the 90º right angle) and point the rest of the triangle toward you. One of the short sides should be horizontal (flat), and the other should be vertical (pointing straight up). You should be able to look up along the longest side by raising your eyes.


The longest side, the one you'll be looking along, is called the hypotenuse of the triangle.

, Close one eye and use the other to look directly along the longest side of the triangle, until you see the exact top of the tree. You want to find the point where your line of sight follows the longest side of the triangle to the very top of the tree.

, This distance is almost the full height of the tree. Add your own height to this, since you were looking at the tree from the height of your eyes off the ground. Now you have the full answer!


To learn how this works, see the ""Using a Clinometer or Transit"" section. You don't need to do any calculations in this method, because there's a little trick: the tangent of a 45º angle (which you used) equals 1. The equation can be simplified to this: (Height of tree) / (distance from tree) = 1. Multiple each side by (distance from tree) and you get: Height of tree = distance from tree.

Shorten the lever arm.,
Find smaller wheels.,
Increase the size of the axle.,
Increase traction.,
Keep on trying.",How to Adapt a Mousetrap Car for Speed1," Installing a shorter lever arm is the best way to adapt a racer for speed. However, if the lever is too short, it will spin out. There is no precise formula for how long the lever should be. Experiment to see how short you can get the lever while maintaining control of the car. Longer lever arms will extend the time in which the axle is pulled. This will make it travel longer distances before the car reaches maximum speed. As a result, it will go slower, but move further. Which is why the length of the lever arm is the most important factor in whether a racer is fitted for distance or speed. ;
, When you increase the size of the wheel, the amount of torque necessary to begin a rotation increases as well. A smaller wheel is easier to turn. So you should make sure that your driving (front) wheel is as small as possible. A good standard is approximately 3 inches in diameter. Use materials that are as lightweight as possible.A larger wheel means more rotational inertia, which keeps the wheel moving once it gets going, but reduces acceleration.
As with the shorter axis, a smaller wheel is a trade-off between distance and speed. The overall distance traveled will decrease as you reduce the size of the driving wheel.
As with most features of a mousetrap racer, performance can vary even when using very similar specs. You always need to experiment to determine what the most functional design is.

, The greater the ratio of the diameter of the axle to the wheel, the less force will be required to accelerate the car. In other words, you should match a larger axle with a smaller wheel to increase acceleration.


Conversely, a mousetrap racer built for distance should have a smaller axle and a larger driving wheel.One easy way to adapt the size of the axle is to wrap tape around it. You don't need to wrap tape around the entire length of the axle, which would likely be counterproductive, because it would increase friction. Just wrap tape around the center of the axle, where it does not come into contact with the frame. This added weight will increase the torque of the axle. You can easily experiment to find the correct amount of torque by adding and removing layers of tape., For the wheel to pick up speed it needs to create pressure against the ground. For the wheel, use a material with a rough texture around the outside to give the wheel traction. Alternatively, cut something that has a rough surface such as a rubber balloon. Glue strips of this material to the outside of the wheel to give it traction., There are so many variables involved in the physics of a mousetrap racer that even similarly built cars operate differently. The only way to perfect your model is to experiment with small variations in design to determine what works best.


Similarly study mousetrap racers that have won competitions in the past. Learn from designs that you know work."

Use this method if you only have a tape measure or ruler.,
Measure your height.,
Stand on sunny, flat ground near the tree.,
Measure the length of your shadow.,
Measure the length of the tree’s shadow.,
Add 1/2 the tree's width to the length of the tree's shadow.,
Calculate the tree’s height using the numbers you wrote down.",How to Measure the Height of a Tree2," You don't need any other equipment to use this method, and you should get an accurate estimate of how tall the tree is. You will need to do multiplication and division problems, but no other math.


If you want to avoid doing any math at all, you can use a tree height calculator online, such as this one, and enter the measurements you find using this method.

, Use a tape measure or yardstick (meter ruler) to measure your height while standing straight. Do this while wearing the shoes you will be wearing to perform this method. Since you'll need a piece of paper anyway, write your height down so you don't forget the exact number.


You'll need a single number, such as your height in inches, not a combination of feet and inches. If you're not sure how to convert into one number, you can use the height of a yardstick or meter ruler standing vertical instead (3 feet or 1 meter). Use the ruler's height and the length of the ruler's shadow anytime you are asked to use
If you are in a wheelchair or cannot stand straight for another reason, measure your height in whatever position you'll be in when you go outside to measure the tree.

, Try to find a spot where your shadow falls along flat ground so you can get an accurate measurement. For best results, do this method on a bright, sunny day. If the sky is overcast, it may be difficult to precisely measure the shadows.

, Use a tape measure or yardstick (meter ruler) to measure the distance from your heels to the tip of your shadow. If you don’t have someone to assist you, you can mark the end of the shadow by tossing a rock onto it while you’re standing. Or better yet, place the rock anywhere on the ground, and then position yourself so the tip of your shadow is at the rock; then measure from where you're standing to the rock.


Write down and label each measurement you make right after you make it, to avoid confusing them with each other.

, Use your measuring tape to determine the length of the tree’s shadow from the base of the tree to the tip of the shadow. This works best if the ground all along the shadow is fairly level; if the tree is on a slope, for example, your measurement won’t be as accurate.Do this immediately after you've measured your shadow, since the sun's movement will cause the shadow length to change.


If the tree's shadow is on a slope, there might be a different time of day when the shadow avoids the slope either by being shorter or by pointing in the other direction.

, Most trees grow straight upwards, so the highest tip of the tree should be above the exact middle of the tree. To get the total length of its shadow, you should add 1/2 the diameter of the tree trunk to your shadow measurement.This is because the highest tip is actually causing a longer shadow than you measured; some of it is just falling over the top of the tree trunk where you can't see it.


Measure the width of the trunk with a long ruler or straight tape measure, then divide by 2 to get 1/2 the tree's width. If you're having trouble seeing how wide the trunk is, draw a tight square around the base of the trunk and measure one side of that square.

, You should now have three numbers written down: your height, your shadow's length, and the length of the tree's shadow (including 1/2 its trunk width). Shadow lengths are proportional to the height of the object. In other words, (your shadow's length) divided by (your height) will always equal (the tree's shadow's length) divided by (the tree's height). We can use this equation to find out the tree's height:


Multiply the length of the tree’s shadow by your height. If you are 5 feet (1.5 meters) tall, and the tree's shadow is 100 feet (30.48 meters) long, multiple them together: 5 x 100 = 500 (or for the meter measurements, 1.5 x 30.48 = 45.72).
Divide the answer by the length of your shadow. Using the example above, if your shadow is 8 feet (2.4 meters) long, divide your answer by that number. 500 / 8 = 62.5 feet (or in metric, 45.72 / 2.4 = 19.05 meters).
If you're having trouble with the math, find a tree height calculator online such as this one.

Use this method as an alternative to the shadow method.,
Stand far enough from the tree so you can view the whole tree—top to bottom—without moving your head.,
Hold a pencil at arm's length.,
Close one eye and adjust the pencil up or down so that you can sight the very top of the tree at the top of the pencil.,
Move your thumb up or down the pencil so that the tip of your thumbnail is aligned with the tree’s base.,
Rotate your arm so that the pencil is horizontal (parallel to the ground).,
Have your friend move so that you can sight him or her “through” the point of your pencil.,
If you have a tape measure with you, measure the distance between your friend and the tree.,
If you don't have a tape measure with you, mark the height of your friend and the height of the tree on the pencil.,
Find the answer once you have access to a tape measure.",How to Measure the Height of a Tree3," While this method is less accurate, you can use it when the shadow method won't work, such as on an overcast day. Also, if you have a tape measure with you, you can avoid having to do math. Otherwise, you'll need to find a tape measure later and do some simple multiplication problems.

, For the most accurate measurement, you should stand so that you are on a piece of ground that is about level with the ground at the tree’s base, not higher or lower. Your view of the tree should be as unobstructed as possible.

, You can use any small, straight object, such as a paint stick or ruler. Hold it in one hand and stretch your arm out so that the pencil is at arm’s length in front of you (between you and the tree).

, This is easiest if you turn the pencil so that the sharpened point is pointing straight up. The tip of the pencil should thus just cover the top of the tree in your line of sight as you look at the tree “through” the pencil.

, While holding the pencil in position so that the tip is aligned with the tree’s top (as in step 3), move your thumb to the point on the pencil that covers the point (again, as you look “through” the pencil with one eye) where the tree meets the ground. Now the pencil is ""covering"" the entire height of the tree, from the base to the tip., Keep your arm held straight out at the same distance, and make sure your thumbnail is still aligned with the tree’s base. The thumb should be even with the center of the bottom of the tree., That is, your friend’s feet should be aligned with the pencil’s tip. He or she should be about the same distance from you as the tree is, not further away or closer toward you. Since, depending on the height of the tree, you may need to be some distance away from your friend, consider using hand signals (with the hand that is not holding the pencil) to tell him or her to go farther, come closer, or move to the left or right., Have your friend remain in the place or mark the spot with a stick or rock. Then use a measuring tape to measure the distance between that spot and the base of the tree. The distance between your friend and the tree is the height of the tree.

, Scratch or draw a mark on the pencil where your thumbnail is; this is how long the tree appears from your perspective. Use the same method as before to arrange the pencil so it covers your friend, with the tip at your friend's head and your thumbnail at his or her feet. Make a second mark at this position of your thumbnail., You'll need to measure the length of each mark and the height of your friend, but you can do this after you go home, without having to return to the tree. Scale the difference in lengths on the pencil up to your friend's height. For instance, if the mark showing your friend's height is 2 inches (5 cm) from the tip and the mark for the tree's height is 7 inches (17.5 cm), then the tree is 3.5 times as tall as your friend, since 7 inches / 2 inches = 3.5 (17.5 cm / 5 cm = 3.5). If your friend is 6 feet (180 cm) tall, the tree is 6 x 3.5 = 21 feet tall (180 cm x 3.5 = 630 cm).


Note: If you do have a tape measure with you when you're near the tree, you do not need to do any calculations. Read the step above for ""if you have a tape measure"" carefully.

Use this method to get a more accurate measurement.,
Measure the distance to a sighting position.,
Measure the angle of elevation to the tree’s top.,
Find the tangent of the angle of elevation.,
Multiply your distance from the tree by the tangent of the angle of elevation.,
Add your height to the height you calculated in the previous step.",How to Measure the Height of a Tree4," The other methods are surprisingly accurate, but with a little more math and specialized tools you can get a more accurate reading. It's not as daunting as it sounds: all you need is a calculator that can calculate tangents, and a cheap plastic protractor, straw, and piece of string so you can Make a Clinometer yourself. A clinometer measures the slope of objects, or in this case the angle between you and the top of the tree. A transit is a more complicated tool used for the same purpose, but uses a telescope or laser to achieve more accuracy.


The Piece of Paper method actually uses a piece of paper as a clinometer. This method, besides being more accurate, allows you to measure the height from any distance, instead of moving forward and backward to get the paper to line up with the tree.

, Stand with your back to the tree and walk out to a point that is approximately level with the ground at the tree’s base and from which you can clearly see the tree’s top. Walk in a straight line, and use a measuring tape to measure your distance from the tree. You need not stand any set distance from the tree, but this method generally works best if your distance from the tree is about 1-1.5 times the height of the tree.

, Sight the top of the tree and use a clinometer or transit to measure the ""angle of elevation"" between the tree and the ground. The angle of elevation is the angle formed between two lines—the flat plane of the ground and your sight line, to some elevated point (in this case, the tree’s top) — with you as the vertex of the angle.

, You can find the tangent of an angle using a calculator or table of trigonometric functions. The method for finding the tangent may differ depending on your calculator, but usually you just push the “TAN” button, enter the angle, and then press the “equal” button (=). Thus if the angle of elevation is 60 degrees, you simply push “TAN” and then enter “60” and then press the equal sign.



Click this link to go to an online tangent calculator.
The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is defined by the side opposite the angle, divided by the side adjacent to the angle. In this case, the opposite side is the height of the tree, and the adjacent side is your distance from the tree., Remember, you measured your distance from the tree at the beginning of this method. Multiply it by the tangent you calculated. The resulting number tells you how high the tree is above your eye level, since that's the level you calculated the tangent from.


If you read the earlier substep about the definition of the tangent, you can see why this method works. As described earlier, the tangent = (tree's height) / (distance to tree). Multiply each side of the equation by the (distance to tree) and you get (tangent) x (distance to tree) = (the tree's height)!

, Now you have the height of the tree. Since you used the clinometer or transit at eye level, not ground level, add your height to the measurement to get the total height of the tree. You can get a more accurate result by measuring your height at eye level, not to the top of your head.


If you are using a stationary transit, add the height from the transit eyepiece to the ground, not your own height.

Limit air resistance.,
Eliminate friction between the axle and the frame.",How to Adapt a Mousetrap Car for Speed2," Reducing the weight will lower rolling friction with the ground. Trim the deck down so it is only as large as necessary to support the mousetrap. When gluing down the deck, put it as close to the back wheels as possible without touching them.


Drill holes in nonessential components to reduce weight. Consider drilling holes in the frame and the wheels.The material used for the frame of the car should be as lightweight and as rigid as possible. Consider bamboo, balsa wood, or foam.Use glue whenever you need to attach something. Tape can be used too, but glue is smoother and weighs less. Whatever you do, don't use metal bolts. They add weight.

, A complicated system of gears and pulleys can be useful when building a racer for distance, because they increase the overall torque. However, when building for speed, they principally serve to create more friction between the components. Consider connecting the lever directly to the axle when building a car for speed., As speed increases, so too does air resistance, making it a progressively more likely to stop your car in its tracks. To prevent this from happening, make sure that as little surface area as possible is exposed. Experiment with different materials for frames to see what is most aerodynamic.


If you are using a wood frame, sand it and paint it. This will make it more aerodynamic.Similarly, reduce the surface area of the car to reduce air resistance. For example, find a thinner frame and wheels.

, Your car can lose a lot of energy at the point where the axle touches the frame. Watch these surfaces to see if the axle seems to get stuck. Try applying a lubricate, like graphite powder. Alternatively, redesign the axle. Consider installing ball bearings.You can search online for a chart of coefficients of friction, to determine which materials have the least friction when paired.

Depending on your class and your individual teacher, you might include very different kinds of information in your reading log. Read your assignment sheet carefully and discuss it with your teacher if you have any questions. Some items you will likely have to include in your log are:


The title and author of the book
The dates you read which page
The amount of time you spent reading each day
Key themes of the book
Major characters and plot developments
Questions you have as you read;
, You can create your reading log in a school notebook or in a computer document.Create a template that has spaces for you to write about all the necessary categories you need to address in your log.


Some pre-made templates also exist online. Just search for ""reading log template"" in your favorite search engine., Be careful when you store your reading log, especially if you have to turn the log in for a grade. Keep your reading log in a safe place that won't have drinks spilled on it. If your log is electronic, be sure that you save your work and have it backed up on an external hard drive or a cloud drive.

, If you have to do a reading log for school, chances are that you have specific reading assignments to include on your log. Sometimes you might have some flexibility in your assignment, such as if you have to read 5 novels in a semester. Other times you might have a specific assignment, such as if you have to read 20 Emily Dickinson poems in a given week. Give yourself a lot of time to complete your reading assignment. Remember that keeping a reading log will take a little more time than simply reading a text.

, Most reading log assignments will ask you to maintain a careful bibliographic citation. This will allow you to cite your sources properly and return to your texts at a later point.Be sure that you note down:


The book's title
The author
The publication date
The publisher and city where the publisher is located
Any other identifying information (such as the edition used, translators, co-authors, etc.)

, Books, poems, academic reading, and other materials (even movies or TV shows) can all be included in your journal, depending on the parameters of your assignment.Never put off entering a reading assignment until later! You might lose track of your work and forget important details.

, Don't try to rush through your reading assignments: take your time and think carefully while you read. Pay attention to key details while you read so that you don't have to reread portions. It will save you time in the long run if you aim to retain information while you read.Take down a few notes as you read, especially if you have questions. Jotting out the main theme of a passage or your question about a chapter while you're reading will help you fill in the information in your log later.

, Many reading logs will ask you to keep track of the nuts and bolts of a text. These are details that are purely factual and do not require any extra interpretation or analysis.Such details include:


Plot elements
Character names
Setting
Key argument (if the text is nonfiction or academic), Most reading logs will ask you to identify quotations and passages that strike you as significant or worthy of further analysis. Look for quotations that you find intriguing, mysterious, confusing, or nuanced.These quotations might be used as evidence for your analytical papers later on.


Don't forget to note the page number and speaker whenever you copy a passage.

, Whenever you think of a question as you read, you should note it in your reading log. These can be abstract questions (such as ""Why is it important that the characters speak in riddles?"") or content-based questions (such as ""Who is the mysterious man in the cloak?"").These questions can be used in future journal entries.

, Think about connections between the book and your own life. Is there anything in the book that reminds you of your own thoughts, feelings, or activities? Is there anything that you particularly love or hate? Think about your feelings, not just your thoughts, as you journal., Some instructors might ask you to begin making analytical claims as you read. You can use your informal reading log as a tool to help guide other formal assignments such as papers, response essays, or annotated passages.Think about how passages relate to one another, and consider the historical or social significance of the work you are reading. Begin to form hypotheses about how the text operates and why it is important.

, If you are in a literature class, think about how your assigned texts relate to one another. If you are keeping a reading log about scientific journals, look for patterns that can help you organize your readings into categories.How would you classify each of the texts that you read? Are there any texts that substantiate one another? Are there any texts that disagree with one another? Do your texts help you think about your other classes or homework assignments differently? Note these observations in your reading journal.

, Some reading logs might involve the writing of formal journal entries. Rather than simply listing bullet points or noting passages, you must write a journal entry in full sentences and paragraphs. Ideally, your journal entry should explore a single theme in some kind of depth. This will allow you to build connections between passages and formulate a mini-argument about the text's significance.An excellent first step to writing a formal journal entry is finding 3 or more passages that explore a common theme, such as justice, love, or despair. Use your journal entry to explore how this common theme is treated in these different passages.

, As you continue keeping a reading log, you should be building your reading, writing, and analytical skills. Eventually, you should consider yourself to be an expert on the books you read. Put yourself in a teacher's frame of mind when you write your journal, and use your entries as a way to ""teach"" a text to others.Rather than simply asking questions, begin to formulate answers to your questions.

, Look at your reading log not only as a way to track what you read but also as a way to track how you improve over time. Ideally you should be writing down gradually richer questions, comments, and journal entries over the course of the semester.Try to get a little more sophisticated with each reading log entry you write. Try to write fewer content questions (such as what happened in the story) and more interpretive questions (such as why the book is significant).

Find out which reading level system is used in your area.,
Find out more about the Accelerated Reader system.,
See if your child's school follows the Guided Reading Levels.,
Determine if your child’s school follows the Developmental Reading Assessment.,
Look into Lexile.,
Examine your child’s favorite books.,

Encourage your child to read books at home.,
Know that your child will be tested each year.,
Understand that testing is based on the school’s regulations.,
Stay updated on your child’s reading progress by having an open relationship with their teacher.",How to Test Your Child's Reading Level," There are a variety of reading level systems; some are more popular in certain regions than others.


To test your child’s reading level, it is helpful to know which system is used in your area—ask the local school district or school to find out and to provide you with more information.
Reading levels can be converted from one program to another, so check with your local librarian or your child’s teacher to see how their skills correlate to another program.;
, AR is a popular program in public schools and comes in a desktop or web-based version.


Children take a test through the program, which then recommends books at or slightly above their reading levels. AR levels are arranged by numbers, such as 2.0, 2.1, etc.
The first number correlates with your child’s grade level and the second number with what month in the school year is standard for that book. For example, a book labeled level 2.3 would be at the level of a typical second grader in their third month of school.

, GRL is arranged on an alphabetical scale, with level A being the easiest and level Z the most advanced.


GRL tests are typically administered at the beginning of each school year by having the child read individually to his teacher from a book considered standard for the grade.
The teacher may ask follow-up questions to test for vocabulary and comprehension, and then uses her judgment and the GRL Reading Record to calculate a reading level.

, DRA is tested in a similar way to GRL, with a child reading a book aloud to their teacher at the beginning of the school year.


The child will then retell the story to their teacher and be scored on a variety of skills, ranging from accuracy to fluency.
DRA books start with level A, and then switch to numbers 1-80 for more difficult books.

, Lexile measures are given from a Scholastic Reading Inventory assessment given by the school, or taken from standardized tests.


Using a child’s standardized test reading scores, an educator or parent can covert the scores into a Lexile measure.
Lexile uses more quantitative measures, such as sentence length and number of syllables in a word, instead of qualitative measures, such as analysis or comprehension. The scale runs from 0L to 2000L.

, A simple way to find your child’s reading level is to look at the back of their favorite books. Towards the bottom of the back cover, near the price and barcode, there should be a number such as RL:1.2, which means that book is an average book for a first grader.


Take a handful of your child’s current favorites and average the reading levels to give you a fairly good idea of his actual reading level.
This system isn’t foolproof, as children sometimes choose books on their own that are below their reading level, but it will give you a good starting point.

, There are a variety of online tests that can be done with your child at home to further understand their reading level.


Many free tests involve lists of words—have your child read each word in the list out loud. When they get to a point where they can’t read 4 or 5 words in a row or they get too frustrated to continue, stop and use that stopping spot to measure the reading level.
These lists can be found on websites like sonlight.com and mindsprinting.com. Note that these online word tests are fairly accurate for determining reading level, but don’t test comprehension or contextual reading.

, For a more comprehensive online test, consider paying for the DORA exam, which costs around $20.


The exam, and other similar diagnostic reading tests, evaluate a child’s ability in multiple reading skill sets from word recognition to spelling and oral vocabulary.
DORA is available through letsgolearn.com.

, Once you know your child’s reading level, you can continue their progress by encouraging them to read books at their correct level at home, either to themselves or aloud to parents or siblings.

, If your child is in school outside of the home, they will most likely be subjected to school reading tests each year. These results should be accessible by parents and open for discussion with your child’s teacher.

, How a school tests a child's reading level depends on state regulations and the procedures of the school district.


Some states use annual standardized tests as a way to determine reading levels. These tests are often multiple choice and cover a variety of reading subjects to produce a well-rounded reading level.
Other schools test the children individually at the beginning of every school year. These tests can be offered in person or on the computer and generally draw their questions from the school’s corresponding reading level program.

, Ask about your child’s reading level during parent-teacher conferences throughout the year and ask for recommendations for books or reading activities you could implement at home.


You could also have a periodic call or email with your child’s teacher after reading assignments or reading groups to see how they are progressing.
Establishing an open relationship with the teacher will also help them come to you as soon as they spot a reading red flag.

Purchase an attractive journal.,
Keep the log near your favorite reading spot.,
Read actively and widely.,
Read slowly and carefully.,
Write down the bibliographic information for everything you read.,
Include the dates of when you read.,
Write down page numbers of your favorite passages.,
Take notes while you read.,
Reflect on the book once it's complete.,
Reread your personal reading journal.",How to Write a Reading Log2," In order to stay motivated, purchase an attractive blank journal that is easy to write on. Many stationery and book stores have journals for sale.Depending on your tastes, you can purchase a lined or unlined journal. You can also choose to purchase a journal with a plain, simple cover (such as a black leather cover) or one that is more decorative and whimsical.


If you expect to keep the journal for a long period of time, try to purchase one that has archival paper. This will keep the pages from yellowing and degrading over time., Encourage yourself to maintain your reading log by storing it in a safe place near your favorite place to read. This might be your bedside, your coffee table, or on an end table next to your favorite reading chair. Make sure it is easily accessible and that you store it in the same place consistently: otherwise you might lose or forget about it.


It is also wise to keep a working pen in the same location.

, In order to make a reading journal worthwhile, you will have to make the time to read. Introduce yourself to new ideas, authors, and concepts by reading a wide variety of materials in many styles and genres. This will help keep your reading log interesting. In order to encourage yourself to read more, you should:


Read every day, even if only for a few minutesTurn off the television and resolve to read insteadFeel free to stop reading books you hate--don't view reading as a choreGet recommendations for excellent books from friends and family
Join a reading group at your local school or library

, It can be tempting to read books at a fast pace, especially when they are page-turners. However, this can hurt your ability to think about what you read and can even make you more likely to forget you ever read the book. Slow down and take your time with the books you enjoy.Savor the phrases, reread your favorite passages, and take a few minutes to consider the meaning of what you are reading.

, Be disciplined about jotting down the important information for every book, poem, or essay you read. Note the author's name, the title of the piece, the year it was published, and the publisher's name.This will help you track down the book at a later date if you wish to reread it. It will also help you make recommendations to your friends and begin to understand your own favorite books and authors.


Do not skip over this part, assuming that you are bound to remember a book's title and author. People are liable to forget even these details over time, so they are the most important pieces of information to write down.

, Because your reading log is serving a journal-like function, write down the dates when you read. Understand how what is going on in your own life might affect your reactions to and thoughts about the books you read. Your future self will be grateful to you for taking the time to write down these dates., Especially if you own the book you are reading, be sure to write down the page numbers of your favorite passages. You will always be able to return to these excellent quotations if you have this information written down.If you like, you could even copy out your favorite passages into your journal, though this can be a more time-consuming task than jotting down your favorite pages.

, Reading is a complicated task, and your thoughts will be constant and ever-changing as you read.You will not be able to write down every thought you have, but you should try to keep hold of your most important observations so you can remember them. Every reader will want to write down different kinds of things, but you can use the following guiding questions to help you decide what to include in your log:


Who are your favorite and least favorite characters? Why?
Have your thoughts about any of the characters changed?
What do you find fascinating about the plot? Are there mysteries to solve?
Do you like the author's style? Are there any distinctive elements to the author's style that make it stand out?
What would you have changed about the book if you were the author?
Does the book help you understand something about your world, about another country, or about history?
How does the book remind you of what's going on in your own life? What are your personal reactions to the book?

, Your thoughts about a book might change drastically over the course of reading it. Take some time once you have finished the whole book to reflect on its meaning and significance. Ask yourself what your favorite and least favorite aspects of the text were.What surprised you? How did your thoughts change between the beginning of the book and its conclusion? Write for 10-15 minutes after finishing the very last page in order to preserve these reflections.

, A reading journal is most effective when you can go back and reread your observations and reactions. Every year or so, flip through your reading log. Do you see any patterns or common themes in your reading? Has your reading helped you process the events of your own life? Reading your journal will help you understand how your tastes have grown and changed as well as how your own life has grown and changed."

Read at the correct pace.,
Pause properly at the punctuation.,
Know what capitalization means.,
Define unknown terms.,
Buy a high quality Bible edition.,
Utilize a Bible reading plan.",How to Read the King James Bible," Read the KJB at a moderate pace; reading too slowly may cause you to lose the connections in thought, that the author intended you to understand.;
, Pausing properly at the punctuation will increase your understanding of the text. While reading: Commas (,) indicate a short pause. Periods (.) indicate a full stop. Colons (:) indicate a long pause slightly shorter in length than a period. Semicolons (;) indicate a pause longer than a comma but shorter than a colon. Pause length summary (greatest to least): Period > Colon > Semicolon > Comma.

, Capitalization in the KJB, aside from proper nouns, indicates the beginning of a sentence, the beginning of a verse (even mid sentence), and the beginning of a quotation (The King James Bible does not have quotation marks); as in the first quote in the King James Bible from Genesis 1:3: And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. The KJB does not, however, indicate the end of a quotation; therefore, some interpretation is required for determining the end of a quote.

, When you come across an unfamiliar term while reading the KJB, you can use a dictionary like Noah Webster’s 1828 “American Dictionary of the English Language.” Webster was a master linguist. He used the KJB to teach in schools and he was thoroughly familiar with the archaic terminology. He uses scripture from the KJB as examples in many of his definitions. This edition of Webster’s dictionary is still available for sale in print and can be accessed free on some websites.

, A beautifully bound edition of the King James Bible will enhance your reading experience. One good choice is the Cambridge Bibles; the Cameo Edition in particular, due to its portable size and dark readable type. There is nothing like the smell of Cambridge Bible leather, which in itself can draw you back to reading it. Alternatively, you can read the Local Church Bible Publisher’s 115E1B edition, which is identical to the Cambridge Cameo Edition.

, Reading the Bible without a plan can be overwhelming and discouraging; choose a Bible reading plan and stick with it. There are hundreds of free Bible reading plans to choose from.


One option is a genre-based Bible reading plan, which breaks up the readings into these genres: Law, Prophets, Poetry, Old Testament history, New Testament history, and the Epistles. This type of system offers variety and will prevent boredom and disinterest and will keep you looking forward to your next reading. Both the “Professor Grant Horner’s Bible Reading System” or “The Bible Reading Plan for Slackers and Shirkers” are available free online.

Use a smart approach to holding your book.,
Stay alert and be careful.",How to Read While Walking," There are a number of alternatives. Think about which one is best for you. This way, you'll enjoy read-walking and have a productive time.


Outside on a sidewalk. This might be a good option if you want to take a relatively slow and short read-walk around your neighborhood.
Outside on a path or trail in the forest. If you enjoy nature, and have access to a nice path or trail, this will be a good option. Just make sure the path is fairly smooth.
Inside a mall at a non-busy time of the day. This will work great if it is too cold or rainy outside.
Inside on a treadmill.;
, Unsafe locations are essentially everywhere. These are places with a lot of other people or traffic, or places with obstacles and other potential hazards. The goal here is to have fun or be productive while exercising instead of getting injured, so pick the best location to do that in.


High traffic places with a lot of cars or bicyclists.
A place with many other pedestrians. You don’t want to be walking into other people.
Paths and sidewalks that are dangerous because of obstructions and uneven paving.

, Before jumping on the treadmill or going outside with your book, try practicing at home. This way, you’ll be able to practice reading and walking in a place that you are very familiar with. This will decrease the risk of accidents which could hurt you, because you’ll already know where those walls are and where the furniture is placed.


Try to figure out a safe pace.
Experiment with different ways to hold your book.
Figure out your reaction time in case you come into contact with furniture or people.

, After you’ve practiced at home, decide on where you’re going to read. If you’re going to read outside, pick a place and walk it without reading a couple times. This’ll help you familiarize yourself with the route and with any obstacles and potential dangers that might be in your way., Try to go with a light paperback. That way, you’ll be able to hold your book with one hand, and you’ll be able to put it in your pocket or hold onto it with much less effort if you’ve got to stop reading.


Consider lightweight books and paperbacks.
Try to get a book with large print.
Don’t use library books, in case it rains or something unexpected happens., Avoid picking a book that you'll want to underline or write in. This will make your read-walking much more dangerous. It will also interrupt your walking, and you'll have to stop often and unexpectedly, creating more danger. Instead of an opportunity to study and take the best notes, view your read-walking as an opportunity to either enjoy a book or familiarize yourself with information that you’ll revisit later., Make sure you choose to go read-walking on a day when the weather is nice. Avoid rainy or windy days, as they will make reading and walking more difficult. In addition, you won’t have to worry about ruining your book or tablet if it rains.

, While some treadmills come with reading racks, others don't. A reading rack will hold your book down, and make turning pages much easier. You can purchase a rack at most major online retailers., Don’t walk too fast. Start out even slower than you would normally walk. There are a number of reasons for this, they include:


This allows you to both relish and extend the experience.
It is safer to walk slower while reading.
Starting out really slow will help you get the hang of reading while walking., A smart approach will save you from falling down, hurting yourself, or bumping into other people.


Hold your document with one hands and start walking while reading. Try to always have a hand free in case you fall or something of that sort.
Hold the book relatively low, and do not cover your face with the reading material.
Keep good form, and try to minimize a ton of bouncing. You want to be light on your feet of course, but if your torso is bopping all over the place, it’s going to be much harder to read. If anything, try for a couple of minutes, take a break to walk or do some strength, and try again., Make sure you can still focus on walking. This is the most important element of staying safe while you read-walk.


Make sure to look up as often as you can or use your peripheral vision to avoid potential dangers.
Try to see the shadow of objects instead of looking up completely from what you are reading.
Don’t get too involved in your book that you are completely unaware of your surroundings.
Try to look up in front of you and at the trail or sidewalk every couple of sentences or every paragraph. This way, you’ll know if there are any obstacles ahead of you and you’ll be able to adjust accordingly.

However, knowing where the dots and empty spaces are is important to being able to read Braille. Braille printed for the sighted may have ""shadow dots"" in the empty spaces; Braille for the blind will not have these.

, These letters use only the the top 4 dots of the 6 in the cell.

, These are identical to letters A through J, except they have an additional dot in position 3.

, These are the same as letters A through E, except they have an extra dot in positions 1, 3 and 6.

, W is out of order because Braille was written originally in French, which at that time did not contain the letter W.

, Pay extra attention to the Braille special symbols. These aren't found in regular print. They are used to distinguish capital letters and other formatting not apparent in the Braille cells.

, Braille Through Remote Learning has an excellent list and search feature.

, Learning Braille is just like learning any other alphabet. You won't pick it up overnight, but it is by no means impossible.

Find a quiet space to read.,
Get comfortable.,
Rest your book against something.,
Have some food and water with you.,
Know when to stop.",How to Read in a Moving Vehicle1," If you are on in vehicle with a lot of space, like a train or a boat, find a spot that has minimal distractions. In a smaller vehicle, like a plane or a bus, it may be hard to move around. Try looking for empty seats in the back of the plane or the bus.;
, Your position is very important for reading in a vehicle where your space might be limited. Adjust your seat so that you have enough legroom. If possible, try leaning against the car door or leaning on the seat next to you.


Uncomfortable positions can really hinder your reading. If you're in a position that's causing you pain, you may be more likely to feel nauseated when reading in a car.

, Hold your book firmly. Lean it against the window or car door. Also try resting it in your lap or on the seat next to you.

, It's important to stay hydrated when taking a long journey. If you aren't getting enough water, you could easily become nauseated or dizzy very quickly. If this happens, take a sip. Food can also help to settle your stomach and help you get comfortable again.


Bring light snacks. Heavy foods can lead to nausea. Bring snacks that don’t irritate your digestive system. Apples, pretzels, and carrots are examples of light snacks to take on your trip.

, Reading in a moving vehicle can be challenging for several reasons. Bumps in the road, turbulence, background noise, and other distractions may make reading impossible. You may want to take a break until things calm down.


Don't push yourself. If you're getting a headache or you can't understand what you're reading, take some time off from the book. There's no point to reading if you aren’t understanding the material.

Read at night.",How to Read in a Moving Vehicle2," Sit down low in your seat. Hold the book to your eye level and begin reading. Keep your line of sight toward the book at the same level as your line of sight out of the window. Looking downward while your side vision registers movement from outside the window causes symptoms of motion sickness. Keep your head up and your lines of vision on an equal plane., Avoid developing motion sickness by blocking the side vision entirely. Use your hand or a window curtain to do this. If you are on a ship, go beneath the deck and move toward the center where you are likely to experience the least amount of movement., Pivot your body so that your back is to the window closest to you. This will stop your eyes from seeing movement in your peripheral vision., Cars don’t have many seating options, but larger vehicles like buses, boats, and planes do. When reading on a boat or plane, find a place to sit where you won’t feel the motion of the vehicle.


On a boat, sit in the lower cabins near the center.
On a plane, sit close to the wings.If you’re on the bus, avoid sitting in the back where you’ll feel more bumps and have less access to fresh air.

, When it is dark outside it is much harder to see out of the windows. If you can’t see out of the window, you are less likely to get motion sickness.Bring a flashlight or book light to only light up the words on the page.

Take breaks from the vehicle.",How to Read in a Moving Vehicle3," Avoid getting in a moving vehicle when your stomach is too empty or too full. Do not consume a lot of alcohol, fatty foods, or foods that tend to irritate your stomach., People who suffer from motion sickness often find a place to sit where they can see what is going on around them. This is usually in the front of the vehicle with eyes facing forward and enjoying the view.In a car, sit in the front seat, face forward, and avoid altering your gaze too much.
On a boat, sit as close to the front as possible. It might be bumpy, but having full view of the scene ahead often keeps motion sickness at bay.
When riding on a train, sit so that you are facing in the direction that the train is going. That way you won’t see any backward motion when the train starts moving.

, Breathe slowly and deeply to help calm your stomach. If possible, move to place where you can get some fresh air.If you’re in a car, open the windows and take slow, deep breaths.
If you’re on a ship, move to the outdoor areas.

On an airplane, try getting up for a walk. On big planes there is often space in the back where the food is kept. It tends to be less stuffy back there since there are fewer people.

Homestuck is best enjoyed with the sound on.,
Enjoy the comic.",How to Read Homestuck," Reading Homestuck will most likely change your life, in all actuality, so it is important you get yourself ready! Proceed with extreme caution. It is a crazy adventure full of feels, fanfiction, cross-shipping, confusing plots, morbid deaths and a whole lot of pain.;
, Homestuck uses Flash, which means that it has interactive games, videos, and such. A mobile or tablet doesn't support Flash, which means that you won't be able to fully enjoy the comic if you read it on that.

, Homestuck is filled with important details, and missing one could make you really confused. Write a few sentences for every 50 pages, then you'll understand it pretty well.

, There are several 'rules' to reading Homestuck. Don't skip the intermissions. Don't skip acts. Don't skip Pesterlogs. Don't give up, either, even when it seems incredibly dull. Details in Homestuck are everything, and as long and as useless as Act 1 may seem, it's ridiculously important! Keep your head up, though. It's very much worth the suffering.

, Most spoilers can be found on Tumblr, the MSPA wiki, YouTube, and all those websites where you can find Homestuck fans. Read the comic before approaching any of these places.

, Shipping is the idea of putting two characters into a relationship (non-canonically). A headcanon is an idea or opinion about a fictional series (book, TV, comic, or otherwise) that is true in one's head, but has not become a canon fact.

, Ever! No matter how useless or boring a part might seem, it is incredibly relevant. This applies to PesterLogs, Intermissions, comic links and the videos. The Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff comics are optional, but they're a short read and are referenced many times throughout the comic.

, You get the full experience when you are simultaneously listening to the epic tracks that will sometimes be on a couple pages of the comic.

, It's pretty crazy, but with determination, self-sacrifice, something to punch, and a nearby ambulance, you should be alright! Good luck!

Write a list of what needs to be bought, packed, accomplished, and arranged before you leave. Start well in advance so you don’t get stuck doing loads of laundry the day you leave.Let someone else look over the list to make sure that you haven't forgotten anything.
Put reminders where you need them. For example, write a list of bathroom items you need and put it on your bathroom mirror so that you can collect all of the items at once.
Put sticky notes onto necessary items you need to bring or put a list of things you need on the door.;
, If you need to find a pet sitter, do this well before you leave on your trip. If you are running out of your prescription medication, get a refill prior to leaving. Take stock of any arrangements that must be made before you leave for your trip and take care of them before you go. It’s best to take care of any details before traveling so you don’t have to think about them while you are away.


Pay your bills and run any errands that are vital before leaving.

, You might be packing your stuff, your children’s things, and gifts for other people. Staying on top of that many things can be difficult, so use a bit of organization. Pack your suitcase with clothes ahead of time and make sure everything fits well. Chose simple, lightweight clothing and fold your clothes in a way that saves space in your suitcase.Decide whether to wrap the presents before or after traveling.


If you’re traveling in a car, consider having a bag within reach with certain items you may want or need on your journey.
For heavy or bulky items, such as shoes or coats, choose one to take. Make sure the rest of your clothing matches this one item.

, If you’re on a schedule (like catching a bus, train, or airplane), plan for potential hazards to getting there. Plan ahead for traffic, running late, or toddler tantrums.Especially if you are traveling with children, prepare for any emergencies by having snacks, a change of clothes, and any other necessary items that might come in handy while traveling.


Whether you’re on an airplane or in a car, have snacks for any passengers that may get grumpy without food. Avoid sweets, as blood sugar spikes and crashes can make people grumpy.
Bring clothing for various temperatures, and plan to layer. Even if it might be hot at your destination, bring a sweater in case there is air conditioning or a cold breeze.

, If you’re traveling around holiday time, opt for airlines that aren’t known for lengthy delays or canceled flights. If you find a flight with a very short layover, opt for a longer layover (or pay a bit extra for a direct flight) in order to avoid the hassle of potentially missing a flight.Consider purchasing flights that depart early in the day. Airports tend to be less crowded and if you need to make changes, it may be easier to get a different flight., Whether you flying or driving, have your necessary things close to you. Keep your medical prescriptions and necessary toiletry items in your carry-on bag. Bring an extra change of clothes in case your baggage gets lost. If traveling by car, have a specific bag set aside for overnight essentials.Keep blankets and pillows nearby to keep your journey more comfortable.


If traveling with kids, pack toys and items to keep them entertained and busy.

, If you’re driving a long distance, make sure your car is ready for the journey. Get an inspection by a mechanic you trust and get an oil change. Make sure your tire tread is good and that your car is in good overall condition. If you anticipate bad weather, prepare for these conditions by ensuring the safety of your car.Get new headlights, fog lights, windshield wipers, or snow tires.

, If you tend to dread traveling, pack a special treat for you to enjoy. For example, splurge on a special snack to eat or a book to read. Find an audiobook that appeals to you and save it for your travels.Having something to look forward to can make your travels feel less like a hassle.

, You’ll likely come into at least one travel snag. Instead of getting upset or bent out of shape, keep your sense of humor and go with the flow. Be flexible and recognize that not everything goes according to plan. Sometimes disasters happen and you need to be willing to change your plans. If this happens, maintain your sense of humor and find a way to approach it without getting upset.If you find yourself becoming stressed or panicked, find a quiet place to be by yourself for a few minutes. This might be a bathroom or the courtyard of your hotel. Take deep breaths, and relax your muscles to prevent yourself from becoming upset.

, If you’re feeling overly stressed, find a healthy outlet for stress, such as relaxation. Find things that help to relax you, such as listening to music, writing, or reading. Use relaxation before you take off and during your trip. If you need some alone time, let others know that you need a quick break and will be back.Find ways that help you feel calm. This could be calling a friend, taking a bath, writing in a journal, or going for a walk.
Avoid taking out your stress through drugs, alcohol, or other destructive means. Instead, find healthy and constructive ways to cope. For more information, check out How to Deal With Stress.

, If you’re going to visit family, let your kids know ahead of time. If your child fears change or has a difficult time adjusting to new people or places, give them plenty of time to prepare for the trip. Talk about who you will be seeing, what you’ll be doing, and what activities you can look forward to on your trip.Make a travel book for your child, letting them see pictures of who they are visiting and what activities they will be doing. Provide some blank pages for your child to use to draw or color. This can help build positive anticipation instead of worried or nervous dread.
If flying, let your kids know that you will go through security. Let children over the age of 12 know they will need to take their jackets and shoes off. Children under 12 can leave on light jackets, head coverings, and shoes.You can even make a game of practicing going through security, complete with pretend ""tickets"" and suitcases.

, You should prepare your child so that they know how to find help if you are separated during your vacation. Roleplay these situations before you leave so that they know how to act.Teach them your phone number, and practice dialing it with them. Also teach them how to dial 911 or how to reach emergency services in the country you are visiting.
Teach them how to recognize police officers. If you are going to a foreign country, make sure you look up what police wear in that country.
Give them a piece of paper with your hotel and contact information on it. They can give it to a police officer or official trying to help.

, If flying, ask about family boarding. Many airlines allow families with young children or multiple kids to board earlier than other passengers. This can help you get you and your family situated without dealing with the crowds of people on the plane.

Use the extra time to get your children sitting and occupied. Get out your toy bag and snack bag and stow the rest of your bags.
Take out some gum, and give it to them to chew during take-off and landing. This will prevent their ears from popping. If you have a baby, a bottle will do the same trick.

, If children are attending an event or visiting family, let them know what behavior is expected of them. Even as you travel, be clear in how you want the kids to behave. For example, say, “We use our inside voices when inside a hotel because we need to respect other people’s vacations, too.” If you’re flying, say, “You might get bored or nervous when you’re on the airplane. If you feel this way, let me know. It’s not okay to whine or scream inside an airplane.”Let children know what kind of behavior is expected before you leave on your trip. If necessary, remind them of your expectations. Say, “Remember we talked about excusing yourself from the dinner table.”

, Giving your child a ""job"" while on vacation can help them feel involved and invested in your plans. These jobs should be simple and fun for the child. Some things they can do include:

Take pictures on a disposable camera.
Pick out postcards and gifts for family members.
Carry the map or guidebook.
Choose what to do on a certain day.

, If you feel rushed before heading out, plan to take some time off work so you can properly prepare for your travels. Consider working a half day and using the time to run errands, pack, and feel ready before you head off. Getting everything prepared and ready can help reduce stress and make you feel more calm, which feels much better than running around trying to get things done.Especially with kids, you might want some time to decompress.


Consider having a day to yourself (or at least without any plans) after your travels to help you recuperate and get back into the swing of things.This will also let kids rest up before they have to return to school.

Travel with someone who can help you deal with your symptoms.,
Have a crisis plan in place.,
Exercise.,
Use relaxation techniques.,
Use grounding techniques.",How to Minimize PTSD Symptoms While Traveling1," If you can, ask your partner, a family member, or a close friend to accompany you on the trip. Tell them how to recognize your visible symptoms (not the things you feel, but symptoms that are noticeable to other people), and let them know how they can help you manage them.For instance, you might tell your partner that if you have a flashback in a public place, they can help by taking you to a quiet area to recover.;

"
Check if the entire country is affected.,
Determine the level of danger.,
Note when the travel alert or warning was posted.,
Confirm the alert or warning through other sources.,
Determine if travel is still an option.,
Notify your government you are travelling to the area.,
Give copies of your itinerary to family and friends.,
Purchase travel insurance.,
Create a backup plan if something goes wrong.,
Watch the local and international news while traveling.,
Keep your identification somewhere safe.,
Stay in touch with family and friends back home.",How to React to Travel Alerts and Warnings," Some travel alerts or warning will only list a particular region or area that may be risky for tourists. It may also note the rest of the country is safe for travel. If this is the case, you may be fine to travel if the area you are travelling to is not listed as risky.For example, if you are travelling to Mexico, you may be fine to travel in certain states or to popular tourist destinations, such as the Mayan Riviera, if the violence in the country is isolated to other areas.;
, Read over the travel alert or the travel warning and identify the level of danger. Does the travel alert talk about violence and terrorism? Does the travel warning note assaults on foreign tourists? If the violence is focused on foreign tourists, this may be a cause for concern. If the violence is focused on residents of the country, you may be okay to travel to the area as a tourist.For example, if the travel alert lists “a risk to locals only,” you may be okay to travelling to the country as a foreigner. If there is a note about “a risk to foreign travellers,” you may be more wary of travelling to the country.

, Check the date the travel alert or warning was posted on your government’s website. Make sure it is recent, within the last one to two weeks. A travel alert that is a few months old may no longer be relevant or accurate. Most government websites will keep up to date travel information on their website, but it is always worth checking the posted date for the alert or warning.If the travel alert or warning is a few weeks old, you may want to search for more information on possible risks in the country on your own.

, Do an online search for more information on the alert or warning from the government of the place you are travelling to as well as government postings from other countries. Look for information from trusted news sources about possible conflicts or issues in the country. This will help to confirm there are conflicts or issues in the country that you need to watch out for.For example, if you’d like to confirm it is safe to travel to the Mayan Riviera in Mexico, you may search for “travel warnings and alerts mayan riviera” to see if other government sites besides your home country have travel alerts and warnings for the area.
You can also read through articles on the current state of the conflict on news sites for up to date information on what’s going on and whether it poses a threat to you.

, Once you have analyzed the travel alert or warning, determine if you feel safe enough to travel. If the travel alert does not seem like it will affect the area you are staying in or does not apply to foreign travellers, you may be okay to head off on your trip. If the travel warning is strongly worded and indicates you may be in danger in the area you are staying, you may revise your travel plans or reschedule your trip for another time.Keep in mind the fallout from an isolated act of violence will likely affect the entire country in some way. You should always go by your own comfort level and the level of danger you may be exposed to while you travel. Your safety comes first, even if that means cancelling the trip or travelling at another time in the future.

, Let your government know you are travelling to a country with a travel alert or warning as a safety precaution. Your government should have a registration program that you can enroll in by providing identification like your passport and your birth certificate. You may be able to register online, depending on your government’s program.Registering under your government will let your government know you may be at risk in a certain country. This could be useful if you need to get out of that country due to conflicts or issues during your travels.
For example, you can register as an American travelling abroad through the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol website.

, Let those close to you know where and when you will be travelling during your trip. Give copies of a detailed itinerary to your friends and family. Note where you will be in the country and the dates of your travel, as where as the address of where you are going to be staying.If possible, you should also include a contact number, such as a cellphone or a landline where you can be reached.
You may buy data for your cellphone or a plan that allows you to make calls in a foreign country so you can be in contact with friends and family.

, To protect yourself while travelling to a risky area, get good travel insurance. You may be able to get travel insurance through your existing insurance company or search for a good insurance plan online. Make sure the travel insurance you buy covers you for any damage or theft to your belongs as well as your health care needs while you are in a foreign country.


Call your travel insurance provider and let them you need a plan to protect you while you are travelling to a country with a travel alert or warning. They can often recommend a good plan for your needs.

, Have a plan in place in the event you need to leave the country due to a conflict or local issue. Find your home country’s embassy or consulate close to where you are visiting. Have the contact details of the embassy close by. Let your travel companions know that you will all leave the country and/or contact the embassy in the event of a conflict or issue in the country.You can find your home country’s embassy or consulate in the country you are travelling to by searching your government’s website.

, Keep tabs on what is happening locally and internationally while you travel in the country. Check your government’s website on a daily basis for updates to the travel alert or warning. This way, you will know right away if the situation is getting too dangerous for you to remain in the country and can work on getting back to your home country.You should also try speaking to locals about the situation to help determine if it is becoming too dangerous.

, Always keep your identification on you in a safe place, such as in a money belt or a purse that you keep with you at all times. Make copies of your identification and keep them in other travel bags. This way, you will have a copy of them if the originals go missing or are stolen.You will need your identification to leave the country if it becomes too dangerous to travel. Make sure it is kept somewhere safe at all times.

, Stay connected to those closest to you back in your home country so they know you are okay. Try sending out daily emails or text messages to family and friends to let them know how your trip is going.


Doing this will also ensure you get information on a more dangerous travel alert or warning from those back home. Family and friends may be able to let you know if the country has become too dangerous for foreigners, for example, and advise you to return home.

Once your preparations are completed, give yourself a few days to relax before you leave.

, It’s all too easy to run into unforeseen difficulties while traveling, so give yourself more time than you think you need to get places. Arrive at the airport at least three hours early, and allow extra time for driving through unfamiliar cities or taking public transportation.Make sure to bring some comforting and distracting materials with you, such as a book, music, and headphones to keep you from getting overwhelmed by your surroundings.

, Reduce your anxiety about the unknown by using technology to get acquainted with your destination before you arrive. Map your driving routes ahead of time, use Google’s Street View feature to explore areas where you’ll need to walk, and look for photos of your hotel and other places you’ll be going.You can use the Street View feature by going to Google Maps and dragging the orange figure in the bottom right corner onto the street you want to look at.

, Bring everything you’ll need to be comfortable, but don’t overdo it. Packing too much can make navigating airports and other public spaces difficult and stressful.If you’re flying, pack any necessities – such as medication, snacks, or earplugs – in your carry-on bag before you board the plane.

, If you are bringing any medications across international borders, keep them in the original prescription bottles. Check the laws in the countries where you’re traveling to make sure your medications are legal there. You may need to declare your medications at customs.Before you travel, consider getting a note from your doctor about any medications you’re taking.

Look out the window frequently.,
Reduce the feelings of movement.,
Avoid heavy foods while traveling.,
Eat lightly to settle your stomach.,
Get some air.,
Don’t worry.,
Try acupressure bands.",How to Prevent Motion Sickness1," Look at a stable object, such as the horizon. The visual cues of movement will enable your brain to synchronize the visual and physical cues of the swaying vehicle.If you are in a car, focusing on an object that is too close for you to clearly see, like trees by the side of the road, may make you feel worse. If you can't see the horizon (you are on a winding road, etc.), then close your eyes instead.
Don't read or play games — these things may actually worsen your symptoms.;
, This lessens the conflict between the physical sensations of movement and the visual signals indicating that you are sitting still. Things to try include:Sitting in the front seat when you are riding in car.
Choosing a seat towards the front of the plane and over the wings.
Selecting a cabin on a boat that is level with the water and in the middle of the boat. This will help reduce the amount of swaying you experience.

, Don’t eat foods that will be difficult to digest. This includes:Spicy foods
Greasy, fatty foods. This may mean avoiding heavy fatty meals at rest stops, airport cafes, or at the ship’s bar.
Alcohol and caffeine. If you are offered a complimentary drink on the plane or boat, you may want to consider turning it down. Ask for water instead.

, These snacks are easy to digest and may help settle your stomach and lessen your feelings of nausea:Munching on dry crackers or other carb-heavy snacks
Sucking on hard candies. Mint is a popular flavor which will also freshen your breath.
Slowly drinking carbonated soda

, Fresh air will help combat nausea. You can usually control air flow in whatever vehicle you are in:Open a window if you are in a car. Chances are the air blowing into your face will give you instant relief. If it is raining and you can’t open the window all the way, try cracking it slightly.
Go up on deck if you are on a boat. On deck you will get fresh air and be able to see the horizon. Even if the boat is rocking, the wind and cool air should help.
Open an air vent if you are on a plane. Each passenger usually has access to an air vent overhead. Reach up, open yours, and aim the air flow at you. You should feel a cool breeze and reduction in your nausea.
Smoking, or being exposed to smoke, or other strong scents from air fresheners or perfumes may also aggravate motion sickness.

, If you are nervous about feeling ill, worrying will make you more vulnerable to it. Use relaxation techniques before you even start feeling ill. You can try: Meditation
Listening to music
Deep breathing
Progressively tensing and relaxing each muscle group in your body
Visualizing a calming landscape
Closing your eyes and taking a brief nap. Even if you are only asleep for 10 or 20 minutes, you may find that you wake up feeling much better.

, These are cloth bands that fit snugly around your wrists. They have a button or knob that should press on the inside of your wrist between the two tendons running down the middle of your forearm.They should not be so tight that they hurt. If your fingers tingle or the blood flow is reduced, they are too tight.
Acupressure bands have not been demonstrated to be clearly successful in clinical trials treating motion sickness; however, some people feel they help.

Take ginger.,
Use over-the-counter antihistamine medications.,
Ask your doctor for a prescription medications.",How to Prevent Motion Sickness2," Ginger is a common natural remedy for nausea, and many people use it for motion sickness. Consult your doctor before taking ginger if you are pregnant, nursing, or taking other medications with which it might interfere. If your doctor approves of you taking ginger, there are many tasty ways to do so:Ginger chews, lozenges, or candy, now widely available.
A warm cup of fresh decaffeinated ginger tea. This will both help settle your stomach and keep you hydrated. You can sip it slowly over the course of your travels. You can bring it with you if you are traveling by car or by boat. If you are traveling by plane, you may need to bring freshly sliced ginger and then ask for a cup of hot water on the plane. Airports generally do not permit you to carry liquids on board.
Ginger soda. You can bring ginger soda or ginger ale with you on a boat or in the car. If you are traveling by plane, check to see if you can purchase it in the airport cafes where drinks are often sold after people have gone through security.
Ginger cookies or breads. These are always tasty snacks.
Ginger supplements. Contact your doctor or the manufacturer’s instructions to determine the dosage that would be right for you.

, If you will also be driving, however, you should not take these medications because they may cause you to be too drowsy to drive. Follow the instructions on the packaging. Consult your doctor before taking them if you are pregnant, nursing, taking other medications, or treating a child. Possible medications to try are:Dimenhydrinate (Dramamine, Gravol)
Meclizine (Antivert)

, If you have severe motion sickness and are planning a cross country car trip, a transoceanic boat trip, or several days of air travel, you may need medicine to manage your motion sickness. As with all medications, tell your doctor if you are pregnant, nursing, or on other medications. Your doctor may prescribe a scopolamine or hyoscine adhesive patch (Transderm Scop). This treatment may not be possible for people with asthma, glaucoma, urine retention, epilepsy, heart, kidney, or liver problems.
However, scopolamine has no effect on people under the age of 12.
If this medication is available over-the-counter, consult a doctor before treating a child or an elderly person.
The patch is generally worn behind the ear. It is usually effective for about 72 hours. Side effects include sleepiness, dizziness, and blurred vision.

Ask guides or travel agents.,
Consult travel insurance.,
Find transportation.,
Find out about the national health system.,
Find a translator if necessary.",How to Obtain Medical Advice While Traveling," If the trip has been set up by experienced professionals, these individuals may be able to help in a medical emergency scenario.;
, If the traveler has taken out comprehensive travel insurance, this policy could help them realize much lower costs in their destination country. Reading the policy carefully can help the individual traveler understand why they may be liable for, and how to work with a foreign health system.

, Each country has its own system of public transportation, and knowing about options may be critical to getting to a medical office in that country.


Observe the usual rules for planning for medical emergencies. No matter what country a person is in, it's important to stay close to populated areas for the best chance of getting medical advice in an emergency situation. Travelers are advised not to go into wilderness areas or other remote places without a plan for addressing medical emergencies.
Know the local transportation grid. Getting timely medical attention may include knowing how to find the best times for travel to a medical center. Having key knowledge about trains, buses or local transport can help a traveler to get through a maze of traffic and access good medical advice quickly.

, Some countries have national health systems that are funded and administrated by the government, and others have more of a focus on private health care setups. Knowing how medical treatment works in the destination country will help the traveler figure out how to get access to local medical advice.

, One of the biggest challenges to getting treated medically in any foreign country is often the language barrier. Travelers should know where translation resources are and how to get an interpreter or day translator for a medical emergency.

Bring a meal with you.,
Pack some snacks.,
Bring a water bottle.",How to Eat Well at an Amusement Park1," Many amusement parks will allow you to bring in a cooler. Alternatively, they may allow you to exit, access your car for food, and return. If either of these are an option, plan ahead and bring a healthy meal with you.Even with a cooler, you’ll still want to bring foods that don't spoil easily. Further, go for high energy, nutritious food that isn’t to heavy.
The best amusement park meals might include jerky, hard cheeses or cheese sticks, peanut butter and bananas, whole grain crackers or bread, fresh fruit, and granola.
Many parks also have specific areas to eat if you bring your own food. There will likely be lockers nearby to store stuff so you don’t have to carry it around all day.;
, If you’re unable to pack a meal for one reason or another, at least bring along some healthy snacks. This will help you stave off hunger between meals. Not only will you wind up consuming less calories compared to a snack from the amusement park, you’ll save money as well.The best snacks include fresh or dried fruit, cheese sticks, trail mix, or raisins.
Avoid sugary snacks. They provide limited energy and may even lead to a crash later on.

, Stay hydrated to ensure your mind and body make is through a day at the park! Having water with you will help you stay alert, and decrease the likelihood that you wind up snacking unnecessarily."
"
Fuel up you body before entering.,
Assess your options within the park.,
Choose healthy sides.,
Eat mindfully.,
Pick your poison and look forward to it.,
Don’t let the young ones wear you down.",How to Eat Well at an Amusement Park2," Even for an all-day fun session, make a point of eating a solid, healthy breakfast before going into the park. For instance, eat a bowl of Greek yogurt with fruit and granola. There are plenty of healthy breakfast options - the point is to get a full meal that will provide you with sustained energy throughout the morning.Make sure whatever you eat for breakfast has healthy carbs (such as those from whole grains) as well as protein.

, You may not have the chance to plan ahead, or may simply need to get some food in the park. Don’t just follow your nose to the nearest food stand. Look around and take note of your options.For instance, does the hot dog and hamburger stand offer veggies burgers or chicken breast sandwiches? Is there anywhere that offers salads?

, You may be able to find a decent entree, such as a grilled chicken breast or a salad without anything fried in it. Don’t ruin your meal's nutritional value by getting fries to go alongside it. Always ask about getting veggies instead of chips or fries.Use less sauce. While that mayo dip may be undeniably tasty, mustard, pickles, and salsa are all healthier options.

, When eating a meal or snack, take a moment to sit down and eat. This will help cut back on the mindless eating that tends to catch people at amusement parks.While taking the time to sit down and assess your hunger level, drink water before eating anything and wait a few minutes. At times, people mistake thirst for hunger, which leads to unnecessary calorie consumption.

, Some people have an inexplicably powerful affection for elephant ears. If this or any other bajillion-calorie love affair applies to you, plan to get one at some point during the day. Make a point of eating especially healthy throughout the day, and look forward to it. Finally, plan to share whatever it is you can’t do without, and mention it to those you’re with so they can share in the anticipation., If you’re bringing kids along, they’re probably going to notice the cotton candy, funnel cakes, and bucket-sized sodas. Resist their requests - in part because they won’t be able to enjoy the day as much if their bodies are bogged down with junk food.Consider telling them at the beginning of the day that they can have one treat at some point. Make a game out of looking for the best treat in the park together.

"
"
Forego the funnel cake.,
Save turkey for Thanksgiving.,
Forget the fried-onion blossom.,
Don’t be fooled by snow cones.,
Share when you splurge.,
Say no to soda.",How to Eat Well at an Amusement Park3," Deep fried dough caked with powdered sugar can set you back nearly 1,000 calories and a few dozen grams of the least healthy sorts of fats. For perspective, that will take more than three hours to walk off.If your sweet tooth is itching, go for a caramel apple instead, which will have about a ⅓ of the calories and very little fat. The apple itself will also provide some healthy, energy-sustaining nutritional value.

, As much as you might want to look like a viking berserker, leave the turkey legs in the park’s fryers. Just one of these avian thighs contains a number of calories well into the 4-digit realm. Further, they contain more than 50 grams of fat each.If you ignore this warning, at least take off the skin!
See if there’s a place that has kebabs. Chicken or steak are healthiest, and since kebabs are grilled instead of fried, you’ll be way better off in the health department.

, Though it is a vegetable and will do its best to trick you into thinking it’s relatively healthy, it’s not. Nearly 1,200 calories and over 70 grams of fat - a day’s worth - are the stats you should remember when the fried faux-flower temptation strikes.Still want a cooked veggie? Ask if anywhere in the park serves corn on the cob. With much less of all the detrimental health effects (even with a healthy dose of butter), this is definitely the route to take.

, They’re not just ice! There are hundreds of calories in snow cones, loads of the worst sorts of sweeteners, and unhealthy artificial coloring. If you just want some sugar, go for cotton candy instead - it will actually be healthier!If it’s the cold you’re after, see about a frozen chocolate-dipped banana or frozen yogurt.
If you simply must get a snow cone, ask for one with less syrup than normal.

, Maybe the temptation of a turkey leg is simply too much to handle. You are on vacation, after all. That said, when you do treat yourself to an amusement park delicacy, share it with another person in your party. You’ll still be able to enjoy a dangerously scrumptious treat, with less of the undesirable effects on your diet.Keep in mind that amusement park portions are often entertainingly large.

, Whatever you call them - soda, pop, or just carbonated sugar beverages - these will work against you at the amusement park. They contain lots of unnecessary calories and even diet versions contain chemicals people shouldn’t be putting into their bodies. If you strongly favor sweetened drinks, see about some chocolate milk. Better yet, simply drink water. You body will be grateful, and you’ll have more energy and focus with which to enjoy the rides!"
"
Plan your dine-out meals beforehand.,
Schedule one cheat meal or cheat day.,
Bring your own snacks.,
Try eating “at home.” If your lodging has a full kitchen (such as at a rental home or extended-stay hotel) opt for eating all meals at home.,
Turn down the hotel extras.",How to Eat Healthy on Vacation1," While it’s more beneficial to not dine out, the likelihood of you not visiting a restaurant on vacation is very slim. For this reason, try to plan your dining experiences before your trip. If possible, choose which restaurants you will visit and check out the menu beforehand. This way, you can determine nutrition information ahead of time and look for healthier options.


It is likely you will end up dining at restaurants you had not planned on. Check out the menu (it is likely posted outside the restaurant) and use a calorie-tracking app on your smartphone (like MyFitnessPal), which may have general nutrition information on some of the offered dishes.;
, Every town is famous for a specific type of food, so plan one meal or one day when you allow yourself to indulge in the local fare. On all other days, you should plan to be more conscious about what you are eating, planning healthier dining choices and meal options.For example, if you’re in New York choose to splurge on New York style pizza. If you’re in Texas, indulge in BBQ. After your splurge, choose healthier options such as opting for baked fish instead of fried fish while visiting Miami Beach.

, Stock your mini-fridge in your hotel with healthy snacks that you can grab on the go such as veggies, yogurt, cheese sticks, hard-boiled eggs and water bottles. Not only does this keep you from heading to the hotel vending machine, but it also curbs your hunger when you’re out sightseeing.


This option also helps during travel, such as on road trips or in the airport. When you have healthy snacks on hand you’re less likely to buy a convenience store hotdog or overpriced fast-food at the airport.You can also pack “brown bags” for longer day trips. Instead of having an unplanned meal at a restaurant, make a new memory by having a healthy picnic packed in brown bags or a small cooler.

, You can then plan all your meals, shop for your own groceries, and know exactly what you are consuming each day. Not only does it save money, but it gives you much more control over what you’re eating.When stocking your fridge, try purchasing items like fresh greens, whole wheat pastas, canned tuna fish, eggs, and berries.Airbnb is a good source to help find rental properties that are often cheaper than a hotel stay. Plus, you can get amenities that hotels don’t offer such as a blender for fresh smoothies or a grill for cooking light.

, If your hotel offers a mini-bar with snacks such as sodas and candies, be sure to turn it down.If snacks are not under lock and key, you can always ask the staff to remove them from your room. Also, if your lodging has complimentary breakfast, stick to healthier options such as oatmeal, fruit, and healthy cereals.

REMEMBER…

FEAST on high protein breakfast and lunches to stimulate the body's active cycle.",How to Prevent Jet Lag with a Modified Diet,";
,

On day one, Feast; eat heartily with high-protein breakfast and lunch and a high-carbohydrate dinner. No coffee except between 3 and 5 pm.






On day two, Fast on light meals of salads, light soups, fruits and juices. Again, no coffee except bet. 3 and 5 pm.






On day three, Feast again. On day four, Fast; if you drink caffeinated beverages, drink them in the morning if you're traveling West, or between 6 and 11 pm when traveling East.







, No alcohol on the plane! If the flight is long enough, sleep until normal breakfast time at destination, but no later. Wake up and Feast on a high protein breakfast. Stay awake and active. Continue the day's meals according to mealtimes at the destination.

, Suitable meals include steak, eggs, hamburgers, high-protein cereals, and green beans.






FEAST on high carbohydrate suppers to stimulate sleep. They include pasta (but no meatballs or sausage), crepes (but no meat filling), potatoes, other starchy vegetables and sweet desserts.






FAST days help deplete the liver's store of carbohydrates and prepare the body's clock for resetting. Suitable foods include fruit, light soups and/or broths, skimpy salads, unbuttered toast, half pieces of bread. Keep calories and carbohydrates to a minimum.

Consider everything in moderation.,
Balance out your meals.,
Choose your alcohol wisely.,
Eat when you’re hungry and stop when you’re comfortable.,
Avoid buffets.",How to Eat Healthy on Vacation2," You shouldn’t want to deprive yourself, especially while on vacation. But make sure you are practicing self-control when splurging on a treat. Try limiting treats to one per day or employing the 80/20 rule: make 80% of your daily caloric intake healthy foods, and reserve 20% for your treats.


For example, have a bite or two of your favorite cake at dessert but don’t eat the entire piece.
Think of your calories as an allowance. Save up your calories by making healthy choices so that you can spend more on the items you really want.

, Your goal is to look at your nutrient intake over the course of the entire trip. If you have a calorie-heavy meal, make the next one healthy. If you had cookies as a snack, eat veggies next time. This is known as the “never two in a row” rule. While on vacation you don’t have to stay 100% on track, but you don’t want to lose your momentum either (it will make it difficult to bounce back after vacation).Another way to balance out your meals is by eating less carbs if you plan on drinking alcoholic beverages. Alcoholic beverages such as beer and mixed drinks are loaded with carbs. If you plan on drinking, be diligent with your carb intake during your meals.
Make a conscious effort to eat lighter throughout the day so you have some wiggle room when it comes to your splurges.

, If you’re restricting calories or counting carbs, alcohol can waste a good portion of your allotted amount. Having just one frozen margarita can account for up to 700 calories.


Portion control is important with alcohol, even on vacation. Alcohol has more calories per gram than carbs or protein (7 calories/g compared to 4). Limit portions to one to two for men and one for women — 12 oz beer, 5 oz wine, 1.5 oz liquor.
Make better choices to limit your sugar intake. For example, instead of mixed cocktails that are high in sugar content, opt for low-calorie drinks such as a white-wine spritzer, light beer, flavored vodka with club soda, or tequila on the rocks with lime.
Even one night of binge drinking can cause a lot of problems for a healthy diet in terms of calories. In addition, people tend to snack/eat while binging and use poor judgement on food choices.
Avoid using soft drinks, fruit juices, and energy drinks as mixers. These will increase your calorie and sugar intake. Look for calorie-free mixers or drink it on the rocks.

, While it sounds easy enough, being in the vacation mindset can often cause you to overeat by eating when you’re not hungry and stuffing yourself until you are miserable. Try using a rating scale (such as zero to five) to determine if you are indeed hungry.Likewise, stop eating when you are satisfied, not stuffed.Your hunger scale should account for all levels of hunger and satiety. For example, zero should be starving, three should be satisfied, and five should be stuffed, couldn’t eat another bite., Buffets can be damaging to diets because many times they offer all of the foods you love in a single place. It’s difficult to avoid splurging when everything is in front of you for the taking. If you’re unable to avoid a buffet, build your meal around vegetables and grilled meats and avoid high-fat options.It’s okay to treat yourself to one of your favorites but remember that portion size and balance are very important.
Avoid going back for additional helpings at the buffet.

"
"
Choose healthier menu options.,
Look for keywords that describe food preparation styles.,
Pay attention to portion sizes.,
Drink plenty of water.",How to Eat Healthy on Vacation3," Whether dining at a fast-food joint or a dine-in restaurant, look for menu items that are on the lighter side. Opt for grilled meats over fried options, load up on veggies, avoid sugary drinks, and beware of heavy dressings and condiments.Wherever your vacation destination, there will always be both healthy and unhealthy menu options. If you’re visiting Italy, opt for grilled chicken and veggies instead of high-carb pasta. If vacationing in New Orleans, order grilled shrimp or fish instead of a fried platter.
Only order healthy options that appeal to you. Otherwise, you’ll feel like you’re depriving yourself and may overeat later because of it.Customize your meal to fit your healthy lifestyle. Ask your server to prepare or dress your meal in a way that is different from what is listed on the menu. For example, order a bun-less burger if you are cutting carbs, or opt for a marinara sauce instead of an Alfredo sauce if you're counting fat or calories., Avoid fried-foods that are labeled as ""tempura"" or ""battered,"" like tempura shrimp or beer-battered fish. Opt instead for grilled or broiled meats. Additionally, stay away from high-calorie sides that are listed as ""loaded"" or ""cheesy"" such as loaded baked potatoes or cheesy mashed potatoes. Instead, order steamed or sautéed veggies., American restaurants have doubled and even triple sized their portion sizes in the last 20 years.Try ordering a “lunch” portion, sharing an entrée, ordering an appetizer as a meal, or asking to have half of the meal “doggy-bagged”., Vacation can often deter your from drinking your recommended daily water intake. However, water is important to keep your body functioning properly, and it can have the added bonus of keeping you full and satisfied to avoid overeating. Keep water in your hotel room, in your car, and in your backpack or purse so you can stay hydrated."

Typically, insurance companies will have a 24-hour hotline for these kinds of questions. If you are unsure about the number, find an internet café and look up their number online.Give them a ring and ask:


“Is my current condition covered by out-of-network coverage?”
“If I get in an accident on this trip, would my plan cover it?”;
, Read your plan or get in touch with your insurance company before your trip to find out about out-of-network coverage. You may be able to find pertinent details by reading your plan. If you cannot locate these details, you should inquire about the extent of out-of-network medical coverage and travel insurance already included in your health care plan. It is essential that you understand any out of network benefits. Consider asking:


""Will I be covered out-of-network?""
“Is travel medical insurance included in my plan?”
“What kinds of things would my plan cover in foreign countries?”
“Would medical evacuation be covered by my plan?”
“Is there an option to purchase supplementary travel medical insurance?”

, If you have some travel medical insurance included in your current insurance plan, there may still be gaps for coverage of pre-existing medical conditions or risky activities.Read your plan carefully to identify any gaps. If you are not sure, ask your insurance provider key questions to find out the gaps in your plan:


“What are the major things that are not currently covered by my plan?”
“Does my plan cover medical evacuation after accidents from risky activities like rock climbing or skydiving?”
“Will my plan cover treatment for pre-existing medical conditions while travelling?”
“If you could identify a gap in my plan when it comes to travel, what would it be?”

, Contact your insurance company to find out how you can get reimbursed for medical expenses incurred abroad. Depending on the type of coverage you own, you may have to pay out of pocket and get reimbursed when you get home. Ask your insurance company how you will be paying for out-of-network coverage:“How does the out-of-network coverage work?”
“How can I get reimbursed for medical fees incurred on my trip?”
“Can you pay the service provider directly?”

, If your travel medical insurance plan requires you to pay for services and get reimbursed upon return from your trip, you should find out what documentation you will need. You may need to keep an envelope for all of your hospital records, prescriptions and receipts from medical providers.Keep the documents in a safe place so you can provide your insurance company with appropriate documentation upon return.You might consider photocopying or scanning the receipts when you get them. Once scanned, you can email them to your provider or to yourself so that they are safe., Find out if your most recent medical expense is covered or not. Most of the insurance companies take phone calls 24 hours a day.If you are travelling and want to remind yourself about what is included in your plan, you can always give your insurer a ring.
Most travel insurance plans do not cover pre-existing medical conditions. If you have asthma or another chronic health condition, you might want to bring supplies with you., If a friend or family member has your health coverage information, you may need to call them when you are travelling. Give them a ring to find out whether your recent medical expense is covered or not. You will need to give your friend or family member a photocopy of your health insurance policy prior to going on your trip, so that they can help you check the details of your coverage while you are on the road. Further, you may want to authorize them with your insurance company so that they can phone and check your insurance coverage on your behalf.

, Go to your insurance company website. Then, log in with your username and password and look up the extent of your insurance coverage.

, When traveling internationally, remember the limits of your current insurance plan. Most plans will not cover pre-existing medical conditions or routine visits to a doctor for a physical exam. If you are travelling for an extended period and want a doctor to give you a general checkup, for instance, this may not be covered., You may want to purchase a general travel insurance plan, which typically covers medical expenses alongside trip interruption, emergency evacuation and lost or stolen luggage. The great thing about travel insurance is that it can cover you for a range of unforeseen travel expenses. Depending on your pre-existing insurance coverage, you may also want to look at medical-only plans or consider plans that focus on medical coverage but also cover some other travel risks.If you have some coverage from a credit card, you may still want to purchase additional insurance. Most credit card insurance plans are not very good for travel., Determine the type of travel medical plan that would be most appropriate for your travel plans. Travel medical insurance is appropriate if you do not have medical covered under your existing insurance or under a general travel insurance plan. If you need the insurance for a single trip, you will be looking at a single trip travel medical plan. However, if you travel more frequently, you may need either multi-trip or long-term travel medical insurance:The most common type of coverage is for single trips. It covers the length of a single vacation and often has a time limit such as six months.
If you travel multiple times in a year, you might want to consider multi-trip medical insurance.
If you are always on the road, you might want to invest in a long-term major medical insurance plan.

, Before purchasing a plan, you should find out the details of what it covers. You should also inquire about what is not covered by the plan. Get in touch with the insurance company and inquire:“Does the plan cover unexpected costs from emergency care?”
“Does the plan cover unforeseen dental costs from accidents?”
“Will the plan advance payment to a service provider?”
“Will the plan cover transportation in the event of an emergency?”
“Does the plan cover medical evacuation?”
“Does the plan include benefits if I am seriously injured or die on the road?”
“Does the plan cover other travel costs such as trip interruption or lost luggage?”

, Consider the cost of travel insurance or travel medical insurance plans. Read reviews of major providers on travel websites and magazines to identify popular budget or high end options that meet your needs. Depending on your age, health and risk tolerance, you may want to consider more or less expensive options:Budget travel insurance typically costs around 4% of your trip costs.
A high end travel insurance plan may cost as much as 12% of your trip costs.
If your trip is very low risk, cheap and does not involve travel to a foreign country, you may be able to tolerate the risk of travelling without insurance., Based on the type of coverage you need, your risk tolerance and budget, purchase a travel medical insurance plan. Make sure you get your plan before you leave the country., Prior to leaving on your trip, you should leave a photocopy of your insurance plan information and coverage details with a close friend or family member.

Read all of the directions.,
Take a pencil and underline any key action words you see.,
Always use specific examples.,
Always use correct organization.,
Try to enjoy writing the essay.,
On a test, if you run into a question that you don't know, move on to next one and complete the test.,
Before the test, be in a positive mood.,
If you know the essay topic, be sure to write a practice essay at home.",How to Understand What Is Being Asked of You in an Essay or Exam," No matter how many wrong answers you have, as long as you follow ALL the directions, you will get some credit. Re-read the question slowly. In your haste and panic, you may have missed the point. Then, analyze what you have learned and start writing.;
, Words like ""explain"" mean that the question is looking for an in-depth definition. Words like ""evaluate"" mean the question is looking for you to look at the good and bad points of a topic.

, No matter how obvious the sentence is, there always should be an example. For example: ""During Urbanization in the late 1880s, many disasters happened in cities, such as Chicago's Great Fire and San Francisco's Earthquake"".

, Your essay should begin with an introductory paragraph containing a clearly stated thesis (argument); it should contain several body paragraphs, supporting the introduction and thesis; and it should end with a concluding paragraph, which summarizes how the essay supports the thesis (conclusion/argument).

, Analyze your favorite author/book. What do you like about it? Try to bring whatever you like about other authors and writing into your essay. Do NOT plagiarize. Just write with a similar style and make your essay interesting.

, Then, go back to the question. Read it through. Analyze every word. Look through the test. Maybe answer is somewhere in here (sometimes, one question has to do with another one). If it isn't, re-read the question slowly. Look for key points and make an educated guess. If you bubbled something in, do not erase it. Most of the times, if you do, it is wrong (unless you did not study for test at all).

, Imagine getting an A+ on the test. Imagine being happy and bringing the report card home. Then, say to yourself ""I am going to pass this test"" several times. Close your eyes. Relax. Imagine success again. Then, take the pencil and begin.

, Proofread it and write another one on same topic. Learn from your mistakes. Bring two copies to school and read them over and over until the actual essay. Put the practice essays away and write a perfect paper.

",How to Teach Reading to First Graders," For example, teach the words: it, she, he, was, am, I, will, etc. Make them go over those words several times, as revision is good reinforcement.;
, As they are beginners, use some easy-to-pronounce-and-understand words.

, That is, pronouncing the word sounds. Make them say these words in sounds and when grasp this concept, teach them new words.

, Make it interesting by colorful flashcards and a comfy, bright classroom. If the atmosphere is bold and attractive, students will learn with greater ease.

, Choose some appropriate simple sentences. Write them out in attractive colors and have the children read them. If they can do word reading, they can do sentence reading as well. If they cannot, go back and revise.

, First spell the starting word of the sentence with the phonetic method and so on. Encourage the students to spell the words out with sounds and then have them read the sentence bit by bit.


Make sure that the students are not stressed. Give them breaks and have light gossips to have a light mood.

, Better yet, use picture sentences to tell them what is going on in the sentence. You could even borrow picture books with one sentence on one page. It sounds childish but this is the step to improve sentences. Do not rush through the sentences. Repeat the concept if they have not grasped it but with a different example. Children stress out if they are given the same lessons over and over.

, First teach small sentences, then big sentences bit by bit, patiently.

, Paragraphs will be easy for the students when they have a clear concept of words and sentences and pronunciation.

, Use books with colorful illustrations. When they have familiarity with the books, layout and paragraphs, the process will be easier. If they do not improve, do not punish them; instead, encourage and guide them.

, This will improve their sense of reading.

Teach the alphabet.,
Teach sounds.,
Teach short, one-syllable words.,
Teach sight words.,
Build vocabulary.,
Build fluency.,
Test reading comprehension.",How to Teach Reading1," The first step in learning to read is recognizing the letters of the alphabet. Use a poster, chalkboard, or notebook to write or display the alphabet. Go over the letters with the student until he or she learns them all. Use the alphabet song to help the student to remember.


Once the student knows the alphabet in order, challenge him or her by writing several letters out of order and ask them to recall the letters.
You can also name one of the letters and ask the student to point it out.
When teaching a child, start by teaching his or her the letters of their own name. This makes learning the letters personal and important. Because it is something important to the child — his own name - the child “owns” his learning, and will be excited by it.;
, Once your student is familiar with the alphabet, you will need to teach them the sounds of each letter. Learning the name of the letter is not enough, as a letter may be pronounced differently depending on the word. For example the ''g sound in the word ""green"" is different from the g sound in the word ""giraffe."" Once the student has mastered the sounds of individual letters, they can practice blending letter sounds together to form words.


This knowledge of the basic sounds of spoken language and their ability to be manipulated to form different words is known as phonemic awareness.Go over each letter and teach the sounds that the letter makes. Give examples of words that start with each letter and ask the student to give examples as well.
You can also try stating a word and asking the student which letter it starts with.
You can then familiarize students with common letter pairs which make specific sounds, such as “ch”, “sh”, “ph”, “qu”, “gh”, and “ck”.

, Introduce your student to basic reading by showing them two or three letter, one-syllable words. Beginners tend to do best with words that have a consonant-vowel-consonant pattern, such as CAT or DOG.


Start by asking the student to read a simple, one-syllable word such as ""sit."" Have the student name each letter, then attempt to read the word. If the student makes a mistake, ask again what sound the letter makes. The student will reflect and either remember or have to be reminded. When the word is read successfully, generously congratulate the student.
Repeat this process with other simple, one-syllable words. Once a list of about five words is created, go back to the first word and see if the student can read it more quickly.
Continue to introduce more words, gradually introducing longer and more complex words.

, Sight words are words that need to be learned by heart as they diverge from the normal rules of spelling. Many sight words such as ""father"", ""again"" and ""friend"" are also high frequency words. For this reason, it is very important that readers are able to instantly recognize these words when they come across them in a text.


The most common sight words have been compiled onto lists, such as the famous Dolch Sight Word Series and the Fry List. To teach sight words, try associating each word with an illustration. Presenting students with illustrations of sight words along with their print versions helps them to make important connections between the object and the word.
Flashcards or posters with a colorful picture and the word written under it are excellent sight word teaching tools.
Repetition is key to sight word acquisition. Beginner readers should be given the opportunity to read and write a new sight word multiple times. The repetitive reading of texts featuring certain sight words is one good strategy for helping students commit these words to memory., A student's reading vocabulary is defined as the the number of words that they know and understand as they read.Expanding your student's vocabulary is an integral part of teaching them how to read. The wider their vocabulary, the more advanced texts they will be able to read and comprehend. You can help your student to improve their vocabulary in several ways:


By encouraging them to read as much as possible and to vary the type of text they read. When reading, ask your students to underline any words they don't know, then you can explain or help them look them up the meaning in the dictionary later.
By teaching them the definitions of words or other attributes of words, such as the meanings of common roots, prefixes and suffixes.
Using association methods to help students draw connections between what they do know and words that they do not know. Pairing a new word with a known synonym is an example., Fluency is the ability to read quickly and accurately, with appropriate rhythm, intonation, and expression. Beginner readers do not possess this ability. As a result, they often struggle through texts that are beyond their ""comfort"" level. Without fluency, a reader will focus all of their energies on correctly pronouncing the words in front of them, rather than absorbing their meaning. When this happens, the reader fails to understand the meaning of the text, making the ability to read it pointless. That is why building fluency is so important.


Some non-fluent readers will hesitate when reading, unable to sound out words or figure out punctuation. Others will read without expression or changing their tone, rushing through the words without thinking about their meaning.
The best way to promote fluency in beginner readers is through repeated reading. In repeated reading, the student reads a passage many times while the teacher provides feedback about speed and accuracy levels, helps with problem words, and demonstrates fluent reading.It is also important to ensure that the student is familiar with different types of pronunciation. Make sure that your student knows how punctuation marks such as a comma, a period, a question mark and an exclamation point will affect the flow and intonation of their reading., Reading comprehension is the process of constructing meaning from what is read. In order to comprehend a text, a reader must associate the words they read with their actual meaning. Enabling your student to comprehend the text they are reading is your main goal as a teacher, as without comprehension, reading is meaningless.


In order to test your student's progress, you will need to assess their reading comprehension. Typically this can be done by asking your student to read and answer questions about what they have read. Formats include multiple-choice, short answer, and fill-in-the-blank questions.
You can also assess your student's knowledge of comprehension strategies by asking them questions while reading, getting them to give you a summary of what they have just read and by observing them as they read.

Eat the Book.,
Flip to the table of contents (if there is one).,
If you have to read a specific chapter, move on to that part.,
Look for topic sentences.,
Set a time limit.,
Take notes.,
Ask yourself questions about what you had learned.",How to Read Uninteresting Books," Ask yourself if you understand the title. For example: ""The book I am holding is called Mac OS 9 for Dummies. Thus, I can assume this book will tell me all about how to understand and install Mac OS 9."";
, If there isn't one you can skip this step. If you only need to read a specific chapter, the table of contents will direct you there. If you (unfortunately) need to read the entire book, skim over the entire table of contents and make sure you understand each heading. For example: Mac OS 9 for Dummies has a table of contents. The first part says foreword which will probably be something you don't need to read. The introduction will tell you special things in this book. There are several parts. The first one you understand (called Basic Training, it'll tell you about the basics of Mac knowledge). But, the second you don't (called Making it Purr). So you read further down and are able (just by looking at the table of contents) to understand that this is about the special parts of the computer and making them work.

, If this book has hard words don't waste time trying to slave over a dictionary just trying to understand one sentence. If you don't understand a word, try using the clues in the rest of the sentence to understand it. For example: If you didn't understand what the word amiable meant and the sentence was: ""She seemed amiable enough to invite us over for tea next Friday."" You would pretend amiable was not there and read the sentence again. ""She seemed ....... enough to invite us over for tea next Friday."" You could assume that amiable meant nice, animated, or happy just based on that sentence's clues.

, Usually a book will have a topic sentence of every paragraph. A topic sentence will tell you what the next paragraph will be about. If this book you are reading is a drama, horror, or some other sort of pleasure reading, it most likely doesn't.

, If you don't finish this chapter in 30 minutes maybe it is time for a little break to refresh your brain and think about what you have learned in the plot or the information.

, If you take notes while reading a lame Chemistry book or Don Quixote, it doesn't matter if you don't think you comprehend it; you will earn that knowledge. Refer to the ""Tips"" section below.

, If you can answer something very well you may have understood it very well.

Read to your child.,
Set a good example.,
Look at the pictures.,
Use variety.,
Be creative.",How to Teach Reading2," Read to your child as often as possible. Doing so teaches your child that reading is fun and also introduces your child to the way that written words sound when spoken aloud. Reading to your child is also a great bonding experience and will encourage them to love books.


You can begin reading to your child from infancy onward. Use picture books, textured cloth books and books of lullabies for babies and toddlers. Once they get a bit older, you can introduce alphabet books and rhyming books.
Engage your child by asking him questions about both the content of the book and its pictures. Asking your child questions about the book you are reading together makes the whole experience more interactive and encourages the child to actually comprehend what he is seeing and reading.
With babies, you should try pointing at certain pictures and asking questions such as ""Do you see the tractor?"" while pointing at the tractor. This will help his vocabulary, while allowing him to interact with the reading process. As he progresses, point at animals like cats or sheep and ask him to make those animals' noises - like ""meow"" or ""baa"". This shows that your baby is understanding what they see, while also providing great entertainment!, Even if your child displays an interest in reading from a young age, he will quickly lose interest if reading is not demonstrated or encouraged in the home. Children learn by example, so pick up a book and show your child that reading is something that adults enjoy too.Even if you're very busy, try to let your child see you reading for at least a couple of minutes everyday. You don't have to read a classic novel to set a good example. Read a newspaper, a cookbook, a thriller…it’s up to you!

, Looking at picture books is a great way to build vocabulary and to help children understand what is going on in a story. Before reading a new book, just flip through the pages, commenting on the pictures. Show your child how to spot context clues that will help them to read.Try asking questions that they can answer from looking at the pictures. For example, if there's a color word, ask them to guess what the word is from the picture.
Praise correct responses, and ask more questions to encourage them if they're frustrated.

, When choosing materials to help your children learn to read, include a mixture of phonics books that they can eventually read all by themselves, slightly more advanced stories that you'll read together and just-for-fun materials of their choice, like comic books and magazines.


Using various types of materials and activities helps make learning to read an enjoyable activity, not a chore.
Do you have a childhood favorite that you want to share with your kids? If there's a book that you've read over and over again, your love for it can be contagious., A little creativity goes a long way when it comes to teaching kids to read. If your child is stimulated by the learning process, you will find it easier to hold their attention and they will learn much faster as a result. Think outside the box and turn learning to read into a fun activity.


Put on a show. You can make reading stories fun and help improve reading comprehension through role playing. Tell your kids that after reading the book together, you'll decide which characters each of you will play. You can write a short script together, create props and dress up in costumes or masks.Try making letters out of Play-Doh, writing in the sand at the beach, drawing on the carpet or using pipe cleaners to create words."

Understand that teaching an adult how to read is a difficult undertaking.,
Assess their ability.,
Make them feel secure.,
Use appropriate materials.,
Make it relevant.",How to Teach Reading3," Adults are not as quick at learning new skills as children and they may find it difficult to remember letter sounds and words that a child would pick up easily. However, teaching an adult how to read is also an extremely rewarding experience. You will just need time and a considerable amount of patience.


Unlike children, adult learners cannot spend several hours in a classroom everyday. If they are juggling work and family life, they will have a couple of hours a week at most to work on their reading. This can significantly prolong the learning process.
Illiterate adults may also have a lifetimes worth of negative experiences and emotions that they associate with their inability to read, which can be difficult to overcome.

, In order to find out where to begin, you will need to assess your student's current reading ability. This may be a professional assessment or simply asking the learner to do whatever reading and writing he/she already knows, and taking note of where he/she struggles.


Continue observing your learner's level throughout the learning process.
If he or she consistently struggles with a particular skill or concept, take it as a cue to help work on that skill.

, An illiterate adult's greatest challenge is overcoming insecurity about their ability to read. Many adults suffer from a lack of confidence and from the fear that it is too late for them to learn how to read. Express confidence in their learning abilities and reassure them that it is never to late to start.


Reassure them that their familiarity with spoken English and their pre-existing vocabulary will play a major role in learning how to read.
Many adults have spent years hiding their inability to read from teachers, family and co-workers. Let them know that they no longer need to be ashamed or embarrassed and that you respect their courage in coming to you to learn to read.

, When teaching adults, look for materials that are not too childish, or at least ask whether they mind using children's materials. However, keep in mind that children's books can be easy beginning materials, as they use simple words and rhymes to reinforce the connection between letter patterns and sounds.


Also remember that if you use materials that are too difficult or outside of their comfort zone, adult readers can easily become discouraged.
Using materials that are challenging, yet manageable will help to build the adult reader's ability and confidence.

, Try to use material that is interesting and relevant to your student. By using relevant materials, you are making the learning process less of a chore and are encouraging your adult student by showing them the practical applications of learning to read.


Try using road signs, newspaper articles or restaurant menus when practicing reading.
Use technology by sending your student each new word they have to learn via text message. This makes learning fun and relevant to everyday life.

Choose a book you'll enjoy.The book you're reading has a lot to do with how motivated you'll be to finish it.,

Find the perfect reading area.,
Set the mood.,
Grab a snack and some water.,
Set targets for yourself.,
Commit yourself to reading the full book.,
Eliminate regression.,
Practice speed reading.,
Take it to go.,
Take short breaks.,
Enjoy it.",How to Read a Novel in One Day," If you don't have a perfect book, or if you want to find a book you'll really enjoy, make a list of your favorite hobbies, subjects, and genres. Use the list to guide you when selecting the book you'll read.

Solicit suggestions from friends and family. You can also visit your public library, and speak to a trustworthy librarian.
Whatever book you choose, make sure it is suitable for your preferences and reading ability. Be realistic. Do not choose a book that is difficult to get through, or one that you find boring.
If you don’t get to choose your book, find a way to get excited about the book you have been assigned. Try to connect with a character or the setting. Let yourself be transported to the time and place described in the book. Imagine what you would do in the protagonist's shoes.;
, A shorter book can generally be read in a shorter period of time than a longer one.


As you become a faster and more focused reader, you will be able to begin reading longer, more challenging novels in a day as well.

, The location of your reading can have a profound effect on how well you read. Pick a quiet, comfortable place without distractions. Turn off your tablet and phone. Avoid any crowded, busy or noisy spaces.Don’t read in a place where you’ll be too relaxed. Beds, hammocks, and the like make poor reading environments because you are likely to fall asleep in them. Your reading area should be arranged to facilitate concentration on your novel.Let your family or housemates know you’re trying to focus on your reading. Kindly ask them not to distract or interrupt you.

, There are a number of ways to create an ideal reading environment. You could play soft music in the background to make you more relaxed. If need be, use earplugs or white noise machines to drown out noisy neighbors or housemates. Do whatever makes you most comfortable and will most benefit your reading experience.


Wherever you are, maintain an upright posture with both feet on the ground. This ensures adequate blood flow and even breathing.Ensure your reading space is well-lit to avoid straining your eyes.

, Snacking will help reduce your need to set your book aside for a big meal when you get hungry. Choose a nutritious snack like fruit or carrots – something you can eat with one hand -- and place it within reach of your reading spot. You'll need a cup of water as well to wash the snack down and avoid dehydration.Junk food is a poor choice for a reading snack. Chips, soda, and candy don’t have the nutrients you need to keep your brain refreshed and alert. They also make you crave more snacks and leave you feeling empty., Take breaks only after reaching a predetermined goal. You can set a goal based on reading time or on number of pages read. For instance, maybe you decide to read 100 pages before taking a break. Or you might decide to read for thirty minutes, then reward yourself with a 5-10 minute break before returning to your novel.

, Before you even open your novel, tell yourself you can and will read it in one day. Set aside a specific time to read and then do it.Telling other people your intentions makes you more likely to follow through on them. Share your reading goal with a friend or family member.

, Regression is the act of re-reading portions of the novel that you’ve already read. You can eliminate regression by using trackers and taking notes.


Trackers (sometimes called pacers) will help you precisely follow a line of text. For instance, following a line of text with a pen or your finger as you read can help you maintain your position in the novel.Taking notes is a good way to eliminate regression too. Making notes on your reactions to the novel’s events or characters will help you stay focused. If you have questions about the text, write these down too. The novel’s atmosphere or the author’s tone may also deserve attention.

Read an entire paragraph or page before taking notes to limit the disruption.You can write notes in the margins of the book or on a separate notepad.



, Speed reading is the act of absorbing a greater amount of textual information in a shorter period of time. There are a number of tricks to speed reading:Look at more than one word at a time. The eye can be trained to absorb whole lines or paragraphs of text as well as single words.
Don’t stop to look up unfamiliar words. It is likely that the word in question will have only a small impact on the overall meaning of the text. Try to use context clues to reason out the definition of the unknown word.Visualize everything in detail. The more clearly you can see the characters, locations, and events of your novel, the easier they will be to recall. This is because you will be reading with the part of your brain which manages visual information, as well as the part which processes linguistic information., If you have to leave your ideal reading area for some reason, you don't have to stop reading. You can listen to an audiobook or read an e-book on the train, plane, or bus.


While some people are attached to the physical form of the book, if you own an e-book reader you can use it to read more easily on the go. Take your e-book with you when you have to go out. It takes up less space in your backpack or bag than a regular book.
Listen to audiobooks. Bring a copy of the audio edition of your novel with you when you leave your reading nook. Listening to your novel as you drive or walk is a great way to continue making progress on it when you can’t sit down for quality reading time.Don’t try to substitute the audiobook for the real deal. ""Reading"" an audiobook to completion takes far longer than does reading through the text of your novel.

, After a reasonable amount of time has elapsed, give yourself a brief rest.Refresh yourself and splash some water on your face. Reload on water and snacks. Refresh your mind for another round of focused reading.


The amount of time spent reading before taking a break will vary with the individual. A seasoned reader may go an hour or more before taking a break; a slower reader might want to take a rest after just 30 minutes.
Since you want to finish your novel in just one day, the longer you can go without taking a break, the better.
If you find yourself staring blankly at the page, re-reading large portions of the text, or feeling generally distracted, set the novel aside and take a break. Walk around the house for a few minutes or grab a snack.

, Try to get caught up in the action, and forget where you are at the moment. This can make you want to read more and accelerate the reading process. Concentrate on the story and get excited about what you're reading.With your novel complete, reflect on what you've read and share your experience with a friend.

When you have found your book, start it.,
Everyone's different.,
Finishing.",How to Read Good Books," Do you like fiction, non-fiction, biographies, romance, mysteries, horror, adventure, or tinkering books such as how-to or craft manuals?;
, Browse through the areas that interest you. Pick up books that you might not normally choose because the cover appears unappealing or old.

, If you usually search for a book under the heading of 'fiction' or 'non fiction', try checking out other headings. You might just find a book hidden there, that looks interesting when you pick it up., There are often seasonal picks for vacation times and there are always regular reviews of new books. For older books, many online book stores have the comments of other readers for you to browse through.

, This is a great way to build your knowledge about interesting books. Often the reasons given by a person who is explaining why a book matters to them will inspire you to want to read it too.

, Before you immediately take the book out, read the blurb at the back or a few pages. Don't get carried away though, because sometimes books can seem good but when you take them out they turn out to be not so good.

, The best way to start a new book, is to be fully concentrated into it. This means no distractions, no interruptions and full attention. The reason for that is the start of a book is always the best. It usually introduces the characters and the key storyline/plot of the book. This is the most vital information that you need to know about the story. Read it! Try not to read it in long time periods, try to read the book frequently. Maybe you are put off by the idea of reading every night. Maybe you want to read every night. When you read, the best way is to be on your own so that you can pay full attention to the happenings in the story. Read in a quiet place. Other sounds such as music, TV, or people can be a distraction.

, Sometimes people have competitions to see who can read a book quicker. This is a bad idea. People can become too competitive. Some people struggle to read so much in a certain time period.

, Once you have finished the book, return it to the library. If it is overdue, you may receive a fine. Usually though, school libraries only charge a penny per day.

Time yourself.,
Count your pages.,
Read with others.,
Read in a way that commands your focus.,
Listen to an audio Bible.,
Sign up for an online Bible email service.,
Read with prayer.",How to Read The Bible In a Year1," To get through a long text without losing focus, try reading your bible for a regular amount of time every day. You might read for twenty minutes to an hour, depending on your reading speed and attention span. If there is a time of your day when you can count on having a certain amount of quiet time, read then.


Keep a calendar and track your progress. Tick a box every day you do your reading.
If you have an average reading speed and you read for about ten minutes a day for a year, you should finish with time to spare. To be able to take off some days and spend extra time on dense passages, try reading for at least twenty minutes at a time.;
, Take the number of pages in your edition of the Bible, and divide it by 365. Then, read that number of pages every day. For example, if your edition of the Bible has 1,760 pages, that's 4.8 pages a day. Round up and read 5 pages a day. Check your progress every month to make sure you've made your monthly page count.


If dividing your reading up by day doesn't work, because you have a changeable schedule, try setting weekly or monthly reading goals.

, You might find it easier to meet your reading goals and boost your comprehension if you have company. Join an existing reading group, or form your own. If you attend a church, an interfaith organization, or a secular organization such as an anarchist free school, propose a reading group and decide on a pace, order, and meeting schedule that suits your group. Members of your group can read together in a room, or read separately and come together for monthly meetings.


Alternatively, ask a friend or family member to read along with you. Even a long distance friend can be a good reading buddy—set reading goals together, and make a weekly discussion date online, in person, or over the phone.
Take a class. Search online, or at your local community college, church, or free school, for Bible study classes. Taking a course that requires you to read the whole Bible will motivate you to read, while providing valuable historical context.

, Taking in a text is very different from skimming. Choose to read in a way that lets you really absorb the words in front of you. Reading aloud can help you retain what you read.Rereading can also be helpful.


If you are a morning person, read in the morning. If you focus better at night, read then.
If you find your mind wandering, try reading in sections. For instance, read for twenty minutes, stand up and have a glass of water, then read for another twenty.

, If you have trouble comprehending reading, or would just like to hear the Bible while you do your daily chores or exercises, download a recording of someone reading it. If you search online, you can even find audiobooks that are designed to be listened to over an entire year.


Even if you are also reading the Bible, you might consider listening as well. If you are reading one translation you might choose to listen to a different translation, for example.

, You can sign up for a plan that emails you your daily readings. If you have trouble picking up a book regularly, but are very prompt with emails, you can motivate yourself by marking your Bible email ""read"" each day.

, If you are reading for purposes of devotion, include your reading in your daily faith routine. Pray before or after you read. Read purposefully, as if you were praying. Ask for guidance in your reading. Read with a question in mind, or read blindly and allow your mind to absorb the wisdom of the words.

Read several graphic novels in addition to the one you plan to review.,
Read other graphic novel reviews.,
Learn about the writer and artist who worked on the graphic novel.",How to Write a Graphic Novel Review1," If you're fairly new to graphic novels, this will give you some perspective as to the range of themes they cover, as well as familiarize you with the overall style of the author and artist who worked on a given novel and variations in writing and artistic styles across the genre. If you haven't decided on a graphic novel to review, this will also help you make up your mind.


Reading other graphic novels also lets you recommend other graphic novels in a similar vein to the one you're reviewing.;
, This will give you some perspective on how to structure your own review. If you plan to write a review for a particular magazine or website, studying reviews published there will give you concrete examples of how the review should be formatted and what information should be covered. If you plan to write a review for your own blog, reading other reviews will give you ideas on developing a consistent format for the reviews you post.

, This will tell you something of the past works of the writer and artist, which can direct you to other works you may want to read for comparison and contrast. It will also provide you with biographical information about the writer or artist, so that you can see the artistic and life influences in his or her work. Prominent writers and artists such as Frank Miller have their own websites, while information about other comics' writers and artists may be available on fan-created websites and blogs or on sites such as Wikipedia, IMDb, or YouTube.


When reading from any fan-created website or post, be sure to view the material with a critical eye. The quality of the writing is an indication, but also look for an ""About"" page that tells you about the person or group putting the material together.

"
"
Look the graphic novel over before you actually read it.,
Note how the graphic novel is structured.,
Read through the graphic novel carefully, taking notes as you go.",How to Write a Graphic Novel Review2," Consider some of the things that attract you to the graphic novel you're holding in your hands: the title (both the actual words and the way they're rendered), the subject matter, the cover art (front and back), any blurbs, the author and artist, and so on. Any of these can serve as a jumping-off point for your review. Skim through the graphic novel to get a sense of the writing and art styles.

, Superhero graphic novels may either be original stories or collected from story arcs published over a series of issues of a regular title or miniseries, such as Frank Miller's ""Batman: The Dark Knight Returns"" being compiled from a 4-issue miniseries; each issue becomes a chapter title in the book. Graphic novels about real people, such as Reinhard Kleist's ""I See a Darkness,"" about the life of Johnny Cash, is structured around key points of Cash's life and career: his early years, his 1968 concert at Folsom Prison at the height of his career, and concluding his final album for Rick Rubin just after wife June Carter's death.

, Make notes about the story, the writing, the art, and any literary or artistic devices you see used in telling the story.


For example, both ""The Dark Knight Returns"" and ""I See a Darkness"" make considerable use of shadow in their art. For ""The Dark Knight Returns,"" which is rendered in color, the shadows show both the gritty reality of the graphic novels' version of Gotham City the story is set in and symbolize the twilight of Bruce Wayne's Batman career. In ""I See a Darkness,"" the shadows tie into Johnny Cash's nickname of ""The Man in Black"" and symbolize the inner demons that plagued him in the early years of his career.

Include the information the reader needs to identify and find the graphic novel.,
Identify the author/artist's reason for producing the graphic novel.,
Explain what the graphic novel is about.,
Describe the quality of the writing.,
Describe the artwork and how it supports or doesn't support the story.,
Give your opinion of the work.",How to Write a Graphic Novel Review3," You need to provide the graphic novel's title, author and artist, and genre. You should also include the publisher and copyright/release date, the format (hardcover or softcover), and, if writing the review to encourage others to buy the graphic novel, its price and ISBN number.


If the graphic novel is a compilation of a story arc presented across several issues of a comic book, you should list the original comics that carried the story. Include the dates of publication if there is the possibility of confusion due to issue renumbering, such as DC Comics 2011 reboot of all its titles, all of which were reset to Issue #1.
If the characters in the graphic novel are not well-known but appear in other media, such as a webcomic, you should mention the other media they appear in, including web links as appropriate.

, This step is most appropriate for original graphic novels or those compiled from limited comic book series instead of from a story arc in a regular comic book. The purpose may be covered or alluded to in a written preface or may also be discussed in an interview of the author/artist, but in many cases you can deduce it by careful reading of the graphic novel itself.

, You do this on 2 levels, describing the plot of the story and by covering themes expressed in the work.


The plot is the basic story. Identify the major characters, describe the setting, and mention the story's major events, but don't give away the ending or any surprises.
The theme is a specific portion of the subject of the work. For example, in Alan Moore's ""Watchmen,"" one theme would be how superheroes would affect the ""real"" world and be affected by it if they lived in it. A work may encompass several themes, or deal with several variations of a theme. For example, in ""Watchmen,"" the theme of superheroes as being on the fringe of humanity is represented by Rorschach's partial insanity and Dr. Manhattan's increasingly detached behavior as a result of perceiving all of time at once.

, Discuss the pacing of the story: the amount of time spent in building up the main conflict, the conflict itself, and its resolution (without stating how the conflict is resolved). Note the dialog and whether it makes sense for the character speaking it, and for a juvenile graphic novel, how appropriate it is for the reader. Cover any literary techniques used in the work, such as the use of allegory, metaphor, and symbolism.


Note that in a graphic novel, the artwork supplements and sometimes replaces the use of words to convey images to the reader's mind.

, Describe the general artistic style (realistic, cartoon-like, manga) and how it is used in the story (earth tones for a nature goddess, dead, gnarled trees in a graveyard, red strips on the walls of government offices to represent ""red tape,"" etc.). Also note any unusual placements of panels, such as Alan Moore's choice to use a 3 x 3 panel grid for ""Watchmen"" instead of the usual 2 x 4 grid, and how they impact the pacing of the story.

, In addition to providing a description of the graphic novel's high points and low points, you need to identify what, for you, were the high and low points, with concrete examples to back up your assertions.


Depending on the audience you're writing for, you can express your opinions in first-person (""I liked 'Gates of Gotham' because�"") or in third-person (""The Nightrunner character would have been better served by including the story of how he came to join up with Batman."") Choose whichever style you're most comfortable with, unless the venue you're writing for requires a particular style, and stick with it.

Pre-read.,
Take notes.,
Talk to people about what you read.,
Re-read as needed.,
Visualize what you read.",How to Read a Long Book or Document1," Take a look at the table of contents and any headings and summaries. Knowing what to expect in each particular section or chapter will help you understand the longer document as a whole. Before you dive into reading the entire text, skim some of the more important parts like the introduction or some of the appendices.Perhaps you could even read a summary of the text online before you begin reading or spend some time brainstorming what you already know about the topic.;
, In order to increase your comprehension and ability to retain the information contained in the long document you’re reading, you should attempt to take notes during your reading process. Jot down keywords, main ideas, and anything else you think is important.


Taking notes will also help you refresh your memory later when you’ve finished reading the entire thing. It’s much easier to go back over your notes rather than reading the whole text again.
You can take notes on a separate page, in the margins of the document itself (if you own it), or simply choose to underline or highlight important passages. Choose whichever method works for you.

, Discuss the content of your long document with others as you read it. This will help solidify the information in your mind as you go. Consider discussing it with your friends, colleagues, teachers, or even try starting a book club so others can read along with you.


Feel free to ask questions if you find something difficult to comprehend. Understanding the text is the most important part – otherwise you won’t remember it if you don’t understand it.

, It’s normal that reading something one time doesn’t make it stay in your brain forever. You may need to re-read it (or at least the important parts) from time to time to make sure you understand the text and retain it for the future.


You can choose which parts to re-read based on the notes that you have taken that indicate which parts are the most important. Or you can re-read the parts that you find difficult to remember.

, Take some time while you’re reading to mentally visualize all that’s happening in the text you’re reading. If it's a story, picture it in your mind. Predict what will happen next. Let yourself get drawn in to the characters and the story.If it's a nonfiction text, it may be harder to visualize the contents. Instead, try to find the reading style that works best for you and use it.
Do you learn the information just by reading and thinking about it?
Do you learn better by doing, by trying examples?
Do you learn by highlighting main points or taking notes?
Do you learn by talking about the text?
Do you learn by writing about what you have read?

"
"
Know the requirements of your assignment.,
Read the book and annotate.,
Outline the main ideas and sub-ideas of your book.",How to Write a Book Report1," Ask questions until you understand it completely. Can you read any book? Must it be a specific length? A specific genre or subject? Should you simply summarize the book or should you give your opinion, too?


Figure out what your teacher is looking for in a book report. How many words should it be? When is the deadline?
If you have not yet chosen a book, ask friends if they have any good suggestions. It's a good idea to check a very quick summary online to make sure it's your type of book. Be sure to stick to any lists or limits you have been given.;
, Keep a pencil and paper by you as you read, writing down points and page numbers. Take notes, mark important parts, underline enthralling lines (if you are allowed). Try to appreciate the book: It will teach you something if you are open to learning. Keep these things in mind:


Characters: Who are the main characters? What happens to them? Did you like them? Were there good and bad characters? Did they all have good traits and bad traits? Did they seem like real life people or animals, or did they seem fake?
Main ideas and themes: What is the main idea of the book? What happens? What did you learn that you did not know before?
Quotes: What parts did you like best? Are there parts that you could quote to make your report more enjoyable?, Do this while the story is still fresh in your head. It will help you organize your thoughts for your report.


Who were the main characters? Why did they do what they did? How did they change throughout the book, if at all? What made you like or dislike them as you read?
What were the turning points in the story? What big, important events happened in the story? How did the resolution of the story come about? Was it a satisfying ending?

Give yourself adequate time to read.,
Break the task into smaller parts.,
Determine whether you can safely skip any parts.,
Bring your document with you.,
Check out audiobooks.,
Be persistent.",How to Read a Long Book or Document2," You simply can't read an entire 400-page book in the hour before class, so start tackling the reading assignment as soon as you know what it is. Most college-aged people can read an average of 300 words per minute, so plan accordingly.If you wait until the last minute, you will stress yourself out in addition to not being able to complete the reading in time.
An average document has between 250 and 400 words per page.

, You will still need enough time in each sitting for some continuity and understanding, but you need not read the entire text in marathon sessions. Instead, set out to read for an hour, or even half an hour at a time. Take breaks every half hour or hour to restore circulation to your legs and keep yourself awake.Alternatively, choose to complete a set number of pages in each sitting. It is easier to get started if you know when you will finish.

, Your pre-reading and your purpose will help determine whether you can take short-cuts. Depending on what the purpose of your reading is, you may be able to skim some of the pages. For example, if you’re reading a long document for a presentation at work, you may need to read the entire thing. But if you’re reading a textbook for class, you may be able to pick and choose some sections instead of reading all of them.Rather than read the entire 400-page textbook this semester, could you look up what you need and read only the chapters and sections that follow the class discussions?
Would reading the headlines and a few introductory paragraphs tell you enough that you could skip reading the entire chapter?
When possible try to work smarter, not harder.

, Often times, there will be free moments when you find yourself being forced to kill time throughout your day. These times are perfect opportunities for you to steal away a little time for reading. If you bring your book with you every day, you will find more time to spend reading in these breaks.


Make sure that you don’t use this as a distraction from other things you should be doing (like reading while you’re supposed to be working). Only take moments to read when you have some dedicated time when you can adequately focus.

, If your document is a popular text, it’s possible that it may be available to you in audiobook format. This means that you can upload the file to your phone or other playing device and listen to it while you do other things.


For example, if you commute to work, you could listen to the audiobook while you drive. Or you could listen to it while you go for a bike ride or while you’re working out at the gym.

, When you have to tackle a large-scale reading assignment, you’ll need to keep at it over a period of time. Make a reading schedule and stick to it. Read some in the morning and some in the afternoon. Read some today and some tomorrow.The average person can read approximately one page per minute (depending on how many words appear on each page), so plan ahead and make sure you continue with your reading schedule so you can accomplish the large reading task.

"
"
Get comfortable.,
Eliminate distractions.,
Be rested.,
Drink some coffee.,
Get your blood pumping.",How to Read a Long Book or Document3," Find a place where you can be comfortable sitting (or in whatever position you find productive for reading) for long periods of time. You won’t be able to read for very long if you are sitting on a hard chair that makes your back hurt after a few minutes. Keep in mind, however, that you don’t want to get overly comfortable because that could encourage you to fall asleep or become lazy and distracted.


Try choosing a comfy chair that keeps you sitting upright, but allows your body to feel relaxed and comfortable.
Make sure that you have adequate lighting to be able to read. Trying to read in low lighting can cause strain on your eyes over time.

, One of the most important parts of being able to focus on reading a long document is getting rid of distractions. Turn off your TV, computer, and phone. Close the door. Tell your roommates that you need to be left alone to focus. Give yourself every opportunity to focus.Try to find or make a quiet place to read. Retreat to an office, library, or back room.
If you find yourself reading the same paragraph several times over, ask yourself why. Did you miss a word or concept along the way? Are you paying attention to something besides your reading? Is it time for a break?

, If at all possible, get enough sleep before you begin so that you won't be too tempted to nod off when you should be pressing on with the reading. Reading when you are tired can be an exercise in futility because reading often makes people more tired, or more prone to give in to exhaustion.Try going to bed early the night before you know you’re going to start reading the long document.
If you start reading and find yourself nodding off, consider taking a short catnap. Even a twenty minute nap can work wonders to help you stay awake while reading.

, It’s common knowledge that caffeine helps alleviate sleepiness, and one of the most common sources of caffeine is coffee. People often drink coffee to help them wake up in the morning or to give them a boost when they are feeling too tired. If you need help staying awake and focused to complete your reading, try drinking a cup of coffee.You could also try drinking some tea, soda, or another caffeinated beverage.

, If you’re feeling too tired to focus, you might benefit from a quick workout or other activity that gets your blood flowing. Increased blood flow to your body will help you stay awake and maintain your focus.Try to do something cardio-related – like a quick jog around the block or a few dozen jumping jacks.

Start with a clear introduction.,
Create the body of your paper.,
Write a conclusion that wraps everything up.",How to Write a Book Report2," In the first paragraph, state the title and author of the book. Your teacher may want the publisher, year of publication, genre, and the number of pages, too.


In addition to the basic facts, you should give a short summary of what your book report explores. Touch on very basic plot points of the book and the themes the author used.

, For the next few paragraphs, refer to your teacher's assignment sheet to decide which parts of your outline you want to expand on in the meat of your report.


Consider giving your opinion of the book. Was it good? What about the book made it good or bad, powerful or dull? How does this work compare with others by the same author or other books in the same genre? You can and should use examples from the book to back up your claims.
Dig a little deeper. What major themes, motifs, or terms does the book introduce, and how effective are they? Did the book appeal to you on an emotional or logical way? Would you recommend this book to others? Why? What would you tell them before they read it? What would you talk about after you read it?Don't try to summarize each chapter or every angle. Choose the ones that are most significant and interesting to you.For non-fiction, provide a general overview of the author's topic, main points, and argument. What is the thesis? What are the important conclusions? What are the author's qualifications to write about the subject? Do you agree with the author's arguments and conclusions? What is your overall response to the book? Did you find it interesting, moving, dull?, Restate your thesis or main idea in your conclusion. Review the major points and, if appropriate, state your opinion.


Pull all your thoughts together. Leave the reader with the impression you were left with and, if the book was good, make them want to read the book for themselves.

Reread your writing and reorganize it if necessary.,
Proofread your work for errors.",How to Write a Book Report3," You should have a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. Make sure that the paragraphs support your introduction, especially if you have an opinion or thesis statement there.


Make sure there are logical transitions between your points. Your paragraphs should flow into each other, but sentences should flow into each other, too.
Look over the paper your teacher gave you. Have you met all the requirements and stipulations? Is it the proper format?

, Spellcheck misses typos all the time. Better yet, give yourself a break and have somebody else proofread your work, too. Sometimes a new pair of eyes sees different mistakes.


In addition to having a friend correct your work for spelling, punctuation, and grammar mistakes, ask them about the content. Does everything make sense? Does it flow? Are they captivated?

Relate what you read to what you know.,
Get into a teacher’s mindset.,
Identify questions that you want to answer.,
Visualize what you read.",How to Read a Long Book in a Week1," Reading a long book can be a challenge if you have no interest in the book’s subject. To make reading a long book more fun, try to relate it to something that is familiar to you or at least try to understand the context of the book to make it more familiar.


For example, if the book is about a love triangle between three fictional characters, try to relate their situation to something that happened to a friend of yours or to the plot of a movie you like.
Or, if you are reading a book that was written over 100 years ago, do a little research about the author, the year the book was written, and the place where the author lived. This may help to make the book seem more approachable.;
, Pretend that you will have to teach someone what you are about to read and then read with that in mind. Consider how you would describe a character, event, or concept to someone who has not read the book. This will prompt your brain to remember the material and make it easier for you write or answer questions about the material later on., If you are reading the book for a class, then you might have a paper or test that will require you to draw on what you have read. Identify the questions that you might have to answer before you start reading. This will make it easier to stay focused and avoid getting overwhelmed by other information., Using visualization can also make reading more fun and help you to remember important information. As you read, pause now and then to imagine what the characters in the book look like, what the setting looks like, or how an important scene might have looked.


You can also use this strategy to help you remember important dates, names, and other facts as you read. For example, if the book you are reading describes an important battle, take a moment to imagine the scene. Imagine that the date of the battle and other important information about it are stamped onto the image.

Celebrate!",How to Write a Good Summary for a Book Report," Your teacher may assign a book to you, or give you a list from which to choose. If s/he doesn’t give you a specific book, you may find it helpful to ask your school librarian to recommend something that’s appropriate for the assignment.


If you can, pick a book on a topic that interests you, as this will make it more enjoyable for you to read.;
, Your teacher may give you an assignment or prompt that gives you specific details on the book report. Be sure you follow all the guidelines given, such as how long the report needs to be and what it needs to include.


Don’t confuse a book report with a book review. A book report summarizes a book and may offer your opinion on a book, but it usually focuses more on facts about the book. A book review usually describes what a book says and evaluates how the book works.
If you have any questions, ask your teacher. It’s much better to ask questions when you don’t understand something than to try to muddle through only to produce work that isn’t what your teacher expected.

, It will be much easier to draft your book report if you’ve taken notes as you go along, rather than trying to remember everything at the end. As you read, jot down a few notes on the following:Characters. If your book is fiction (or a biography or memoir), keep track of who the major characters are. What are they like? What do they do? Are they different at the end of the book than the beginning? Did you like them?
Setting. This category mainly applies to fiction. The setting of a book is where and when the story takes place (for example, the Harry Potter novels’ main setting is the school of Hogwarts). The setting may have significant influence on the characters and the story.
Story. What happens in the book? Who did what? Where in the book (beginning, middle, end) do important things seem to happen? Were there any clear “turning points” in the story, where things seem to change from what came before? How did the story resolve? What parts are your favorite parts of the story?
Main ideas/themes. This category will be slightly different for nonfiction or fiction. Nonfiction may have a very clear main idea, such as presenting a biography of a famous historical figure. For fiction, there will probably be a key theme that runs throughout the book. Think about this in terms of what you learned from the book that you didn’t know before reading it. You may find it easier if you take a few notes on each chapter.
Quotations. A good book report not only tells, but shows. For example, if you really enjoyed the author's writing style, you could use a quotation in your book report that shows why you liked it. A juicy quote that sums up the main idea of the book could also be a good idea. You don’t have to use every quotation that you write down in your report, but jot down any quotations that catch your attention.

, Your teacher may have given you specific requirements, and if so, you should follow those. There are two basic ways to organize a book report:


Organize the book report by chapter. If you organize your book report this way, you will move from chapter to chapter. You'll probably need to cover multiple chapters in each paragraph.

Pro: You can go in chronological order, which could be helpful when you're summarizing books with a lot of plot elements.
Con: This kind of organization can be more difficult to figure out if you need to talk about multiple chapters in one paragraph.


Organize the book report by type of element (""thematic"" organization). If you organize your book report this way, you could have a paragraph about the characters, a paragraph or two about plot summary, a paragraph about main ideas, and a paragraph that sums up your opinion of the book.

Pro: You can tackle a lot of plot summary in very little space. The paragraphs are clearly divided, so you know what to cover in each one.
Con: This may not be appropriate if your assignment is mostly to summarize the book rather than give your opinions about it.



, This will help you draft your summary. Put your notes into outline form depending on how you decided to organize your paragraphs.


For chronological order: Give each chapter or section of the book its own section. Write down the most important story elements and character developments that happened in each chapter.
For thematic organization: Put your notes about the various elements, such as characters, plot, and main ideas, into separate sections. Each will become a paragraph.
When you write your first draft, think about what elements move the story forward, because those will probably be the most important. You can give more detail as you revise, if you want.
For example, many things happen in Suzanne Collins’s The Hunger Games, but you can’t talk about them all. Instead, focus on the overall movement of the story. Begin by explaining what the Hunger Games are and how Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark are chosen. Then you would summarize their time in the Capitol, including information on how sponsorship works. Following that, you would summarize the most important moments from the Games, such as Katniss injuring her leg in the fire, the attack by tracker-jackers, Rue’s death, the kiss in the cave, Cato’s final battle, and the decision to eat the poisonous berries. Then, you would conclude by wrapping up the most important moments from the book’s ending.

, Your introduction should give the reader a basic idea of what the book is about. It should also give a little bit of information about its main characters and/or ideas. You don’t have to go into a lot of detail here; you just need to give enough information that your reader knows what to expect from the rest of the report.


Give publication information for the book, including the book’s title, author, year of publication, and genre. Your teacher may ask you to include other information. If your book was written by someone important, won an award, or is a best-seller, give that information too.For example, a short overall summary of Lois Lowry’s The Giver might look something like this: “Lois Lowry’s young-adult novel The Giver was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt in 1993, and it won a Newbery Medal in 1994. It is set in what appears to be a utopian society that thrives on ‘Sameness.’ There is no hunger, sadness, or poverty in this society. However, this utopia depends on keeping its people from feeling true emotions. This lack of emotion causes serious issues for the main character, Jonas, once he is chosen to become the new Receiver of Memory.”For a nonfiction book, summarize the author’s main idea or purpose for writing the book. State what you think their thesis is. For example, a short overall summary for the book I Am Malala might look like this: “The youngest recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize, Malala Yousafzai tells her incredible true story in I Am Malala: The Girl Who Stood Up for Education and Was Shot by the Taliban. This book was published by Little, Brown and Company in 2013. Malala wants to inspire other young people to believe in their power to change the world by sharing her own experience about the value of education and peaceful protest.”, Working from your outline, develop body paragraphs that summarize the most important elements of the book. Unless you’re dealing with a very short book, you almost certainly won’t be able to summarize every detail or even every chapter in your final draft. Instead, focus on what seemed most important to you about the story and the characters.For nonfiction, your summary should focus on what you think the author’s main idea is and how that idea is developed in the book. What important points does the author make? What evidence or stories from their personal experience do they use to support their points?

, If you've chosen to organize your book report chronologically, think about how the plot moves along. What are the major events in the plot? Where do things change? Where are the surprises or cliff-hangers?


Break up your paragraphs based on where the important events happen. For example, if you were summarizing J.R.R. Tolkien's novel The Hobbit, you might organize your paragraphs this way:

Introductory paragraph: summarize the book in general and gives the publication information.
Body paragraph 1: summarize Gandalf's plot to get Bilbo Baggins to become a burglar for Thorin Oakenshield and the party of Dwarves. End with Bilbo's choosing to go on an adventure (because this is a major changing point for the character).
Body paragraph 2: summarize the adventures Bilbo and the Dwarves have, such as almost being eaten by trolls, getting kidnapped by goblins, and Bilbo finding Gollum and the One Ring. There are a lot of adventures, so you wouldn't talk about them all; instead, pick the most important points. You might end with the Dwarves being captured by the Wood-Elves, because this is another ""turning point"" in the story. Bilbo has to decide whether he is brave enough to rescue everyone.
Body paragraph 3: summarize the interactions between the Dwarves and the Lake Town people, Bilbo getting into the Lonely Mountain and talking to Smaug, Smaug destroying everything and getting killed (spoiler!), and the many groups of Dwarves, Elves, and Men deciding to fight over the spoils. This is a good place to stop this paragraph, because it's the climax of the story and your reader wants to know the resolution, or how everything turns out okay.
Body paragraph 4: summarize how Bilbo tries to stop the fighting, the argument Bilbo and Thorin have, the outcome of the battle, and Bilbo coming home to discover all of his stuff is being sold off. You can also talk about how the main character, Bilbo, ends up as a different character than the way he started off. That would be a good transition into...
Conclusion paragraph: talk about the main ideas of the book and what you learned. You might talk about how important it is to learn to be brave, or how greed is criticized in the book. Then, wrap up with your opinion about the book overall. Would you recommend it to a friend?



, If you've chosen thematic organization, you can develop your paragraphs according to topic instead of letting the plot determine your paragraphs. You'll want a paragraph (or two) of plot summary, a paragraph about the characters, a paragraph about the book's main ideas or themes, and a paragraph that sums up your overall opinion.


Begin with a VERY brief plot summary. Talk about the type of book it is, where the book is set (Hogwarts, outer space, a mythical past), what the main character is trying to do or learn, and how the plot ends up.
The paragraph about characters should talk about the main character (or characters). Who are they, and why are they important? What do they want to do or learn? What flaws and strengths do they have? Do they end the book as different in some way than how they began?For example, a paragraph about the characters in The Hobbit would probably focus the most on Bilbo Baggins, the ""protagonist"" or hero of the novel. It would probably also need to talk a little bit about the other important characters: Thorin Oakenshield and Gandalf the wizard. This paragraph would consider Bilbo's character development from someone who starts off afraid of new things to someone who ends up being brave and saving his friends.


The paragraph about the main ideas or themes might be the hardest one to write, but your notes should help. Think about what lessons the characters have learned. What did this book make you think about? Did it make you ask questions?

For example, if you were writing about The Giver, you might want to discuss the importance of feelings in human lives. You could also talk about the idea that in order to experience life fully, you have to experience pain as well as pleasure. Another big theme is the idea of becoming your own person: the hero Jonas has to learn how to reject the ""Sameness"" of society to follow his own path.



, Your conclusion should wrap up by reviewing the main points of the book and giving your opinion of the book. Did you like it? Was it enjoyable? Do you agree with the author’s ideas or ways of writing? Did you learn something you didn’t know before? Explain your reasons for your reaction, using examples to support your claims.Imagine your conclusion as a way of telling others whether they should read the book or not. Would they enjoy it? Should they read it? Why or why not?

, You should have a clear structure in your report, with an introduction that provides a short summary of the book’s main points, body paragraphs that clearly summarize the book, and a conclusion that provides an overall assessment of the book.As you read, ask yourself: if you were telling this summary to a friend who hadn’t read the book, would they understand what happened? Would they have a good idea of whether or not they would like the book?

, You need transitions between your paragraphs, and also between each idea in each paragraph. These transitions help guide your reader along as they learn about what happens.


For example, instead of beginning sentences with just the word “This” or “It,” remind your reader what happened in the previous sentence. “This” is vague, but “This (contest, lottery, murder)” is clear.

, Make sure you’ve spelled the author’s and characters’ names correctly, given the complete and full title, and provided the publisher of the book (if your teacher asked for it).

, This will help you catch any awkward spots or places that seem hard to understand. Reading aloud will also help you catch proofreading errors that need correcting.

, The best way to know whether you've done a good job summarizing the important parts of your book is to ask someone else to read your book report. A friend or a parent can help you find the places that are unclear.


Don't tell your friend what the book is about or what you're focusing on before you have them read your report. That way, they will have to focus only on what's on the paper -- which is what your teacher will be doing too.

, This is important whether you’re turning in a printed copy or a handwritten copy. If you don’t put your name on the book report, your teacher won’t be able to give you a grade

, If you’re printing out your book report from a computer, use clean, heavy-duty paper in the printer. Keep the book report from getting wrinkled before you turn it in. If you’re hand-writing your book report, use your nicest, most easy-to-read handwriting and clean, unwrinkled paper.

, You’ve done a good job. Be proud of your hard work!

,
Take notes in exactly the same way for each chapter.","How to Take Notes for a ""Chapter Book"" Book Report"," You will need 5 pages labeled with the name of the book in each of the 5 sections of your notes. The sections are: Characters, Settings, Vocabulary, Plot or story notes, Predictions.;
,, As you read, you will need to watch for the names of people and places; also watch for any dates or other numbers given.

,


Leave half a page for writing down things about them. You will only have two characters on each page of paper! Every time their name is used or they are talked about in the book, the author is telling you clues about the character. Be a detective.






Catch as many of those clues as you can and list them under the character's name. Age? Physical description? Personality? Fears? Friends?

, The setting is where and when the story is taking place.
(You will only need a few lines for each setting though, so more will fit on each page.)
You don't need to copy the full description from the book, but briefly tell about it - i.e. ""A cold dark cave"" ""Aunt Tillie's house in the city.""

, Many of them you can guess at.


If a word is new or unfamiliar to you, write it down in your vocabulary section.
Write down the page number where you first saw the word, and the sentence it was used in (this is very important).
Leave four more spaces for adding a definition later.

,


Write 1-3 sentences (in your own words) about what has happened in this chapter.
Try to pick out what you think will be the most important things that happened.

, Don't look ahead!


Guess what will happen in the next chapter. It's okay if you don't get it right. One fun thing to do here is think, ""If I was writing this story, what would I have happen next?""
See if you can figure out what the author is going to do next.

, Many words will have more than one meaning. You will need to copy down only the meaning for the word as it was used in the story (that's why you wrote down the sentence it appeared in, so you would know which meaning you needed).

,,,,


When you have finished the book, you will have everything you need to do an excellent book report! You will have an entire story line, descriptions of all the characters, new words you've learned, and even notes about what you thought would happen and if the author could surprise you or not!

Determine your time frame.,
Calculate how many pages you have to read.,
Remove distractions.,
Set a timer.,
Use a pointer.,
Read the introductions and the conclusions first.,
Speed read.",How to Read a Long Book in a Week2," Consider how many hours you can dedicate to reading per day. Take into consideration all of your obligations. Write down your routine to determine how much time you can realistically set aside for reading. Calculate the time you spend:


Sleeping
Working
Attending school
Doing misc. activities (sports, extra curricular activities, studying, homework, etc)
Having free time where you will not be reading

, Once you have a dedicated amount of time you have set aside to read, consider how many pages you have to read every day to finish the book by the end of a week. For example, if you have a 300 page book to read in 7 days, you can realistically expect to have to read about 43 pages per day. That is 300 pages divided by 7 days.


If you want to determine how many pages you have to read per hour using this calculation, divide number of pages per day by hours you expect to read per day.For example, if you plan on reading for two hours a day, that would be 21.5 pages per hour. You may need to spend more or less time reading every day depending on the length of your book and how fast you can read.
Consider reading as much as you can in the first day or two of the week. Rather than spacing out your reading evenly, you might try to read most of the book in the first two days of the week. This will give you a head start and provide a cushion in case you have to skip a day. For example, if you have a 300 page book to read, try reading 100 pages on the first day of the week and 75 on the second day. Then you will only have to read 125 pages over the next five days.

, You will retain more of what you read and be able to read more easily if you are in a quiet environment that is free of distractions. Some good ways to minimize distractions include:


Reading in an empty, quiet room.
Reading in a library.
Using noise-canceling headphones to create a quiet environment.
Putting on white noise or soft, non-distracting music to help you concentrate.

, It is easy to get lazy and stop reading before you should. If you have a set number of pages to read in a certain amount of time, set a timer for yourself. Force yourself to read until the timer goes off.


To stop burnout, consider the “20 minutes on, 5 minutes off” method.This is where you set a timer for twenty minutes and force yourself to concentrate without taking breaks. When the timer goes off, let yourself spend five minutes doing something you enjoy (or nothing at all!)

, Studies have shown that readers retain more and read more quickly by using something that points to the text.This allows your eyes to follow along with the text. The simplest pointer to use is the tip of your finger. You can also try:


Using a ruler and placing it under the line of text you are reading.
Following along with the point of a pencil.
If reading an Ebook, setting the font to have a single line of text visible when reading until prompted to a new page.

, By skimming a text, you can read more in a short period of time. However, you may not retain the information that you read. One way you can retain more and still read quickly is to read the introductory paragraph(s) and conclusion paragraph(s) of each chapter. These should highlight the main arguments and findings of the chapter.By doing this, you will also be more likely to understand the entire chapter if you have the key argument/idea in mind while you read.
In the introduction, look for the author's argument. Generally, an introduction is made up of an attention grabber (usually the first part of the introduction) and then the key argument/thesis statement/research question. This is the sentence(s) you want to look for; it will give you exactly what the author intends to discuss in her writing.Similar to the introduction, the conclusion also should contain the author's initial argument. It should also contain some sort of findings or conclusion of key points. It will help to give you a general idea of what the writing is about.
This technique is mostly used for non-fiction in which you are trying to process information. You can do this while reading fiction, but you might miss character or plot development.

, This technique requires you to train your eyes to make less movements when reading a page.To learn to speed read, try to:


Cover text you have already read by using an index card.
Train your eyes to stop on fewer words by trying to not focus on each individual word.
Try RSVP (reading rapid serial visual presentation) software. This software will flash a single word at a time on the screen, training your brain to recognize words more quickly.

"
Use sticky notes.,
Annotate your book.,
Subvocalize.,
Slow down at certain parts.,
Practice!",How to Read a Long Book in a Week3," Using visual markers, like sticky notes, will help you read faster because you will be visually reminding yourself of what you have read.


You can use these visual cues to mark chapters already read, passages you struggled with, or inspiring quotes.

, Making notes of what you read and how you felt about it is an excellent way to become a faster reader.It forces you to write down your reactions and emotions as you read. You will be more likely to remember what you have read and also make connections to further reading. Some ways to annotate include:


Highlighting passages you find interesting, intriguing, or important.
Summarizing chapters/paragraphs to capture main ideas, findings, or arguments.
Noting reactions/emotions/questions you have in the margins of the book.
Underlining important words or phrases.
Writing the definition of unknown or confusing words/concepts.

, Subvocalization is applying silent speech to reading. It may help you read faster because you are not only reading the words with your mind, but also forming the words with your mouth. To practice subvocalization, form each word silently as you read.You can do this without moving your lips by pretending to read out loud the text in your mind in a conversational tone, as if you were talking to someone.
This activity is disputed by scientists. Some say that this is a great way to learn to speed reading, while others argue that it actually slows down the reading process. Give this technique a try to see if it works for you., While your first instinct may be to read as fast you can to finish the book, you probably will not retain a lot of what you have read this way. Instead, when you come to an interesting or important part of the text, slow down your reading. Try to internalize what you are learning. This will help your reading speed in the long run as it helps with comprehension.


The more you read, the more you will learn to recognize ""important"" parts of the text. For example, you may want to slow down when reading the introduction in order to really comprehend the material.

, Just like anything in life, reading quickly takes practice! If you want to try to increase your read speed, try to calculate how many pages you read per minutes. Then, try and beat your personal record. Just make sure you are understanding what you read!


Try and read more for pleasure to naturally increase your reading speed.
Time yourself when reading when you aren't under a deadline. Push yourself to read a set number of pages faster. Set goals for yourself.
Avoid getting frustrated when reading. If you think you read too slow, the worst thing you can do is get frustrated and quit. Instead, keep at it! You will improve over time.

Find a quiet spot.,
Avoid reading in bed.,
Schedule time for reading.,
Commit.",How to Read a Long Book in a Week4," To really “sink into” a good book, you must first find a comfortable spot. Try different locations around your home to see what relaxes you the most. Try some of these spots:


A quiet, infrequently used room.
A sunny spot outside.
In the bath.
The living room on your favorite couch.

, If you sit in bed and try to read for pleasure, you might make yourself so relaxed you will fall asleep. Avoid reading right before bed as you will teach your body that reading means that it is time to sleep.Furthermore, reading on a backlit screen (like an ereader, phone, or tablet) may make it harder to fall asleep!, Just like having to read for an assignment, you should also schedule yourself to read for pleasure. Sometimes, it is easy to occupy yourself with work and other activities.Look at your daily or weekly schedule and block out a space that is just dedicated to reading. This will also assuage any guilt you might feel by reading for fun rather than accomplishing something else!


Try blacking-out or writing on a calendar that you intend to read. This will give a visual reminder to you and anyone trying to schedule appointments with you. For example, on a calendar, mark out a day and time you want to spend reading. Pick a day of the week, like Tuesday, and an hour you are free, say 12-1pm, and commit yourself to reading each week at that hour.

, If you enjoy reading, do not let it become something you give up because something else comes up. If you have scheduled time to read, then read. If you are having a stressful day and would rather do something else, force yourself to read for a short period of time. Chances are, it will help to de-stress you and help calm you down.


By committing yourself to reading, you will more likely read more and more quickly.
Scientists suggest that it takes 21 days to break or build a habit. Try and a keep consistent reading habit for 21 days to ingrain reading as a daily habit."

Clear your mind for one minute before reading.,
Eliminate distractions.,
Read in short intervals.,
Take time to read during dull moments.,
Consider an e-reader.",How to Read Books for School Without Getting Bored1," It's hard to enjoy reading a book when your mind is busy with other thoughts and worries. Before you begin reading, take a minute to clear your mind.


Sit in a comfortable position for about a minute. Try to clear your mind of troublesome thoughts. Take a few deep breaths and, if necessary, close your eyes.It may help to imagine a relaxing scenario. Picture yourself on a beach with friends, for example.
Time yourself. Give yourself 60 seconds to zone out before you begin reading.;
, If you frequently read when you're distracted, this can prevent you from enjoying the book. Your mind will be focused on your cellphone or computer. You may get irritated that your reading is taking your attention away from these things. Before reading, turn off your phone and computer. Go to a quiet place in your home, like your bedroom, and simply spend some time alone with your book., Part of the reason many people dislike reading books for school is the pressure to read by a deadline. While deadlines are unavoidable in school, there are ways to work around them. Instead of plowing through 50 pages in the course of 3 hours, read in short intervals. Take breaks in between.


You'll have to do some planning to make this work. If you put off required reading until the last minute, this might be tricky. Be aware of deadlines ahead of time by reviewing the syllabus. Then, see how much you need to read each day to make the deadline.
Read in 50 minute intervals. Take 10 minute breaks in between. Do not try to read for more than a couple of hours each day. This could lead to boredom or frustration with the text.You may enjoy the book if you're able to engage with it in a less stressful manner. You may pay more attention to the plot of a book as well as its characters if you read in short intervals. This can help you develop an interest in the text, allowing you to read it without boredom.

, If reading feels like a burden or an obligation, it will be less enjoyable. Instead of setting aside time to read each day, try to read during dull moments. If you're already bored, a book will seem like a welcome break from the monotony.


Keep your book with you when you go out. If you're waiting for a bus or waiting for a friend to show up at a coffee shop, start reading. Short 10 or 15 intervals of reading are less tedious and you'll be grateful the book's distracting you from simply waiting.You'll also find yourself getting through books quicker. While you'll only be reading in small chunks, it will add up. You'll find yourself reaching reading deadlines quicker. This will make reading feel less stressful, allowing you to enjoy the process., An e-reader may help you feel less bored by a book. It's easier to transport, allowing you to read on the go, and many younger people prefer reading from a screen. If your teacher allows e-readers, ask your parents if they'd consider getting you one for Christmas or your birthday. Explain that you feel it may help you enjoy reading more.Check your school's library to see if you can borrow digital books. This may make your e-reader more useful, as you'll be able to obtain reading for school for free on your e-reader.

Consider reviewing top selling products.,
Focus on reviewing specific categories.",How to Write an Objective Amazon Review," In order to write an objective review, you need to actually use, wear, or test out the product. Take notes that you'll be able to use in your review. If it helps you write a review, order a few different styles of a similar product so you can compare items in your review.


Amazon notes that the item you're reviewing must be valued at $5.00 or more. Also, if someone else in your household has reviewed the item, you can't write a review as well.;
, Helpful reviews give specifics about why the product is good. Instead of simply saying, ""This product is good. You should buy it,"" say something like, ""This product was well made and had really good customer service.""


Even if you really didn't like the product, try to include one positive thing to note in your review. This will help your review seem balanced. For example, you might say, ""Although the scale is heavy and difficult to program, I liked its sleek appearance.""

, Many people who read reviews are checking to see if there are flaws in the item they're considering buying. Your objective review should mention if there were problems with the item that would bother other consumers. Avoid using a negative tone, even when writing about criticisms.


You may want to write something like, ""I really liked the design of the dresser I bought, but I found that the materials were cheap and the dresser was very hard to put together. People may have trouble assembling all the little parts of this dresser.""

, Reviews that are overwhelmingly positive might make someone think you work for the company or are receiving something in return for a perfect review. On the other hand, extremely negative reviews can also seem misleading. An overwhelmingly bad review can make some readers believe that you're trying to undermine the product or manufacturer.


Try to provide a mix of positive and critical feedback in your review. Many readers distrust reviews that are extremely negative.

, Avoid writing a review about the seller or the shipping and handling of the product. Doing so goes against Amazon's review guidelines. Instead, explain why you gave the product as many or as few stars as you did. You can compare the item to another similar item and explain the differences.For example, you might say that you preferred this kitchen scale model as opposed to another one because the buttons were larger and easier to use.

, Amazon guidelines state that reviews can be anywhere from 20 to 5,000 words. This really leaves the proper word length for a review up to you. Amazon suggests that 75 to 500 words is the best length for a review. One study suggested that there was a correlation between wordcount and how helpfulness rankings.Word length will vary depending on what you're reviewing. For example, you'll probably write a longer review for a novel than for cotton balls.

, If you received a product for free and were asked to write a review, you should mention that in your review. You can note it in the review itself or state it at the very end. Some people believe this shows your review is honest, although you may be more likely to favorably review the item.A sample disclosure statement could be: ""Disclosure: I received a sample product from the manufacturer for an honest review.""

, Once you've written your objective review, run the review through a spell check and grammar program before you publish the review. Consider writing the review using a word processing program if you struggle with correct spelling.


If your review is full of typos and misspelled words, readers may have a hard time understanding it or they may just skip over it.

, If you want more people to read your objective review, you can choose to connect and share the review on Facebook or Twitter. You'll just need to connect your Amazon account to your Facebook or Twitter account.To connect accounts, you'll need to agree to provide Facebook or Twitter with access to some of your account information.

, Many software developers provide this program for free to download. Once you download and install the software, you'll be able to read analyses of your reviews, sort your reviews by their star ratings, and track your ranking as an Amazon reviewer.


You'll need to ensure that the software you choose to download is compatible with your computer's operating system.

, Search on Amazon for a list of their top selling products. You may want to buy and review one of these items since an objective review for a popular item can boost your review in the rankings.


Be sure to check a number of departments for top selling items that overlap. For example, if you want to review a kitchen scale, check the Home and Kitchen category as well as the Office Products and the Industrial/Scientific categories.

, If you write a lot of objective reviews for one type of product category, you may be able to join Amazon Vine. Amazon Vine is a reviewer network selected by Amazon. Vine reviewers are given products by Amazon to review. Some of these items may not even be released for sale yet. Since you must be invited by Amazon to join the program, try to make your reviews as helpful and objective as possible.Although you won't be paid to participate in Amazon Vine, you will need to review products that are sent to you within 30 days.

Underline and highlight.,
Ask yourself questions.,
Make margin notes.,
Research anything unfamiliar.,
Have questions ready for your teacher.",How to Read Books for School Without Getting Bored2," If you're engaged with a text, it's harder to get bored with it. Reading actively can help you get into a book. To start, underline or highlight important sections.


You should underline sections that are of interest to you, like particularly notable descriptions. However, you should also underline sections that seem important to the work. If you've been learning about the concept of foreshadowing, for example, highlight or underline examples of foreshadowing in your text.
Do not go overboard. Some students, especially when they first start to highlight, may end up highlighting half the page. Use discretion. Target significant portions of the text only.
Make sure you check with your teacher before underlining or highlighting. If your book belongs to the school, it may be against the rules to write in it.

, As you read the book, try to ask yourself questions. Make predictions about what will happen next. Try to see how certain lines, passages, or descriptions point to the greater theme of the work. Ask what each portion of the book says and what it does.


What a section of the book says is its literal meaning. For example, if you're reading East of Eden you may note Steinbeck describes the setting as being caught between two sets of mountains. One set is dark and foreboding and the other is light and calm. What this section says is a description of the setting of the work.
Ask yourself what this section does. In other words, how does this section function on a deeper level? Take the mountains in East of Eden. Steinbeck is establishing a metaphor. The main characters are caught between light and dark forces.

, Margin notes can also help you engage with the text. If you underlined or highlighted something, make a note of why. For example, you could write something like, ""Example of foreshadowing"" or ""Symbolic of the main character's emotions."" This can help you engage with the text. Better understanding a work can decrease boredom while reading it.

, The more you know about a work, the more interesting it will seem. If you encounter anything unfamiliar or confusing while reading a text, try looking it up. You may read or learn something through your research that makes you more interested in the text.


Write down any unfamiliar vocabulary words and look them up later. You should also write down any terms or concepts that you don't understand.
Do a little research on the author. Understanding the author's beliefs and background can enhance your understanding of a text.

, As you read, write down questions. If there's anything you do not understand or want to know more about, jot it down in a notebook. In class, when discussing the book, you can raise these questions. Your teacher's insight can help you develop an active interest in your reading material.

Discuss TV shows and movies you watch.,
Make connections with stories.,
Read non-required books.",How to Read Books for School Without Getting Bored3," If you want to better enjoy books, you need to develop an interest in stories in general. If you don't read a lot outside of class, your main source of storytelling may come from television or movies. Try to engage with digital media actively.When watching TV or movies, try to discuss what you're watching with friends. Use some of your active reading techniques on films and shows. Ask yourself questions.
What drives the characters? How do the writers and directors use foreshadowing and metaphor? What do you think will happen from here? Why?

, Sometimes, having a personal connection with a story can help you enjoy it. As you read a book for school, pause on occasion and put yourself in a character's shoes. How would you feel or act in this situation? Why? Have you ever been in a similar situation yourself?In addition to making a book more enjoyable, making a personal connection with a text can also increase your comprehension of a book you're reading., You're far more likely to enjoy reading if the material interests you. If you read non-required texts outside of class, you may have an easier time with required reading. Make a trip to the bookstore or library. Find books that appeal to you. If you're interested in the supernatural, look into fantasy novels. If you're fascinated by the Victorian age, look into historical fiction. An appreciation for non-required text can help you better enjoy books you read for school.


You can read non-required books over Christmas and summer vacation. You'll have a lot of free time, which you can use to read.
You can also read non-required books during free time at school. For example, if you have time between classes or at lunch, pull out a book to read.
Reading before bed each night can help you sleep better. If you make a point of taking half an hour to read before falling asleep, you'll have more time to enjoy non-required reading while also getting better quality sleep.

Think about what the setting might reveal.,
Meet the characters.,
Identify the story’s point of view.,
Know who the conflict is against.",How to Read Literature Like a Professor1," Setting includes physical location and temporal location. For a short work, the entire story may take place in a single room, but a larger work will likely have a slightly larger scope. Similarly, a piece of literature may take place during a single day or week, or it could extend for generations. The setting will carry various implications. For instance, the U.S. South in the 1950s will be more racially tense than a story taking place in New York City during the 1990s.;
, The protagonists and antagonists are the most important characters to know, but even minor supporting characters can be a catalyst for plot or may reveal important details about the actions of the main character. Know the relationships between characters as well as the character names, since names are occasionally symbolic in themselves.

, In a basic sense, point of view refers to first person and third person. First person refers to literature that has a narrator who describes things from his or her perspective, but this narrator may or may not be the main character. Third person can be omniscient, in which all the details of the story are accessible, or it can be limited, in cases where only one or two characters are followed while the others’ actions and thoughts remain a mystery.

, A conflict can occur between two characters, between a character and a society, and between a character and nature. Also identify how that conflict was resolves and if there were other ways to solve it. If there were other ways, speculate on how a different course of action could have changed things.

"
"
Try to relate to the story.,
Figure out how the story relates to the human experience.,
Think about cultural connotations.,
Identify the main character's quest or struggle.,
Pay close attention to the imagery used.,
Consider the mood or tone.,
Look for symbolism.A symbol is any story element that stands for an abstract idea.,
Identify themes and motifs.,
Consider other figures of speech and literary techniques.",How to Read Literature Like a Professor2," A good way to determine what a story really means is to determine what the story means to you, as a reader. Every story can mean something different to other person, but oftentimes, a story that rings true to you will do the same for another person for a similar reason. For example, a work of literature in which a boy’s beloved dog gets killed may relate to you especially well if you once had a dog that was also killed, but anyone who has experienced the unexpected loss of something or someone held dear can relate to the sensation of loss.

, If you have never shared in the experiences of the protagonist, consider how others might. For instance, you may have had a peaceful childhood, but a work of literature about an adolescent struggling to grow up in a turbulent environment or broken family is usually designed to speak to the coming of age process as a whole, not just to those who have gone through similar experiences.

, Cultural connotations can refer to the setting in which a story is written, but they also refer to the setting in which the author wrote the piece in. A female writer whose works were published at a time in which women were not well received in the publishing community may have feminist undertones, even if the main plot of the story has nothing to do with feminism. An author who was exiled from his or her homeland is likely to weave a political message into the work. The author’s circumstances often tint the work of literature itself, regardless of whether or not the work is supposed to be focused on a particular circumstance.

, This relates to conflict, but goes a little deeper. Ask yourself what the protagonist’s conflict really means, and clue yourself in by drawing on classic story patterns. A boy who gets into a fight with his rival over a girl is at odds with his rival, but he is also playing into the basic pattern of the hero—the good knight, the prince, the cowboy with the white hat, the superhero—facing off against the villain—the bad knight, the sorcerer, the cowboy with the black hat, the super-villain. Adding a love interest into the battle is another common aspect of the quest.

, Imagery refers to any sensory detail in the work, including visual, auditory, olfactory, taste, and touch. An author may not mean anything much when describing the way a certain chair felt, but then again, he or she could use those details to draw emphasis on an underlying theme in the story. A ""soft chair"" may not mean anything, but if the protagonist has recently lost her grandfather and sits down in his old recliner, noting that it makes her feel ""soft and warm,"" the sensory detail suddenly takes on new meaning as it indicates her present state of mind after losing her loved one.

, The tone of a work refers to the mood or atmosphere created. Word choices can indicate tone. For instance, bold, unquestioned statements can create an air of confidence or determination, while polite or diplomatic phrasing might indicate more uncertainty. Tone is also influenced by setting, subject matter, and the way that characters behave.

, Such an element can be an object, place, color, season, figure, character, or any other concrete or tangible expression. Seasons, for example, are often used to represent the passing of one's life, with spring indicating childhood and coming of age, summer representing the prime of one's life, autumn indicating maturity and growing old, and winter representing the process of dying.

, A theme is a fundamental idea addressed in a work of literature, and could also be thought of as ""what the story really means."" Themes are usually topics explored and fleshed out throughout multiple works of literature written by multiple writers, giving the theme universal appeal. A motif is a structure or device used to develop a work's theme. If a work is about the struggles of someone dealing with depression, that struggle could be identified as the theme. Feelings of loneliness or hopelessness that are emphasized could be considered motifs, since they serve to highlight the theme.

, Not every work of literature makes use of every literary technique, but there are many that can be used to help identify structure and meaning in a given work. Irony and foreshadowing can help set the tone, for example, while foil characters and stereotypes can support or contrast against a theme.

Know that highlighting is not ideal for first-time reading.,
Understand that you may need to look things up while reading.",How to Study a Textbook," If it is a book that takes a detailed look at a particular topic, the introduction will summarize the author's argument and present an outline of the book. If the textbook is a general introductory text, such as Introduction to American Government or Principles of Microeconomics, the introduction will serve to tell you how the author is going to approach the topic.;
, First, have a look at the table of contents for the textbook. See how it’s organized; this may help you predict what you will cover in class and what will be on exams. Second, look at the organization of each chapter. Most textbook authors use a detailed outline of major headings and subheadings that they plan to cover in each chapter of their book., Many textbooks offer a recap or summary of the chapter content and study questions or “food for thought” at the end of every chapter. Skipping to this part first, before you read the whole chapter, will help you know what to focus on as you read through the chapter.

, See if the headings and subheadings provide any clues to potential questions. For example, a section titled Causes of Alcoholism in a psychology textbook might easily be converted into a question you could see on an exam: What are the causes of alcoholism?As you read, look for the answers to these questions. If you don’t find what you’re looking for, consider changing your questions.

, You may find it easier to comprehend and get through your textbook if you read aloud. Reading aloud can also help you maintain your pace, especially if the prose is dense or complex., Put away your cell phone, do not sit at a computer, and do not allow yourself to be interrupted. We often think that we can multitask and study without full concentration. But if you are going to tackle any subject seriously, then you need to give it your full attention. Focus and you will be rewarded.

, Go for a 10 minute walk or reward yourself with some entertainment. You won’t study well if you’re exhausted. Approach each chapter with a clear mind.

, This will help generate a preview of the textbook so that you can approach the reading with a sense of its structure and main points. Keep things like the end-of-chapter questions in mind as you complete your reading.

, On this read-through, don't take notes or do anything else; just read. You have two objectives in doing so. The first is to get a sense of the purpose of the chapter. Ask yourself: what is the author trying to convey in the chapter overall? Second, how does the author build the information or argument in the chapter? When you have a mental picture of these two questions, you can then begin taking notes that will benefit you in your study for exams and research papers.


Don’t rush this step! It can be tempting to just get done with your reading as soon as possible, but you are unlikely to retain information if you hurry through.

, Notes do not mean taking every word down verbatim. The art of note-taking involves discerning what is important and engaging with the material rather than just copying text out.


The first thing to write down is the main point or argument that the author is conveying in the chapter. Do this in no more than three sentences. Then ask yourself how the author begins to make this point. This is where the major headings and subheadings help. Under each heading are paragraphs that make up the section of the chapter. Document the topic sentences that help build the argument in the section and chapter.
Don’t be afraid to write in your book. Annotating a textbook by writing notes, comments, and questions in the margins near relevant material can be invaluable when studying.Hand write your textbook notes. Handwriting your notes forces your brain to actually engage with the material as opposed to glossing over the material or mindlessly typing the same text into the computer.

, Go back through the chapter and list major theoretical concepts and properties key to understanding any technical elements of the chapter. Also list key terminology with corresponding definitions. Often, this information will be printed in bold, italics, or set apart in a box or with some other eye-catching method.

, Begin by summarizing the chapter and its main points in your own words. This will tell you where your knowledge gaps are. Ask yourself questions about what you’ve read and the notes you took: What question does this information answer? and How does this information relate to other things? are good places to start.

, This is a common myth held by students. Particularly if you’re a slow reader, you may find it more effective to read the beginning and end of the chapter, along with pull-outs (information placed in a box, graph, or other attention-grabbing area on the page) and anything bolded or italicized in the text., Another common mistake students make is to read their textbook once and then never look at it again. A better strategy is to practice layered reading.


On your first read-through, skim the material. Determine what the main idea or goal of the text is (often signaled by the chapter title and subheadings), and mark any places that you didn’t feel as though you understood well.
Read headings, subheadings, and other organizational elements. Textbook authors often construct their chapters so that it is very clear what the goal of each section is. Use this to your advantage.
Read for more detail in later readings.

, Sometimes, students will just move their eyes along the page again and again and feel like they’re not getting anything from their “reading.” Reading is an active process: you need to be engaged, paying attention, and thinking about what you read.

, While it’s tempting to break out the rainbow of highlighters when you read through a chapter, avoid this temptation. Research has shown that highlighting actually can hamper your reading because you may feel tempted to highlight every single thing you feel is important without thinking critically about the ideas presented.If you must highlight, wait until you’ve completed your first read-through, and use the highlighter sparingly to point out only the most important ideas.

, It can be tempting to just read past words or elements you don’t understand in an effort to “just get it done.” This actually damages comprehension. If a dense textbook on Marxist economics has terms that you don’t initially understand, don’t just read on: stop what you’re doing, look up the word, and understand it before continuing.

Practice a little every day.,
Start with easier material.,
Use your finger or an index card to set the pace.,
Change your attitude towards reading.,
Know when to slow down.",How to Read Faster1," A lot of the skills necessary to improve your reading speed will not come naturally to you, so you will need to practice them everyday until they become second nature. Even 15 to 20 minutes of practice per day can make a huge difference to your overall pace.


Improving your reading speed will take time, as you are learning how to read in a whole new way. Remember it took you years to learn how to read well as a child, so be patient with yourself this time round.
A good way to track your progress is to time yourself on a regular basis. Set a timer and count how many words you read per minute. The more you practice, the higher this number should become.;
, When you are training yourself to read faster, it's a good idea to start with easier material -- something that you enjoy or gain immediate value from -- until your abilities improve.


Something like a travel book or memoir of famous figure, for example, might be a good option. Starting with something very dense -- like a physics textbook -- can throw you off and make the whole process seem more daunting.
Once your skills improve and you learn what to look for in a text, you will find yourself much better equipped to deal with more longer, more complex material. By this time, you will have developed a good grasp of which techniques work best for you and learn to recognize which parts of a text are most important.

, It's a good idea to use your finger, a pen or an index card to mark your place on the page as you read. And while using a pointer prevents you from losing your place and having to make regressions, this is not the only benefit.


By moving the pointer quickly across each line and down the page you can set the pace you wish to read at, as your eyes will be forced to keep up.
Think of your your eyes like a magnet that's attracted to the pointer on the page -- wherever it goes, your eyes will follow!

, In addition to implementing specific techniques for increasing your reading speed, it's also important that you revise your attitude towards reading in general.


Rather than seeing reading as a chore or something that has to be done, you should look at reading as an opportunity -- to be entertained, to learn something new, to expand your horizons.
It doesn't matter what the subject is -- it could be a book on statistics or a historical account of mining in Colorado -- as long as you approach the topic with an open mind and a willingness to learn, you'll find the whole process much more enjoyable and easier to get through.

, Despite the benefits of reading faster, it's important to recognize that there will be times when you need to slow down and really make an effort to fully comprehend what you're reading.


There's no point skimming through a text if it prevents you from fully comprehending the material or retaining any useful information. Therefore, one of the most important skills you can develop is the ability to recognize when you should read slowly.
In addition, there are certain types of texts that should never be skimmed through or glossed over too quickly. This includes works of fiction, classic literature, poetry and plays. These kinds of texts are works of art and creativity, where each and every word is intended to be read and even analysed. You will lose much of the value of these texts if you attempt to read them too quickly."
"
Scan your text before reading.,
Plan out what you’d like to get from the reading.,
Focus on nouns and verbs.",How to Speed Read With Better Comprehension1," Whether it’s a chapter or a few pages, if you can identify what the author devotes a majority of the attention to, you can speed up and slow down where appropriate. Try reading just the first sentence in every paragraph to get a general sense of what’s occurring. Scribble paraphrased notes on the first sentence or just the headings. You’ll be able to skip right over some unimportant or purely supplementary sections.When reading for pleasure this may not be as effective, since small details may be crucial to the story.
One study showed reading comprehension improvement for the majority of a class when skimming beforehand took place.;
, If you already know the general topic of the article or book, you likely know to which section you need to devote more attention and time. By noting the contents beforehand, you’ll be able to determine which parts can be skipped.Based purely on header structure, you’ll be able to focus more on things you believe to be important.

, Some examples show that comprehension is largely sufficient if the noun and verb combinations, and some crucial prepositions, are understood thoroughly. By skipping over the other words, the general content of the text is understood.For example, “Hitting a baseball is about transferring kinetic energy by shifting weight toward the rear foot and coiling the body” could be shortened as, “Hitting baseball…transferring energy…shifting weight…rear foot…coiling body.

Avoid sounding out the words in your head.,
Avoid reading word-by-word.,
Overcome inefficient eye movement.,
Eliminate regression.,
Avoid distractions.",How to Read Faster2," Many people sound out the words as they read -- either by moving their lips or hearing the words in their head. This is known as sub-vocalization and is one of the major problems that affects your reading speed.


Although sounding out words is an effective way of teaching kids how to read, it is not conducive to reading faster. This is because sub-vocalization only allows you to read the words as fast as you can say them -- which isn't very fast at all.
By eliminating subvocalization, you can potentially double or triple your reading speed. You can avoid mouthing the words by keeping your mouth busy -- chewing gum, humming, or whatever. Preventing yourself from hearing the words in your head as you read is a little harder, but it can be achieved with concentration, practice and the art of mindfulness., Another common practice which slows down reading speed hugely is the practice of reading each individual word separately. Instead, you should try to read in chunks.


For example, most inexperienced readers will read the phrase ""the horse is in the barn"" as ""the"" + ""horse"" + ""is"" + ""in"" + ""the"" + ""barn"", thus processing each word individually. However, your brain has an amazing ability to fill in gaps of information, so if you can train your brain to process the sentence ""the horse is in the barn"" as a single piece of information containing the key words ""horse"" and ""barn"", your brain will fill in the rest. That way, you can get the same meaning from a piece of text while only reading about 50% of the words. This speeds up reading time considerably.

, When children learn how to read, they are taught to look at each word individually before moving onto the next. However, your eyes are capable of taking in much more than a single word at a time -- up to four or five, in fact -- so this practice makes reading a lot less efficient.


Try to relax your face and soften your gaze as you read -- this will allow you to take in more of the page at once. Try to absorb at least four words at a time, before moving your eyes onto the next chunk of words.
In addition, you should try to utilize your peripheral vision as you read. This allows you to read to the end of the sentence without the need to refocus your gaze, thereby saving you time.

, Regression is the practice of reading the same sentence or section two or three times over, whether intentionally or unintentionally. Obviously, this adds a lot of unnecessary time onto your reading, without necessarily improving your understanding of the material.


Some people regress because they lose their place in the text and go back to the beginning of the page or paragraph in order to find it again. You can avoid this by using a pointer to mark your place as you read -- whether it's your finger, a pen or an index card.
Others regress because they feel that they haven't really grasped the meaning of the text the first time around. To overcome this, you need to ensure that you are really concentrating the first time round -- reading should be an active activity, not a passive one -- so engaging with the material from the get-go will prevent you from having to reread anything.
In addition, you need to decide if the information is important enough to reread -- if you have grasped the basic concept of a sentence or paragraph (even if you haven't absorbed each individual word) then reading it again is a waste of time., Many people are slow readers simply because they are attempting to read in an inappropriate environment. If you want to read quickly and absorb the material in front of you, you need to eliminate both external and internal distractions.


Don't try to read in a loud environment, with people talking or the television or radio on in the background. You'll find yourself getting distracted, which will force you to go back and reread paragraphs or use subvocalization in order to process what you're reading. Read in a quiet, peaceful environment where reading is your only focus -- don't try to multitask.
You will also need to try to eliminate any internal distractions, such as thinking about an issue at work or deciding what you're going to have for dinner. Your internal monologue can be difficult to shut down -- it requires focus and concentration -- but if you can manage it, you'll find yourself reading much faster."

Retain the most important information.",How to Read Faster3," One of the most efficient ways of improving your reading speed is to preview the material before you read it. This can help you to get a sense of what the text is about and allow you decide if it's even worth reading in full.


To preview the material, try reading the entire first paragraph, the first sentence of each successive paragraph and the entire last paragraph.
In between these items, look at headings, bullet points and highlighted words. This won't give you all the details, but it will help you to identify the most important parts to go back to and what you can simply skim over.
This is a good technique for long, unfamiliar or difficult texts which you are trying to get an initial grasp of. , Another technique is to simply scan the material and pick out any key words. By using this method, you can develop a basic understanding of the material without wasting time on the nitty gritty.


For example, in the sentence ""the fearsome lion stealthily hunted its unsuspecting prey -- the antelope,"" it is not necessary to read every single word in order to grasp its meaning. By skimming the text for key words you can come up with the phrase ""lion - hunted - antelope"", which communicates essentially the same meaning. following this step allows you to halve the time it takes to read a text without sacrificing too much meaning. This technique is best used for simple, short texts, such as magazine and newspaper articles.

, If you're reading an article, book or paper for the sole purpose of gleaning new information, then a handy technique is just to read the first and last sentence of each paragraph, especially when it's reiterating something you already know.


A lot of non-fiction work can be very repetitive and contain long-winded explanations of a simple concept. If you already have a grasp of the concept, then there's no need to go through the entire paragraph line by line.
This also goes for newspaper and magazine articles -- if you only want a basic overview of the contents, it's amazing how much information you can glean simply by reading the first and last sentence of each paragraph.

, If you're trying to improve your reading speed, you should get used to the idea of skipping over information you already know or understand, as reading these sections will provide you with little additional value.


You can decide which sections are worth reading by skimming the text for key words or reading the first sentence of each paragraph. This will give you a pretty good idea of what the text contains and allow you to decide whether its worth the time investment.
This also goes for things that you're not interested in. If you're reading something like a memoir or historical account, it's fine to skip over the parts you're not interested in reading about. This may go against your nature as a reader, but it will save you time while also helping you to maintain interest in what you're ready.
Related to this, you should not feel bad about abandoning a book that you're not enjoying or learning anything from. Many books are poorly written or don't do a good job of explaining advanced concepts. Try to read about 10% of every book you pick up and if you find it's not working for you put it down and move on to a different book. This will save you time and be more beneficial in the long run.

, One of the major issues people have when they begin to read faster is that they have difficulty absorbing and retaining the information they come across. While the major solution to this problem is to become a more active and engaged reader, there are several more specific techniques you can try.



Link concepts in the book to things you already know. Linking complex ideas to a personal experience, memory or emotion will help you to access the information more easily. As a simple example, linking the French word heureux (which means happy) to a pleasant memory where you experienced feelings of happiness might help you to remember the word more easily.

Highlight important information and write summaries. Use a highlighter while you're reading (or just dog-ear entire pages) to highlight important concepts or ideas. Then once you've finished the book, go back to these highlighted sections and use them to make a 200-300 word summary of the book. Doing this will provide you with a database of references that your can use in the future, which also helping you to commit the ideas to memory."

Associate content with the familiar.,
Create leading questions using the major parts of the material.,
Ask yourself questions about the material while reading.,
Put yourself in a character’s shoes.,
Change your reading patterns.",How to Speed Read With Better Comprehension2," When reading about any activity or item in the story, comprehension will improve if it’s compared to similar experiences in the reader’s life. The more unique the item or activity, the better. It’s easier to recall the lone experience with a tiger than the countless times you have petted a dog. , With the titles, headers, captions, and other key ingredients, you can devise questions about where you believe the reading material may be headed. While reading, challenge yourself to actively search for the answers to your questions to see if the content is progressing as you expected. , After reading sections, even paragraphs, ask leading questions that force more than simple answers. If you can deduce how something happened, or why a character took a specific course of action, that displays comprehension. Identify the importance of actions and key plot elements, and where the story may be leading.

, Choose a key character during the reading to identify with, and imagine supplementary details about their life that relates to the story. Create visual images of the content, with details about what the character may be wearing, where they may be living or walking, their favorite activities., When comprehension is insufficient or lacking, you may have to literally change how you read. Sometimes it’s just a matter of reading further into a selection in order for context clues to become clarified. Try a few of the following suggestions to improve comprehension: Speak the words out loud. If you say the words while reading them two sense will be affected, and recollection may be strong.
Slow down the reading. Don’t sacrifice too much speed. Consciously make an effort to incrementally slow the pace of your reading until comprehension is improved.

View more than one word at a time.,
Narrow the margins.,
Read more.",How to Speed Read With Better Comprehension3," When the eyes stop on a word, it’s called fixation, and it lasts approximately 1/4 second per word.Of course, the smaller the words, the less fixation time.If you are currently looking at one word at a time, and can expand your field of fixation, it would improve the speed with which you read.

, The ability to see both margins of text at one time accelerates reading speed. When only the right margin is viewable at the end of a line, the eyes need to return to the left margin on the next line. The parafovea portion of the eye cannot adjust to the next line perfectly. Instead, the peripheral vision misjudges the beginning of the next line, generally landing a word or two to the right. The subsequent adjustment left to the beginning of the line, a fraction of a second process called a saccade, is a disturbance in crucial to speed-reading efficiency., It seems like a simple concept, but the more you read the better you will be at speed reading.The reason for this is your fluency will increase and your vocabulary will expand, decreasing the amount of time spent on difficult words.Your recognition vocabulary – the words you understand immediately without thinking them through or sounding them out – is stored in your brain, and is sub-vocalized quicker than unorthodox words.Some electromagnetic studies have shown that sub-vocalization – the process through which physical mechanisms of speaking occur while reading – takes place no matter how fast someone reads.Try to improve your recognition vocabulary by subscribing to a “word of the day” program or by improving yourself through self-driven vocabulary study.

Ask your teacher.",How to Choose a Good Book for a Report (Middle School)," Starting the night before the book report is due is way too late. Starting a few days before might also be too late unless you’re an extremely fast reader. Give yourself time to read the book and understand it fully, then write your report. This might take a week or more to complete. This means you need to start looking for your book as soon as you can. Finding a book can take time, so don’t rush it. You might find the perfect book, but it’s checked out and has to be returned to the library., You need to follow any of the guidelines your teacher gave you for the report. Underline the parts that relate to choosing a book. What do you need to know? Some important information might be:


Whether there is a minimum number of pages you need to read
Whether the book should be fiction (made up) or non-fiction (true)
Whether a graphic novel is an appropriate choice
What kinds of information your teacher wants you to get out of the book

, There are millions of books out there, and between your school library and the public library, you have access to thousands. Within the parameters your teacher has set (number of pages, fiction or non-fiction), figure out what kind of book you would most like to read. It’s important to choose something you want to read so that the assignment goes as smoothly as possible. Some possible questions you might ask yourself as you are choosing a book for a report are:Do you want something with a historical background, or something that takes place now?
Is there a particular topic that interests you that might be a good choice – animals, skateboarding, music, for example?
Do you like funny books or serious books?
Do you like books about real people, or would you rather read fantasy or science fiction?

, For some help finding books that might appeal to you, the children’s librarian at your local library is a great resource. Go and talk to him or her about what you’re looking for. Explain that you’re writing a book report and ask for the librarian’s help. He or she is likely to know a number of books that will fit with what you’re wanting.


Make sure to tell the librarian if there is a minimum number of pages you need to read and whether it should be fiction or non-fiction.
Be honest with the librarian about your reading ability and speed. You don’t want to get stuck with a book that’s too hard and too long.

, If it’s hard for you to get to the library, or you’d rather start by doing some research on your own, check online. There are lots of great sites that review children’s books, and you can often search them by category. Here are some ideas about searching:For a book about basketball that is fiction, you might want to search for the words ""basketball,"" together with ""novel"" and ""middle readers."" That should give you some ideas. If you want a nonfiction book about basketball, you might try searching for a particular player's name along with ""middle readers.""
If you're looking for a book you know your teacher will approve, you might want to check the lists of Newbery winners and nominee. The Newbery medal is the highest honor for books for middle readers, and includes an array of topics and themes., Sometimes your teacher is your very best resource. He or she probably knows you pretty well – both the level at which you read and your interests – and can suggest a book that wouldn’t be too hard that would appeal to you.

, Sometimes you can find a great book just by going and looking at the other books on the shelf around books you’ve liked before. Non-fiction books in particular are typically grouped by topic, so it’s a good bet that you’ll find books on similar themes next to books you’ve already read on those themes., Even if you’ve decided on one, it’s good to have a backup or two. You might realize as you’re looking at the books more closely at home that one of them is not as good a choice for a book report. You also might find that your teacher has advice on which one would be better.

, Hopefully, between talking to the librarian, your teacher, and possibly going online and then browsing the library, you have found a few possible candidates for your book review. With the books you’ve found in front of you, read the plot synopsis, found on paperback books on the back of the book, and on hardcover books typically on the inside of the front cover on the book’s dust jacket.Which of the books looks best to you?
Which book is the easiest to read?
Which book do you think would be best for the report, based on the assignment?

, Even if you think the book is the perfect choice, talk to your teacher. He or she might have read the book and not think it is the right choice for you.


If your teacher doesn’t like your first choice, share your other options with him or her. Hopefully one of them will work.

Forget these ideas:


You can learn to 'speed read'.,
Decide what type of reading you're doing.,
Glance at a phrase quickly.,
Picture or imagine each phrase.,
Don't try to read faster than you can picture the meaning of each phrase.",How to Read Faster by Looking at Phrases," Unless you're a savant, reading will be limited to the speed you can think. Anything beyond that is skimming.
Vocalizing is just a bad habit. When speaking, people lower their tone to indicate a new phrase or thought is coming. You vocalize to find the phrases.
Reading fast is best for light reading. Reading for pleasure should be savored. Gulping it down is as fun as watching a movie in fast-forward.
Push your speed and wait for your comprehension to catch up. Concentrate on improving your comprehension. Your speed will increase on its own.;
, Are you reading for pleasure, or reading to learn something?


If you are reading for pleasure then slow down and enjoy it. Appreciate the word choice, the rhythms and cadence, the concepts and mental imagery. The goal is to enjoy this reading, not to finish it as fast as possible.
If you are reading to learn, then you want to concentrate on comprehension and you want this comprehension in the least amount of time. Some reading will be a combination or somewhere between these two types, and you will adjust your reading accordingly. You may even want to read 'light' material quickly just to practice reading fast.

, Do not say or think of the words. Glance at the phrase and think of what it means. Quickly picture it in your mind. For example, look at the following phrases:


It was the best of times, — it was the worst — of times — it was the age of wisdom, — it was the age — of foolishness...

, At first this may take some effort, but if you've learned to read words without thinking of each letter, you can learn to stop thinking of each word. Words are just symbols, and only when strung together into a phrase do they form a unique thought. You are reading thoughts, not words or letters.

, The goal is to imagine the concept of each phrase. Pushing your speed without getting the meaning, is meaningless. This is the opposite of everything else you'll hear about learning to read fast, but it is the same principle as learning to type; if you slow down and concentrate on accuracy, the speed will follow. Your goal here is to read 'ideas' or phrases rather than words. Sometimes you need to 'slow down' to go faster.

You’ll have to spend a lot of time reading and working on this assignment, so try to choose a book that seems exciting.If you pick a book that is boring to begin with, it will make finishing your book report that much harder.
You can also read a book you are interested in more quickly since it will hold your attention better. This will help you finish your book report on time.;
, Employ the motto “Work smarter, not harder.” If you have to do a book report, choose a book that is short. This will save you time in the long run because it will take you less time to read the book.


You probably won’t get any extra credit for reading a really long book.

, If possible, choose a book that you have read before. This means that you might be able to simply skim the book instead of completely re-reading it and that will save you a lot of time.


If you’ve read the book recently enough, you might even just be able to read an online summary of the book to refresh your memory instead of reading the whole thing again.
This is especially helpful if you don’t have much time to complete your book report. Choosing a book that you’ve already read means that you can get started right away on the report part.

, There are plenty of summaries and analyses of books available on the internet. If you choose a book that is popular enough, there should be some kind of information on the internet that you can use for guidance. But if you choose a less popular book, you might not be able to find anything online to help you along the way.This doesn’t mean that you should cheat.

Do not plagiarize. Just use these sources for guidance.
These online summaries can be very helpful if you don’t have much time to finish your book report.

, The most important thing to do to ensure you complete your book report on time is to start reading and working on the report well before the deadline. If possible, give yourself enough time to read the book and start working on the report.


You will probably need around a week, depending on how long the book is and how long your report has to be.

, If you are out of time and trying to complete your book report at the last minute, make a schedule for yourself and stick to it. Give yourself a day to read the book and the online summaries. Then spend an hour working on your outline. Then take a few hours to write your completed book report.


Make a schedule that will allow you to complete your project on time, one that works for you, and stick to it even if it seems hard.

, Think about what the book was about and try to decide on a main idea that you see in the novel. Most books have an overarching theme and identifying this will be helpful for you to decide what to say in your book report.


The main idea of the book might be something about growing up, overcoming evil, coming to terms with feelings of alienation, searching for freedom, etc., The characters are what drive the narrative plot in a story. They are the most important things to consider when writing a book report. After all, there wouldn’t be a story without the people in it.Some questions you might ask yourself about the characters include:


Who were the main characters?
What was each character’s main function in the story?
Were the characters complicated like people in real-life, with good and bad traits? Or did the protagonists or “good characters” have only good traits while the antagonists or “bad characters” have only bad traits?

, The plot is the sum of all the events (or, at least, the main events) of a story.The plot is important to consider because the novel’s structure is determined by the organization of the events that take place. Often these events are sequenced in some meaningful way that tells you something about the story. Some questions you might ask yourself about the plot include:


What was the main event in the story? Was there a defining moment/event?
Was there a deep meaning behind the main plot?
Did the book talk about one thing, or were there sub-plots?

, The key to writing a good book report is to plan out what you want to say ahead of time. Even if you are running out of time to complete your book report, making an outline will help you organize your thoughts and make sure you include all the things you want to say. A typical outline for a book report includes the following:



Introduction – This is where you introduce the title of the book, the author, when it was published, and any relevant historical context. You may also want to mention the main idea or theme that you identified in the book.

Summary of the book – Give a short description of the action of the plot. Discuss the main events to show that you read the entire book.

Description of the characters – Here you’ll introduce the main characters and discuss why they are important. You might want to mention what their role is in the novel, any obstacles they overcome, and what we are supposed to learn from them.

Description of the plot – This is where you talk about how the plot affects the story, such as the order of events or who the plot affects you as a reader.

Analysis – Here, you’ll evaluate the book and talk about any deeper meanings you uncovered while reading the book. You might refer back to the main idea/theme and discuss it in greater detail.Conclusion – Your concluding remarks should summarize what you’ve said so far. You can end with what you think the author seems to have wanted you to learn from reading this book.

, Nice formatting goes a long way. Make sure you include your name and the date in the heading and try to give your book report a clever title. Make separate paragraphs for separate topics.If you handwrite your book report, make sure you use your nicest penmanship. You don’t want to get a bad grade just because your teacher couldn’t read what you wrote.

, A good way to prove that you actually read the book is to quote from the book. When you are discussing a character, you might want to include something they said in the book that illustrates the point you are making about them., A day or so before your report is due, proofread it to check to see if there are any errors. Sometimes it’s good to take a step back from your report and then look at it again in a few days with fresh eyes. This will help you find mistakes that you might have overlooked when you were so involved in the writing earlier.You can also ask your parents, a friend, or a teacher to read it for you to help you find any mistakes you might have missed. This is especially helpful if you are running short on time and don’t have the time to wait a few days before you proofread it yourself.
This is another reason why it’s a good idea to type your report on a computer. Most word processing programs will notify you if you’ve made a mistake in spelling or grammar.

First, skim read.,
Re-read with greater focus.,
Make notes while you read.,
Look up words and ideas that you don’t know.,
Discuss the writing's ""main points"" in your own words.",How to Read Critically1," The first time you work through a piece of writing, it can be helpful to simply skim it. Skim reading involves reading very quickly, only briefly pausing to examine details. Skimming can help you get a general idea of what a piece of writing is about before you read it again, saving you time and energy in the long run.


There's no ""right"" way to skim read, but one good policy is this:



Read the entire intro paragraph
Read the first sentence of each body paragraph
Read the entire conclusion paragraph



;
, Now that you've done a skim reading and you know the rough ""point"" of the essay, it's time to read it ""for real."" Proceed through the whole essay again, this time reading each sentence slowly and carefully. Don't hesitate to read sentences or paragraphs again if you're having a hard time understanding the content.


Don't rush — slowing down helps you connect with the text., Taking notes in a class can help you retain more information — doing so while reading is no different. Writing down key thoughts and phrases will make you actively pay attention to what’s going on in the text. You can also jot down questions you have so that you can try to answer them later.


Mark words and concepts that you don't understand for later reference.

, If you understand every word and concept you came across in the essay, you're in luck — you can move on. However, if there was anything in the essay that you didn't understand, now is your chance to enlighten yourself. Filling in the gaps in your knowledge will help you gain a fuller understanding of the text.Dictionaries and thesauruses can help with words you don't know. However, technical terms and unknown concepts may require you look up help articles online. For instance, if you're reading an article about ""4K"" television, you probably won't be able to find a definition for 4K in the dictionary.

, Now, do another quick skim reading. After each paragraph, ask yourself, ""What was the point of what I just read?"" Express your answer in your own words — try not to copy the essay's. Working your way through the essay piece by piece and reinterpreting the information each step of the way is a great way to make the most important themes in the writing ""stick.""

Use a ruler or pen as a marker or tracker on the page.,

Read the text with a goal in mind.,
Challenge your reading rate by practicing with more difficult texts.",How to Read Fast," An average college student can read between 200 and 300 words per minute (wpm) if they are reading fiction and non-technical materials. A strong reader can read 500-700 wpm and an excellent reader can read 1000 wpm. This means the average reader may be five times slower than a good reader and ten times slower than an excellent reader. Improving your reading speed if you are an average or even a good reader means you will need to try several techniques for speeding up your reading rate and be willing to practice improving your reading rate for a consistent period of time.Though your reading speed may fluctuate based on the type of text used and your level of familiarity with the reading material, in general:


A poor reader has a wpm rate of 100-110 words.
An average reader has a wpm rate of 200-240 wpm.
A good reader has a wpm rate of 300-400 wpm.
An excellent reader has a wpm rate of 700-1000 wpm.
Keep in mind ESL readers may struggle to maintain more than 200-300 wpm when reading a text that is not in their native tongue. Many educators argue that ESL readers should try to maintain a slower reading rate to ensure they can comprehend the text.;
, Being a faster reader does not necessarily mean you will be able to comprehend the finer details or points in the text. In fact, your ability to comprehend a text may decrease as your reading speed increases. Less-commonly known words or longer words take longer to read and comprehend. Speeding through the text may cause you to skip over key words and your understanding of the text may start to fade. Many linguistic experts argue that it’s important to improve your vocabulary and broaden your exposure to many different types of texts, in addition to improving your reading speed. This will ensure your reading comprehension rate stays at the same level or improves along with your reading speed., Determine your reading speed using a practice text and a timer. Use a text that is at least five to ten pages long on standard 8” x 11” paper.Count the number of words in five lines of the practice text. Divide this number of words by five and you will have the average number of words per line in the text. For example: 70 words/5 lines = 14 words per line.
Count the number of text lines on five pages of the text and divide this number by five to determine the average number of lines per page. Then, multiply the average number of lines per page by the average number of words per line and you will get the average number of words per page. For example: 195 lines/5 pages = 39 lines per page. 39 lines per page x 14 words per line = 546 words per page.
Once you have the average words per line and words per page, time yourself reading the text for one minute. Try to read as fast as possible, but also make sure you understand the idea or point in each sentence.
After one minute, stop reading and count how many lines you read in one minute. Multiply the number of lines you read by the average words per line to determine your words per minute rate. For example: You managed to read 26 lines in one minute. 26 x 14 words per line = 364 words per minute. Your wpm rate is 364 words per minute, which means you are considered a good reader.

, This exercise will help you learn how to read material and process it more quickly. The purpose of this activity is to reread “old” material quickly and to glide on to the new material until you can read and comprehend it faster. You will need a practice text that is at least 1-2 pages long and a timer.Set the timer for 60 seconds and try to read as much of the text as possible. Stop the timer at 60 seconds.
Start the timer at 60 second again and read again from the beginning of the text. Try to read more material during the second 60 second period than you did in the first reading period.
Repeat this exercise a third and a fourth time. Try to read more of the text during each exercise until you read more of the text during the fourth time.

, This is a longer activity where you will read the same short passage over and over again until you improve your reading speed. Keep your reading speed in mind as you complete this exercise and use it as a benchmark. Try to improve your reading speed so it becomes faster during every rereading.Begin with a 100-word paragraph. Set the timer to two minutes.
Try to read the paragraph four times during the two minutes. Aim for a reading speed of at least 200 words per minute.
Once you are able to read the paragraph four times in two minutes, move on to reading a 200-word paragraph eight times in four minutes.
As you continue to do this reading drill, your reading speed should improve.

, You may slow down when you read due to re reading or regression, where you skip back over a phrase or term due to an inability to follow the lines of text on the page. To help make your eye placement on the page more accurate and efficient, you can use a pen as a guide.Hold the pen in your dominant hand, with the cap on. Hold it under your hand, flat against the page. Set the timer for one minute.
Use the pen to underline each line of text as you read. Keep your eye fixed above the tip of the pen. The pen will act as a useful marker on the page and will help you maintain a consistent reading speed.
At the end of one minute, calculate your wpm based on the number of lines you read. Note if your reading rate improves with the use of the pen.

, Many readers tend to vocalize the text as they read, where they move their lips and read words out loud. You may also subvocalize, where you talk to yourself in your head as you read silently. Both of these habits can slow down your reading rate, as speaking is a relatively slow activity. The average speaking rate is 250 wpm, which is not considered a very fast reading rate.Limit your reading habits so it involves only your eyes and your brain, rather than actual speech. Vocalization will slow your reading down and cause you to try to do two things at once, rather than focus on the text.
Poetry and plays are texts that are meant to be performed, so it can be difficult not to vocalize as you read these texts. In fact, vocalizing while you read these texts can help you understand them better. You may find speaking the dialogue in a play or a line of poetry can enhance your understanding. However, it will likely slow down your reading rate.

, If you are aiming to improve your reading rate and your reading comprehension rate, you can do a 30-60 second preview of the text before you read it in full.Start by reading the title of the text, such as the chapter title.
Read all the headings and subheadings.
Look over any marked, italicized or bolded text.
Look at any pictures or illustrations, as well as any charts or graphs.
Read the first sentence of every paragraph, particularly the first sentence of the first and last paragraphs of the text.
After you have previewed the text, ask yourself: What is the main idea of the text? What is the author’s purpose for writing the text? What is the style of the writing: formal, informal, medical, legal? You should be able to answer these basic questions if you preview the text properly.

, Chunking is when you group words in the text into short, meaningful phrases that are three to five words long. Rather than read every word, and risk forgetting the beginning of a sentence by the time you get to the end of the sentence, you can chunk the text into groups of words that will help you comprehend the text quickly and effectively. Many teachers will use chunking in the classroom to help students comprehend large texts. You may be given a statement of purpose to guide you as you go through the text and look for specific sections you can chunk together.Keep in mind excessive chunking can limit or reduce your comprehension of the text. Try to use the statement of purpose given to you by your teacher to guide you as you chunk the text.

, Approaching the text with a question or in a questioning manner can make you a stronger reader and possibly a faster reader. Look at the text as if you were searching for something, or trying to reach a goal.Take the heading or title of a chapter and turn it into a question. For example, if a heading of a section in the text is “The Causes of Global Warming”, you can switch it into a question, such as: “What are the causes of global warming?” You will then approach the text with a goal, and will be looking for the key answers to this question in the text. Your reading will now be goal-oriented, allowing you to possibly read faster and not lose your reading comprehension ability.

, Once you start to improve your reading rate using assigned texts in a class or out of a book that is considered suitable for your reading level, you should try to vary the types of texts you practice with to improve your reading rate. Varying your texts will also expand your vocabulary and help you avoid having to re read or pause over a certain term or word when you are reading.Keep in mind legal material and medical material are not meant to be read quickly, so it can be difficult to maintain a high reading rate when you practice with these types of texts. Take your time with these types of texts and work on improving your reading rate slowly, over time.

Try to enjoy what you're reading.",How to Read Critically2," Critical reading acknowledges that every piece of writing is a product of a certain person, time, and place. This personal, historical context affects both the content of the writing and the voice of the author. Research the context of the piece of writing you're analyzing. Answering the ""when,"" ""where,"" and ""who"" of the writing is a good place to start.


After this, familiarize yourself with the mindset, beliefs, opinions, and current events that were happening as the writing was created. Ask, ""how are these reflected in the writing itself?""

, A single word can carry many different meanings. Many authors use subtle turns of phrase to convey double meanings or raise questions in the reader's mind. Ask yourself, ""does the author of this piece of writing really mean what she/he says? Is there anything ambiguous about the way the work is written?""


If you're not sure whether the work has a hidden meaning, consider why it was written in the first place (your background research can help you here). Is the author just trying to entertain you, or is s/he trying to convince you to accept a certain theory or philosophy?

, Neither the author nor the reader is a completely cold, logical machine. Recognizing a work's emotional content is also important to gaining a full understanding of it. You don't need to write your emotions down, but instead just think about how the tone, diction, and syntax effects your emotions and interpretations of the text.


While it's important to acknowledge the text's emotional content, a crucial part of critical reading is to take a logical approach to analysis, rather than an emotional one. Recognize your emotions (as well as the author's), but don't let them keep you from thinking about the work with a detached, objective perspective.

, This just means to think about what you have thought about. Consider your thoughts about the passage you have read. What do they say about your relationship to the author? What do they say about you? Do you find yourself mostly agreeing with the author or mostly disagreeing? Below are just a few tips to help with metacognition:


Challenge or question at least one thing you read in the passage. Then take the author's side and argue for it. Remember: just because you read it doesn't mean it's true!
Consider how the reading may apply to your life. This could mean anything from thinking of when you might need to know what acids and bases are to personally applying a line of poetry which especially moved you.

, Critical reading isn't just a joyless, logical exercise. The feeling of accomplishment you get from working towards an understanding of a complex piece of writing can be an excellent motivator. It's also fun to gain ideas and perspectives that you haven't had before.


There's no escaping it: some passages are just dry or uninteresting. See if you can find at least one thing you like about what you're reading. You can even pretend you're a detective or a reporter and the passage you are reading is involved in an exciting assignment. This makes things a little more fun. If you can't find anything fun in the reading, it's probably advanced academic material. In this case, enjoy feeling smart for reading it!

Write down a short phrase on a piece of paper.,
Rewrite the phrase backwards.,
Practice reading the phrase.,
Move on to longer phrases.",How to Read Backwards1," It typically helps to start with shorter, easier words and work your way up to a longer phrase. Two to three words will be sufficient.;
, Begin with the last letter of the last word and end with the first letter of the first word. Leave spaces between words just as you normally would. Practice writing the phrase several times; it will help clue your brain to the right-to-left movement.


Because you are accustomed to reading left-to-right, your brain naturally prefers this direction; essentially what you are doing is re-teaching it how to track from right to left (called ""directional tracking"")., Start with the letter on the right and work towards the left (the opposite of how you normally read). Identify each letter individually and try to sound it out as you go. Over time, your brain will begin to recognize the shape of the word, and you will no longer need to sound it out.Practice reading several times over the next few days. Spacing out your practice over time helps you feel more comfortable reading and recognizing words from the opposite direction, from right to left rather than left to right.

, Pick a random sentence from a book and practice reading it backwards. If it is difficult to isolate the sentence in the book, rewrite the sentence on a piece of paper, then rewrite the phrase from right to left. It might help, at least initially, to use your finger under each word to help your eyes keep track of where you are.


Practice makes perfect! Here's an example. Try to figure out what it says.

Identify what you want to know about the news.,
Go in with a positive attitude.,
Review the sections.,
Give the headlines and first paragraphs a quick scan.,
Vary your reading speed.,
Skim or skip over information you already know.,
Do not talk to yourself when you read.,
Avoid re-reading phrases.,
Ask yourself questions when you read.,
Take mental notes while reading.,
Think about the what, why, and how of each article.,
Focus on key information.,
Choose a good place to read.",How to Read a Thick Newspaper in a Short Time," This is a good strategy to speed up any reading, including reading a newspaper. Keep your reason for reading the newspaper in mind as you go into reading it. This will keep your focus sharp, and you'll be able to know which information to read closely and which to skim.Usually, people read the newspaper to learn about the world. Which current events do you want to know more about? Which events and news items are not important to you?
Knowing what you want helps you read efficiently, and therefore faster. If you're not interested in entertainment news, you can skim reviews of recent movies. If you're eager to learn more about international news, read the section covering this slower.;
, If you see reading as a chore, it will take longer and also feel longer. Instead of thinking of reading the newspaper as a chore, look at it as an opportunity.Think about how much you will learn. There is so much going on in the world, and reading the news will inform you about facts and events you would not learn about otherwise.
Think about any benefits to reading the newspaper regularly. For example, maybe there's an election coming up. You can see reading the newspaper as an opportunity to become a more informed voter.

, Newspaper are divided by sections. There is usually a table of contents somewhere on the first page, alerting readers of the section divisions. Before you dive into reading, quickly skim the sections.Look for the sections that most interest you. Keep them in mind as you read, as you'll know to pay closer attention when you read those sections. You can also choose to start with the sections that are most important to you, so you can give them the most attention while your mind is fresh.
For example, maybe you're looking for news about the upcoming election. The section on politics runs from page five to seven. This is the section you should read most closely.

, The most important information about an article will be in the first paragraph and headline. When starting a fresh page, give the headlines a quick scan and skim the first paragraphs.Some articles will be less important than others. There may be articles about topics you already know about, or articles that aren't personally important to you.
It's okay to skip or skim the less important articles. To most effectively read a newspaper, you should pay attention to the content that will best education you.

, Reading at different paces helps you read both efficiently and quickly. Some articles will be more complicated than others. Read fluffier material quickly, and slow your pace when you reach something more complicated.Some articles can be skimmed or read very quickly. A local interest story about a new restaurant, for example, is probably not very complex. You can breeze through this article quickly and still learn most of the necessary information.
An article that's covering, say, a recent political debate is probably more complex. You will have to slow your pace to read articles of this nature. Even though you are reading slowly here, you will still get through the paper faster having skimmed less complicated articles.

, News can be a bit redundant. Sometimes, information will appear in more than one section. For example, an op-ed about a current event may include facts you already read in an article. Another article may contain basic information about ongoing current events you already know.If you start reading something that sounds familiar, skim or skip over the paragraph.
If an entire article seems like information you already know, it's okay to skip it. If you read news online or watch the news, information in a newspaper may be repetitive.

, Many people have a tendency to talk to themselves when reading. You may whisper the words out loud as you read them in your head. This habit can actually greatly slow down your reading pace.Pay attention to your mouth when you read. Try to be aware of mouthing the words out loud.
If you catch yourself whispering or talking, stop. You will finish the paper quicker if you're not talking out loud.
You may also find you're talking to yourself silently in your head while you read. You may be repeating the words in your head a second time or adding commentary. Try to silence your internal monologue when you're reading.

, Contrary to what many believe, reading a phrase over and over again does not improve comprehension. It can also slow down your reading speed. If you're reading a complex article, it's more effective to slow down and read carefully. This will get the job done quicker and help you better retain the information., Active reading is important. While you may be able to read a newspaper fast, it won't matter if you don't remember what you read. One way to prevent zoning out is to ask questions.Keep asking yourself what each article is about. Remind yourself why you're reading the paper periodically.
You can pause and think things like, ""Why is this story important?"" and ""What are the implications of this for the larger world?""

, Be aware of what you're reading. As you shift between sections, take note of it. For example, take note when you move from politics to foreign affairs.If there's any information you really want to remember, you could jot it down somewhere or take a note using your phone.

, News articles have three components: what, why, and how. As you read, try to be aware of the what, why, and how of each article. This will help you remember all the necessary information.The what is the basic information behind the event. Make sure you know the basic facts of what occurred.
The why is why the article is important. Think about why this story matters to you, and why someone is reporting on it.
The how involves all the technicalities. It details any background information or circumstances that allowed the event in question to occur.

, As news articles tend to be brief, the first paragraph gives you insight on what information is key. Read the first paragraph closely and keep this information in mind throughout the article. This will give you a sense of article's intentions, and you could read with your mind on the bigger picture.For example, an article that starts off detailing a recent election may contain information about unexpected results.
You can assume the article will be about these results, why they were unexpected, and the possible consequences. Go into the article with that information in mind.

, While it seems like a small detail, where you read matters. If you're reading in a noisy area, you're less likely to retain information. Choose somewhere quiet and somewhat secluded to read the paper.Make sure the area has good light. It can be hard to read if you're struggling to see.
Avoid reading at night, especially in your bed. This can cause you to become drowsy.

Visualize a word in your mind.,
Flip the word from right to left mentally.,
Practice.,
String words together.",How to Read Backwards2," It can be any word, though it is easier to start with shorter (two to four letter) words. Mentally write the word in your mind as you would on a piece of paper, drawing each letter.

, Beginning first with two-letter words (oh, ah, no, on, etc.) practice flipping the letters in your mind. As you move to longer words, it might help to mentally write each letter one at a time, beginning with the last letter, rather than trying to flip the entire word. As you gain confidence it will become easier to flip an entire word.

, Because this is a mental exercise, you can picture any word backward. Next time you are stuck in traffic, waiting in line at the grocery store, or waiting for a friend at a restaurant, pick a word you see and practice flipping it in your mind.

, For an extra challenge, practice flipping whole phrases in your mind. It is often challenging enough to visualize a backward word in your mind, so be patient with yourself. Flip single words in your mind before flipping an entire phrase.

Hold the backwards text up to a mirror.,
Read the text from left to right.,
Use a mirror to write backwards.",How to Read Backwards3," If you're trying to decipher text that has been written backward in mirror image, there's an easy way to make it legible. The mirror image of the text, or the image of the text that you'll see in the mirror, will look as though it was written normally.


Mirror image writing is different from right to left backwards writing. In mirror image writing, each individual letter appears backwards, but the letters are still in left to right order.
You can see the effect if you hold up regular text to a mirror.

, Just as you normally would, you should be able to clearly read the text now. No brain boggling is required to decipher the code. The letters will appear in their normal position.

, The next time you want to make your writing slightly more difficult to understand, you can use a mirror to translate your text into mirror image writing. Here's what to do:


Write your text on a piece of paper in normal writing.
Have a friend hold it in front of a mirror.
Use a piece of tracing paper to trace over the mirror image of your text.
The text on the tracing paper will be your message, in mirror image backwards writing.

Buy reading glasses.,
Get a portable magnifier.,
Download a magnifier phone app.,
Secure the time and space to read the small print thoroughly.",How to Read Fine Print1," Buying a pair of reading glasses is a simple solution to help make reading fine print easier. Difficulty reading up close, or Presbyopia, is commonly experienced by aging individuals, and easily remedied by having reading glasses on hand to look at mail, restaurant menus, recipes, and other common things. Check for reading glasses, which normally retail for about $10, at drug stores and department stores.If you plan to use your reading glasses on a regular basis, visit your ophthalmologist for a prescription. Inexpensive reading glasses can cause eye fatigue when worn for too long.;
, Handheld magnifiers are portable and can be beneficial for reading fine print in stores, restaurants, other establishments, or at home. Opt for a model with lower magnification, given that larger magnification limits the area of visibility (e.g. 3x as opposed to 6x magnification). Handheld magnifiers range in price from approximately $5-$150., There are numerous magnifier apps available for both iPhones and Androids. These apps use your phone's camera to zoom in on and magnify whatever it is focused on. The quality of these magnifiers relies heavily on the quality of your phone's camera; some also use your phone's flashlight feature to illuminate the view.The Smart Magnifier app for Android, for example, uses your phone's camera, auto-focus, and LED flash to magnify whatever you want to focus on.

, When presented with a document to sign, never hesitate to bring it home, or to a more quiet, comfortable setting, so that you can review it thoroughly. Conditions in a store or office may not be ideal for you to read the fine print in a text properly, or to take the necessary time to review it. Taking the document home will also allow you to have a second person review it, if necessary.Never let a salesperson or representative pressure you into signing or purchasing something without thoroughly reviewing the fine print. It is your right to know the exact details of what you are entering into.

"
"
Consider your environment.,
Select a book.,
Set obtainable goals.",How to Read a Book Faster1," Your reading area should be free from distractions. Turn off the television, music, internet, phone, anything that has the potential to sidetrack your reading.You should also be comfortable, otherwise you'll focus on being hungry, too hot, too cold, basically anything other than your book.


Do be careful of getting too cozy though. Make sure you can stay awake and pay attention to your reading material. This is especially important if you choose to read in bed before going to sleep.;
, It can be anything from a favorite mystery or a textbook. Do choose something in line with your reading goals.


For example, if you have trouble finishing a book for pleasure, pick something you're really interested in reading. Don't find something that probably won't hold your interest. Likewise, if you want to be able to quickly read and glean information for school, you should choose something academic.

, These can be large goals with smaller steps, or a simple to-do list you'd like to accomplish. Either way, writing down your goals makes you focus on what you'd like to accomplish and how you can get there. Examples of achievable goals include: reading an entire book by a certain date, paying attention to a whole chapter and being able to recall the information, reading through a book for the main argument, and reading through a book in less time.
Goals are highly individualized and completely determined by you. Your goals should encourage you to continue practicing.

"
"
Make a list of questions.,
Look for key words.,
Skip to the end.",How to Read Fine Print2," With regard to the fine print of any agreement or advertisement, there will be certain questions you hope to address based on the information provided. Make a list of questions you want to find the answer to in the text and skim through it accordingly. Having clear reading goals can improve your concentration and increase your reading efficiency.For example, before reading a phone contract, ask, ""What are the fees for going over the monthly data limit?"".

, While reading all of the fine print in contracts is challenging, looking for keywords is a good way to seek out the information you need. This information may be regarding late fees, transaction fees, and any other terms that may mean you getting charged more than what you are bargaining for. Some important words and phrases to be on the lookout for are:""Automatic renewal clause"": a clause allowing a company to automatically renew your contract if you do not contact them to cancel by a certain time.
""Liability waiver"": the company is freeing itself from all liability regarding loss or injury.
""Early termination fees"": this refers to the penalties established for cancelling a contract early, which can be exorbitantly high.
""Unilateral amendment clause"": means that the company can alter the terms of your contract at any time.

, If the fine print of a contract or agreement is thousands of words long and you can't commit to reading it all the way through, skip to the end. Many companies put important information about charges and fees towards the end of the fine print in their contracts, in the hopes that no one will read that far. Credit card applications, for instance, contain up to 5,000 words on average, making it less likely for customers to read all the relevant information detailed about high interest rates and late payment fees."
"
Enlist another pair of eyes.,
Deal with customer service.,
Get an expert opinion.",How to Read Fine Print3," When reading fine print that is difficult to understand, a second set of eyes can be very helpful. If possible, ask a close friend or family member to read through the text to see if anything stands out to them. Ask if they reached the same conclusion as you did after reading it.For instance, after having your friend read through the fine print on an internet provider advertisement, ask them if they also understood that there are additional fees for modem rental and installation visits.

, The best way to clarify what is stated in fine print is to speak to a customer service representative from the company to inquire about what is in the fine print. Bring up any questions about terms and conditions that are unclear to you after reading the fine print, and remain clear and cordial. Ask for the individual's name and record the pertinent details of the conversation (e.g. the time and date of the call, the questions you asked and the responses that were given)., The fine print in contracts and legal documents may contain terminology that is difficult to understand without a legal background. If necessary, seek the services of a lawyer to read over the text and interpret it for you with certainty. Search online for lawyers in your area.Some law schools offer free legal clinics for certain types of issues. Contact your local law school, court, or bar association for more information."
"
Engage with what you're reading.,
Take short effective breaks.,
Practice concentrating on what you're reading.",How to Read a Book Faster2," If you have trouble sitting still and concentrating on what you're reading, make notes or write down a brief outline. Write down any questions you might have about the content before you start reading.Writing things down can be especially helpful if you find yourself reading the same few sentences over and over again without being able to continue.
Reading aloud or whispering can help you pay greater attention to your book.
You can also move your fingers along with the text to help keep your place in the book and guide you along.

, This is your chance to think about something other than what you're reading. Move around, get a snack, watch a little television or whatever helps you mentally pause.


Set a time limit in advance and limit the number of rest breaks you take during a given period of time.
Doing something physical can re-energize you and make it easier to return to reading., In order to truly focus on concentrating, you need to do it a little every day. After a few days, you should notice some small improvements in your reading.Find a time of day that works best for you to read and try to read a little each day at that time. Soon, it will become a habit.
Don't try to remember every single detail when you're reading (for pleasure or for school). You'll become overwhelmed, which will make it difficult to continue.

"
"
Focus on reading, but avoid habits that slow you down.,
Read effectively by skimming certain parts and paying attention to others.,
Train yourself to read faster.",How to Read a Book Faster3," Most of the strategies listed in Method 2 will help you focus when reading faster, but some tools will slow you down.


Don't vocalize, highlight text, re-read material, or try to write down every detail you read. Using your finger as a guide can actually help you speed up since your finger can help guide your eyes along as you read.

, Consider the structure of the book by reading the table of contents. Sure, sometime skimming stops you from understanding the text fully, so ensure you read parts carefully now and then, and if there's something new, check back and read a little bit. Spend time carefully reading the introduction and conclusion, as these lay out the main themes of the book. Skim through chapters that provide extensive drawings, illustrations, or lots of similar examples.
Write down a summary after reading for a while. Be sure to note any key concepts or plot developments. This can help you focus while reading., Adjust your speed based on the information you're reading. For example, slow down when you encounter main arguments or new concepts. You can speed up again when you come to repeated or familiar material.


Time yourself. Give yourself a set amount of time to get through a certain amount of text. Once time's elapsed, evaluate your speed. Keep timing yourself and you should see progress.
For example, give yourself an hour to complete reading/skimming a chapter. At the end of the hour, determine if you got the main points of the chapter and understood the information. Practice adjusting your speed if you did not finish or had too much time left.

, Pick books depending on your reading level, no matter what your age. It should be something that you find interesting. Otherwise, you will not feel like sticking to it. Reading is about enjoying the experience while learning something.


You could choose interesting and easy-to-read books such as comic books, or more complex books like epic novels and non-fiction.

, This may be someplace secret where no one will bother you, or simply your home at a time when it is quiet.

, Any time is a good time to read. But if you can set aside some time everyday, that will help in developing a reading habit.

Pick up something to read when travelling on the bus or train. This is a good way to pass time and you can train yourself to read faster and comprehend more despite the distractions around.







,, Or there could be maps depicting the place described in the book. Be sure to look at all that.

, If you cannot speed read, then do not push yourself to read faster. The whole point of reading is to understand what the author is conveying. No sense in skimming through the content.


Ask yourself the five Ws- Why, What, Who, When, and Where. This will guide your reading.

, This can aid good pronunciation and word recognition.

Sound out each word as best you can based on what you hear. Remember, pronunciation of English words could be different depending on what type of English it is (American or British) and depending on the context (like heteronyms- project can be both verb and noun) and you will notice they form some sort of word.






Pay attention to the stresses in words and sentences.

, When you start getting bored or need a break, take one. Reading should be fun and enjoyable, don't force it. After your break, return to where you were, and continue.

, It is okay to reread something if you do not understand it fully the first time.

, Context clues are when a person figures out the meaning of a word by seeing how the word was used in a sentence. For example, you were reading the following sentence and wanted to know what 'pessimist' means:My mother is always happy and optimistic, the total opposite of my brother, the pessimist. So from the sentence, you can gather that 'pessimist' means the opposite of happy, so pessimist means being moody and angry. Good, experienced readers always use context clues! If you find a word that you're totally stumped on, use the dictionary! If you want to save time and the hassle of turning pages, go to the online dictionary.

, Read that portion out in front of a mirror, out loud. Memorizing can improve your confidence with reading.

, If you don't understand what you are reading, read the sentence(s) again. Try reading the words out loud to yourself. If you still don't understand something, ask a good reader nearby to explain the sentence(s) to you, or simply pick up a book that is easier to read and more appropriate to your reading level. Feel free to use your finger as a pointer. It will keep your eyes focused on the line you are reading, improving your understanding.

, Try to read as much as you can in your free time. Reading will help you in lots of ways; your vocabulary will become larger and more sophisticated and you will notice your grades change for the better in school. Have fun reading!

Eliminate distractions.,
Find any type of paper to keep notes in.,
Read back through your notes occasionally, making sure they make sense.,
Ask questions about the theme or the author's intentions.,
Keep your notes together so that you can refer to them later.",How to Improve Your Reading Comprehension1," Turn off the music and the TV. Flee to the library or the bathroom, if that's where you can have peace and quiet to read.;
, Taking notes, while not immediately exciting, is a good way to boost reading comprehension. If you're reading for a class, try a notebook. But if you're reading for fun, get as many pieces of paper as you think you'll need for the story and, of course, grab a pen or pencil.


Jot down what you remember about each chapter, section, or even paragraph. If your reading comprehension is already decent, you may only need to take occasional notes.
Don't rewrite the novel. On the other hand, don't write so few notes that you can't follow what was going on chronologically in the story at a given point.
Anytime a major event happens, or a new character is introduced, or some odd detail sticks out, write it down in your notes.
Try writing down characters and their relationships on one page and a basic time line for the story on another page. Draw a family tree, if it helps.

, Wait a day, then read your notes again. If your notes make absolutely no sense, you know you either need to take more notes, or take better notes.

, Getting in the habit of asking questions will help you improve your comprehension by getting you truly involved in the story. You're trying to figure out what's going on, and in order to do that, you need to ask some questions and pose possible answers. Write down your questions in your notes, as well as your answers.


Some hypothetical questions that you might ask yourself while reading a book and taking notes:
Did the main character let the cat out the back door for a reason, or was the author just trying to fill space?
Why does the author start the book in a cemetery? Does the setting of the book say anything about the main character right off the bat?
What is the real relationship between these two characters? On the face of it, they seem like enemies, but could it be that they actually like one another?


Pose these sorts of questions after you finish a section or a chapter and are trying to make sense of the story. Predict what the answer is going to be. When the answer is revealed, ask yourself what supporting details in the book make that explanation the best one for the story.

, If you jotted down notes on loose leaf paper, put the paper into a binder, separated by tabs for each different story. If you used a single notebook for your notes, create section headings outlining where the notes for one story start and end.

,,,,,,, Search the sentences of a page for the main idea. Skip over text that is less interesting or relevant: this is especially important for online reading.

, Guide your eyes using a finger or pointer, such as a pen, in order for the eye to move faster along the length of a passage of text. Draw invisible shapes on a page of text in order to broaden the visual span for speed reading. Using a finger or pen to make these shapes on a page will speed up your visual cortex, increase your visual span to take in the whole line, and even imprint the information into your subconscious for later retrieval. It also reduces subvocalization, thereby speeding up reading.

This may sound daunting, but remember, some books will be shorter and only take a day or two to read.Try to stick to an average of two books a week. There will be ebbs and flows in your reading. Some weeks you may only read half a book while other weeks you may read five books.
If you’re feeling overwhelmed about your lack of progress, read a few shorter books to get ahead quickly.;
, You may think you have no time for reading, but take a good look at your day and see what you can find. Do you watch T.V. after dinner for an hour or more? Do you spend a lot of time on Buzzfeed, Facebook, or other time-wasting sites? Do you binge Netflix? Use the time you spend on these activities and re-allocate it to reading.You don’t have to completely remove these activities from your schedule, but cut back on them and use that time for reading.

, Keep a written record of the books you have read or use a website like GoodReads (www.goodreads.com) to keep track of the books you have read. GoodReads is easy to use and you will get recommendations based on what you have read to help you find new books to read.


Keeping a record of what you have read will help you know how many books you have left. It’s also fun to watch your list grow as you finish more and more books.

, Everyone is different, but find what works for you. Turn off all of your electronics at least an hour before you normally go to bed and read until you fall asleep. If you’re eating alone, read a book. If you’re waiting to meet up with a friend, take out that book while you wait.Once you start increasing your reading, you’ll find it easier to find more time to read.

, Remember, audiobooks are books too. If you have a long commute, listen to an audiobook. You can also listen to books while cooking dinner or taking a walk. This is a great way to optimize time that you otherwise couldn’t be reading.Audiobooks can be expensive, but look at your local library to see if you can check some out from there.
Audiobook subscriptions are also a cheaper way to get audiobooks.

, Being part of a regular book club is a good way to stay motivated with your reading challenge. It will introduce new books into your reading cycle and is a great way to stay on track. It would be even more fun to start a book club with your friends.


Challenge them to read 100 books a year with you. Keep score! If they start beating you, it will motivate you to read more!

, You don't have to read for hours and hours every day, but you will need to read for a reasonable amount of time every day, depending on how fast you read and how long the book you're reading is. Add reading to your daily routine and try to read as often as possible. Aim to read about ten hours a week.If you commute, read on the train.
Read on your breaks at work instead of socializing.
Read at the doctor’s office while you wait for you appointment.
Read instead of checking social media or watching T.V.

, This might be hard for people who like to finish what they have started, but if the book isn’t engaging, you are less likely to read it. If you’re not inspired to read, it will be more difficult for you to read. Choose books that are relevant to what is currently happening in your life.If you’re reading a book you just can’t put down, it will be easier to read more often.
Not every book is for you. Don’t feel guilty because you can’t get excited about a book your friends have raved about. Read what interests you!

, Technology makes it even easier to carry a book with you everywhere you go. You can download e-reader apps to your phone and have a book with you at all times. If you have an e-reader, you can sync your phone reading to your e-reader so you never lose your place.


Small ten minute reading sessions while waiting for the bus will add up over time.

, Have a few books in various subjects going at one time. Choose a fiction book for light reading before bed and a more complicated non-fiction book for a challenge. You may not be in the mood for one book, but since you’re reading more than one book, you have options!Having multiple books encourages you to read more often because you can read what you are most interested in at that moment.

, Even if you’re reading multiple books simultaneously, they are likely in different genres. Choose the next book you want to read in each genre before you are finished with the current one, so you don’t stall in your reading. Browsing the new releases at the library is a great way to find something interesting to read.If you have money to spend, go to the bookstore and buy a new or used book. The more books you own, the more options you have to read. This will keep your momentum going to reach your goal of 100+ books.
Buying books in bulk guarantees that you will always have a book nearby to start immediately after finishing the last one.
An alternative to buying in bulk is to use the library, borrow books from a friend, or use ebook sites with free downloads such as Project Gutenberg, iBooks, and Libri Vox.
Keep a list of books you want to read and refer to that when you’re having trouble figuring out what to read.

, Sometimes it can be hard to decide what exactly you want to read. Choosing a theme for the year could help you with these decisions. Maybe you want to read a few books from each genre or all of the books by a specific author. You could also do something like “Reading the World” or going through the bestsellers that year.Even if you don’t make it through the list, it’s a good place to find ideas for what to read next.

If you are reading factual information, such as a textbook or a newspaper, use the organization of the piece to guide you.,
If you are reading for a class, guide yourself using another set of clues available to you.,
Use digital information to your advantage.",How to Improve Your Reading Comprehension2," In addition to the table of contents, section headings, and titles, look at:


Summaries, introductions, and conclusions. These will have clues about what parts are especially important.
The main idea in each section you read. Often, it will come first or early in the section. Jot down these main ideas when taking notes.

, Pay attention to the following and use them to help guide your focus as you read:


The syllabus or class outline.
The homework assignment(s). If you know there's a question coming about a particular character, for instance, you will know to pay attention to that character.
What the instructor emphasizes in class.
Any available sample tests or quizzes on this material. You may be able to get these from student groups, from your instructor, or from the text or reader.

, Select key words or phrases and use those to search within the book electronically, if possible, with something like Amazon.com or Google Reader. This is particularly helpful for looking up quotes because the page number will often be listed.

"
"
Read aloud.,
Start with books at or below your level, not with books above your level.,
Read books over again to gain fluency.,
Get better at identifying words (vocabulary).,
Read with a helper.",How to Improve Your Reading Comprehension3," Reading aloud is a great way to slow down while reading. Slower reading usually means more comprehension, because you have more time to process what you're reading. An added benefit of slow reading is that you get to see the words on the page (visual learning) and hear the same words spoken aloud (audio learning).


If you decide that hearing spoken words helps you improve your comprehension, don't be afraid to get narrated books. Of course, you'll want to read the books in addition to hearing them spoken, but this could greatly improve comprehension.

, It's like being thrust into a chess match with a master when you've only just started playing. Of course you're not going to do well when that's the match up. Start with books at your level; you shouldn't be straining to figure out what words mean, or reading sentences over and over again.


If you're reading for a class and the book you're assigned is above your level, read it as best you can, but continue to read other books at your level. Reading those books will help you understand the harder ones.

, Reading teachers talk about this concept called fluency. Fluency is the ability to read words at a certain speed. To be fluent, you want to be able to read 90 words a minute.That seems like a lot, but with only a little bit of practice, you should be able to get there. What kind of practice? Re-reading! Read books over again, twice or even three times. After the first time, the words will read easier and fluency will improve.

, If you don't know what a word means, it's going to be hard to improve comprehension. Have a rough idea of what vocabulary level you should be at given your age. If you're below your level, try starting with books that you fully understand and then work your way up.


There are a number of ways to improve reading comprehension:
Have a dictionary or computer with you while reading. When you come across a word you don't know, look it up and write the definition down in your notes.
Read lots of books. Sometimes the definition of a word will be clear given the context of the sentence. The more you read, the better you'll get at guessing the definition of a word given its context.
Read books above your level. Books above your level will contain lots of tricky vocabulary words. Getting through these books will be harder, but you'll come away with great knowledge.



, Whether that helper is a teacher, a friend, or a parent, read with someone above your level who you're comfortable with talking to and asking questions. When reading with a helper, follow this structure:


Pre-reading: define vocabulary words ahead of time; preview key comprehension questions so that you can look out for them while you read.
Reading: look out for the comprehension questions you went over before reading; ask questions; read aloud if necessary; take notes; listen to someone else reading.
Post-reading: summarize what you just read; ask any questions you had; predict what's going to happen next based on what you just read.

"
Start reading as soon as you can.Few people can read a book in a single sitting.,
Use supplemental materials when available.Always keep a dictionary and thesaurus on hand when reading.,
Resist summaries before finishing the text.,
Eliminate distractions that slow you down.,
Stick to a reading schedule.,
Read when you are fully awake.If you are already tired, reading something you don't like will put you to sleep.,
Listen to an audiobook reading.,
Plan to reward yourself when you finish.,
Join a study group reading the same material.It is helpful to join a group that is reading together.",How to Read a Book You Don't Like1," Starting to read in advance will help you pace your reading. This will allow you to limit the stress forcing yourself to read will have on you. If you start early you can give yourself breaks when you need them.;
, Book and chapter summaries can help you remember what you forgot and highlight points you missed. These can help you when you get stuck or confused.

, If you are interested in what's going to happen in a story and you don't want to read it, resist reading a summary. Also, don't ask your friends what happens. Harness that interest in the story to inspire you to read. Once you hear a summary your interest in reading will sharply diminish. You may not finish reading at all and miss important details.


Summaries are much more effective at helping you remember something you've already read. If you have already read the text and know what's going on, then detailed summaries can save you a lot of time.
If you find the writing very difficult, like some people find old authors like Shakespeare, try reading a summary as you read the text. This will help you understand what's going on so you can focus more on the language.

, When you read something you don't like, distractions seem to pop up everywhere. Things that are rarely distracting become severe irritations. If you can avoid it, don't try to muscle through distractions. Move the distraction away or go somewhere you have no distractions.


Don't try to ""multitask"" by having the TV or computer on while you're reading. You may think that you're getting more done, but your focus will be split and you won't get as much out of your reading., Even if you start early, you need to read at a steady pace to complete the book. Starting early lets you set your pace a little longer but with less daily reading. However, when you start getting behind, catching up can be a real chore. It may seem an insurmountable task. Keep up with your reading schedule at all costs.


An easy way to figure your reading schedule is to divide the number of pages by the number of days you have to read the book. For example, if you have two weeks (14 days) to read a 300-page book, you'll need to read at least 21.5 pages a day if you read 7 days a week. However, if you don't want to have to read on the weekends, you'd need to read at least 30 pages a day.
Schedule a specific time of day to read. Put it into your calendar or a planning app on your phone. Make an appointment with yourself to read, just like you would to go to class or see the dentist. Be faithful about ""showing up"" to read at your appointed time.If you start getting behind, you may need to double or triple your reading for a day or two. Do this as soon as you miss a day. If you are very far behind, try doubling your reading for several days in a row rather than trying to catch up in one day.
Be careful not to compare yourself to others if you read slower.This will only exacerbate your difficulty. Plan ahead so you can read at your own pace. If you want to joining a study group, consider finding a group that reads more at your pace.

, If you are reading before bed you may find yourself sleeping on your open book. Falling asleep while reading robs you of time to read. It may also make you late for meetings or classes if you fall asleep during the day.

, This uses different senses to process the same information. When you hear an audiobook you will be listening to a story. You won't be forcing yourself to read. It is much more passive. If you get distracted, the reading will continue until you pause or stop it. This is especially helpful if you drive or commute long distances and can use your travel time to catch up on homework.


It is tempting to multitask while listening to an audiobook. Be careful to continue listening to and following the story of the audiobook. Don't let yourself get too involved in a complex task. Focus on menial, mindless tasks so your mind can listen while you work.

, One of the worst things you can do is to let your reward for finishing be starting the next book on the list. Plan to reward yourself for your work accordingly. When you think about your next reading, then you can think about being that much closer to your reward.


Try not to let your exam grades discourage you from reading.Thinking you will fail regardless may slow you down or inspire you to quit. Think of reading the book as an accomplishment in and of itself. Reward yourself for achieving your goal.

, You may keep up with the readings so you don't get behind in the group. Even if you get behind, they may be more sympathetic than your teacher. They will also help clue you in to important topics and events to remember.

Measure your student's correct words per minute.,
Have your student practice reading when he/she is most awake and alert.,
Practice efficient reading strategies.,
Be consistent and patient with your student.,
Encourage your student to read at home.",How to Improve Reading Fluency," The first step in teaching your student reading fluency will be for him or her to learn the alphabet. However, teaching the alphabet in alphabetical order may not be as productive as teaching him/her letters that are most frequently encountered first. This way your student will become more familiar with those letters early on and learn to recognize and pronounce them with greater ease.Teach the sights and sounds of each letter in the alphabet in the following order: a, m, t, p, o, n, c, d, u, s, g, h, i, f, b, l, e, r, w, k, x, v, y, z, j, and q.
Focus on lower-case letters before learning upper-case letters, as these occur much more frequently in written text.
Familiarize yourself with the sounds of letters, rather than the names of those letters.;
, Once your student has a basic understanding of the alphabet, you can practice quizzing him/her on individual letters. This will help your student understand all the possible sounds a letter can make.Say the sounds a letter makes out loud.
Have your student listen to the sound and then select the correct letter that corresponds with that sound. You can use a group of flash cards with letters on them, or the keys on a keyboard to identify the correct letter.
After a few rounds, try switching it around. Hold up a flash card with a letter written on it and have your student vocalize the sound that that letter makes.

, Many students struggle with letter combinations that sound like other letters. For example, the pairing ""ph"" that produces the ""f"" sound of phone can be very confusing. Likewise, students may not understand how the letter ""c"" can be used in both ""car"" and ""circuit."" Students will need to understand the basic alphabet sounds and shapes before advancing to letter pairings like this. However, these letter pairings are essential to cover before moving on to whole words.Spend some extra time with these letter pairings. Practice teaching them both ways: having students identify the sounds those letters make together, and also having students identify the letter pairings that a given sound would be made by.
Give students specific words for context so that they understand when and how those letter combinations are used. This can be a good transition into focusing on identifying words.

, If your student is gaining a clear understanding of the shapes and sounds of letters fairly easily, then by all means push him or her to continue advancing through the alphabet. However, if your student is struggling with the alphabet, you may need to slow down and spend more time focusing on pronunciation and recognition.Some students may need as much as 1.5 hours spent on each letter before developing a firm understanding of that letter.
Pushing your student to progress too quickly can result in that student lacking a firm understanding of the building blocks of words. That student will only have problems when he/she advances to working on complete words.

, Once your student has learned letters fluently, it's time to start building words out of those letters. Start out slowly, working on short, simple words at first. As your student gets more comfortable you can progress to longer, more complex words.Say a word out loud.
Show your student a flash card with that word written on it.
Use the word in a sentence.
Have your student say the word out loud while looking at the flash card.

, Your student may struggle with short and long vowel sounds. Teaching your student some of the most common rules of phonics may help him/her develop a better understanding of how words sound and why. Don't get too bogged down in teaching the rules, but showing your student some sample words and explaining why a given word sounds a certain way can help him/her understand and apply those rules to other words.One vowel between two or more consonants usually produces a short vowel sound.
Two vowels between two or more consonants usually produces a long vowel sound.
When a one-syllable word ends with a silent ""e"" (like bake, dime, etc.), it usually produces a long vowel.

, As your student gets comfortable reading and sounding out simple words, you should progress to sight word recognition. This will help your student learn how to read on his/her own without sounding out words, and with practice it will improve your student's speed and efficiency.Read a word out loud.
Have your student look at a list of words and choose the correct word.
Once your student has a firm grasp on this, you can try switching it around. Show your student a flash card with the word on it and have him or her sound out the word aloud.

, Part of teaching reading fluency should include teaching what words actually mean. Reading a word on the page will only go so far if your student doesn't know what those groups of letters and sounds actually mean. You can do this by helping your student associate words with an image, with the hope that eventually your student will be able to make that connection on his or her own.Start showing the written word paired with a picture or symbol of that word.
Use the word in a sentence.
Ask your student to sound out the word while looking at it on paper. Then ask your student to use the word in his/her own simple sentence.
Once your student gets a firm grasp on this, try showing him/her a list of several words. Then say a word out loud and show the picture or symbol of that word, and ask your student to choose the correct word from the list of words.

, Once your student has a strong grasp of recognizing, decoding, and pronouncing individual words, start having him/her string words together. Your student doesn't have to be ready to read and speak full sentences just yet, but being able to read chunks of text instead of individual words will help get him/her there more quickly.Aim for your student to read and interpret four or five words at a time and understand their context, rather than focusing on (and getting bogged down by) every single word.
Once your student is capable of reading and interpreting short strings of words, start forming short, simple sentences.
Focus on connected text. Make sure the word strings you teach your students make sense when paired together, even without a larger sentence for context.

, Once your student can read short sentences, he or she will be ready to start putting sentences together into basic paragraphs. This may be challenging at first, as even a short paragraph will look intimidating to students who have just mastered four or five word sentences. However, with patience and practice, your students will be able to start reading increasingly-long paragraphs and understanding their meaning.

, A good way to gauge your student's progress is to measure his or her correct words per minute. This simple learning strategy tests your student's ability to get through a paragraph while also alerting you to any words that he or she is still struggling with.Time your student while he/she reads out loud for 60 seconds.
Write down any words that your student stumbles over, pronounces incorrectly, or takes more than three seconds to pronounce.
After 60 seconds, mark on the page where your student began and ended. Then count the number of words he or she got right versus wrong, which will give you your student's oral reading fluency rate (number of correct words per minute).
Make and use flash cards from the list of words your student struggled with.
Practice improving your student's fluency at least five days each week. Keep track of your student's progress and try to improve his/her oral reading fluency rate every week.

, If your student is not sufficiently awake and alert in the mornings, see if you can rearrange the student's schedule to work on reading fluency in the early afternoon. Try to gauge each student's individual habits and patterns to determine what time of day works best for that particular student.Trying to practice reading while your student is too tired will be very unproductive. Reading requires an alert and engaged student.

, Once your student has gotten comfortable with basic text reading at the paragraph level, you can start teaching him/her strategies to read more efficiently and quickly. This should only come after a basic understanding has been developed, though, or your student could potentially miss out on important aspects of reading sentences and paragraphs.Have students skim the page over before you start reading. Teach them to look for headings, bold text, and bullet points, as these typically contain the most useful information.
Teach your students to avoid enunciating each word internally. This will slow down the reading process significantly and may cause your student to lose the context of the rest of that sentence.
Skim over ""unimportant"" words like conjunctions (and, but, or), prepositions (with, as, etc.), and articles (the, a, an).

, Reading fluency should be practiced on a regular schedule. You should spend at least 10 minutes per student each session, though you can spend longer amounts of time working together if this is feasible. Hold reading sessions at least three times each week and try to stick to a consistent schedule., Reading fluency can only go so far in the classroom. In order to develop true fluency, your student will need to practice his or her reading skills at home. Have him/her spend time reading every day, and talk about what your student has read during your in-class meetings.Ask your student to talk about the stories he/she has read at home.
Have your student keep a list of words that he or she struggles with while reading at home.
Spend some time working on the words that your student is having the hardest time with. Make flash cards and work slowly at improving your student's understanding of the words, their meanings, and their sounds.

, Do a bit of research first. Whether you choose a book or not, go read a little about the author, what is known about how and why the book was written, its historical setting. What was happening at the time it was being written?

, This will give you a preview of the book. For modern books, find reviews in past magazines or newspapers. For older books, read some standard discussions on the book, what English professionals have said in history.

, Try to recognize these as you see them happen. Learn the basic genre of the book, if western, horror, historical, adventure, science fiction, romance, drama, or comedy., Try to find the names and descriptions of main characters, and the setting. When and where does the story happen? Look at the author's writing style, and begin to get used to it.

, You are not doing a translation exercise. You won't understand every word. Get a main idea, a feeling, a mental picture first.

, Underline, put a question mark if you want to check something later, or an exclamation mark if something catches your attention. Later you can go back and check new words or ask a question.

, Don't worry about grammar, just write your ideas.

, In class, ask other students and participate in class discussions. Do any work sheets given by the teacher.

, In a class, you may have a reading schedule. If not, give yourself 2-3 months, and try to read the same amount every week. Keep a reading journal, with ideas after each chapter.

, Even if it's an old movie, it will help you visualize the story.

Take plenty of notes.If you do not understand the material you will certainly grow to hate reading it.,
Discuss the material with classmates or study mates.",How to Read a Book You Don't Like2," Consider only reading a portion a day if you have time. This will allow you to learn a little each day with fewer days of non-studying to forget what you learned.


When you go back to reading, plan to review. Take a few minutes to look back at what you read previously to remind yourself what you learned last time. This will help you avoid getting stuck by forgetting previous material.

, The last thing you want to do is push yourself beyond your limits. If you find your pacing is too quick, take a break. Work these breaks into your pacing if possible. Maybe take a day or two off during the week instead of reading every day.

, Sometimes what is important is not to read word-for-word but to understand the concepts. If you focus on reading word-for-word you may sometimes miss the overarching themes. Skim the material and focus on learning concepts and themes when possible.

, One of the best ways to avoid this is to take copious notes. Write out definitions and concepts. Memorize them in your spare time.


Most textbooks will provide a Glossary with definitions for key terms and concepts. Use this Glossary whenever you run across a term you are unfamiliar with. If you find yourself forget that term frequently, make a flash card and quiz yourself until you know the term's meaning by heart.

, Finding a study group can be a boon to your understanding in a class. Where you fail to understand a topic, they often can help you out. Likewise, when they do not understand, you can teach them. This will help both of you to better understand the material.

Don't stress about the instructions.",How to Read a Book You Don't Like3," Many people who find themselves unable to finish a self-help book believe they already know what's being said. If that were true, you wouldn't be asked to read the book. Even if you know the material, perhaps your execution is poor. Consider that you need a refresher course.


Read about the author to discover their credentials. Most publishers won't waste money printing the work of a quack. Once you know where they are coming from you may be better able to appreciate what they are saying.

, Depending on why you are reading the self-help book, you will likely have ample time to read it. Wait until you need to have it read ""tomorrow"" and you will likely be unsuccessful. Plan out your reading schedule so you won't have to read more than you can understand.


Consider reading a chapter per week or each day. Most self-help books are read for understanding rather than pace. The goal is to learn the principles rather than finish the text.

, Practicing the principles in the book can give you real-world benefits that make the reading seem profitable.


Write the principles you are learning on note cards. You can review those note cards throughout the day. This will help you remember to try to implement the principles throughout the day.

, If you are reading for someone else (e.g., a spouse or counselor) you may want to discuss the book with them. Chances are that they will be very happy to help. Especially if they were the ones asking you to read the book in the first place.

, Some self-help books end their chapters with homework. If you think reading the material is a chore, this extra work will probably infuriate you further. Focus on understanding the principles and skip the homework unless you think it will be interesting or enlightening.


Some self-help books require some extra work. You likely don't have to complete all the recommended homework but don't skimp on what's important. If there are self-evaluations or tests on which other parts of the book rely, try to complete those. Instructions to write down your feelings or thoughts at the end of a chapter are often supplemental time-fillers you can ignore in a pinch.

When it comes to reading, you may not be aware of your goals going into the book. However, you can easily create your own goals as you go along.


If you're reading a book for class, you probably have a set number of pages or chapters to get through. This can help you have a clear end in sight.
If you're reading for pleasure and find yourself struggling, try setting daily reading goals for yourself. You can choose a set number of pages or chapters, and keep yourself motivated by reminding yourself you're only reading a fraction of the book that day.
Challenge yourself to learn something from the text. You can learn a great deal from reading, whether it's fiction, nonfiction, or historical texts - even the boring ones.;
, If a book is hard to get through, it may seem even more daunting to look at the book as a single work of literature spanning hundreds of pages. Instead of trying to marathon the book from cover to cover, try breaking it up into smaller sections - say, a few chapters every day. As you work your way through the day's section(s), try taking breaks between chapters so you can refresh your mind and rest your eyes before you continue.Take breaks along the way to help you stay focused. However, make sure you decide beforehand how many breaks you'll take and how often.
Don't take breaks whenever you feel like it. Challenge yourself to get through a set reading goal (like the end of a long chapter, or after completing two relatively short chapters).
Put your bookmark at the end of that group of chapters. That way you'll be able to see where the end point is as you turn each page, and you'll be more motivated to make it all the way to your resting point.

, A boring book may tempt you to reach for your cellphone, check your social media, or flip on the television. However, breaking your focus like this will only make it more difficult to get through the book. Instead of giving in to temptation, force yourself to continue without distractions until you get through that day's reading.


Find a quiet place where you won't be disturbed (if possible).
Try turning off or silencing your cellphone. Keep the television turned off, and stay away from your computer or tablet.
If you don't have your own quiet space or if you like to read on the bus, try wearing earplugs while you read.
You can use noise-reducing earplugs, or wear headphones and listen to something that will block out noise without distracting you. Instrumental music works best - try something soothing but upbeat, like jazz or certain classical composers.

, Sometimes a boring book can seem even more boring if you're tired, distracted, or unfocused. Try getting into a good reading mindset before you pick up the book. That way you'll be less likely to lose interest or look for reasons to quit for the day.


Try to read when you're most awake. Reading a boring book while you're nodding off on the couch will not get you very far.
Sometimes writing things out helps you clear your mind and remove distractions. Try doing this before you get started on your reading for the day.
Take a few deep breaths before you begin. This can also have a calming, head-clearing effect for some people.

, Underlining/highlighting passages is a great way to engage with the text and find your place if you need to refer back to the text at a later date. Annotating the margins with notes, questions, or observations is another great way to stay engaged, as it forces you to ask questions of the text and look for significant passages. Some things to look for as you read include:


definitions or relevant terms (especially those you're not familiar with)
methods and results (for text books)
cause-and-effect relationships
references to earlier material, as this will probably be an important concept

, Another good learning tool to help you stay focused is to extract important material from the text and re-phrase it in your own words. This forces you to pay close attention and to actually process what you read, rather than passively skimming the text.Reading actively requires you to extract and bring together related pieces of information from the text. By doing this, you may find that a passage from the middle or end of the book is directly related to an earlier section in ways you might have missed.
As you read, try to paraphrase difficult passages in your own words. This has been shown to help students retain information., In addition to synthesizing material, you should force yourself to ask questions of the text. Then try to find the answer, which may come from reading onward or from quickly referring back to previous pages or chapters (in which case underlining/highlighting/annotating will come in handy).Try to decipher what the author is trying to accomplish with each chapter you read. How does it stand alone, and how does it fit into the larger context of the book's intended goal(s)?
How does each chapter you read build off of the previous chapters? Are they related, or do they seem disconnected? Was this a deliberate choice by the author?
Ask yourself, ""Can I learn anything from this text?"" Surely the answer is yes; it's just a matter of figuring out what it is you can learn.
Ask yourself questions about any passages or sections that are difficult/confusing. Try to answer those questions before moving on, either by reflecting on the material you've just read or browsing through your underlined and annotated sections from earlier in the book.

, No matter how boring a book may seem in the moment, there's always something that makes it worth reading. Remember that any published piece of writing was deemed to be important, interesting, and well-written by someone who professionally edits books, so if you haven't found that payoff yet it's still ahead somewhere.The payoff is coming at some point. It may not arrive until the end or near the end, but there is almost always a payoff at some point.
Whether it's the thrill you experience when the action finally delivers a plot twist, the new knowledge you'll take away from the book, or the realization that the book was actually about something much deeper than you'd realized all along, there's definitely something to be gained by finishing the book.
If you don't finish the book, you may never know why so many people consider it a classic.

, Not finishing a book is essentially a waste of money. This may not be a problem if you borrowed the book from a friend or through your local library, but if you purchased that book you're missing out on a return for your investment.


If you bought the book, you may have invested $10 to $20 in that book (possibly more if it's a hard-cover copy).
If you only read the first few chapters of the book, you effectively wasted most of the money you spent on it.
Try to think about the book as any other form of entertainment. You wouldn't buy tickets to a play or a sports game and leave after 10 minutes, so why do the equivalent with a book?
Even if it's not a waste of money, and you are reading if for school, think of the consequences it will have on your grade if you don't read it.

, Working through a boring book has its rewards, and those rewards extend beyond the satisfaction of finishing the text. Think of it as training for adulthood and an exercise in maturity or self-discipline.Think of getting through a boring book as training for life.
There will be times in life when you have to do something unenjoyable.
If you decided that you didn't feel like finishing your work assignments at your place of employment, you'd be fired pretty quickly.
If you don't do the assignments you're given in school, your grades will suffer.

, If you're really struggling to finish a book, try giving yourself some kind of tangible incentive. Reward yourself with something you like at the end, or withhold something you like from yourself until you finish the book.


Having an enjoyable reward in sight might be the ""carrot on the stick"" you need to keep working until you reach the end.
You might decide that when you finish the book you will treat yourself to a nice dinner, an ice cream treat, or a fancy bottle of wine (if you're old enough to drink).
You may also want to try withholding certain unnecessary treats/perks from yourself until you finish. For example, you may decide not to have any dessert foods until you finish the book.

Find a quiet reading space.,
Skim the section titles.,
Utilize any summary information that the book provides.,
Read the material.,
Examine graphs, charts, and images.",How to Read a Chapter of Biology1," To successfully read from your biology book, you should look for a quiet place. Try to leave any distractions, such as TV or cell phones, turned off. This will help you focus on the biology concepts that you are reading about.Going to the library or an open classroom is always a good option when seeking a reading space.;
, Jumping straight into the first paragraph might be overwhelming for some. Instead, read through the section titles for that chapter to gain a rough idea of what concepts you will be reading about. This will mentally prepare you to read the material and understand how the concepts fit together.For example, a chapter on mitosis might have sections for interphase, prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase, and cytokinesis.

, Many biology books will have a chapter summary or a page listing key terms at the end of the chapter. These pages summarize biological concepts discussed in the chapter. Read over this material to have an idea of what the main points of the chapter will be.

, Once you have read your section titles and settled into your quiet space, it’s time to get to work. Start reading the first section of the chapter. Read at your own pace and make sure that you are understanding each section before moving forward.Sometimes, it is a good idea to commit to reading one section at a time instead of reading the whole chapter at once.
Re-read sections as needed.

, Much of biology is better explained with visuals. Instead of skipping over charts and images, take the time to look at them. They say a picture is worth a thousand words, and in biology, this is often true.


One of the most popular images in biology is the diagram of a cell. This shows the major structures and functions of the cell.
You might also encounter a chart depicting the Krebs Cycle.

Get some background info.,
Make sure you have a clear understanding of what your project for the book will be.,
Start reading the book.,
Ask for help from your teacher or a fellow class-mate.,
Call a friend and take turns reading it aloud to each other.,
Study your notes repeatedly.,
Stay calm during the assignment or while working on the assignment.,
add some light music in the background , that will reduce the monotony, even if it is boring and almost impossible to read, make it a longer process.,
Put a calendar, keep some time aside for every chapter and work on that for the time kept aside, no matter how boring that chapter is.

",How to Read a Boring Book for Class and Do Well in the Associated Project or Test," on the book. Yeah, it sounds boring, but it helps you fully understand the book in the long run. So you might want to try looking up things like the time period the book takes place in, and the cultures in it! It helps make it seem more exciting.;
, Do you have to write a report, make a display, or take a test?

, If you start the book with your class, be sure to listen to your classmates questions, and highlight important parts.

, If the book immediately seems boring, don't put it down. Instead think of why its boring you. Is the vocabulary throwing you off? Or maybe everything is just different.

, It helps.

, If you are really worried about your grade you can invite a friend in the class and study together. But make sure that your friend is helpful, and had read the book, and fully understands it.

, Review the sequence of events, and main theme in your head. The more you freak out, the less you remember

, First, go through the book fast, and reread it again and again fast, so that ultimately you know everything that is in it.

Make reading notes.,
Summarize graphs or images.,
Organize the notes.,
Utilize common biology study aids.",How to Read a Chapter of Biology2," As you read, jot down important biological concepts and details. Your reading notes do not have to be organized at first, as long as you can go back and understand what you wrote. Also, write down any questions you have or things that you do not understand in your biology chapter.For example, if you come across a word you don’t know (e.g. lipid), write it down.

, Writing out the concepts covered in a graph or image is a great way to check your understanding. Make notes of the graphs and images that are covered in your text. You can also draw any images that you would like to have in your notes.


Diagrams of particular structures, like the golgi apparatus, would be good images to redraw in your notes.

, After you read the entire chapter, you should revise your notes. Rewrite all of your reading notes in complete sentences and organized bullet points. Add your diagrams and/or image summaries in with the concepts that they explain. Be sure to put everything in your own words., Put your notes into folders based on subject matter. It may help to even color code the folders. Break the notes down into flashcards with a question on one side and an answer on the other. You can also make flashcards with a term or image on one side and the definition or explanation on the other. These tools will help you understand the chapter you read more completely.


A colored folder system might use a green folder for things related to genetics, a red folder for cell structures, and a yellow folder for metabolism.
A note card might have the word “Anaphase” on one side and a description of what happens during anaphase on the other side.

"
"
Define unknown words.,
Look for background information.,
Imagine how you could apply this information.",How to Read a Chapter of Biology3," Context clues can give you a good idea of what a word might mean. However, biology is a science with very specific terms. Look up each word that you do not know and write out its proper definition. This will keep you from being tripped up when you see the word in a new context.


You can often find the definition of these words in the textbook glossary. If you come across a word that isn’t in the glossary, look it up in a dictionary or online.
You might need to look up words like glycosylation or respiration to fully understand the chapter of biology that you are reading.

, Many biological processes can only be understood with the right background information. Sometimes, that background will come from other biology concepts, but you may need to study other subjects as well. To gain the needed background information, go to the library or look online. Look through textbooks in other subjects such as chemistry or utilize resources such as Khan Academy online.


For example, if you are studying metabolism, a background in chemical processes will be useful. Some of this information may be given in the chapter, but you may be assumed to know some of it.

, Many people find biology difficult to connect with. In order to understand the concepts and enjoy what you are reading, you will need to find an application for biology. The application should match something you enjoy and do well in. Common topics are things like health sciences and biochemistry.If you enjoy math, you could look at biological concepts as they apply to mathematical concepts. A good application for this would be to determine the rate at which cells grow given different conditions.
You could also consider how these biological concepts affect everyday life. For example, when you are studying genetics, you could think about your own features and the genes that create them.

"
"
Utilize tutoring centers.,
Ask classmates.,
Participate in study groups.,
Talk to your instructor.",How to Read a Chapter of Biology4," Most schools will have a tutoring center to help students in different subject areas. Schedule an appointment or come in during the time that the biology tutor is available. Tutors are sometimes biology instructors, lab assistants, or students who do exceptionally well in their biology class.

, Be selective when asking classmates to help you out. Ask the students who are doing well in biology as opposed to someone you’re friends with who is also struggling. You can ask for one on one help, or form a study group with several students., There is usually a student in every class who is eager to start a study group. If your biology class doesn’t already have a study group, be the eager learner and start one. You can even create social media pages that keep the group connected and let everyone know when and where meetings will be. Come to each study session with your notes, your book, and any homework problems. Ask questions and try to answer others’ questions., Your biology instructor can be your most valuable resource when you need help. Go to office hours or set up a meeting with your biology instructor. Use this time to ask them about the concepts or applications that you are struggling with in your biology class.It always helps if the instructor sees that you are putting in effort. Attend class every day, take advantage of optional study times, and participate in class discussions.

Bring an interesting book.,
Select an appropriate topic.,
Read ahead.,
Change up the story.,
Talk loud enough for everyone to hear.,
Set rules and stick to them.,
Act out different voices.,
Fix-up the reading area.,
Don't read too fast.,

Ask questions.,
Use props.,
Follow up after the story.",How to Read a Book to a Group of Kids," Kids don’t have very long attention spans, so try to choose a book that will be interesting to them and likewise to you. Children are keenly aware when the adult around them is not interested in what they’re doing. Try a pop-up book if you’re unsure how to pick something fun.


If you find that the kids are not paying attention, or you just want to avoid losing their interest, try selecting a few books, two or three should suffice, and have the kids vote on which one they want to read. You can’t please everyone, but you can work the runner-up story into the next storytime.;
, The book you choose should be appropriate for the age group and appropriate with regard to content. If you’ve been tasked to read to older children, books like Everybody Poops may not be the best selection. Instead, try something in the Dr. Seuss line, or the classic Incognito Mosquito.

, Regardless of the age group, make sure you read the book yourself a few times. You can think about possible questions the kids might have, think of fun ways to read through the book, and also find a natural rhythm or cadence that fits the pace and tone of the book.

, Pick different stories for each reading. If you read the same story again and again the kids are likely to get bored. What’s more, reading a variety of stories will expose the children to a breadth of vocabulary, plots, and diversity, specifically in the types of language. In other words, your little ones will have ongoing experiences with different syntactic forms (sentence and phrase structure), sounds, verb tenses, and emotions., You’ll lose part of the audience if they can’t hear you. Also, they won’t be able to pay attention if they don’t know what’s going on.


Please remember that there is a difference between talking for all to hear and yelling a story at the kids. Avoid the latter by testing the room’s acoustics beforehand. You can do this by reading to another adult or even by turning on the voice recorder on your phone and placing it in the middle of the room.

, Kids need structure and learn this through interaction. Before you start reading the story, be sure to reinforce a few simple rules like, “don’t interrupt the story” and “raise your hand if you have a question.” As you read through the story, you’ll likely need to restate these simple rules several times, but do it calmly and politely.


If you happen to be interrupted, you can try to a polite phrase like “I see your hand, please wait your turn” or “I’ll call on you when it’s time for questions.”

, Whether it’s a book about a caterpillar or the three little pigs, there is always room for fun. As you preview the book, come up with some different ways to read each character’s lines, using vocal expression. You might change the pitch of your voice from low to high, speed it up or slow it down, or add a voice effect like talking in a whisper or creaky voice.


Also, you’ll likely find that making faces helps too, and can be quite natural. You can also try to act out a specific word, like saying “scared” in a scary voice, or saying “happy” in a cheerful tone. Remember, it’s your job to make the grumpy old man in the book sound even grumpier!, You don’t have to read to the kids in an emotionally sterile environment; make the reading area fun and interesting to be in. You can add comfortable rugs, and throw in some over-sized pillows or bean bag chairs. Also suggest to the parents that the kids bring their favorite comfy blanket if the story is around nap time. You might kill two birds with one stone., If you find yourself reading too quickly and blowing through the story, the children and the parents may not be able to keep up and you could lose your audience. Practice your rate of speech in advance and time the story. You’ll find that you stay on track better by making yourself aware of your own voice.


It may be a good idea to take a slight pause of 2-3 seconds as you turn each page. This will add an equal amount of spacing at regular intervals and slow your rate of speech appropriately.

, You can involve the kids by showing them all the pictures in the book. Seeing the pictures help kids understand the book better in addition to keeping everyone's attention. As you show the each picture, you’ll need to ensure that you are catching each member of your audience. To do this, sit comfortably so you can easily turn to show the book to the left and right sides of the room., Another way to engage the group is to ask what the children would do at specific parts in the story. For example, while reading The Three Little Pigs, you might ask the kids “Who would open the door for the wolf?” or “What would you build the house out of?” The responses may be surprise you in witty and clever ways.


You should try to ask just a few questions near the middle of the story, and again at the end. Don’t ask too many questions too often or it may break up the story and you’ll lose continuity.

, Try adding a prop to the story for the kids to use as you read. For example, hand out egg shakers for the kids to shake when something specific happens, like thunder rumbling or when a character skips. This will bring the children into the story and make it more fun for all.Also include some stuffed animals that look like the characters. So you would bring a stuffed wolf or turtle for the kids to act out some scenes. This also serves as a great way to extend the children’s imaginations.

, Immediately after the story, ask the kids what their favorite parts were. Take it to the next step and have them make up what will happen next. This is perfect to spark creativity and keep them reading.Asking the children follow questions can be very useful. Try asking a question that requires limited or guided output like “Who remembers what the hungry caterpillar ate?” or “What happened to Humpty Dumpty?”You’ll also get a good idea of who was paying attention, in addition to checking their comprehension skills.

Choose reading material that you will enjoy.,
Go to a real bookstore.,
Remember that you won't be tested.,
Rely on media other than books.,
Join a book club.,
Listen to audiobooks.,
Take your time.,
Avoid forcing yourself to read.,
Read at relaxing times.",How to Read a Book If You Don't Enjoy Reading1," Many people like to talk about reading “the classics,” but this might not be the type of reading material you enjoy and could turn you off to the activity. Choose any type of reading material you like which can help encourage you to read.Check out a wide variety of genres, such as celebrity biographies, romance, non-fiction, graphic novels, or fictional works.
Ask friends and family members for suggestions of material they enjoyed reading. Chances are that you may like it, too.
You’ll likely enjoy a couple of different genres of reading. For example, you might like to read romance novels one day and a graphic novel the next. Don’t pigeonhole yourself into one type of reading: allow yourself to explore the wide world of reading!;
, Brick-and-mortar bookstores have several advantages over browsing online. For one thing, you can walk through the aisles and pick up anything that catches your eye. You're more likely to discover something exciting when you can see what's in front of you, rather than having to know what to search for. Most bookstores are also happy to let you relax and read in their coffee shop or lounge area, so you can ""preview"" a book before you buy it.


Additionally, employees in bookstores usually love books and are happy to offer recommendations. For example, if you usually don't like reading but really enjoyed The Hunger Games, a bookstore employee could recommend other books like it that you might also enjoy.

, Some people have learned to hate reading because in school they had to read just to pass tests, and they never made an emotional connection to the material.If you're just trying to figure out what you might enjoy reading, remember that this isn't a test, and you won't ""fail"" if you don't enjoy a particular type of book.


It's also not a competition. Liking one type of book doesn't mean that you're ""better"" than someone else. Someone bragging about loving James Joyce's Ulysses isn't inherently a superior person. And in fact, quite a few people lie about having read ""classic"" books -- 65% of people admit to saying they've read an ""important"" book when they have not.Read things that you find interesting and enjoyable, and don't let anyone make you feel bad about what you like. Popular writers like John Grisham and James Patterson may not be Charles Dickens, but their works give plenty of people enjoyment.

, Just like not getting stuck on one genre of reading, try different types of reading media. From magazines to books and tablets to e-readers, there are many different media from which you can choose to read.If you don’t like reading books, try smaller publications such as magazines or newspapers. Making the reading manageable can motivate you.
If you travel a lot, try using an e-reader or tablet. This can help you to pass time without having to tote heavy books or magazines on your trip., Reading doesn’t have to be a boring or solitary endeavor. Joining a book club can be a fun and social way to enjoy different kinds of reading with friends or family members.Seeing a story unfold and talking about it can be a powerful motivation for many people to read as well as making it more enjoyable.Combine your reading with other enjoyable activities such as eating a meal or having a glass of wine.
Be aware that with a book club you won’t necessarily always like the book choices. You can always opt to not read the book or grin and bear with it until something you like comes along.

, If you truly don’t like reading, listen to audiobooks. These are often performed by voice actors so they sound dramatic and engaging. Audiobooks may help you enjoy books without actually having to do any physical reading. They can be great if you commute, too.


It might take a few tries to find a genre of audiobooks that you like. You can always stop an audiobook if you don’t like it and try something new.
Public libraries often offer a selection of audiobooks that are free to check out. You can also join a subscription service, such as Audible, that allows you a free audiobook every month for a small fee.
Studies have shown that listening to books offers basically the same intellectual benefits as reading a book.In fact, there are some people who learn better from hearing than through visual stimulation., If you’re reading for enjoyment, there is no pressure to read quickly. Take your time while reading a text to help ensure that you can thoroughly enjoy whatever you’ve chosen to read.


Break down your reading choice by pages, chapters, or sections. If you feel like you need to make your text more manageable, break it down into digestible parts. For example, you could say, ""I’m going to read 5 pages."" See if you can do that and continue on if you like. Otherwise, leave the reading for another time.

, You might be making reading less enjoyable by forcing yourself to read because of personal or societal expectations. Don’t pressure yourself to read and you may find that you really enjoy reading as well as what genre you prefer.Place different reading material randomly around your home or office. This may encourage you to pick up something to read when you’re bored or instead of watching TV or doing other activities.You can also take reading material with you on vacation, to a pool or amusement park, or on your morning commute. Having it there may entertain you when you’re bored or need a distraction.

, Don’t read when you feel stressed or at times when you’re in a hurry. Reading at times you’re relaxed can help your brain associate with pleasure instead of as a chore.Studies have shown that a positive and relaxing context can motivate people to read.For example, you might want to keep some reading material next to your bed. You can reach for it before you go to sleep if you like. Make sure to keep a couple of different types of material available— such as a magazine and a book—so you can read something that parallels your mood."

This may help you understand complex topics and actually learn to enjoy the book.


Most major works of literature have study aids. These have annotated comments that can explain difficult sections of the book.
Talk to your instructor or boss if you’re having a difficult time. She may be able to suggest effective ways to read the book.

, If you don’t enjoy reading and realize that you have required reading for school or work, accept it and develop a plan to tackle the assignment. This will help you figure out how to strategically get through the activity.Allot to each section of the reading a specified amount of time so that you don’t get mired on one part of it.For example, you’ll probably want to spend more time on the introduction and conclusion than the body of a text.
Make sure to schedule breaks for yourself to refresh your brain and recharge yourself., It is never too early to start required reading. This can minimize your stress and help you retain information.You can read for 20-30 minutes a day to help you get through the text in a more effective manner.

, Working with smaller and more manageable sections can help you get through your required reading. This will ensure that you address every section of the reading, even if it’s not enjoyable.Before you start, skim the entire text to get a basic idea of what it is about. This can help you from getting lost or confused by the work.Pace yourself: allow yourself no more than an allotted time for each section. This may help motivate you to get through the text., People who have to read a lot of texts, such as academics, employ strategies to quickly “gut”—or get the most important information—reading assignments. Learning how to gut can help you more effectively and enjoyably get through the tedium of required reading.The most important sections of any text are the introduction and the conclusion. Make sure to read these thoroughly and then skim through the remainder of the text for important details.
The first and last sentences of paragraphs usually offer previews of the paragraph's argument.
Sidebars, text boxes, and summaries in textbooks often condense the most important information. Always read these.

, Reading aloud can be especially helpful for texts such as plays and poetry. Plays were written to be performed, and it could make that Shakespeare play a lot more accessible to hear what the words sound like, rather than just reading them on the page. Similarly, reading poetry aloud, paying attention to line breaks and punctuation, can help you discover things about the text that you wouldn't if you read it silently., If you’re reading required texts, you’ll likely need to recall the information at a later juncture. By taking notes as you read, you will construct a built-in aid for when you need to recall what you’ve read.


Taking notes is a delicate balancing act between getting too little and too much information. You don’t want to write down everything you read, just the most relevant information. For example, if you are in finance you may want to focus on important figures instead of facts. Conversely, if you are reading a historical text, you’ll need to know the significance of events instead of details.
Take notes by hand. Studies have shown that people learn more by writing notes instead of typing them in to a computer or recording them on a device., If you are in a team or a class where everyone is reading the same required text, break down the reading among several people. Make sure to take notes and then have every person exchange what they’ve written. This may help you avoid having to read too much.


Reading groups with colleagues or classmates can be very helpful in effectively tackling reading assignments. Every person has different strengths with learning and material you may not understand someone else likely will.

, If your teacher allows you to select which book you want to read, you can find one that you enjoy reading. This will make it much easier to read quickly, and you can successfully complete your reading log in no time. Here are some tips for finding a good book:Think about the topics or subjects that you are interested in, and a pick a book that best fits. For example, if you like mysteries or suspense, look for a book in these genres.
Have you studied a subject or event in school that you’d like to learn more about?
Is there a book you read in the past that you liked? If so, look for books by the same author.
Ask your teacher for recommendations. He or she will be impressed that you asked for their assistance, and will probably be able to give you some good possible options. Your teacher also has a good idea of your reading level and will be able to suggest a book that’s a good fit.
Get help from a school librarian or a public librarian. They are trained to help people find books. If you tell them what grade level you are in and mention your interests, they will be able to point you in the right direction.
Even if your teacher provides you with a list of possible books, you may be able to choose which one is the most appealing to you.

, Although it may sound silly, the more you practice reading, the faster you will be able to read. That’s part of why your teacher is assigning these reading logs., Before you get started reading the book you selected, make sure you know what information you have to fill out for the reading log.


For example, do you have to answer specific questions about the book for the log, or will you have to complete a book report or other project at a later date? If you know what information you will need to look for, you can keep this in mind while you’re reading and your log will be easy to complete.

, If you wait until the last minute to read the book, you’re going to feel stressed out and it will be harder to comprehend the book and quickly fill out your reading log. Procrastination also won’t make this process any more pleasant.Set aside time each day to read. When you are done, reward yourself by doing something you enjoy.

, It may sound too simple, but finding a good location to do your reading in can make the process a lot more enjoyable and faster.Look for a place where you can focus. This might be a quiet corner in your house, a comfy chair in a coffee shop, on the front porch, or on a park bench.
If you read in bed, you might be tempted to fall asleep, and the dining room in your house might get noisy when everyone is home.

, When you find a good spot, make sure there are no distractions such as the television, radio, computer, or your phone. These will make it harder to get into the book you are reading and concentrate.If your mind keeps wandering while you are reading, take a short break. When you return to the reading, you should be better able to pay attention., If you don’t have access to the log while you are reading, keep track of your reading in a notebook, journal, or even on a scratch piece of paper. Then, you can easily transfer the information to your log when you have to turn it in.Pay attention to how long you read and how many pages you read. These details can be difficult to remember later, and if you don’t keep track along the way, you will find it harder to accurately and quickly fill out your reading log.If you have questions about something you read, write them down so you can look up the answers later or ask your teacher. Think about the plot of the story, what the characters want, how the author writes, why the book ended the way it did, and what the author seems to be trying to teach the reader.
Taking notes while you read will help improve your comprehension and help you focus on the book.

, If you are having any difficulties reading or feel like you are having a hard time comprehending the material you read, talk with your teacher or a parent. They will be able to offer some excellent tips and advice on how to improve your reading skills.

, If there are things about the book you found confusing and you’re not sure how to answer a question on your reading log, take a few minutes to do some online research.There are many online websites that discuss specific books. You may find these articles and websites helpful because they often examine the plot, analyze main characters, and interpret important quotes. Use these resources to help you understand the book and complete your reading log.
If one of your friends is reading the book or has read it, talk with them about the book.
Try explaining what you are confused about to an older sibling, parent, or friend. They may be able to answer your question.

, You want your log to be as neat as possible so that it is easy for your teacher to check and review. If you’ve already kept notes and recorded your reading, this will be a quick and easy step., If you procrastinated and waited until the last minute to read, it’s probably tempting to adjust the times and page numbers on your reading log so you seem like you followed directions and didn’t procrastinate. This approach, however, will likely get you in trouble with your teacher.


Teachers are savvy and will probably realize you didn’t get through as many pages as you indicated on the log in such a short amount of time.
Keep in mind that the average adult reading speed is 300 words per minute, so if your reading log reflects you are reading more quickly than this, it will be a red flag to your teacher. Indicating that you read 30 pages in 30 minutes or 20 pages in 20 minutes also looks suspicious.
If the book is difficult to read or on a higher grade level, keep in mind that your teacher will probably expect you to spend more time reading the book.

, Most reading logs usually have a place for parents to verify the information and then provide a signature. Forgetting this step may mean you won’t receive full credit for your log.If you are rushed or didn’t really do the reading, you may feel tempted to forge your parent’s signature, but it’s not worth getting in trouble over. You will have to do the reading log again in the future, and your parents and the teacher will likely be able to tell if you falsified the information.

, If you are having any difficulties completing the log or keeping up with the regular reading, it’s important to talk with your teacher so they can help you strategize about how to complete the log and resolve any problems you may be experiencing.Depending on the circumstances, they may be willing to provide extra time for you to complete the reading.
They may also be able to recommend a reading tutor who can help you improve your reading skills.

See an eye doctor.,
Decide what you want to read about.,
Don't allow public or peer pressure to choose your reading material.,

Make yourself comfortable.,
Take care of other priorities before you sit down to read.,
Give it a really good try.,
Sprint, rather than marathon.,
Don't read alone.,
Join a book club.,
Consider an e-reader.,
Read when you have time.,
Treat yourself (in moderation) when you read.,
Recommend your favourite books to other readers, and get together to talk about them.",How to Make Reading a Pleasant Habit," There's nothing like an eyestrain headache to lay your reading plans to waste.;
, You'll be much more motivated to read if you choose a book or magazine that you actually have some interest in. Check out the staff picks at some local bookstores, read book reviews in a magazine that interests you, ask some friends and family what they recommend and why, or pick your favourite TV genre and ask a librarian to recommend a book in a similar style. Make sure the subject is interesting to you.

, It doesn't matter if ""everyone's reading it."" If you have no interest in a vampire love story, don't choose to read one. If you have no interest in football, don't choose a football player's biography. Choose what you are actually, personally interested in. If you try, but find that you don't care that much for fiction (novels, such as ""Twilight"" or the Harry Potter books), try biographies or informational books. You can read about political personalities, Hollywood celebrities, royalty; you can read about World War II, or Genghis Khan, or the Civil War. You can read about how to prune trees, how to cook, different dog breeds. Or you can choose to read classics such as ""A Christmas Carol"" or ""Moby Dick."" There are all sorts of books to choose from. Choose one you want to read, not one all your friends are reading (unless you really are interested).

, It should be quiet, comfortable, and designed to make you feel relaxed.

, Some people like to lie on a couch. Some people like to sit in a chair. Some like to use an ottoman to prop their feet up, some like to sit at a table and lay the book down when they read. Whatever makes your reading effortless and comfortable is what you should do. There are little laptop tables with swiveling tops that you can angle for a reading surface. Sitting in a chair with your book on a table at a comfortable angle and distance can help you focus on the book rather on your arms getting tired from holding the book at the proper angle, or your hands going to sleep.

, If you've never been able to settle into reading easily, you will make it that much more difficult if your mind is blazing over errands you still need to run today, work you need to do, or calls you need to make. Accomplish these things first, then read. A quiet mind will have more resources to dedicate to imagination.

, If you have trouble imagining what you're reading, practice closing your eyes and describing a daydream to yourself while you picture it in vivid detail. If you only have trouble with this one book, ditch it. There's no point torturing yourself. Every book is not for every reader.

, Read in bursts if this is more your style. Rather than try to read a book from cover to cover over a weekend, take a break every now and then to stretch, snack, listen to a song, sleep, and think or talk about what you're reading.

, Find a reading buddy to read funny stories out loud with.

, When others are reading the same book you are, the group always needs to slow down to accommodate all schedules and all reading speeds. This way, your group may read a chapter or two per week - or maybe you will agree to meet in a month, after you have all finished the book you've agreed to read. Then you can discuss things you liked, disliked, were confused about, and also talk about the meanings and significance of the things you've read.

, A wide variety of e-reader and reading apps for smartphones and tablets will let you read whatever book you want in a digital format.





, If you're an avid Internet user, you might often come across interesting lengthy posts or articles that you currently don't have time to read. Special software like the Pocket app or the Reading List feature in the Safari browser lets you save the material for further offline reading.

, Have a chocolate, compliment yourself for meeting a goal, read something erotic, do something that you already consider a pleasant habit.

, Call your brother and/or sister and encourage them to read the book you are enjoying. Tell them to hurry and read it so you can talk with them about it! Sharing the reading love is a great way to make reading a pleasant habit.

Take a break.,
Start with something light.,
Read short stories.,
Listen to books instead.,
Find a comfortable reading space.",How to Like Reading Again1," Take a few days to pursue other activities, such as art projects, exercise, or even just catching up on your favorite TV show. If you can work in some light reading into the mix, it might help you ease back into the process, but you shouldn’t worry about taking some time off to pursue other hobbies.;
, Read the newspaper with your morning coffee or follow a blog. Try a magazine or a graphic novel. These can be read in short bursts, but you are still exercising your reading muscle. Just reading a little bit everyday will encourage a habit. , After you’ve been reading light material for a few days, you can work your way up to short stories and essays. You can find an anthology at the bookstore, prowl through literary magazines, or find a website where authors post their stories for free. Short stories have the same type of narrative as books, but they can be read in one sitting.


If you prefer non-fiction, find an anthology of essays or look for creative non-fiction. These are written like fiction but are often autobiographical stories about the author's own life.

, Try listening to an audio book or a podcast. While it may not replace reading itself, it can engage you with stories, narration, and plot. You can listen as you go about your daily activities, such as cleaning, cooking, or exercising.

, A good reading space has a low noise level, ample lighting, and comfortable seating. Some people enjoy reading at home on their bed or couch. Others go out to cafes or parks. Try reading in a few different places to mix things up. The most important thing is that you enjoy the space.

Turn off devices.,
Use noise-cancelling headphones.,
Meditate.,
Sit up.,
Caffeinate.,
Visit a psychiatrist.",How to Read a Book when You Are Restless or Tired1," One of the most serious obstacles to focusing in the modern world is the constant temptation to surf and text. A distracting phone notification can take time away from reading, cause you to lose your place, or even cause you to forget what was happening in the book. Turn off your phone and computer. Move to a distant location where you won’t be tempted to use them., We are biologically wired so that loud noises and bright lights will break our attention; this is a relic of a time when we needed to be constantly vigilant about predators. To prevent these interruptions, we should try to block out unanticipated noises. Earplugs can do this, but most people will find headphones more pleasant.


If you're using headphones, it's important that the music you listen to is not itself distracting. This will vary from person to person, but often the optimal music for these purposes is soft, without lyrics, and fairly repetitive., Meditation has been shown to expand parts of the brain involved in conscious focus.When meditating, focus on one thing, preferably your breathing, and try to shut out the rest of the world. Do this for a few minutes per day to improve your concentration and possibly for a minute before you begin to read, to get you primed to concentrate., You may like to lie down when you read, but that certainly won't help you stay awake. Exercise good posture. Sit straight up. Keep your knees parallel to your hips. Let your feet rest flat on the floor.One study has shown that students that sit up perform better on tests than those who slouch. Good posture may help you focus, and it'll also help prevent getting aches and pains from being hunched over a book., Caffeine can help you concentrate on what you’re doing, give you energy, and keep you awake.It can even help alleviate focus problems caused by ADHD.If you are not used to caffeine, try some green tea so that you don’t become over-caffeinated. Otherwise, a cup of coffee should help.


Caffeine works best if you do not overuse it. It is ideal to have one dose of caffeine per day, whenever you most need to concentrate., If you consistently have trouble reading, you might suffer from ADHD. Visit a psychiatrist and honestly describe your symptoms. If he believes that you do suffer from ADHD, he will likely prescribe you medication that can help you concentrate.Don’t try to diagnose yourself before going to the psychiatrist. Suggestion can be powerful; it is easy to convince yourself that you have the symptoms of ADHD and end up giving your psychiatrist a skewed perspective on what you are experiencing.

, Books will normally display a few positive reviews on the back, but you can also find a wide range of reviews online and in magazines. Websites will have star ratings with opinions from critics and casual readers alike. These websites can also recommend books that are similar to books you might have enjoyed in the past.


Also look for book review blogs. If you find a blogger who has enjoyed the same books as you, they can help you identify new books you might enjoy.

, Start reading books again with a genre you enjoy, whether it is science fiction, political thrillers, or crime novels. It will help you move back into reading more easily.

Learn to scan the text.,
Write reviews of what you read.,
Look up things that you don’t understand.,
Annotate your books.",How to Like Reading Again3," You don’t have to read every word that is on the page. Scanning allows you to pick up the important material while not stumbling over every minute detail. Scanning can help you enjoy reading again by helping you bypass the tedious parts of the text. , After you finish a book, graphic novel, or story, write a short summary in which you state what you liked and didn’t like about the novel. Summarize what the book was about and what the author was trying to convey. This exercise will help you process what you just read, and it will help you realize what parts of reading you enjoy.


If you’d like, you can post these reviews to a book review website or your own blog. Other readers can give you feedback, and you will find a network of people who also enjoy reading the same books. This may boost your enjoyment of the activity and of the text.

, Sometimes, there are difficult concepts and words in a book. Don’t be afraid to look them up. Understanding such things will speed up your reading and increase the satisfaction you receive from the text.

, Using a pencil, underline interesting sentences in the book. Mark points where you were shocked, excited, or saddened. Scribble down predictions of what might happen. This process of actively reading will increase your investment in the text. It will also increase reading comprehension and memory. You may want to erase the marks before the next person reads it.


If you do not want to write inside a book, you can use adhesive notes to stick in the page. "

Figure out why you are reading.,
Underline or highlight.,
Take notes.,
Reframe headers.,
Stop and think at the end of a chapter.,
Use your finger.,
Read aloud.",How to Read a Book when You Are Restless or Tired2," Having a purpose will help you focus. Ask if there is a specific type of question you want answered. If you are reading fiction, ask what the theme of the book is. For history, ask why it matters to the present day. If you are reading for class, think about what your teacher will want to know. Try to answer these questions as you read., Once you know what you are looking for, take note of it when you find it. Underline or highlight text that is relevant. This will help you find it in the future, but it also forces you to ask yourself throughout what the most important parts of the book are.


Be selective. If you highlight everything then you aren’t really focusing on what is important., When you come across an important idea, write a short note to the side of the text in the margins. This will force you to engage with the ideas and leave some record for you to go back to. A short note is usually enough to interact with the text without taking up too much time., Headers are a good clue as to what the text is about. Pay close attention to them. Reframe them as a question and while you read through the chapter, then try to answer that question.


For example, if the header is, “The Attitude of the Founding Fathers toward the Government” ask yourself “What was the attitude of the founding fathers toward government?”

, Most people can only maintain an optimal level of focus for about fifty minutes, meaning that regular breaks are important.The end of a chapter is a good place to stop, because it usually concludes a major idea. Write some notes at the end of the chapter, describing the major ideas and/or events of the chapter. Relax for five to ten minutes.


Do something pleasant during your break, like drinking a cup of hot chocolate or playing a short game. This will give you some incentive to focus and finish up the chapter.

, To keep your place and your focus, scan your finger along the text as you read. Keep your figure directly under what you are reading. This step should only be necessary if you find it difficult to keep your place., If you are still having trouble focusing, try reading aloud. This will require you to process the text more and make it harder to lose your focus or fall asleep."

Remember your reading rights.",How to Force Yourself to Read Novels if You're Too Busy and Dislike Reading," Is it because you don't read well? Are you easily distracted? Do you read slowly? You may need to simply keep reading (reading takes practice), give yourself time (slow readers can still enjoy reading), and give yourself a quiet space.;
, If you have a choice, find a book that you'll enjoy. This is an age in which there are novels on every conceivable topic.



Librarians can help you find a book that's of interest to you. You may be surprised how enthusiastic, knowledgeable, and helpful librarians are on a number of books.






Better bookstore staff often can offer guidance. Often, top selections for genres are displayed...usually these have broad appeal.
In a given category (young adult literature, romances, historical fiction, sports writing, etc.) there are lists of top selling or highest recommended books. This can be found at places like Amazon.com, The New York Times Bestsellers list, and more. If something sells well, it's probably good.

, Try books that appeal to a large age range, as they are time tested, usually reasonably easy to read, and fun. English language suggestions: Charlotte's Web, The Harry Potter Series, The Chronicles of Narnia, Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass

, There are a lot of novels that aren't traditional books: graphic novels, or Japanese manga, for instance, may be more your taste.

, One of the biggest things that prevents many people from reading is their mindset. Instead of thinking thoughts like, ""I can't read well"" or ""I read too slow"", focus on the positive aspects of reading. Reading allows you to process thoughts faster and to learn and explore different ideas and cultures.

, Read the back cover or inside front cover. Both, if possible. Figure out the basic plot of the story. If there isn't any information on the book covers, Google it. Watch out for spoilers, though!

, Your reading nook should be somewhere quiet where you can concentrate without distractions. Try to avoid rooms where loud talking and electronic noises could mess with your ability to comprehend what you're reading. If you can't find a place in your house to read, try the library, a cafe or coffee, or better yet, the great outdoors! Beaches on lazy summer days make just as great of a place to read as your own backyard does!

, Set aside time for reading. But make this reasonable for you. For one person it may be 15 minutes, for another an hour--there's no perfect amount. But be sure it's enough time to make it useful to forward the story, but not so long you get restless, bored, or fatigued.

, If this is true of you, realize you are using time as an excuse...the TV, computer, game console, or cell phone can wait.

, The reward could be a monetary gift, such as a dollar in a little jar. When you complete your book, you will have enough for a night out with your friends, or to go out to dinner. Or, fill a jar with 10 or 20 marbles. For every hour you read, take out a marble. When you finish the book, count how many marbles are left. The fewer marbles missing the better. Mark a certain reward before finishing, and see what you've earned!

, You might be an individual that process books better through listening than with reading...and that's perfectly OK. It's understanding and enjoying the novel that matters, not whether you read it or heard it. A bonus is that you can listen while driving, cleaning the house, and other places reading won't work.

, Unless you are reading a particular novel for an assignment, remember that you don't have to read a book you find boring, offensive, or confusing. This is something you are doing for fun. Try your best, but don't give up reading completely just because one book ruins the experience.


Many bookstores, communities, libraries, and more have book discussion groups. It can really be motivating to keep you with a book, help your understanding of a novel, and meet new people. Some groups are specific (Oprah book club, teen groups, science fiction fans, graphic novels, mothers, and more.) If you happen to be a student, this can really help you in your literature classes in school!

Take public transportation.,
Read to your children.",How to Fit Reading Into Part of Your Daily Life1," The average American spends 608 hours a year on social media and 1642 hours watching television. At an average reading speed, you could read hundreds of books a year if you simply devoted the time that you currently spend on Facebook and TV to reading.The first step toward doing this is changing your environment. Keep books near you at home. Don’t keep a television in your room. Keep your cellphone far away from you and erase distracting apps.;
, Habits are self-reinforcing. If you get accustomed to a schedule, you are likely to stick to it. So, schedule an hour or two every evening to do some reading and decompress after a hard day.Consider taking an hour to read just before going to bed. Watching TV and being on your computer before bed can make it harder to sleep. Spending the last hour of the day reading instead can both help you grow intellectually and get a better night’s sleep., If you make up thirty minutes earlier than you normally would in the morning, you could use that time to get some reading done. Cracking a book in the morning can be a good way to way to clear your mind before starting your day., If you always have a book available, you can read in short spurts for 10 to 30 minutes when you have some downtime. If you can find a few times throughout the day when you can devote a little bit of time to reading, it’ll ultimately add up.


Consider, for example, keeping a book in your backpack. That way, when you have a few spare moments at work or school, you can get some reading done.
Also, keep a book in the bathroom., While it isn’t quite the same as reading, audiobooks do allow you to experience some of the great books of classical literature, without taking any time off from what you’re doing. You can listen to an audiobook in the car or while walking. This can make your commute both more edifying and entertaining., There are several tablets and specialized reading devices on the market. With these, you can bring an entire library in your backpack and always have something interesting to read when you get a spare moment.


Tablets, however, can also have apps that will distract you when you read. If you need help focusing, delete these apps.

, You shouldn’t try to read while driving, but public transit is a different story. Taking the train or the bus frees up time that you can use for reading. Bring a book with you and try to get some reading done on your commute., Reading books to your children is a great way to expand their creativity and literary abilities. But, reading time can double as both good parenting and an opportunity to expand your own knowledge. Consider literature like the works of Mark Twain, which can be as enriching for adults as it is for children.

Many public libraries now allow their cardholders to download electronic audiobooks to personal MP3 players. Alternatively, you can buy audio books on CDs or specialized MP3 players. You could also buy the audio version of a book you already own.;
, That way, you will have it with you when you have a few moments of reading that you can slip in.


Buy a pocket version of a book, such as the Barnes and Noble Pocket Classics. These are cheap, small and can fit in your purse or back pocket.
Read or listen while you are waiting or on line for something. Read or listen on your lunch break at work, or even during breakfast.
If you are a college student, read a book between classes instead of the school newspaper.
Pick books for ease of reading and/or interest level. Even if you do enjoy involved reading during quiet times at home, a crowded airport might not be conducive to the level of focus required to absorb it.

, The elliptical trainer, arc trainer and stationary bike all accommodate book reading, and some gyms have book holders to hold reading material for those who want to read during their workout. Then you will get smarter and fitter simultaneously, and your workout will become more enjoyable at the same time.

,, Books and audio books make great traveling companions.

, These can protect it from wear and damage.

, This can encourage deeper thought and analysis of the book, or help to remember the plot line if you can't read it often.

, This can give you more incentive to finish the book by a certain time. People give you more time to sit and read if you tell them you have to read the book for a book group.

, If you are very busy, you're less likely to finish that 600 page literary epic.

, If you don't like what you are reading and it's not required, read something else. There's no law that says you can't abandon a book just because you don't like it. If you do love a book, you're more likely to return to it and you'll probably finish it faster.

, Opportunities like these make reading a part of your everyday routine, and they take advantage of times when your mind is most flexible and your life is probably quiet.

Read in the bathtub (but keep a towel handy so the books don't get wet). If you're no good at keeping books dry in the tub, read a magazine or newspaper instead.

, It's a great opportunity to spend some quiet time together. You could also read aloud to each other.

, If all you have time for is a page or two today, just read that much. It might be enough to get you into the story, or to keep you going until a day when you have more time.

, Start by reading at the pace that feels natural to you. You'll naturally speed up with practice.

Set a goal.,
Find a genre that you like.,
Vary your reading material.,
Read what you want to read, not what you think you need to read.,
Join a book club.,
Find what you value about reading.",How to Fit Reading Into Part of Your Daily Life2," Plan to read a book every two weeks or finish a chapter every day. Once you have the goal, just rearrange your time to ensure that you meet it. Reward yourself with a nice meal or a good movie if you meet your goals., Go to the library and explore your options. Read the back of the book, the prologue, or just the first page and see if you like it. Ask friends who like to read what books they enjoyed and why. Keep looking until you find a book that is good for you.


Often it takes a while to get into a book, but if you have made it through the first fifty pages and still aren’t interested, consider moving on. Getting stuck on a book that you don’t like can hold you back from reading., Reading books from the same genre can get old with time. Though, you might think you know what you like to read, there are plenty of genres that you haven’t tried yet. Experimenting with a new genre might introduce you to something that will revitalize your desire to read.If you have been reading a lot of non-fiction, try some fiction.
If you typically only read classic novels, try some modern fiction.
Maybe you historically prefer fantasy novels, but it never hurts to try some detective literature. Sherlock Holmes always makes for a good read.

, Reading can become a tiresome habit if you’re always reading as if it were a responsibility. Nonfiction can teach you a lot about the world around you, but so too can a good story. High literature can be edifying, but if tough writing is making it hard for you to pick up the book, consider moving on to something light and easy., Find friends or family that are interested in reading the same books with you. Then set a schedule to meet once every week or two weeks to talk about what you have read. Having a deadline will give you the incentive to finish up on time. Doing it with other people can make reading a fun social activity that brings you closer to your loved ones.If you don’t want to go out of your way to create your own book club, see if you can find one that already meets. Meetup.com can be a good way to find likeminded social groups, including book clubs interested in your favorite genres.

, You should find some reason inside you that gives you the motivation to finish books. That motivation can vary from person to person. But, once you’ve found, it your reading schedule should fall into place because you will want to make it work.


Maybe you want to be smarter than your peers and know that you can show off your intelligence better if you do a lot of reading.
Maybe you want to fix the world and know that you can only accomplish that if you know more about how the world works.
Maybe you want to make money and know that a good idea can be very lucrative. "

Remember that reading quickly is a skill.",How to Finish Your Summer Reading," Go over your reading list and figure out exactly what books you need to read over the summer. Then make a list with the title of each book, and the number of pages that each one has. Finally, read the book jackets, or look online and find a quick summary of each book so you have some idea of what each one is about.


You may want to mark books your are excited about with a cross or plus-sign next to the title, and books that seem less desirable with a circle or a minus-sign. When you plan your reading schedule, alternate between books you are eager to read and those you dread. Putting off all of the books that you don’t want to read until the very end is the surest way not to get them done.;
, You can do so if you weren’t assigned a reading list but feel like you would like to do some summer reading to keep your mind fresh, or prepare for college. Ask a teacher or librarian for guidance, or go online for suggestions.


UC Berkeley publishes a summer reading list intended for incoming freshman and other reading enthusiasts.The American Library Association also publishes summer reading lists for younger children.

, If you are going to buy the books on your reading list, order them as soon as possible. If you are going to check books out from the library, remember that they may not all be there exactly when you want them, so start early, and be willing to reorder your list based on what is available.


Consider sharing books with friends in the same class. This will require a little more planning, but can really cut down on costs.
Think about buying electronic copies of your books so you can read them on an e-reader or your phone, and take them wherever you go.

, Are you normally the one who works on things a bit at a time, or do you usually finish assignments in brief flurries of activity right before they are due? You are not likely to magically change your productivity style, especially over the summer, so make a plan that works for you.

, Get out a planner, or make yourself a calendar showing the days until school starts. If you have any vacations or special activities planned, mark those in. You might still be able to read during those times, but you might read less. Then decide on an order that you will tackle your books, and write out a schedule based on your productivity style.


If you tend to be steady and methodical about the way you do things, plan to read a set number of pages each day. Calculate the total number of pages you need to read, and the number of reading days you have, and then divide the first by the second. Write this daily reading target on your calendar, and try to meet it every day.
If you tend to procrastinate and do homework in binges, a better approach is to set a fixed deadline for each book. For instance, you might plan to finish Old Man and the Sea no later than July 1, and Fahrenheit 451 by July 20, and so on. You should still try to read every day, but even if you end up staying up late to read each book the night before it’s “due,” at least you’ll be getting them done.

, A great way to motivate yourself to complete a difficult task is to plan rewards for finishing various steps along the way. Think about activities you can do to reward yourself every time you finish a book, or when you get the whole list done. Maybe you can go to a movie, or buy a new CD when you finish a book, or give yourself a day off to play video games or just do nothing.


Ask your parents to help. See if they will consider giving you an allowance bonus every time you finish a book, or some kind of extra privilege.
Capitalize on summer reading incentive programs. Local libraries and business often have summer programs that reward students for reading with prizes and raffles. There are also some national programs run by private companies that you might be eligible for.Be sure to mix up your list so you aren’t saving all of the books that you are really dreading until the end. Leaving the book you are most excited about reading until last can help you stay motivated through books that are less appealing.

, Of course, one of the great things about reading is that you can do it almost anytime and almost anywhere. But if you are not excited about what you are reading, it can help to set a designated time that you will get it done. Set your alarm, or create a reminder on your phone for “reading time,” and when it goes off, get your book out and get going.


Plan manageable blocks of time. If you read for an hour or more in one sitting, include short breaks to get up and stretch every twenty minutes or so.
Mix it up. You don’t always have to read in the same place. If it’s a nice day, try reading outside. If you are bored of reading in your house, try the library or a local coffee shop, instead.

, You never know when an opportunity to read might arise. You might get stuck waiting at the dentist’s office for half an hour, or arrive at swimming practice twenty minutes early. If you have your book with you, you can take advantage of this time, and get something accomplished.


E-books make this even easier, since you can read your book right on your cellphone.

, Regardless of how you wrote out your schedule, the best way to get your list done is to read a little bit every day. Not only does this help you make your way through the list, it also keeps you from forgetting what was going on in your book and from wasting time by re-reading.

, If you are working through an assigned reading list, chances are good that you will either be tested on what you have read, or have to write about it in an assignment. Taking notes will help you remember what you have read. You probably don’t need extremely detailed notes, but some basics to keep track of, including the names of the major characters, a bit about what they are like, and a brief summary of the events in each chapter., If you get off schedule or miss one of your deadlines, your workload can quickly pile up to the point that it feels impossible. If you get behind, cancel some other activities if you need to and get caught up as soon as possible. You will thank yourself come August.

, If your book contains words that you do not know, don’t guess; look them up in the dictionary! If you are having trouble understanding the plot of the story, ask around and see if anyone you know has read it and can help, or look for a study guide online or at the library.


Reading a study guide can help, but it’s no substitute for actually reading the book.

, If you know someone else who is reading the same book, meet up a few times to talk about what you are reading and compare notes. When you are both done reading, consider watching the most recent movie based on the book, if there is one. You can then discuss how it differed from the book and which one you liked better, and commiserate over the ordeal you have been through.

, It can be hard to get excited about compulsory reading assignments, but remember that most of the books on your list were chosen because they are really good. Ignore the fact that you are being forced to read the books on your list, and try to let yourself enjoy the experience. You might be pleasantly surprised at how fun and interesting this kind of homework can be.

, It’s hard to read quickly if you are distracted or uncomfortable. Reading in a quiet, well-lit environment will help you focus on your book better, and help you remember what you read, so you won’t have to take extra time to reread. Turn off the TV, put away the tablet, and silence your phone. Then make sure you have adequate lighting and a comfortable seat to read in.Some people find that listening to music helps them concentrate, while others find it too distracting. Experiment with both to find what works for you. Instrumental tracks are usually best.
Using noise cancelling headphones, and/or listening to a white noise recording can really help you concentrate in a noisy environment. There are many free white noise recordings available online., Your eyes dart around a great deal when you read, and every time they shift focus, and then have to find again the right place in the text, it wastes valuable time. Using either your index finger, or a rule as a pointer can eliminate this problem. Just place your pointer directly under the line of text you are on, and slide it down the page as you progress. Using a pointer might feel like it’s slowing you down at first, but once you get the hang of it, you should notice a drastic improvement in your reading speed.

, Many people either silently mouth the words they are reading, or imagine the sounds of each word in their head as they read it. This is called “ indirect vocalizing,” and while it is a great way to savor a well-written novel or poem, it makes for slow going. To get through material in a hurry, try to stop spelling. You will be amazed at how much faster you can read.Try chewing gum to stop spelling. This keeps your mouth busy, and prevents you from reading under your breath. You could also chew on a straw or toothpick, or other nonhazardous item.
Humming softly may also help some people stop spelling, but it may distract you more. Give it a try for a page or two and see if it helps.

, Get a stopwatch, or use a timer app on your phone, and figure out how long it takes you to read one page at your normal pace. Then set a timer for 30 seconds less than that time (so if it took you five minutes to read your first page, set your timer for four minutes, 30 seconds) and try to get through each of the following pages under that time. Once the new time becomes manageable, shave another 30 second off of your time, and so on.Reading quickly is more about concentration than anything else, and using a timer is an excellent way to trick yourself into concentrating better by turning reading into a race.
Practice makes perfect. You may want to use the timer for a few days, but eventually you will no longer need it, as you will have trained yourself to read more quickly and efficiently without it.

, There are dozens of free or low-cost courses and apps that are designed to teach you to read more quickly and efficiently. Most of these are based on one of a handful of tried and tested methods, and while you may never learn to read 1000 words per minute, as some courses advertise, you can still learn techniques that will significantly improve your reading speed and help you get through not just this summer reading list, but the ever-increasing amount of stuff you will be assigned in the future., It is not something that most people can do inherently or not, it is an ability that must be learned and can easily be improved with practice. The more you read, the easier it will get, and the faster it will go. By the end of summer, you should be zooming through that pile of books !


If you are really struggling and cannot seem to improve, a learning issue like dyslexia may be slowing you down. Talk to a school counselor, parent or doctor about getting screened. You may need to learn special techniques, or get help from teachers creating more reasonable deadlines."

Plan a reading session.,
Choose an environment you enjoy.,
Have what you may need with you.,
Caffeinate.,
Use a bookmark.,
Choose your own adventure.,
Recognize the value of the book’s content.,
Make it social.,
Read a comparable or contradictory account.,
Grind through the rough spots.,
Recall why you’re reading this book.,
Read the book's summary.,
Accept and embrace the task at hand.",How to Finish a Boring Book," Choose a location, and either an amount of time you want to spend reading or a number of pages you hope to finish. Don’t try to read the rest of the book in one go. Provide yourself a mental map of what your brain is seeking to accomplish – in terms of the literal tangible task at hand. This will keep you from being overwhelmed by how much you have left to read.


Keep reading at the end of your reading session if you feel like it.
If you fail to make the time to read the book, you won’t ever finish it!
Assign yourself one or two chapters a day. Complete them, and the reading will feel lighter and more rewarding.;
, Find somewhere quiet, well-lit, and with fresh air. Avoid anywhere that makes you feel restless. Don’t think that locking yourself in the library will automatically make you productive; some of us are better able to focus when leaning against a tree in the park. If you are indoors, find somewhere clean and organized.


Avoid distractions. Don’t read within sight of a television or computer. Turn your phone off, if possible.

, Have both blank paper and a writing utensil to take down notes, realizations, or points of inspiration. Have water and a healthy snack. Nuts are a great option, as is fruit. Natural sugars, such as those you can get from an apple or orange, will give you a short-term boost in mental ability, including memory., Coffee and tea can work wonders on your ability to focus. Don’t overdo it, as too much caffeine can make you uncomfortable and distracted.Different types of coffee and methods of preparation offer different amounts of caffeine.The same is true of tea, which comes in a greater variety of flavors and is a healthier option.Be conscious of caffeine’s other effects on your body, including those with potential health ramifications. Do not drink more than 400mg of caffeine per day., Mark your place clearly. Struggling to find where you left off can lead to starting your reading session in a distractedly frustrated mindset. Easily finding your spot makes it easier to pick up the book and get right into a productive reading session.


Use something you feel positively about – especially a photo or written quote that motivates you.

, If you’re reading a story, pretend you are the protagonist. Change it up and pretend you’re the antagonist. You can even pretend you’re a minor (or made-up) character observing the scenario from within the story. Relate to what is happening to the characters, however you are able to do so.

, If you’re reading more technical material, pause when you’re not understanding something. Re-read a paragraph you didn’t fully understand. Comprehending more the second time will re-invigorate both your enjoyment of the text and your motivation to continue reading.


Look up words and concepts you don’t recognize. New tendrils of thought and knowledge will increase your attachment to the text you’re reading.
Appreciate that you’re learning from the book, and take pride in doing so.

, Ask friends if they have read the book. If they have, ask them about the book, the story, the plot, the concepts considered, etc. Knowing that someone else has read or is reading the same book makes the act of reading feel more communal, and this can motivate you to continue reading.

, Read a different account of the same issue, a different perspective, or a different story set in the same time period or context. Comparing and contrasting what these other texts say with what you’ve already read can renew your interest in the book you want to get through. Don’t read too much of another book, only enough to add to your understanding or interest in the book you want to get through.

, If you’ve commit to reading a book, don’t let what might just be a boring patch throw you off course. Remind yourself that a less interesting part may be setting the tone for something important or interesting later on.

, Ask yourself: “Why am I reading this?” An important distinction here is whether your reading out of obligation or for pleasure. These different situations dictate entirely different types of reading. In the context of obligation, remind yourself of the reasons why you must read the book. This alone will increase your focus and willingness to continue reading.


Determine whether you truly want or need to finish it. If this is obligatory reading, could you read a summary instead, or just read certain parts?
If you are reading for pleasure, but are no longer enjoying the book, re-evaluate your desire to continue. Recognize that people quite frequently don’t finish books.If you don’t want to finish it, don’t!

, If you’re committed to reading a dry or technical book, conceptualize the broader picture. What is the book about? Is there something at a later stage of the book that is of interest to you? Make yourself aware of what the book has to offer. This will compel you to keep reading.


Use SparkNotes or CliffsNotes. These websites or publications can provide key information about a book, and can potentially offer the information you’re looking for. Do not depend on these summaries to offer the same depth or insight offered by the book itself. Use this step only when you are willing to make do with a partial understanding of the book’s content.

, Consider the words of author David Foster Wallace, who often write about the mundane and boring aspects of human life: “Bliss—a-second-by-second joy and gratitude at the gift of being alive, conscious—lies on the other side of crushing, crushing boredom.”Wallace’s editor spoke of how the author sought to explore boredom, not only because it is a inevitable aspect of reality, but because it can lead to joy.A moment of increased awareness or discovery may be on the very next page!

An example of a good purpose is, ""Experience this character's feelings during the course of this book"" or ""Figure out exactly what I don't know about this subject.""
Setting a purpose ""activates"" your brain. When you have a clear purpose, your brain searches for all the references and ideas it can that will help you achieve your purpose.;
, Peaceful and quiet places will help you focus on the book. If you're in a crowded place, you will be distracted or disturbed by the things that are going around you. Also, make sure your place has a lot of light so you'll be able to see the words clearly.

, Make sure it's comfortable and has good lighting. A small table nearby is handy. You can even add a small box full of book favorites by the couch.

, If you want to be a successful reader, it's recommended you turn off electronics while you are reading, unless you're using device such as a Kindle. This will distract you a lot and you will not be able to focus. Not only electronics, but anything else that might distract you and make you unable to read.

, Make sure you have a book that's just right for you. If you like comedy, get a funny book. If you like fantasy, get a book about fairy tales or fantasy. If you get a book that's not right for you, you may lose interest in the book and won't want to read it.


Reading a small section of a book is helpful for deciding its value to you. If you're thinking of buying a book, why not head to your local library and check it out? Different genres appeal to different readers, so browse around.
You might prefer an audiobook.

, There is a difference between giving the book a chance and being halfway through the book and still hating the story or information it depicts. If you think you are not enjoying a book that you have picked stop reading it, because if you keep on at it, it will put you off reading. Try a different book that you might enjoy more.


If you found it boring because it was too hard, try an easier one. Or vice versa, if you wish to challenge yourself more.

, Imagine what the characters are feeling and what their next moves might be before you find out what the author actually has them do.

, If Junie B. Jones was making mischief, would you make the situation brighter or dimmer?

, Your version doesn't have to match what the author describes exactly, and it's okay if they have the face of somebody you know.

, Pick some delicious food such as parfaits, salad, fruit smoothie, or even chopped up fruit. This trick can raise your mood. A special drink is nice, too - hot chocolate, lemonade, tea, etc.

, If it is a rainy day, cuddle up with a blanket and a favorite stuffed animal. It will make you feel appreciated.

, Example: In that situation, I would... If you remember a similar situation think about what you did in it, and compare to a character's decision.

, Reading makes you a lot smarter. If you read every once in a while, you may forget about it and not continue reading.

Enhanced smarts. This one is rather obvious, but studies show that people who read earn higher GPA's, have higher intelligence and just more general knowledge.
Reduced stress. Fiction is perfect for this. After a long day at school, a good book, a cup of tea, and a comfy place to read are super relaxing.
Better vocabulary. Reading improves language more than talking or direct teaching. It gets you to look at words that you might not hear at school.
Improves your critical thinking. Studies have shown that reading improves your ability to spot patterns, which helps you think and figure out things much easier.;
, Some people like romances, some like sci-fi, and there are hundreds of teenage drama-type books.


Consider a game book if you like fantasy or mystery and don't fancy reading from beginning to end.

, If you aren't big on reading, you probably shouldn't choose a 500+ page book.


Consider an audiobook. These are great if you have vision problems or are on a long car trip. One great choice is Neil Gaiman's ""The Graveyard Book,"" read by the author.

, Look through the books that the library has.

, If you don't like it, try a different genre, or maybe something shorter.

You could also go online to a book review site like goodreads.com.

, Maybe you and your friend(s) can read the books together and discuss them later. You could even start a book club.

Lead an alphabet hunt.",How to Build Literacy Skills Through Games1," Put a letter on a magnetic surface and ask your child to identify it. Say a letter and ask your child to put it on the magnetic surface. Take turns and let your child name letters for you to identify and find.


Play these games using the sounds the letters make. For example, ask your child to find the letter that sounds like “essss.”
Your child can use magnetic letters to create words and sentences when they are at a higher literacy level.
Be careful of choking hazards like loose magnets or small letters. Do not leave a small child alone with the letters.;
, Find a space where your child can move around freely. Make capital letters on the floor out of painter’s tape, duct tape, or masking tape. Call out the name of a letter. Have your child move to that letter.When your child moves to the letter, they can say the sound the letter makes or a word that begins with that letter.
Your child can also call out the names of the letters and ask someone else to move to them.

, Say a letter and ask your child to find that letter somewhere in the room where you are playing. For example they can find letters on food packages in your kitchen or in magazines in the doctor’s office. Play this game anyplace your child can find letters, including on street signs around town.


If your child can write, ask them to write down the letter.

Make alphabet dominoes.,
Create an alphabet bingo game.,
Play alphabet bingo with alphabet dice.",How to Build Literacy Skills Through Games2," Cut 2 in x 1 in (5 cm x 2.5 cm) rectangles out of thick paper or cardboard. Draw a line down the center of the rectangle. Write one letter in each space. Make several dominoes.Play with letter dominoes just like you play with standard dominoes.
Have your child say the name of the letter they match to a new domino.

, Divide some pieces of paper into nine equal squares. Draw or paste a simple picture in each square. These are the bingo cards. Write letters on smaller pieces of paper and put them in a cup. These are the tokens. Take a token from the cup and say the letter on it. Your child will find a picture on their bingo card that starts with that letter. They can cover the picture with a marker.


On the bingo cards use very simple pictures that represent one word, for example a bird, umbrella, or tree.
Label the pictures so all players can agree what the picture is. This will also help your child recognize words.
The words in the pictures should all start with a different letter of the alphabet.
Make markers from small pieces of paper or take them from another game you have.

, Fold and glue a piece of paper into a cube. Write a letter of the alphabet on each face of the cube. Make a few dice and write different letters on each. Ask your child to roll the dice. They will say the name of a letter they see on the dice and then find a picture starting with that letter on an alphabet bingo card. They can cover the picture with a marker.


To make one big die using all 26 letters in the English alphabet, write six letters on two of the faces and four letters on the other four faces.
The player can choose which letters on the die to match to a picture on a bingo card.
For more advanced play, the player tries to match the first letter on the die to a picture on the bingo cards. For example, if the die face shows “DGZK,” the player first tries to find a picture that starts with “D.” If all pictures starting with “D” are covered, the player tries to find a picture beginning with “G.” If necessary this continues through “Z” or “K.”

Make a word box.,
Go on a word hunt.,
Get word magnets.,
Create a picture book.,
Design a menu.",How to Build Literacy Skills Through Games3," Get a stack of index cards and write one word on each card. Your child can also write the words. Store the index cards in a shoebox. Make cards with words from stories that you read with your child. Vocabulary and spelling words from school are also good choices for the word box.Spread some of the words on the floor. Give silly commands about how your child should move to the cards, for example, “skip to the word ‘penguin’” or “crawl to the word ‘blue’.”
Ask your child to sort the words into different categories. For example, they can sort them into words for animals (dog, tiger, horse, etc.) or words that make them think about nighttime (stars, moon, sleep, etc.).
Give your child a stack of word cards. Ask them to match the words on the cards to objects in the house. You might let them tape the card to the object.
Play charades with the words in the box. Pull a word from the box and act it out while others try to guess the word.

, Give your child a pad of paper and a pencil when you go on errands. Have them write down words that you ask them to find. For example, you can ask them to find words beginning with the letter “M” or words with seven letters. Or ask them to write down specific things that you buy, like the fruits and vegetables in the grocery store.


Have your child read the list to you and help them correct spelling and pronunciation.

, You can find magnetic word kits at bookstores. Sometimes they have a theme. Use them to practice reading skills, or to create sentences, stories, and poems.


Have your child practice reading the words on the magnets.
Ask your child to sort the magnets into specific groups of words, for example, words that start with the same letters or words that rhyme.
Your child can create the groups and ask you to guess how they sorted the words.
Ask your child to create sentences with the words. You can try to see who can make the longest or silliest sentences.
Have your child write a short story or a poem with the words.

, Write a letter at the top of a piece of paper. Ask your child to draw or glue pictures of words that start with that letter on the paper. Help your child label the words for each picture. Make a page for every letter in the alphabet and bind them together into a book.


Your child can do all of the writing.

, Glue some pictures of food onto a sheet of paper. Help your child label all of the foods on the paper. Next ask them to decorate the paper like a restaurant menu. Play restaurant by asking your child to read the menu and pretend to order from it.You can make menus for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

Block out noise.,
Distance yourself from your phone.,
Find your zen place.,
Reserve reading time.,
Do some pre-reading exercise.,
Have a healthy snack.,
Get more sleep.,
Read some reviews of the book.,
Reward yourself for reading.,
Switch up your reading style.",How to Focus on a Book," Make sure that your surroundings are quiet. Studies have shown that background noise may decrease higher brain function, impairing learning and memory.To focus on your book, find quiet by whatever means necessary- try looking for a secluded spot, wearing earplugs, or reading late at night when most people are sleeping.;
, Studies have shown that smartphones are a great distraction, and that the absence of one when completing a task can make you more than 25% more productive.When you are reading, leave your phone in another room, or tucked away in your pocket or book bag to avoid looking at it. If you are not anticipating any urgent calls or messages, try turning it off altogether.


The same principle applies for television. Having it on in the background is likely to disrupt your focus., Everyone has their own ideal working space, where they can concentrate, relax and be productive.If you already know where you feel best, make a point of setting up there to read. If not, try some of these options for relaxed and focused reading:


Library
A basement, attic, or other quiet room at home
A quiet park
A bookstore
A quiet café or restaurant

, Make space for reading in your busy schedule to avoid worrying about other responsibilities, chores, and activities during that time. Choose a point during the day when you will not be needed by family, friends, or colleagues; if possible, let them know that you will be out of touch during that period. Taking time for yourself- for reading, or anything else you might want to do- is important for psychological and physical health.If your schedule allows, make this reading time a regular weekly, or even daily, event.

, It has been shown that 30-40 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity can greatly improve cognitive clarity.Before picking up a book to read, try going for a run, brisk walk, or bike ride to clear your mind and improve concentration. Consider bringing a book along with you for these types of workouts so that you can read whenever you need a rest.

, Healthy foods can raise energy levels, and thus improve your ability to concentrate throughout the day. Snacks should contain fibre-rich carbohydrates or Omega-3 fats, which can also support memory and concentration.Try stocking up on some of these snacks for your reading time:


Nuts
Fruit
Oatmeal
Pumpkin seeds
Peanut butter
Anything with whole grains

, Studies have shown that getting a sufficient amount of sleep is key for good concentration and memory.Sleepiness can slow down thought processes, increase irritability, and disrupt learning, thereby interfering with your ability to focus on a book. Try to get between 7-9 hours of sleep a night, as is recommended for most adults., Book reviews provide a brief summary, evaluation, and assessment of a book.Look up online reviews of the book you're reading to spark your enthusiasm about it; if the reviews are bad, read the book with the intention of finding positive aspects that surpass the reviewer's opinion. Try to formulate your own review of the book as you read, considering the following critical questions:


What contribution does this book make to the field or genre?Is the writing style clear and effective?Are concepts clearly developed?, If you're having trouble concentrating on a book, offer yourself rewards for finishing chapters, or the entire book. To make this reward system effective, ensure that rewards are realistic, immediate, and specific; your motivation will falter if you can't follow through with the reward, or if it is too vague or far in the future to inspire you.Smaller rewards (for finishing chapters or sections of a book) could include an indulgent snack, or watching an episode of a favorite television show.
Larger rewards (for getting through an entire book) could include an extravagant purchase, a gourmet supper, or a trip to the movies.

, Consider switching how you approach the book in order to revive your interest in reading. If old school books are not your thing, try reading on a digital device. Alternatively, try reading out loud; it has been shown that doing so may help readers retain information better by creating a distinctive memory of what was said.Something as simple as switching from a paperback book to a hardcover book might also increase your enthusiasm about reading.

Get acquainted with sight words.,
Make lists of sight words to be learned.,
Plan individual lessons.,
Set goals for learning.,
Schedule time to read with your child.",How to Teach Your Child Sight Words1," Given that reading likely comes easily to you as an adult, it might be difficult to reacquaint yourself with the process of learning to read that your child is undertaking. Read articles about sight words from reputable online sources or books to better understand how to help your child. In addition, you can talk to your child’s teacher for advice on how to best approach this lesson; collaborating with teachers is a good strategy for optimizing your child’s educational experience., The Dolch word list, compiled by Edward William Dolch and published in 1948, lists the 220 most commonly used words in the English language.The list is divided by grade levels, based on when students are expected to know certain groups of words. Consider the words that are most common in texts geared towards your child's age and make a list of sight words for them to learn, accordingly.


Note that the following sights words are taught in kindergarten: a, am, an, and, are, at, can, do, for, go, has, have, he, here, I, in, is, it, like, look, me, my, no, play, said, see, she, so, the, to, up, we, For each sight word lesson, aim to teach your child three to five words. At the beginning of each new lesson, review the words learned in the last session, then move on to the new ones.Repetition of words is necessary to ensure that the lesson has been absorbed properly; solid knowledge of a few words is better than a weak knowledge of many words., As a general rule, children are expected to learn the Dolch sight words corresponding to their grade level within that academic year; these targeted reading levels range from prekindergarten to grade three.Plan to track your child's learning over the course of the year using a calendar, or a complete list of sight words to be learned during that time. Reward your child for ""mastering"" sight words by marking their progress with colorful stickers or markers.

, Reading with your child is incredibly important for their learning and development; if possible, you should read with them at least once a day.Learning sight words, as an integral part of reading, is just as important. Change up your approach to the lessons, but make sure they occur regularly enough to impact your child’s long-term retention of the words.

Use the “see and say” method.,
Use the “air writing” or “table writing” techniques.,
Practice sight words in context.,
Correct your child’s mistakes in an encouraging way.",How to Teach Your Child Sight Words2," Purchase sight word cards from a department store, bookstore, or office supply store; you can also make your own sight word cards with large index cards and a bold marker, making sure to use large, clear lettering. Have your child read the word out loud while simultaneously underlining it with their finger; this will help your child to focus on the word and memorize it.Make sure to hold the card at your child’s eye level and have them repeat this several times; use the word in a sentence to deepen their comprehension of it.


As an additional step, have your child spell the word out loud with the sight card, then repeat it; this will allow them to memorize how it is constructed.

, The physical act of writing a word helps a child register it cognitively and retain it in their memory. Hold up a sight card and read the word slowly, tracing it in the air or on a table surface; repeat this process, spelling out the word. Help your child repeat these steps; eventually you can attempt the process without the sight card., Recognition of individual sight words should transfer to reading sight words in a full text or narrative; this practice will help your child make the connection between sight words and their meaning. Have them identify sight words within an age-appropriate story or book. In addition, you can ask your child to write out a sentence with a specific sight word in it; if they are too young for this exercise, try writing out sentences for them and allow them to circle the sight words themselves as you say them., Aim to correct your child’s mistakes in the most positive way possible by emphasizing the right answer, as opposed to criticizing the error (e.g. ""You were very close! The answer is AWAY. A-W-A-Y."") Evidence suggests that children actually learn better by making mistakes than by not making them.To correct your child without being negative, remember to:


Let them know that you love them no matter what.Give them examples of some of your own mistakes, and how you learned from them.Praise them for accepting their mistake and trying to learn from it.Don’t bring up their past mistakes; focus on their improvement and resiliency."

Teach sight words with pictures and illustrations.,
Use music to enhance the learning process.,
Play Sight Word Bingo.,
Play the match game.,
Label things around the house.",How to Teach Your Child Sight Words3," Many children learn more efficiently with visual aides. Pictures can help your child make important connections between the word and what it represents; in addition, colorful images help the brain with pattern recognition.Make or purchase sight cards with pictures and the corresponding word, or have your child draw their own pictures for each word.

, Music has been shown to stimulate the brain, so it is a great enhancement to the learning process overall.Try putting together songs with your child to help them remember sight words, and practice them frequently.In addition, try playing instrumental music in the background to stimulate your child’s concentration and energy levels while they practice sight word exercises., Games are a fun way to provide the repetition necessary for your child to learn sight words. Play inspires curiosity, problem-solving, and skill mastery while leaving room for failure and re-attempts.There are many game options to try, such as Sight Word Bingo.


Select the sight words you want your child to practice. Use two squares of paper or cardstock as the Bingo cards, and write nine sight words on each card.
Have your child draw the top card from a stack of sight word cards, then read the sight word.
Players who have the sight word on their Bingo card will place a marker on top of that word.
The first player to have three words covered with markers, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.

, Another fun game to promote your child's comprehension of sight words is the match game. Playing the match game will strengthen your child's memory of sight words.Select the sight words you want your child to practice. Matching cards are needed for each word.
Read the cards with your child and then shuffle them; place all cards face down on a flat surface.
Have your child turn over a card and read the sight word, then turn over a second card and read the sight word. If the sight words match, your child keeps them. If they don't match, your child places them face down. Then take your turn.
Continue alternating turns until all the cards are gone.
Players count their cards and the player with the most cards wins!

, Print the name of household items onto cue cards and attach them to the objects themselves. This will allow your child to make clear associations between words and objects.This will also reinforce the lesson for your child outside of your designated teaching times.

Go online.",How to Be a Good Reader," You can advance to more difficult reading materials from there. If you attempt to read material that is too challenging initially you are more likely to become discouraged. While challenging yourself to read at a more advanced level is a wonderful goal, studies have shown that if you allow yourself to become discouraged while reading you will be less likely to achieve that goal in the long run.Skim the first few pages. If you have trouble understanding what the author is trying to say, you may not enjoy the book.
If you have chosen a book with a very narrow focus, like a scientific work or a specific historical treatise, you might want to instead familiarize yourself with books on more general topics first.
Use the five finger rule. Pick a book, and read the first two or three pages. Put one finger up for every word you can't pronounce or don't know the meaning of. If you've put up 5 or more fingers, the book is probably too hard. Educators have been using this method for years, and it can be applied for children as well as adults.;
, Building a greater vocabulary will make reading easier and more fun in the future. The more words you are exposed to, the more your vocabulary will grow.


If you don't understand a word, first try to use context clues to figure out what it means. Frequently, the rest of the words in a sentence will offer hints about what a particular word means.
Look up words in the dictionary that you do not recognize or understand. Write down these words to review later to solidify them in your memory and make them a part of your vocabulary. Keep of a collection of these words for your own reference.
Use new words you learn in your everyday speech. Putting words into action in your everyday life will ensure that you remember them.

, Studies have shown that people who spend more time reading, and take in a greater volume of reading material, develop a more extensive vocabulary and greater reading comprehension. This improves their ability to take in knowledge more generally.As with anything else, developing reading skills takes work. Set aside time to read every day. Literacy experts disagree about exactly how much time you should devote to reading, given that it varies according to age, skill level, and ability. A good rule to remember, however, is consistency. Try to read every day. If you need to take frequent breaks while reading, go ahead. Even while practicing, reading should be an enjoyable experience.
Take a book with you on a morning bus or train commute, or read on your lunch break. Having access to reading materials during moments of down time makes it more likely that you will read regularly.
Read the words out loud. Reading out loud, alone or to someone, can improve how you read and spell. However, don’t force a nervous reader to read aloud, especially in a group setting. Fear of shame and humiliation can make some unsure readers dread the experience.
Visualize the story, pay attention to the introduction of characters and places. Try to see each in your mind. ""Seeing"" the story will make it more real to you and easier to remember.

, You are much more likely to commit to reading when it is an enjoyable and engaging experience. If you are bored while reading, you are more likely to put the book down and engage in a different activity.Find books related to your hobbies, career goals, or a topic that piques your curiosity. There are books that cover every topic imaginable, and the availability of local libraries, bookstores, and the Internet means that all of them are at your fingertips.
Don't limit yourself to just monographs. Comic books and graphic novels are a great way to get children and young adults hooked on reading. Collections of short stories are a good option for those who don't want to commit to reading a longer work.
Read magazines that cover your areas of interest. Whether your interests are in motorcycle maintenance, gardening, bird watching, or 19th-century architecture, there is a magazine that caters to you. Many of these contain lengthy, well-sourced articles.

, The more you associate reading with comfort and relaxation the more likely you are to continue developing your reading skills. Reading can become a treat, rather than a chore.


Find a quiet place to read so that you aren’t disturbed. Avoid distractions like TV or the radio, or other people prone to disturbing you. Make sure it is somewhere with good lighting where you can relax. Hold the book about 15 inches away from your face (approximately the distance from your elbow to your wrist).Make a cozy and fun reading area. A nicely lit corner with comfortable pillows creates a great ambiance for reading.
If you are helping someone read, stay positive! Negative feedback will only discourage a fledgling reader, so keep the environment upbeat.

, Reading doesn't have to be a solitary pursuit, and can be even more enjoyable when shared with others.


Start a book club with friends. Making reading a social experience can inspire you to continue to improve. Friends can also provide encouragement for each other.
Start an online blog reviewing the latest books you have read. Encourage others to dialogue about their opinions of the work.
Go to a coffee shop or cafe readers frequent. Seeing others reading can inspire you, or expose you to interesting titles. Strike up a conversation with a fellow patron about what they have been reading.
Consider taking a class at your local college, community college, or community center. You can learn a new skill, study a topic that interests you, and practice your reading skills at the same time.
Read interesting passages to family or friends. You might encourage them to improve their reading as well.

, If you can establish reading as a regular and normal activity in your household, all members of your family will be encouraged to be better readers. It will also allow you to practice your reading skills.


Parents can help their children be good readers by reading to them when they are young. Reading to children helps them develop language and listening skills, which prepares them to understand the written word.Keep books handy in your household and keep age-appropriate books accessible to children to peruse on their own. Even if a child cannot read on their own yet, establishing initial skills for reading—such as how to correctly hold a book and turn the pages—is an important step to becoming a reader.
Family reading time can provide a moment to bond with your children. Life can be very hectic, and it is often difficult to set aside quality time with your family. Try to schedule a moment to read with your children everyday as part of your routine.
Be patient if your child begins to favor one book and wants to read it over and over again. A favorite story could be offering your child comfort or appealing to a particular interest they have at the moment. Also, re-reading the same words and sentences repeatedly helps your child begin to recognize words by sight., Public libraries offer free and unlimited access to remarkable collections of reading materials and other types of media and technology. Getting a library card is easy and usually just requires a photo ID, although some libraries may also require proof that you live in the area, such as a utility bill.Libraries are wonderful places to find a variety of books and librarians are there to help. Trained in how to most effectively help you make the most of your library experience, librarians are a resource you should not overlook. Ask the librarian for suggestions for books on a specific topic, or a more general genre, or to help you find a particular title.
Finding materials that interest you is an important first step in improving your reading. Read the backs of books or the inside of the dust jacket for a brief summary of the plot. Usually, you will be able to tell right away if a book will not sustain your interest.
Most libraries allow you to check out more than one title at once. Take home several books to give yourself a variety of reading materials to try.

, Decide which type of bookstore can best suit your needs before setting out. Areas around college campuses and urban areas are more likely to contain a variety of bookstores to visit.


Larger chain bookstores carry everything from self-help books, to novels, to academic publications. If you are not sure what you are looking for, this type of larger bookstore can provide many different types of reading materials to help you narrow your search.
If your interests are more specific, look for a bookstore that caters to the type of book that appeals to you. Children's bookstores are designed to offer a more relaxed and fun environment for younger readers.
Buying from a small local bookstore is a good way to support local business in your community. You can find some unique books in these smaller stores, like work by local authors who have not been featured nationally.
Ask bookstore employees for recommendations. Usually, people who work in or own bookstores are there because they love to read. You will likely get a wide range of recommendations from them.

, You don't have to go to the library or spend a lot of money to find good books. Used books are available for just a few dollars, sometimes even for the change you have in your pocket.

, These offer easy ways to peruse reading material for interesting titles or collections. Sometimes people offer to sell off collections as an entire set.


Be careful when buying used or second-hand books to check the book thoroughly before buying it for missing or damaged pages. Flip through the entire book to make sure it is not badly torn or water damaged.
Feel free to negotiate on the price of a book or other reading material you come across at a garage sale. Sometimes the person selling the book is unaware of internal damage to pages that would decrease the price for the item.

, You can easily find discount books or reading material on the internet, without even leaving home. You can also download e-books and other forms of media to take with you.


Used books are available through most major online retailers. Used books are substantially less expensive than new, and most sellers provide an assessment of the state of the book in terms of wear and tear, and internal notations or highlighting.
More and more information is available for free online. Find a website or blog that interests you and follow it. You can easily find blogs online that include book reviews, which could lead you to explore other books and authors.
Consider getting a portable reading device for easy access to digital material. Although there is nothing like holding a book in your hand, digital devices make it easier than ever to carry several different e-books with you in one small place, which could save you from carrying around heavy books and magazines.
Many public libraries now allow you to ""check out"" e-books for free for a certain period of time, such as two weeks.

Try an audiobook.;
, Fiction and nonfiction have several genres, and it won't be hard to find something you like. Even magazines and newspapers are great reading material! If you want, find several genres you like. Reading will be more enjoyable if you are reading diverse things.


Consider game books.

, This can be accomplished by buying one, borrowing one from a friend, or visiting your local lending library. Try not to over look this step. Reading's hard to do if you don't have a book.

, You might have the excuse that you don't have time to read. Put aside some time and devote it just to that: reading. Thirty minutes is a good length; however, even twenty, fifteen, or ten minute sessions can be enough.

, Sitting in a comfortable seat can help you enjoy your book a lot more.Or even just laying back and relaxing. On top of that, being in a comfortable setting will make you want to stay and read. But don't limit your place to chairs. You can sit on a couch, a bed, or even the floor if you prefer! Make sure your setting is nice and quiet too.

Put yourself in the characters' shoes.",How to Understand What You Read," Get off the computer, turn off the TV, and cut out the music. It's very difficult to read, especially if you're reading something difficult, when your attention is divided. Reading closely means you have to find a nice, comfortable location that's distraction-free.


Make reading fun by getting yourself a snack or a drink and getting comfortable. Burn a nice-smelling candle or read in the tub to make yourself as comfortable, and make reading as enjoyable as possible, especially if it's not something you're excited about reading.;
, If you're reading something difficult, don't worry too much about spoiling the ending for yourself. If you read a paragraph and have to start the paragraph over, consider skimming over the whole story, or flipping through the book somewhat to get a sense of the plot, the main characters, and the tone of the reading, so you'll know what to focus on as you read more closely.Taking a look at Cliff's Notes or reading about the book online can be a good way to get a good summary of the reading to help you get through it more easily, but be aware some teachers do frown on anything like this and may give a lower grade or even nothing when they notice you were using it. Just don't forget to go back and read through more closely.

, Think of yourself as a movie director and picture the action while you're reading it. Cast the movie with actors, if it helps, and really try to picture the events as realistically as possible. This can be a lot more fun, and it will help you remember and understand what you are reading a lot better.

, Some people find it much easier to stay focused and interested in what they're reading by reading out loud. Lock yourself in your room, or hide in the basement and read as dramatically as you want. This can help slow you down if your tendency is to try to skim too quickly, and it can help make the reading more dramatic if you find it somewhat boring.


Always try reading poetry out loud. Reading The Odyssey becomes a much more awesome experience when you invoke the muse aloud.

, You can use context clues to help you figure out things by yourself, but it's always a good idea to take a minute to learn any references you might not have gotten the first time. It'll make the reading much easier.


In school, having looked up an unfamiliar word or concept will always win you bonus points. It's a good thing to get in the habit of doing.

, Make sure you save enough time to do your reading so you can complete it comfortably and take frequent breaks. For every 45 minutes of reading you do, let yourself relax for 15 or do some other kind of homework, to give your mind a rest and let yourself focus on other things for a while. When you're ready, come back fresh and excited to get back to the story.

, Write questions in the margin, underline things you think are interesting, highlight important concepts or ideas. Don't be afraid to make lots of marks on your text as you read. Some readers find that holding a pencil or highlighter makes them a more active reader, giving them something to ""do"" while doing the task. See if it works for you.


Don't underline or highlight too much, and definitely don't highlight random passages because you think it's expected. It won't help you to go back through and study if you've just highlighted randomly, and it'll make your text a lot more difficult to go back through.

, If you're reading something difficult and find yourself often wanting to go back to get something you missed, start taking it one page at a time. At the end of each page, or even at the end of each paragraph, write a brief summary of what happened on that page. This'll break up the reading and allow you to go through it with much more careful attention.

, If you find something confusing, or you notice something that's giving you difficulty, always write it down. This might give you a good question to ask later in class, or give you something to think more about as you continue reading.

, When you finish reading, immediately start writing down your reactions to the story, the book, or the chapter from the book you needed to read. Write about what seems important, what you think the purpose of the writing was, and how it made you feel as a reader. You don't need to summarize it for a response, but you might find it helpful to summarize in general if it will help you remember what you've read more.


Don't write whether or not you liked the story, or whether you thought it was ""boring."" Instead, focus on how it made you feel. Your first response might be, ""I didn't like this story, because Juliet dies at the end,"" but think about why you feel that way. Why would it have been better if she had lived? Would it have? What might Shakespeare have been trying to say? Why did he kill her off? This is a much more interesting reaction now.

, It's not cheating to discuss what you've read about before or after class. In fact, most teachers would probably be thrilled. Get your classmates reactions and compare them to your own. Again, try not to talk about whether or not it was ""boring,"" but see if anyone has a good explanation of something you might've found difficult or confusing. Offer your own reading expertise to help your friends.

, Write down some questions in your notebook that might make interesting discussion questions to bring up in class. Some teachers will make this an assignment, but it will help you to engage with your reading anyway.


Don't ask questions that can be answered with a ""yes"" or a ""no."" Learning to ask ""how"" is a helpful way of coming up with big discussion questions.

, If you have a question later, it can help if you've got the page you want to talk about or ask a question about marked already, rather than having to spend ten minutes trying to remember where Polonius' big line was.

, What would you have done if you were Juliet? Would you have liked Holden Caulfield if he was in your class? What would it have been like to be married to Odysseus? Talk about it with others who have read the same book. How do different people answer the same question? Learning to put yourself into the reading and interact with the text is a good way of experiencing it and understanding it. Think yourself into the book.

Pick the right book.,
Ask your friends and family about their favourite books.,
Read the book about your favourite movie.,
Find a comfier place to read.,
Relax.,
Understand what you are reading.,
Connect with the story.,
Make all reading enjoyable.,
Plan time for reading.,
Set goals.",How to Enjoy Reading Books," What is your favourite genre? Reading what you like is often the key to liking reading. If you don't like chocolate cake, it doesn't mean you don't like all types of cake. It's the same with reading.;
, You can start learning about different varieties of books, and this can give you some ideas on where to look. Also, ask what these other people like about reading, and why that is.

, A lot of times, a movie is based on a book and because the screen version can only be so long, by reading the book, you get more details!

, If you're always itchy or achy while reading, you probably won't enjoy your book! Choose a clean, quiet area that will be easy to focus in.

, Take a couple of deep breaths before reading and have something hot to drink near you. Relaxing is a great way to enjoy lots of things.


If you're having a hard time finding a quiet place, try a backyard or park. The outdoors are always great.

, Find a reading level for you. If you don't know the words or expressions, you will find the book very dull and frustrating.

, Ask yourself what each character enjoys doing the most. Try connecting it to you by comparing your hobbies, talents, likes, and dislikes. Also, think if you would change the character at all.

, If you only read because you have to, change that. Don't pick a super boring book about the subject. Go to the library and try historical fiction based on the subject! It can be easier to digest and enjoy, but still be educational! When you're looking for books on a certain subject, ask the librarian for help.

, Keep everything balanced so you have time to read a little bit at least. You can never enjoy reading if you never do it.

, Try reading one page every day for a week, and challenge yourself to read two pages the next! Work your way up until you're at a comfortable amount of time for you.

Practice close reading with your child.,
Determine the comprehension skill that will be practiced/taught.,
Develop a text dependent question to be asked for each reading.,
Complete the first reading - Ask, ""What is the problem?"",
Complete the second reading.,
Complete the third reading.,
When choosing to do a close reading with a library book or a textbook, your child will not be able to make annotations–circling, underlining, or highlighting in the text.",How to Teach Close Reading to First and Second Grade Students," Begin by choosing an appropriate text. The text should consist of the following features:


A short text (1 to 3 paragraphs) or one section of a longer text
Preferably a non-fiction text
The appropriate reading level for your child so that he/she will be able to read the text independently and with proficiency
Follows a text structure known to your child. Understanding how texts are structured will help your child organize information and gain understanding of what is being read. Common structures include: description, cause and effect, problem and solution, and compare and contrast.;
,


As children become competent readers, they must make sense of what they are reading.
Comprehension skills range in complexity. The skills include: recalling, understanding, applying, analyzing, synthesizing, and evaluating the information read. The skill of recalling information, listing the ingredients needed to complete a recipe, is considerably easier than the skill of evaluating - judging or defending information based on evidence.
The skill chosen for close reading will depend on the reading level of your child and the information being read.
In our example the comprehension skill to be practiced/taught is the analysis of a problem- solution structure using the following text.

Thomas and Jaydon were both second grade students at Sunshine Elementary School. Thomas thought it was a great school with great friends. So he wondered why Jaydon always looked so sad. Then he remembered what it felt like last year when he was the new kid at school. Since he didn't want Jaydon to feel that way, he asked Jaydon to sit with him and his friends at lunch. He also invited Jaydon to play basketball with them at lunch recess. As a result, Jaydon no longer felt sad. He smiled and laughed a lot and was happy to be a student at Sunshine Elementary School.



, The choice of text dependent questions is essential. The right questions will focus your child on the specifics needed to identify the critical details and information needed to understand the text and successfully practice the expected skill.


Each question needs to align to the comprehension skill being practiced/taught.
Each question needs to build on the previous question to support your child in attaining the expected skill.
During each read, your child will be expected to make annotations –circling, underlining, highlighting, and/or note-taking to assist in his/her understanding of the text and to provide evidence from the text to answer the question.
For our example the following questions would be asked to guide your child in analyzing the above text.

First Read - What is the problem?

Annotation - Circle the words/phrases that provide evidence to answer this question


Second Read - What events occurred in the story?

Annotation - Underline the words/phrases that provide evidence to answer this question


Third Read - How do the events solve the problem?

Annotation - Highlight the words/phrases that provide evidence to answer this question





,


Using the evidence circled, an appropriate answer would be: As the new student, Jaydon felt sad because he was lonely and didn't have any friends.

, Ask, ""What events occurred in the story?""


Using the evidence underlined, an appropriate answer would be: Thomas knew what it felt like not to have friends so he asked Jaydon to sit with him and his friends at lunch and to join their basketball game at lunch recess.

, Ask, ""How do the events solve the problem?""


Using the evidence highlighted, an appropriate answer would be: Due to the events that Thomas did - inviting Jaydon to join them at lunch and lunch recess Jaydon had the opportunity to make new friends - as a result he no longer felt lonely.

, A fun option is to have your child use highlighting tape. Highlighting tape comes in many fun colors. Choose a different color tape for each annotation. When the readings are completed, the tape can easily be removed without damage to the book.

Practice letter recognition and sound recognition using a set of alphabet cards.,
Identify letter sound matches.,
Build words.Create a set of boxes.,
Develop an understanding of letter patterns.,
Switch letters to change the word.,
Continue on the road to reading success To reinforce these skills, select books for your child that highlight the phonics patterns practiced in these activities.",How to Teach Children Phonics,"


Shuffle the cards in random order and have your child say the name of each letter. Next, have your child produce the sound of each letter.
As your child becomes more skilled as a reader, he/she will need to read words with letter patterns - two letters combined to represent one sound. Using flash cards have him/her practice letter patterns such as vowel pairs: /ea/, /ee/, /oa/, /ai/, and digraphs: /sh/, /ch/, /th/, and /wh/.;
, To build sound letter matches, have your child sort pictures cards according to their beginning sounds.


Select picture cards that begin with the 3 initial consonant sounds that are very different such as: /b/, /s/, & /t/. Review the cards before you have your child sort them: bear, triangle, smile, spoon, sunflower, spinner, sign, train, tree

If your child needs support ask, “What is the first sound you hear in the word bear? What letter makes the /b/ sound? Is it the letter b, s, or t?


Then have your child sort the pictures according to their ending sounds.
Activities of increasing difficulty include sorting pictures according to their medial sound represented by their vowel pattern: /e/: seal, peas, read, team, wheel; /o/: boat, coat, toad, road OR according to their beginning digraphs: cards: chair, cherries, shoe, sheep, thread, three, wheat, whiskers.

, Each box represents a sound in the word.


Place different magnetic letters below the set of boxes. Black letters represent consonants, and red letters represent vowels.
Dictate a CVC word - three letter word that consists of two consonants and a vowel. The vowel appears in the middle of the consonants and makes the short vowel sound. CVC words consist of the same number of sounds and letters. Examples include: cat, hat, sat, bat, pet, set, bet, tap, cap, cab
Next, have your child say the word slowly pronouncing each sound heard: /c/, /a/, /t/.
Ask your child to choose the correct letter for each sound heard. Have him/her begin building the word by placing the first letter in the first box moving from left to right. This will help to reinforce that the letters need to be placed in the correct order to build (make) the dictated word.

, Extend the activity by dictating words that include vowel pairs and/or digraphs. Words consisting of vowels pairs and digraphs (two letters combined to represent one sound) will always have a greater number of letters compared to sounds.

, Sounds said in the correct order produce desired words, therefore the positioning of letters is essential in building the corrects words. Switching letters/sounds will change a word. Begin by displaying the magnetic letters that are needed to build the dictated words. Next, draw three or four boxes depending on the number of sounds heard.


Dictate the word cat and have your child listen to the sounds and place their corresponding letters in the correct order from left to right..
Next, ask your child to switch the letter c with the letter that makes /h/ to build the word hat.
Continue by having your child replace the h with the letters that make the /ch/ sound. Ask your child to read the new word - chat.
Have your child change the word chat to chap.
Activities of increasing difficulty would include longer words with more patterns.

, This will help your child to strategically apply the skills learned to reading words in books.

Set yourself goals.",How to Learn Speed Reading," Almost every reader ""subvocalizes,"" or moves their throat as they imagine speaking the words.This may help the reader remember concepts, but it's also a major barrier to speed.Here are a few ways to keep this habit to a minimum:


Chew gum or hum while you read. This occupies muscles used to subvocalize.
If you move your lips as you read, hold a finger against them.;
, When reading, your eyes often move back to earlier words. Most of the time, these are short movements that probably don't improve understanding.Use an index card to cover words right after you read them, training yourself not to overuse this habit.


These ""regressions"" also happen when you've failed to understand something. If your eyes jump several words or lines back, that's a sign that you may need to slow down.

, While reading, your eyes move jerkily, stopping on some words and skipping others. You can only read while your eyes are stopped. If you learn to make fewer movements per line, you'll read a lot faster. But be careful – research reveals limits to how much English readers can see at once:You can read eight letters to the right of your eye position, but only four to the left. This is roughly two or three words at a time.
You notice letters 9–15 spaces to the right, but can't read them clearly.
Normal readers don't process words on other lines. Training yourself to skip lines and still understand them would be very difficult.

, Your brain normally decides where to move your eyes based on how long or familiar the next words look.You can read faster if you train your eyes to move to specific places on the page instead. Try this exercise:Place an index card over a line of text.
Write an X on the card, over the first word.
Write another X on the same line. Place it three words further for good understanding, five words for easy texts, or seven words to skim the main points.
Write more Xs at the same spacing, until you reach the end of the line.
Read quickly as you move the index card down, trying to only focus your eyes just below each X.

, Many programs claim to increase your reading speed by training your reflexes first, then practicing until your brain can catch up. This has not been thoroughly studied. It certainly increases the speed you move through the text, but you may understand little or nothing. Try this if you want to aim for extreme speed reading, and you might understand more after a few days of practice. Here's how:


Move a pencil along the text. Time this so you can say ""one one thousand"" at a calm pace and finish just as you reach the end of a line.
Spend two minutes trying to read at the pace of the pencil. Even if you can't understand anything, stay focused on the text and keep your eyes moving for the entire two minutes.
Rest for a minute, then go even faster. Spend three minutes trying to read at the pace of a pen that moves across two lines every time you say ""one one thousand"".

, If you can't reach your goals with the techniques above, try RSVP, or Reading Rapid Serial Visual Presentation. In this approach, the phone app or computer software flashes text a single word at a time. This lets you choose any reading speed you like. Raise it too high, though, and you won't be able to remember a large percentage of the words.This may be useful to get a rapid summary of a news article, but not when studying or reading for fun.








, Skimming can be used to gain a shallow understanding of a text. It can be used to scan a newspaper for interesting material, or to get the important concepts out of a textbook in preparation for a test. It's not a good replacement for thorough reading.

, Begin by only reading the chapter titles and any subheadings at the start of large sections. Read the headlines of each newspaper article, or the table of contents in a magazine., Textbooks usually contain introductions and summaries of each chapter. For other texts, just read the first and last paragraph of a chapter or article.


You can read quickly if you're familiar with the subject, but don't try to speed read as fast as possible. You're saving time by skipping most of the section, but you do need to understand what you're reading.

, If you still wish to learn more, brush your eyes rapidly across the page rather than reading normally. Now that you know the gist of the section, you can pick out key words that mark important areas. Stop and circle the following words:Words that are repeated several times
The main ideas – often including words from the title or section header
Proper nouns
Italics, bold text, or underline
Words you don't recognize

, These often present a lot of information without much reading required. Take a minute or two to make sure you fully understand each diagram.

, If you've lost track of the subject, read the start of each paragraph. The first one or two sentences will teach you the main points., Go back and look over the words you've circled. Can you ""read"" these and get a general sense of what the text is about? If you get confused at a certain word, try reading a few sentences around that word to remind yourself of the topic. Circle additional words as you do this.

, Track your progress by timing yourself daily, or each time you try these exercises. Trying to beat your best speed can provide great motivation. Here's how to time your reading in words per minute (wpm):Count the number of words on a page, or count the number in one line and multiply by the number of lines on the page.
Set a timer for ten minutes and see how much you can read in that time.
Multiply the number of pages you read by the number of words per page. Divide by ten to get your words per minute.
You can use an online ""speed reading test,"" but you will probably read at a different pace on a screen than on a printed page., Your reading speed should improve if you repeat one or more of these exercises daily. Many people can double their reading speed after several weeks. Set yourself milestones to motivate yourself to keep practicing:


200–250 words per minute is the expected reading speed for someone age 12 or older.300 wpm is the reading speed of the average college student.
At 450 wpm, you're reading as fast as a college student skimming for the main points. Ideally, you can do this with almost total comprehension.
At 600–700 wpm, you're reading as fast as a college student scanning to find a word. Most people can learn to read at this speed with about 75% of their normal comprehension.At 1,000 wpm and above, you're reaching the level of competitive speed readers. This usually requires extreme techniques that skip over most of the text. Most people can't remember much at this speed.

Build on student interests.",How to Teach Close Reading," To teach close reading, it is important that you first do a close reading of a text yourself.Extrapolate all of the details you can that are both directly stated and implied in the text, determine the apparent audience and the writer’s purpose.


Make a list of the details you have gleaned from the text so that you can later compare your list to the student’s list in order to model adequate detail from a close reading.
For example, you may use the following passage from Dr. Martin Luther King’s famous “I have a dream” speech:

In a sense we've come to our nation's capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the ""unalienable Rights"" of ""Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."" It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note, insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check, a check which has come back marked ""insufficient funds.""Details you may glean from the text involve the following (this list is not exhaustive):

Who is the speaker? Dr. Martin Luther King, famous African American civil rights activist
What is the purpose of the passage? To persuade the audience (a large number of US citizens gathered in a rally for civil rights) that black men deserve the same rights as white men.
What figurative language is used? There is an extended metaphor about a banking transaction between the US government and its citizens. Dr. King also personifies America, giving the country a (female) gender and agency.
What rhetorical devices are used? Dr. King uses an appeal to authority when he cites the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence. He also uses an appeal to the audience’s sense of fairness when he alludes to the government failing to withhold their end of the promise/transaction.

;
, While this may seem like a frivolous detail, deciding the specific way you’re going to give a student the text is an important consideration. This is particularly true if you’re helping a student prepare close reading for a specific purpose, such as a state-wide exam that will be taken on a computer: you may want to mirror the process of the exam as well as the content as much as possible.


Are you going to type the passage and give it to your student? If so, be sure to double- or triple-space the text to give him plenty of room to make notes an annotations.
Are you going to have the student read directly from a book? Then provide scrap paper on which he can write notes while he reads.
Are you going to have him read on the computer? Can he highlight and make notes on the computer screen, or will he need scrap paper?

, The student should know that he is supposed to do a close reading, and what information he should be getting from the text while he reads. It may be helpful to explain the differences between reading for pleasure and performing a close reading.After explaining it, ask the student to explain in his own words what his goal is for close reading so that you can be sure he understands.
For the excerpt from “I have a dream,” you might explain the context of the speech to aid understanding. Tell the student that you’d like him to read the excerpt and figure out what the passage is about, who is speaking, why he is speaking, and to whom he seems to be addressing his words.

, Guide the student to preview the text—look at any title or author attribution present, determine the form (prose or poetry, for example) and then do an initial read of the text. It may be helpful to have him read the text all the way through one time, then begin annotating and making notes on the second read-through. With the initial read, students should be able to answer “big picture” questions about the text, such as “what is the passage about?” and “who seems to be speaking?”
For the “I have a dream” excerpt, students should be able to express that Dr. King was explaining the unfair way that the US had treated African Americans. They should know that Dr. King is speaking and that the excerpt is part of a speech, but you may need to provide them with this information verbally or in a sentence or two before the passage begins.

, Give the student explicit instructions about how to annotate or make notes on/about the text. He can develop his own system later, but to begin with, it’s useful to give him explicit instruction.


For example, you might tell him to underline the most important concrete nouns, circle adjectives, make a box around active verbs, and highlight the main (topic) sentence. If he is reading directly from a book, you can ask him to make a chart and list the nouns, adjectives, and verbs separately and copy down the main sentence.
For a persuasive piece like the “I have a dream” speech, your instructions may differ slightly. You might want the reader to highlight any rhetorical devices, circle “loaded” words that have strong connotations for the listeners, underline figurative language, and list important details to the side.

, Because you read the text closely yourself, you should be prepared to ask questions to help the student flesh out details from the text. The questions you ask will depend on the level of the student (a second grade student may not be able to answer the same questions as a high school or college student, for instance.) Some questions to consider are:


What details does the author include to make you “see” what is happening in your mind?
What details do you think are being intentionally left out?
What is the author’s purpose for writing?
Does the author use any intentionally persuasive language? Where?
Why does take ?
What emotions are communicated in the passage? How does it make you feel?
Who do you think is the intended audience of the passage?

, Depending on the student’s age and abilities, ask them to explain all of the details he can glean from the text. He can do this orally (telling you the details) or he can write them down in a list. Emphasize this is not a summary, which provides a brief synapses of the material, but a close reading, which requires listing as much detail as possible.


You may want to share your list with the student after he finishes. This can give you the opportunity to model a more thorough list of details if his was a bit spare, and you may even find that he noticed some details that you did not.
This is a great opportunity for a discussion about how each of you approached the text and why your lists may have differed., When the student lists or tells you details from the text, divide those details into things that are directly (explicitly) stated in the text and those that are not.Close reading should primarily center on details directly from the text, and while extrapolating more information is a valuable skill, it is important for the student to know the difference.
In other words, close reading should focus on what is actually present in the text, not what the student thinks the text should say.
For example, direct details from the “I have a dream” text would be: America has treated black men unfairly, the country was founded on principles of free will and the innate rights of humans, and the speaker and audience are in Washington DC asking for change.
For example, indirect details from the “I have a dream” would be: Dr. King is an influential leader, people listening to his speech want things to change, and American laws supported the equality of black and white men at the time of the speech.

, Tying close reading into other skills, such as the students’ own writing,can make the activity seem more meaningful. Giving students a reason for doing an activity (other than “you will be tested on it”) often gives them more of a stake in their own education.There are many ways to connect the “I have a dream” speech to other student skills. Students could write and deliver their own speeches about injustices in their lives, write journal entries in the persona of Dr. King, or even do a creative response, such as a collage or an interpretive dance, that follows the theme of Dr. King’s speech.

, You might want to provide some support along with the text. Remember that the process of close reading is what’s important here, not challenging the student to identify complex vocabulary words.


For example, if there are a couple of very challenging vocabulary words that you think may stump your student, you might want to provide a gloss (synonym) for them beneath the passage.

You may provide glosses for the “I have a dream” speech for the terms “promissory note” and “insufficient funds” if you think that your students will not understand these finance terms.


If the passage does not make sense out of context, you may want to provide 1-2 sentences of context prior to starting the passage, such as “This speech was given by Dr. Martin Luther King in 1963 in front of the Lincoln Memorial. Over 200,000 people attended the speech, which was part of a rally known as the ‘March on Washington.’”

, The skills of close reading are not limited to printed texts. Visual texts can be closely read as well, and reluctant readers may be more open to visual texts. Teaching the skills of close reading with a visual then later applying them to print text has the potential to engage more reluctant students.


Effective visual texts should have enough ambiguity to leave them open for interpretation, but offer rich nuance that enables the close reader to extrapolate more about what’s going on as he spends more time analyzing the visual. The “I have a dream” speech is widely available in audio format. Though some students may have trouble processing audio as well as reading, you could certainly provide both audio and written copies for close reading. You can then also discuss delivery in addition to the content of the speech.

, In order to effectively close-read, the selected passage should be short. An entire novel is not an appropriate selection for close reading (at any age!), but a paragraph or two is likely more appropriate.


Close readers in the early grades should focus on a very short paragraph, while more advanced readers may be able to close read 2 fairly complex paragraphs.
The “I have a dream” speech is fairly long in its entirety (around 1,600 words) and would not be appropriate for a short close-reading lesson. However, there are many short sections that can be excerpted and analyzed on their own.

, A close-reading text should be somewhat difficult for a student, but not so difficult that he cannot engage with it at all. If a text is too difficult, the student can become so bogged down in vocabulary that he has trouble finding any meaning in the text. If the text is too easy, the student is unlikely to engage in truly close reading because the majority of the details will be immediately obvious.


The “I have a dream” speech example here is likely appropriate for most high school students, but may be a more difficult passage for younger children.

, Particularly when you are just starting to work with a student on close reading, it can help to provide texts that the student finds interesting and relevant to his life. You can later move to texts further outside of his comfort zone if necessary.


For example, if your student is a fan of sports, finding a text about the final moments of a basketball game could keep him engaged with the reading.

Look at groups of words, not single words even if you do not want to not do it.,
Read with your hands.,
Scan for keywords.,
Chunk the material.,
Race the clock.",How to Improve Speed Reading Skills1," If you read a text one word at a time, then this will slow your reading speed way down. However, if you can get into the habit of reading groups or chunks of words at one time, then you can read much faster.Start by trying to look at a group of three or four words at once, then work up to looking at an entire line of words.
Focus on words that give the sentence meaning, such as the nouns and verbs and pay less attention to the filler words, such as “A, the, and, etc.”
To see the biggest improvement in your speed reading skills, combine this technique with other speed reading techniques.;
, Use your finger to push yourself through the page. As you read, move your hand left to right under the text as if underlining it. Move your hand at the speed which you would like to read. You may start by moving at a slightly faster pace than your ordinary reading, and speed up on subsequent readings.While it used to be claimed that this use of the hand or finger ""guided"" the eye, it now appears that the finger sets the pace of reading rather than guiding its path. This is because it is difficult to pace the movements of your eyes, but easy to pace the movements of your hands.You can also use a pen or other object to pace yourself.

, Scanning is a highly effective way of extracting answers from a text without really reading it. If you know exactly what you are looking for—a name, a date, a statistic, or a specific word—you can find it quickly by skipping over large chunks of the text. To scan, first visualize the word, number, or phrase you would like to find. Then, run your eyes rapidly over the text. The information you are looking for should pop out at you.Try scanning with your hands or a pen, preferably a blue or black pen. Experiment with shapes to see which gets you the quickest results.

, One of the reasons you read slowly is that you have to pause sometimes to understand what a passage is saying. You might also have to go back and reread things you have already read. To improve your speed reading, try to pause for reflection only at the end of a reading session (i.e. after about 15 to 20 minutes) or after finishing a section, such as chapter.To check for comprehension at the end of every speed reading session, write down keywords, or just summarize what you read in a few sentences or by explaining it to someone. This will help you keep to improve your comprehension, and it will also help you to retain information better.

, You can train yourself to read faster by timing yourself as you go. Start by getting your base time. Set a timer for fifteen minutes, and speed read as you normally do. When the timer goes off, check to see how far you got. Do not count the words, just the pages or paragraphs. Record your figures: for instance, you might write ""15min/6.5 pages.""Check your comprehension. Say what you learned out loud—you don't need to write it down, just check to see that you took in the information you were reading.
The next day, set the alarm for 15 minutes again and try to read faster. Record your times again (""15 min/7 pages,"" for instance), and check for comprehension.
Do this every day or 5 days a week to improve your skills. Try to beat your last time every session.
If you notice your comprehension is dropping, you may have reached your peak, or you may need to aim for a more moderate improvement in speed.

Survey the text.,
Write questions.,
Read or skim the text.,
Recite the answers.,
Review the text.",How to Improve Speed Reading Skills2," Before you read, read all titles, chapter and section headings, subheadings, and any charts, graphs, diagrams, questions, and summaries you can find.If you are reading a text without these things, you might consider reading the first and last sentence of every paragraph or chapter to get an idea of the material the text is covering.

, Write down any questions you hope your reading will answer. You will comprehend more if you go into the text knowing what you want to learn. If you are not sure what you want to learn, go through and turn every chapter heading, section title, etc. into a question. Try to guess what the text will teach you: ask yourself the question you think the text might answer.If you like, add further questions while you read.

, Review your questions, then read the text. You may skim or scan, or you may just read at your current fastest pace.Depending on the length of the text, you may choose to read it all, or you may choose to read it in sections.
For maximum comprehension, pause at the end of every section and think about what you have read. Answer the question if you can.
For maximum speed, answer the questions once you have read the entire text.

, Now that you've read, you should be able to answer the questions you asked yourself. Answer all the questions you have read. You do not have to write them down (unless that is your assignment), just recite them aloud.If you are pausing after each section, make sure you can recite the answer to that section before you move on to the next. If you cannot, go back and skim it again.
If you feel you made an error in the framing of one of your questions, reframe it so that you can answer it.

, The final ""R"" in SQR3 is ""review,"" which will help you retain the information you have comprehended. Go back over the questions you have answered and see if you can still answer them from memory.If you cannot, skim the section again until you can.

Expand your vocabulary.,
Choose strategic texts.,
Take notes.",How to Improve Speed Reading Skills3," Running into words you don't know is one of the great bogs of speed reading.You're likely to get stuck on words with meanings you don't know, and likely to miss key information. To expand your vocabulary, read more. When you don't know a word, look it up.


If you are reading a certain genre of text, such as a medical textbook, it will help to study basic medical jargon before you start reading.
Reading broadly in the fields that interest you will expand your vocabulary.

, Because you'll always be trading some of your comprehension when reading at breakneck speed, you might want to save speed reading for texts that are somewhat easy or that you won’t be tested on. For instance, you might choose to speed read a book that is written for young adults. Or, you might speed read a book that you need to read for a class, but that will not be on any exams or tests. Another good choice for speed reading would be a text you have read before that you would like to review.


Avoid speed reading texts that you really need to know, such as material you will be tested on.
Avoid speed reading texts that require you to subvocalize or analyze while you read, such as poetry or fiction. You will miss out on the most important information., If comprehension is your goal, then processing what you just wrote is your best tool. After you've completed your speed reading of a text, take some time to reflect on it. Write down key ideas, discuss them with a friend, or just free-write about your impressions.


Don't make marks or highlight the text—this will interfere with your speed reading, and it may distract you from the information you are trying to absorb.

Try an audiobook.",How to Encourage Yourself to Read," Like anything else, reading is an activity that gets easier with practice. Block out a chunk of time to dedicate to reading every day, even if it’s just ten minutes.


Choose a time that’s stress-free. Read during a nice, quiet time. Enjoy a book with breakfast or as you’re getting ready for bed.
Prepare yourself a snack for while you read. Prepare a cup of coffee with a chocolate biscotti or a plate of hummus and crackers to munch on while you read. This will make you look forward to reading time!;
, Even though reading does get better with practice, it’s supposed to be a fun activity. Don’t force yourself to read things you hate. Reading is supposed ignite creativity and inspire joy. If you can’t get into a book, move onto a new one.


Reading increases empathy and intelligence, but only if you can focus on what you’re reading. Choosing books with compelling characters and storylines that suck you in raise your chances of reaping the intellectual benefits of reading., Spend some time checking out the selection at your local library to get an idea of what you’d be excited to read. Libraries are perfect places to get lost for hours. Wander through a bunch of different sections and grab whatever books interest you!Curl up in an armchair and read the first page of all of the books you take off the shelf. After you’ve gone through them all, choose one or two that seemed the most compelling. Don’t buy too many books at once, as this can be overwhelming. Instead, limit yourself to one or two a visit that you can’t wait to get home and read.
Get a library card. Though people go to libraries less frequently than in the past, your local library is an amazing resource for essentially free books. Talk to a librarian about how to set up an account, and ask for some recommendations.

, Like the library, bookstores are an excellent place to find books that might interest you. Independent bookstores are particularly good resources because unlike some of the bigger chains, independent stores are run by book lovers who want to foster a literary community. Going to an independent bookstore will help you to meet other people who want to get into reading.


Employees at independent bookstores are well-read and will be able to offer you exciting new recommendations.
Most independent bookstores also sell local authors. This is a fun way for you to read books by people you might know and to become more active in the community!

, Joining a book club not only exposes you to books that you might not have otherwise read but also allows you to connect with other like-minded readers. Coming together with others and discussing what you’re reading makes the material feel more relevant and gives you a chance to hear a wide variety of opinions.Plus, most book clubs have great food! Wine, cheese, and fruit are standard book club snacks. The food and conversation stimulate lasting connections and friendships.

, There’s no reason to immediately force yourself to read War and Peace when you’re trying to get into reading. Start with something that’s easy and fun to read, regardless of its academic level.Pick up your old favorite kid’s book. Young adult novels are fast-paced, easy to read, and full of imaginative characters. Grab a favorite like Harry Potter, or some Roald Dahl classics like Matilda or James and the Giant Peach to get started.
Try an alternative format, such as a graphic novel. If you like history, try out the graphic novel Persepolis by Marjane Satrapi or Maus by Art Spiegelman.

, Don’t limit yourself to one genre. Alternating between genres such as fiction, non-fiction, fantasy, sci-fi, and history can keep you constantly engaged and excited about reading.Science fiction and fantasy are often great picks for people who don’t love to read. They’re fun, imaginative, and fast paced. Ender’s Game by Orson Scott Card and A Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams are two widely adored sci-fi classics.
For fiction, don’t force yourself to read the classics just because you think you should. The Kite Runner by Khaled Hosseini and The History of Love by Nicole Krauss are two examples of popular contemporary books.

, Friends, family members, and teachers who know what you like and what you’re interested in are a great resource for book recommendations. Not only will you get good advice, but you will make connections with other people who love to read. Since reading is such a solitary activity, it’s nice to share your thoughts on books with the people in your life.Reach out to your old high school English teacher and ask for a good book recommendation. Your teacher will most likely be thrilled to hear from you, and will have tons of knowledge on the best books out there.

, Every year, The Pulitzer Prizes awards prizes for the best writing of the year. Check out the Pulitzer website at http://www.pulitzer.org/prize-winners-by-year for a list of the best books of the year.


The website is organized by either “Prize Winners By Year” or “Explore by Category.” Choose “Explore by Category” to see prizes in many different categories such as Fiction, Drama, History, Biography, Poetry, and General Nonfiction. Scroll through them all!
For lovers of classics, check out the Modern Library’s list of 100 Best Novels at http://www.modernlibrary.com/top-100/100-best-novels/. Print out the list and cross them off as you go!

, There are tons of sites, such as Goodreads, Delicious Library, and Shelfari, that let you track the books you’ve read. You can also see what books your friends are reading and check out reviews of books that you’re interested in. Most sites also give you recommendations based on what you’ve read and rated.Even if you don’t like using online reading sites, write down a list of all the books you’ve read with a few notes on what you thought of them. Studies show that keeping track of goals and accomplishment helps with happiness, motivation, and emotional well-being. Plus, it’s satisfying to have a record of all the books you’ve read!, Encouraging others to read will make reading more fun for you as well. When you find a book that you love, tell a friend, family member, or significant other to read it. Then the two of you can talk about it, and the other person might then be more inspired to read and ultimately provide you with more future recommendations.

, There's no reason to slog through a book that you just can't get into. There are hundreds of thousands of books out there. If you're not into a book after about thirty pages, move on to something else.

, It’s hard to read if you’re in physical pain. Find a nice, cozy place to settle in with a book so that all you have to focus on is the story itself. Don’t sit in a hard plastic folding chair, but rather an armchair, hammock, couch, or comfy window nook.Make yourself a nice cup of tea or coffee to sip on while you’re reading. It’ll keep you hydrated and awake!

, Reading takes a lot of concentration, and it’s impossible to get into a book if you’re constantly checking your email or Facebook or distracted by outside commotion. Find a quiet place and eliminate technological distractions while you’re reading.Turn off your cell phone or put it on silent.
Put your cell phone far enough away from you that you won’t pick it up to check your social media.
Buy some earplugs to drown out the sounds of traffic or your neighbor’s TV.

, There’s nothing like the feel and smell of a good old-fashioned book. However, some prefer reading electronic books through sources such as the Kindle. Find a reading medium that makes the most sense for you.


Kindles are generally easier to transport. You can store tons of reading material in one light-weight package.
Kindles also have special features such as highlight, search, and note taking.
While print books are easier on the eyes, Kindles have a muted gray background that causes less strain than the common computer screen., If you spend a lot of time in transit, audiobooks are great ways to keep reading on-the-go. Though the average word per minute is lower by listening to an audiobook than by reading for yourself, for those with limited time, it’s still better than not reading at all.Some people are more auditory than visual. If you tend to excel at auditory learning, audiobooks are likely the right choice for you.
Audiobooks aren’t just for commuters. Listen to a book while cooking, cleaning, mowing the lawn, or running.
iBooks and Audible are two of the main resources for audiobooks."

Don't turn them down when they invite you to hang out with them, unless they're uninteresting people to be around, saying ""Sorry, I can't.,
Encourage a friend to tell you what she or he thinks of a specific phrase or paragraph, and listen (vs comment your thoughts first ).",How to Encourage Your Friends to Read," This may sound like something Captain Obvious would say, but the truth is you can't really call yourself a bookworm when all you read is a couple of books per year. Make a habit of reading at least one book per week. Just be sure you read the classics (and generally every very well-known book, even if you may not like it; you may find this useful when a whole group talks about a book you wouldn't have read otherwise).;
, Then use it to display a long-ish list of favorite books. It may catch their attention and ask you about it next time you meet.

, Obviously, none of them would know what you're talking about. Then talk a little about the book, describe the plot, the characters, the writing style, everything you think will appeal to them. If that's the case, mention the fact that the book is short and the author has an informal writing style. Teens usually like that. Don't sound too much like a commercial, though, and neither like a literary analysis. Focus on the things you liked about it.

, When people point it out to you that ""you are writing look wi3rd l0lz"", tell them it's a consequence of reading books. Make proper writing seem cool to the people you talk to (not that it wouldn't be in any case, but that was not the point). Do the same when you use a word whose meaning is unknown to your friends.

, Along with other little things, of course.

, It's annoying and people feel insulted when someone, even a friend, tells them in an aggressive way that they are do something stupidly.

, often that starts in their home. You want to open a door to reading for them where they feel appreciated and safe, which they might not be at home, especially if their parents are not very literate. Don't make fun of people who never read in front of your friends, because they will get the feeling you're subtly trying to make fun of their lack of literary culture.

, Unlike other people, I'd like to read something this afternoon."". You might get told something like ""What's wrong with you dude, you used to be a cool guy, now all you do is sit in the library all day like a frigging' bookworm!"". Which you don't need to care about, as it's your life and you are choosing to take responsibility as to how you want to live it. But you don't have to bring books with you every time you meet them if you're using the books as a shield, although it might work once. But only once. Try asking the person what she/he loves to do and offering to find a good book for them about it, or read it yourself and comment next time you meet...

, Especially if you can apply it to a current situation they're facing or you both know about. ""You know this reminds me of Mr. ----- when he was talking the other day. What do you think?"" Then you can begin to talk about what you found interesting in the book together, and get their curiosity , and self esteem going..!"

Incentivize reading.",How to Encourage a Teen to Read," One of the biggest reasons that teenagers don’t read is that they do not have books that are the appropriate level for them. Books and stories that are too easy (below a teen’s reading level) are boring. Books that are too hard (above a teen’s reading level) are frustrating.The trick is finding a “just right” book. If you are a parent, the first person to ask for your child’s reading level is their Reading, Language Arts, or English teacher. Many teachers test their students’ reading levels early in the semester and help them find appropriate reading materials throughout the year based on their level.
If you are a homeschooling parent or if your child’s teacher doesn’t know their reading level, you can find out for yourself.;
, There are dozens of online tests to determine what reading level your teen is on. They take anywhere from a few minutes to a couple of hours and vary in how much detail they offer.


One of the easiest tests to determine your teen’s approximate reading level fairly quickly is the San Diego Quick Assessment. It only takes a few minutes.For a more detailed interpretation of your teen’s reading level, you can explore more complicated tests on sites like ReadingA-Z.com.
Tests like these are just an approximation of your child’s reading level. Pay close attention as your teenager reads, and if they seem to be struggling with books on the level they test at (or find them too easy), shift levels. , Many teens will be tempted to read books that are below their reading level, because they are comfortable with them. This is fine every once in awhile, but it won’t do much to help them grow as readers, and they may become bored with reading quickly. Other teens will be tempted to read books that are too hard for them because they want to impress you or their peers, but they will quickly grow frustrated and not learn anything from the book. Each time they pick up a book, ask them to determine which of these categories it fits into: Too easy

You’ve read it many times before. You might be able to repeat a lot of the story or even the phrasing without looking.
You don’t struggle with pronouncing or understanding the meaning of any of the words or phrases.
You can read this book very quickly and smoothly.


Just right

You haven’t read this book before.
You understand most of what the book is saying.
There may be a few words (less than five) on each page that are difficult for you.
You read most of this book fairly smoothly, but you do hesitate on a few sentences.


Too hard

There are more than five words on almost every page that you struggle with.
You don't understand the plot and can't summarize what has happened in the book so far.
If you read aloud, you read very slowly and without much expression. You hesitate a lot.



, You should do this after you know your teen's reading level. It’s best to do it in conjunction with a conversation with your teen about whether he or she thinks the book is “just right” or not.


Websites such as Readability-Score.com will tell you the reading level of a text if you are unsure. You can even use Microsoft Word to test the readability of some texts.If you’re not sure whether your teen is struggling with a book or not, ask questions like “What’s that book about?” or “How do you think it’s going to end?” to get a feel for his or her comprehension. (Google a summary of the book to find out if your teen is giving accurate answers or not.)
You can also ask teens to read a passage out loud to you to determine whether they are stumbling over words or not.

, Many people default to fiction (especially novels) when they are providing reading material. It’s important to offer teens a wide selection of literary styles. Encourage a wide variety, even once your teen expresses a preference for one genre. Your child might be interested in a unexpected book or story, which will open up new avenues. Try to provide some reading material in each of these categories: Fantasy and science fiction
Historical fiction
Biography
Informational books about science
News articles
Reference books
Poetry
Short stories

, Sometimes the classics won’t cut it! Particularly if your teen doesn’t enjoy reading or reads below grade level, it’s important to find material that keeps them engaged. It’s particularly important to find high-interest reading for low-level readers. If your teen is not reading at grade level, many of the books on their level will be about kids who are younger than them or subjects geared toward younger children. Look for lists of “hi-lo” books (high interest, low reading level) online to find things that your teen will enjoy. Teens may also enjoy reading comic books and graphic novels.
High interest series in particular are a great way to get teens invested in reading for the long term. Some high interest series appropriate for teens include the Harry Potter series, the Hunger Games series, the Divergent series, the Twilight series, the Bluford High series, the Mortal Instruments series, and The Wolves of Mercy Falls series.
For nonfiction, look for material on exciting topics such as scary weather phenomena, sports figures and celebrities, outer space, or news events involving teenagers. , One way to get teens excited about reading is to find books that also exist in other formats. Try reading a book together about a month before the movie version comes out, and then watch the movie together to see how it compares.


Ideas for books that have corresponding films include: the Harry Potter series, the Hunger Games series, the Twilight series, the Chronicles of Narnia, The Outsiders, The Martian, The Fault in Our Stars, The Perks of Being a Wallflower, The Princess Diaries, The Giver, The Book Thief, Matilda, Little Women, Harriet the Spy, Holes, and If I Stay.

, Almost every teenager craves social interaction. Turn reading into a social activity by finding a local teen book club that your child can join or founding one yourself.


Be sure to find or organize a group of teens on approximately the same reading level.
Pick high-interest books for the whole group, or discussion will lag.
If you’re organizing the club, consider picking books with corresponding movies. Then the group can watch the movie together and compare and contrast it with the book.

, If possible, start reading to your child as soon as they are born. This is the most important factor in language development in young children. Even when children turn into teenagers, reading aloud can still be beneficial.


Reading aloud is a great way to expose teens to books that are above their reading level.You can help them with difficult words if they are reading aloud. You can also model reading with expression and fluency.Be sure that teens follow along as you read. They shouldn’t listen passively; actively paying attention to the words on the page will help them with comprehension.

, Ask them about the plot and the characters if they are reading fiction. Ask them to tell you about current events if they are reading news articles. Encourage them to predict what might happen next or even to read their favorite passages to you.Before your teen reads a book, you can ask

""What do you already know about this topic?”
""What do you think the title means?”
""Why do you think this picture is on the cover?”


While your teen is reading a book, you can ask

”Who is your favorite character?”
""How do you think this book is going to end?”


After your teen finishes reading a book, you can ask

""Was there a part you liked best/worst?”
""Where did the book take place?”
""What was the most important thing that happened in your book?”


Also talk to your teen about what you are reading. That doesn’t necessarily mean you need to give them the sordid details of your romance novel. You can tell them about the current events you read about in the news or tell them about the new scientific breakthrough you read about in a magazine at the doctor’s office.

, Teens’ reading levels and interests will change rapidly. It’s important to provide them with a wide variety of genres and reading material at many different levels.Used bookstores, thrift stores, estate sales, and yard sales are all great places to find books.
You don’t have to buy books to make them available to the teen in your life. The public library is a good alternative. Help your teen get their own library card so that they can take bit of extra responsibility for their reading.

, If you have a teenager, chances are good that they spend a lot of time in front of screens. Encourage them to spend some of that time reading.


Many public libraries now have an e-reader option.
Project Gutenberg, Google, Open Library, and Internet Archive all offer free ebooks.
Magazines and newspapers targeted at teenagers are also a good option. You can get a subscription that comes in both paper and digital versions for many such periodicals.

, Audiobooks are great for modelling fluent reading. They can be more entertaining than even reading aloud, because the readers are often adept at voices and accents. Play audiobooks on long car trips.
Turn on an audiobook that the whole family will enjoy in the evenings. It’s okay if everyone sits around and plays Candy Crush while they listen together. Don’t forget to talk about the plot and the characters later though! Don’t let audiobooks replace regular reading altogether. Teenagers still need to read normal books to improve their fluency and comprehension.
Audiobooks are an expensive option, but you can find lots at public libraries. You can also subscribe to services such as Audible.com in order to get audiobooks frequently. Librivox offers free audiobooks on thousands of titles as well.

, Let your child see you reading whenever possible. If you’re not a fan of books, let them see you reading the newspaper or your favorite magazine. Remember that you don’t necessarily have to read classics to show your kids that reading is fun. Pick up a romance novel or a sci-fi thriller if that’s your thing. , Encourage your teen to read more by giving them positive reinforcement when they do. Both teachers and parents can do this. Create sticker charts or keep lists of all the books that your teen reads. Be sure to set attainable goals. You can base the goals on the number of books or the number of pages your teen reads. For younger teens, start out with small goals like 300 pages or 5 chapter-books. For older teens and stronger readers, raise the bar a bit. You might even base the goal for older teens on number of chapters.
If your child reads very slowly or feels frustrated with these goals, you could create a goal based on the amount of time they read instead.
Incentivize carefully. You don’t want to create a system in which your teen ONLY reads for rewards. Consider using a trip to the bookstore (to buy more books your teen loves) as a reward for reading.

Enjoy!",How to Develop an Appetite for Reading," If you try to begin developing your appetite for reading on a one thousand word tome with many complex issues and a huge cast of characters you may find this stops you wishing to further pursue an appetite for reading. Consider trying to read short story collections at first.;
, Do you have a friend who always has his/her nose in a book and may have recommended several books to you in the past? If you ask someone who knows you and reads a lot what books they'd recommend for you this may be easier than trying to find a suitable book yourself. As an additional bonus you will then have a friend to discuss the book with later.

, Some readers can read on a crowded train or even whilst walking down the street but not all can read with distractions and to truly enjoy a book it might be better to read in quiet places where you can give the book your full attention. Consider creating a reading nook for this purpose.

, If you don't enjoy the book you were reading then consider why not. Did you feel it went on too long? Try short stories. Was there too much violence? Stay away from horror and crime. Often people do not have an appetite for reading because they feel they dislike reading, when really they have simply read the wrong books for them. If you did like a book see if you like others by the same author or in the same genre.

, Or read the same book as a friend. This will allow you to share your opinions of the book and enjoy it in a different way. It may also give you the chance to try books you wouldn't have otherwise have thought of reading.

, Having an appetite for reading allows you to get a lot more from books and is an easy hobby to keep.

Know when to stop reading.",How to Consistently Read," You need to pick a book that really interests you (if possible). Even the most passionate readers will struggle through books if they find them boring. Start by figuring out what genre interests you - Fantasy, history, sci-fi, romance, action? Ask a librarian, teacher, or friend for suggestions. Also, look for familiar authors. If you loved ""Winter Garden"" by Kristin Hannah, for example, look for another one of her books. Also, follow up on series. Did you love the first ""Percy Jackson and the Olympians"" book? Why not read the second one? If you're doing a book report in class and the teacher has assigned you a book, you're out of luck, but you can still plough through it!;
, Not everyone has the same reading level and the same attention span when reading books. Read the first page of the book and judge if it is at your reading level. If there are more than five words that you don't know, the book is probably not right for you. You'll want to have a good understanding of the book, which is hard if you don't know half of the words. Also, make sure that the book isn't super-long. If you have a short attention span, don't pick a book that's 700 pages long. Go for a 200 page book instead.

, Depending on the book, sometimes it takes a while for you to get into it. Unless you're a fast reader, don't pick out a book if you only have 1 day to read it. If you're doing a book report, don't procrastinate! Read the book at a regular pace so you'll have it finished by the deadline.

, If you find it really hard to read a book, but you have to do it for a class, tell yourself to read 15 pages a day. Each day, set out 30 minutes to 1 hour to read your book. This works a lot better than cramming in 300 pages the night before your book report is due.

, Read in a quiet, comfortable environment. Read where there is an A/C or cool air and lots of light. If you're reading where there is lots of noise from people or traffic, you won't be able to concentrate on the book. Also, it's best not to read on subways or in cars, as few people are able to do this without getting sick from motion-sickness. A good place to read is in your bedroom, snuggled up under the covers. Also, make sure that there is a good amount of light when you're reading so you don't damage your eyes.

, It's all fine and dandy to read a book, but did you actually understand it? If you had to read the book for class, your teacher may quiz you on the book. Also, some of the material that you read may help you later in life and help you speak more intelligently. If you're having trouble understanding the book, go to CliffsNotes or Sparknotes; they'll help you understand the story a bit more clearly.

, Sometimes people find it easier to use eReaders instead of real books. If possible, use an eReader or an iPad and download a book off of it. For some people, this really helps keep them going.

, If you're doing a class book report, this isn't really an option, but if you're reading for fun, know when to stop. If you're not enjoying the book at all and it hasn't gotten interesting after page 50 or so, stop reading. Don't force yourself to read a book that you hate. Just put the book down and read something else. In a few years, come back to that book you never finished; it may be more interesting than you thought.

Remember that reading is deeply personal.",How to Love Reading1," People read for a wide variety of reasons. Before you pick up a book, consider what you want to get out of reading. Some people like reading books that teach them new skills, from computer programming languages to skills for hunting or camping. Other people enjoy narratives, whether fictional or biographical, to transport them to other times, worlds, or situations. Think first about what you ultimately want to get out of reading.You are much more likely to learn to love reading if you connect with something that seems purposeful to you. If reading is just an exercise or something you feel you “should” like, it’s not likely to have a meaningful impact.;
, Once you know whether you want to learn, be entertained, or something else entirely, you can narrow down types of books based on your answer. For instance, knowing you want an entertaining story alone doesn’t narrow between poetry, literature, popular fiction, memoir, and other types of writing, all of which could provide an entertaining narrative.


Try doing an internet search for popular books in the area that you’ve chosen. This can give you a list of suggestions where you might start.
Consult with your local librarian. Librarians are usually delighted to make reading recommendations. Once you know what you’re “looking for” from your reading, ask your librarian if s/he knows of any books that might suit.
Talk with the employees at your local bookstore. Most people who work at bookstores love reading and love books. They can be a great source of recommendations. Chatting with people who are passionate about reading might even spark a little fire of your own!

, You can narrow down reading choices even more once you’ve picked a general type of writing by considering the genre you want. If you’ve decided on popular fiction, for instance, you can choose between horror, science fiction, historical, fantasy, romance, mystery, or more realist books that take a less whimsical approach to their characters and settings.


As another example, if you decide to want to read nonfiction history books, then consider the time period and subjects that most interest you. A book about D-Day in Normandy during World War II will obviously be a very different reading experience than a book about the politics of the Roman senate around the time of Julius Caesar.

, Even within a particular genre, a particular writer’s style might not work for you due to his/her particular voice. This can be due to when the book was written, the tone, the point of view, or a number of other reasons. If you don’t like a book in the genre you think you should most enjoy, try to narrow down the reason why.


For instance, if you decide you want to read horror novels, older novels such as Frankenstein or Dracula are going to read very differently than Stephen King or Clive Barker novels.

, You may feel very passionately about social issues or something else. Seek out books that connect to the issues about which you are passionate or that frame the issue in a wider context.Remember that you can read more than books, too. Look at print and online magazines, blogs, and other places to find other reading material.

, People sometimes feel obligated to finish a book even when they don’t like it. You’ll develop an aversion to reading rather than a love of it if you try to slog through a 300-page novel that you don’t like. Many books can start slow as they develop the setting and people/characters involved, but if a book hasn’t hooked you within 50-75 pages, then there’s nothing wrong with moving to another one.

, Reading isn’t a competition. It’s a deeply personal, highly subjective activity. There’s no reason why you should feel guilty for not loving that award-winning novel everyone’s talking about. Nor should you feel embarrassed if you truly love something that others may consider “lowbrow,” like comics or romance novels. Read what you love, and don’t compare yourself to anyone else.

Visit the bookstore.",How to Love Reading2," Find a place that is quiet, well-lit, and comfortable. You can even make a reading nook in your room. Constant distractions from the book in front of you can make it hard to concentrate, and no one likes reading the same passages over and over. Finding the proper environment in which to read can be just as important as finding the right book for many people.Sometimes, people may suffer from light sensitivity, which can cause headaches when you read. Avoid high-contrast print, glossy paper, and fluorescent lighting.You don’t have to read only at home, either. Check out the coffee shops, cafes, or bars in your area.

, Try to set aside time to read every day. Even if it just starts as ten minutes on a lunch break, twenty minutes on the bus, and fifteen minutes before bed at night, that’s suddenly forty-five minutes that day you’ve spent reading.You can even turn this into a little game with yourself. Set a daily goal for reading time and give yourself a reward when you hit it. Eventually, you may come to find reading is its own reward.

, You never know when you might find a few extra minutes to read. Sitting in waiting rooms, commuting on public transportation, waiting at a restaurant for a friend to arrive, etc. are all situations where we tend to pull out our phones and send text messages or check Facebook. By having a book in your bag, you can help develop your love of reading.If you have an e-reader, you’ll be able to carry an entire library around with you. The choices are endless.

, Whether it’s in a pocket notebook, a memo on your phone, or someplace else, try to keep a reading list of books you hear about that you want to read.Remembering titles and authors is difficult and drawing a blank once you’re at the bookstore or the library is frustrating. By having a list handy, you’ll always remember what books sounded interesting.


If you’re at the library or bookstore and see a book that intrigues you, snap a photo of the cover. That way, you’ll remember it for later.

, When you find an author whose style you love, try tracking down his or her other books. Even if the plot or subject of the author’s other books doesn't necessarily grab you, loving a particular writing style can lead to enjoyment of books you might not expect. Try looking into the other books of an author you find yourself really enjoying.

, Look into book clubs or reading groups that specialize in the books you enjoy. Reading can be more of a solo activity than watching movies or television shows, but it doesn’t have to be. Books can be just as fun to talk about with others as other media.Finding these groups locally isn’t always easy, so remember to look online for reading communities as well.

, Sometimes school, work, or other obligations might not leave you as much time to read as you’d like. In these situations, try listening to audiobooks to still get your daily dose of books.Even having books read aloud to you will still keep you involved and enthralled with reading during the period where you cannot pick up the actual book.

, Your tax dollars pay for libraries, and you can try out as many books as you would like for free (as long as you remember to return or renew them on time).


Many public libraries even loan out e-books so you can read them from home.

, Bookstores, whether the big chains or intimately used book shops, are also great places to browse if you prefer to own your books. Sometimes being surrounding by cases and cases of books is all it takes to reignite your passion for picking up a few new ones.

Offer a choice.,
Provide an environment that fosters reading.,
Encourage creativity.,
Be supportive and encouraging.",How to Love Reading3," One reason many students and young people don’t enjoy reading is that they feel it is always “required,” and never a choice. If you can offer them a choice of reading that takes their interests into account, they’re more likely to learn to love reading.A choice of how to read can also be helpful. For example, in-class reading periods can be very helpful for some students, while others need to be at home alone in their rooms to focus.
A choice of what to read can help young people understand that reading doesn’t always mean dry or boring. In addition to the classics, provide options such as magazines and comics.

, If your home doesn’t have many books or other reading materials, it will be more difficult for your child to see reading as something enjoyable that s/he could do even in leisure time. Keep interesting, fun books around your home.Set a good example by reading yourself. If your children see you enjoying a good book, they may be more likely to pick one up themselves.
Try reading together as a family. Creating a positive association between reading and family fun time can help take the pressure off of young people to “perform” in their reading.
Create a “reading space,” either in your classroom or your home. It should not have other distractions and should be a pleasant little retreat where the child can enjoy reading.
Use books as rewards. Offer to take your child on a trip to the bookstore to pick out a few new books as a reward for chores or good performance in school. Help your child see that reading can be something that’s fun and rewarding.

, There’s no reason that the story has to end when the back cover shuts. Encourage young people to engage with their reading creatively.For example, you could encourage students or your own children to draw scenes from what they read.
Performing reading in funny character voices can provide extra drama to reading.
Ask questions about how children feel about the reading.
Encourage them to think about what might happen next in the story, or write their own continuation.
Ask them to create a movie poster highlighting what they think is the most important element from the book.

, One reason children may feel uncomfortable reading is that they worry they don’t understand what they read or will get the “wrong” answer. Be supportive and encouraging of young readers.Never tell a young reader that his/her opinion or interpretation is “wrong.” Instead, ask the child how s/he came to this opinion. This will help her/him articulate how she formed her ideas and will help teach him/her about how to hone reading skills.
If a young reader tells you that s/he is having trouble understanding, be patient. Don’t make the child feel stupid or ignorant for not “getting” the material. Instead, ask questions to find out where the confusion is, and guide the child into stronger skills.
Accept every comment, no matter how “wrong” or inaccurate it may seem, as a valuable contribution. Remember that it can be terrifying for young or inexperienced readers to even offer their opinions. If the idea is inaccurate or needs correcting, ask further questions about it rather than rejecting it out of hand.

There are plenty of other interesting books out there, though, and you can work your way up to more difficult material over time.


Some people like to begin by reading the novel versions of movies that they’ve enjoyed. From ‘’Fight Club’’ to ‘’The Hunger Games’’, you will find that many movies are actually based on books. One method of determining what kind of book you will like is to figure out what it is that drives you to frequent certain movies or TV shows. People who like biopics usually like biographies. If you like psychological thrillers, you might like murder mysteries or horror stories. If plot drives you, a lot of fiction is suitable for your tastes.
If you don’t like fictional stories, try non-fiction. You will learn about real things that happened, gain insights into science, history, other cultures, or what people are doing to try to solve problems in the world, and explore interesting ideas by great thinkers.;
, Ask people whose taste you trust-- people who like the same music, tv or movies as you. Ask them about what their favorite books or authors are.


Asking people you know is a good way to start out-- they can often lend you the books that they enjoyed the most.
If you like an author that a friend recommends, stick with them! It’s the best way to keep on reading.

, Start with the best of the best! If they ended up on a list of great books for the year, a lot of people must have read and liked them so you can probably find something you like there too.


Some awards are based on what people are actually reading rather than what critics choose. This may be the best place to start since you know that the many people have enjoyed these books.Award lists that are selected by writers, critics, librarians, and book sellers can give you an idea of what is going on in the literary world., Don’t put yourself in a place where you will be self conscious or experience interruptions.


Libraries are designed for finding great books and reading! You can grab a book and get started right away in the quiet of your local library branch.
Go to a park or somewhere outdoors. If you associate reading with oppressive indoor settings, going outdoors can be a great way to break up the monotony.Try walking on the treadmill with a book. Some people simply cannot sit still while reading. Some studies say that you can remember more later if you read while walking on the treadmill, and the jolt of dopamine you get from multitasking may encourage you to keep reading., Many people think that they do not have time to read, but the truth is that they just have not found the time. Some easy tweaks may add an hour or so per day of extra time.


If you normally have down time before or after work (extra time waking up or winding down), you can make reading a part of that routine. If you spend time checking your email or playing games as a matter of routine, put your book by your laptop or on the couch to remind you to read instead.
Small adjustments make a difference. Getting up a little earlier can make time for reading in your breakfast routine. Getting to the gym earlier can make an extra half-hour for reading before bed.

, Goal-oriented reading is less pleasurable than relaxed reading. You will feel happier after reading if it is done without any stress on finding information or reading a certain number of pages. Go to bed a half hour or hour earlier than usual, so that you have time to read before you get too tired.
Be aware that the light from an e-reader device may disrupt your sleep. A real book might be a better option before bed., This is not the most relaxed way of reading, but if you are an on-the-go type, it’s a good way to fit reading in without having to shift your schedule too much.


If you spend a long time commuting, bring a book instead of plugging into your phone.
If you usually eat lunch alone, you can take the time to enjoy a chapter or two while you eat. If you eat out for lunch, try packing your lunch instead. This will free up a surprising amount of time.

, Once you've chosen or found the time to read, keep media from cutting into your precious half hour. Every time you look at something new, you get a jolt of dopamine-- the neurotransmitter that makes cocaine so addictive. Forcing yourself away from screens will allow you to pursue the long-term enjoyment and deeper understanding that books offer.


Turn your phone completely off. You might be shocked at how often you reach for it and check your lock screen to find it completely black.This serves as a good reminder to stay focused on your book.
Completely get away from your laptop or television. A click of the remote or trackpad will bring you back into the digital world, and you can get stuck there for an incredibly long time.
Use your local library. Libraries are built to be quiet, distraction-free places to read. Use them to their fullest! , You can skim while you read too! Reading avidly can sometimes mean that you find any way to make things easier for yourself.


Skim the beginning paragraphs of a few chapters of a book before you commit to it. If the story or style grabs you, it’s probably a good fit.
You may find yourself in the middle of a book you really enjoy, but has taken a dry turn. Read topic sentences and final paragraphs so that you get the general idea. Read quickly until you reach a part that holds your interest.

, You might like the feel of having an actual book in your hands and turning real pages. If you don’t like carrying around and keeping track of too many things, you may like the convenience of using an e-reader device.


If you use productivity apps on a tablet, you will probably like the convenience of e-books. Downloading your books mean that you have many books in one place. If you already carry a tablet, you won’t have to carry a book as well.
If you prefer to go to the library and browse actual books, and enjoy the feeling of turning pages, you probably want to stick to real books.

, Having books around, whether electronic or real, to browse and choose from will inspire you to read.


Use your library. Take advantage of the fact that you can check out multiple books and return them if nothing grabs you.
If there are books that you have that you’ve been meaning to read, leave them out! They will serve as a reminder, and you are more likely to pick them up if you are looking for something to do.
Purchase books for your tablet online or check out an eBook from your local library. , You don’t want to waste time reading something that isn’t for you, and struggling through a book just to get it done might derail your efforts to become an avid reader altogether.


Gather a few possibilities and read the first chapter or two of each one, then choose the one that grabs you.If you feel stuck or bored, try something different! Just because you like biographies doesn’t mean you wouldn’t enjoy some light fiction with a little less substance. It might just provide the break you need to go back to the weightier stuff later.Use the fifty page rule. If you’ve started a book and don’t like it, you might still feel weird about stopping cold. Fifty pages is usually enough of the book to figure out whether or not it’s worth it for you to keep reading. If it seems like a chore, don’t do it. There are plenty of books out there for you to enjoy.

, A reading log is a good way to look back on what you’ve read and to keep track of things that you want to read.A log can be a list on your phone, a pinterest board, or a physical notebook. Just make sure that it’s something that you’re likely to keep around or remember.
Keep an ongoing list of what you’ve read: a simple list of titles and author’s names. If you particularly liked a book, mark it. Also keep a list of recommendations and things that you want to read.
If you’re the note-taking type, keep summaries and memorable quotes in the notebook as well. This will provide you with concrete examples of your progress and remind you of the knowledge and information that your reading has given you.

, Having regular meetings on your calendar and knowing that you’ll need to be able to talk intelligently with other people about a book is a great incentive to keep reading.


Depending on where you live, you may have many genres to choose from. Try sticking to your favorite genre first, just to make sure that you stay on track. You can branch out after you’ve gotten into the swing of things.
If you can’t find any near you, you can start your own. You can use facebook or meetup to create groups easily.

, The public library systems in many states or larger cities often choose one book and encourage as many people as possible to read it at the same time. The usually include programs like book talks and other events where you can join a discussion.If you do this with friends, it can be easier to stay on track, and you’ll have someone to talk to about the book.

, You can look for a broader forum that discusses multiple kinds of books, or you can pursue a specific artist or genre.


On social media forums like Goodreads, you can see what your friends are reading, read book reviews, and keep track of your own reading so you can see your progress. There is also an option to find books related to ones you’ve liked as well, which makes finding new books easy.

, If you can’t remember what you’ve read right after you finish it, you may get discouraged. Taking notes ensures that you can quickly remember what you’ve read, even after you’ve forgotten it.Take brief summary notes at the end of each chapter to ensure that you can look back and recall what you’ve read.
If taking notes interrupts your reading flow, mark key paragraphs with a check mark or star. Later, you can go back to these starred paragraphs and take notes on them for yourself.

, Many people highlight the first sentence of a paragraph. Sometimes the first sentence is the right one to emphasize, but in other cases, only looking at the first sentence of a paragraph can leave out key information.


Don’t mark up any specific sentences or words right away. Be patient and wait until the final sentence before deciding. If the paragraph seems important right away, mark it with a star.
After a difficult or inspiring paragraph, pause for a moment. Explain to yourself what you have read, out loud or in your head. Then summarize that in the margin or on a separate piece of paper.

, Reading out loud is a great trick for people who are auditory learners. It also works any time that you may be having difficulty with the language of the book.


You may feel a little bit silly if you are alone, but don’t let it stop you. You’ll soon get into the rhythm and forget your circumstances.
If you are in public, try covering your ears and mouthing the words. This usually goes unnoticed, and is not really odd behavior for someone reading in a public place.

, It’s ok not to read the entire book, especially if it is non-fiction. By taking a moment before reading to locate key information, you can save yourself time.


Use the table of contents to locate what you’re looking for. If you’ve skimmed over a few paragraphs, check for summary words (in conclusion, in summary, furthermore) and pay particular attention to that paragraph.
Before you start reading, perform a quick check of a chapter. Take note of its title and any subheadings. Read the first and last paragraph, and check the topic sentences of the body paragraphs. Try to determine from these things the main idea of the chapter and the author’s intention. "

Read for content. When you read, read for the main idea of each paragraph, along with its supporting reasons. When building up lapsed reading skills, it can be helpful to read with a pencil in hand to take notes or underline the key idea of each paragraph.
Look up unfamiliar words. Merriam Webster online is a wonderful and thorough resource for defining unfamiliar words. Simply underline or make a list of unfamiliar words. When you reach a good stopping point, return to each word and look it up, re-reading the sentence it appeared in. This helps contextualize the word and its usage in case there are multiple meanings.Learn to appreciate context. When encountering unfamiliar words or ideas, often the literary, historical, or social context of the text can offer clues as to what the character or writer is talking about. This may require a small amount of outside research to become informed on the different levels of context presented by a text.Become familiar with literary devices. Particularly if you are a fan of novels and short stories, becoming familiar with common literary tactics is an important part being a better reader. Understanding common tools like metaphor, hyperbole, parallel structure, personification, and alliteration can enrich the reading experience significantly.Don't rush. Reading for learning and enjoyment is never a sprint. Instead, take your time, nurture your skills and their development at your own pace. Do not get discouraged if you are a slow reader, especially at first. Each day, as you read, your mind will take the reading tactics it learned before and apply them again, often with greater efficiency.;
, A basketball player can't practice if she doesn't have her ball and sneakers ready. Reading is the same as any other skills. Below are some suggested ways of always having fresh reading material nearby:


Get subscriptions: Trade or special interest magazines are a good way of keeping current reading material nearby. There are also literary magazines like Harper’s or The New Yorker for fiction and creative writing.
Go to the library: Even the smallest town has a library full of books, free to check out. If you haven’t already, get your library card and see what your own local libraries have to offer.
Consider an e-Reader. Barnes and Noble, as well as Amazon, have e-Readers and a substantial selection of digital books for sale or loan. Libraries often offer free e-book loans, too.
Look online. Websites through university libraries often offer the full-texts of pre-copyright literary works online. For example, ""Project Gutenberg,"" currently hosted by Ibiblio through the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, currently contains nearly 50,000 essays, novels, novellas, and short stories and adds an average of 50 new novels a week., It is easier to grow your reading skills if you make reading a part of your daily schedule. Below are a few ways this can be accomplished.


Join a book club. These usually meet weekly or bi-monthly and are a good way of motivating you to read and also meeting people who are also committed to good reading habits. Book clubs also give you to ability to talk about what you read and the benefit of talking to multiple intelligent and interested readers.Download a news aggregator. There are several free services like Feedly or Digg that will let you follow online blogs, newspapers, and magazines through a browser-based platform that also organizes what you read into folders and sorts based on “read” vs. “unread” items.Find a time and place to read. Do you have a favorite table in a coffee shop, or a quiet corner of your own home where you like to curl up and relax? Find a place that is conducive to your own reading habit. Set aside regular time to enjoy your spot and always bring along your current reading.
Set daily or weekly goals. There is no prescribed speed at which to finish a book of magazine; however, if you are an ambitious reader, and have a list of reading your are itching to tackle, setting reasonable reading goals is a good way of satisfying your ambitions. For example, set a goal that you will read for an hour a day, or that you will read one chapter of your current book, or 10 pages of your current magazine.

, Reading can be more interesting and satisfying when we read about topics that we care about.


Seek out blogs, books, and magazines that pertain to your own hobbies and interests in order to incentivize reading and maximize enjoyment.

, Word of mouth is often a useful tool to direct our reading choices.


Talk to friends or find readers online with common interests. Find out what books they’ve enjoyed.
Goodreads.com is a good resource for getting book recommendations with thoughtful descriptions.Visit your local bookstore, if you have one. Most bookstore employees love reading and will be happy to recommend their favorites. If you have an independent or used bookstore, that's even better.

, Part of being a good reader is knowing what good writing looks like. Experience for yourself the books that have shaped Western history, while also considering: How to expand that search and look for books that are classics in other parts of the world as well.
Discover how each generation of writer claims, owns, and reinterprets the crucial facts of history for their own generation.

, They say everyone is a critic and that taste is relative; however, trends develop because certain instances of culture become resonant or relevant for many people at once. Some of the benefits of reading book reviews are:Developing a new set of reading skills. Reading criticism is a different sort of animal from reading fiction or non-fiction. Grow your skills in learning to understand the purpose and usefulness of literary criticism.
Getting info about a book without having to buy it. Reviews are a good way to anticipate and reject prospective book purchases. They are also a good way of learning how to articulate your own tastes as a reader.
Starting an informed conversation. Perhaps you and your book club have just read a book that got a mediocre review in the New York Times. Bring the review in and mention the key points the critic mentions. See what the others think. Develop your own opinion about the book.

, It’s important to keep track of the books, magazines, and blogs that incite our interest so that, when our current book is done, we know what to move on to. Goodreads.com is a good place to keep track of this; however, even a page in a personal journal is a good spot to keep track of what we hope to read in the future.

, Schools, nursing homes, correctional facilities, and even shelters for the homeless all appreciate the services of volunteer readers. Acting as a volunteer reader is an important service because:


Not every child gets the parental time at home required to build good reading habits. In single parent homes with multiple children, it can be difficult for a parent to give individualized reading assistance to a child who is struggling. Acting as a volunteer means that you can shape a child’s educational future and professional prospects.Not every adult can read. For a variety of different reasons, there are people who reach adulthood without training in literacy, which curtails job prospects and the ability to live independently. As a volunteer reader for adults, you can have a positive impact on the life and self-esteem of persons in need.You can enable life-long learning. For elderly persons with vision problems, reading may no longer be an option. Especially if they enjoyed reading earlier in life, having someone come and read to them is not only a learning experience. It can offer companionship, friendship, and a mutual exchange of education.Some communities may also have a volunteer program where you can record textbooks and other written material for people who are blind or dyslexic to listen to., Look online, through resources like paperbackswap.com, or locate a used bookstore in your area that participates in a book swap.Especially if you like reading pop fiction, romance novels, or sci-fi, book swaps are a useful and inexpensive way to keep your bookshelf full.

, Want to learn about new authors and meet authors you already know? Book festivals are a great opportunity for both. They also provide other benefits, including:


Books for sale. Publishers and book vendors come out to book festivals and often offer sales on books by the authors appearing at the festival.
Get a book signed. Especially if an author has just been published, they are often asked to appear at book festivals to promote their work. Book signings will let you enjoy literacy and create an heirloom at the same time.
Enjoy being read to. Festivals often have guest authors read passages from their more recent works or will host public readings to incite interest in or memorialize talented authors.

, A reading blog is a good way to remember books you enjoyed, write criticism of books you didn’t, and keep track of what you’ve already read. Additionally, a reading blog can:


Help you meet people. Make your entries public and let random people from across the internet enjoy and even comment on your thoughts.
Practice writing. Reading and writing are two halves of the same coin. Being able to write well, and even emulate writing styles you enjoy, is a good exercise. It also requires becoming your own editor, reading back over what you’ve written to ensure quality and precision

, If you enjoy reading in your own language, choose a new language to learn. You can start reading in another language by:


Getting a dictionary in the selected language. Check one out from the library or purchase a copy from a bookstore.
Beginning with children’s books. Books for young school-aged children are composed of simple, straight-forward passages and have basic vocabulary pertaining to common, easily translatable life-events. Learning to read at this basic level can prepare you to tackle more advanced readings.Picking up a poetry translation. Pick a well-known poet in the language you’ve chosen to learn and find a version of their book that includes versions in their native language alongside a version in your native language. Read slowly and carefully, comparing the translation to the original version. See how certain concepts have been translated along with the language used to describe them. This is an effective way of understanding not just a new language, but a new culture as well. "

For now, choose books on topics that are relevant to you and that you'll find fascinating. For example, the sports lover can read books on football, sports car racing or running. The hobbyist can read a book about collecting, restoring or making things. The fashion lover can read books about clothes, fashion history or makeup tips. Choose according to your likes!;
, Reading well can get you into a good college. Getting educated at a good college can help you understand the world better, through knowing more things. Knowing more things can set you in good stead for earning money, finding interesting work and offering your expertise to a wide range of people. Knowing how to learn by yourself and research in fields that aren't your expertise can help you to survive during harder times, by thinking laterally and using your skills in a transferable way. A non-reader is less able to succeed at doing this due to the lack of access to the broader knowledge reading offers you.


If making tons of money isn't the single most important thing to you (and really, it shouldn't be), know that reading enhances your knowledge of the world around you. The development of language, and its ability to communicate ideas is probably one of the single most important parts of human development. The ability to record an idea or a thought, and then allow another person to visualize that idea, either with words or pictures, is absolutely amazing, and it is one of the greatest pillars of civilization.
Being able to access the thoughts, ideas and musings of people who have long gone and of your contemporaries has to be one of the most amazing and miraculous things about books and reading. You can learn from rely upon and even ""befriend"" the people whose knowledge you soak up from books.

, Learning to write, and especially to read, enables you to understand and experience nearly all of the ideas that have ever been communicated in your native language. This is empowerment, and it is a form of freedom that is invaluable.

, Not everything you read is worth reading. Being a discerning reader means choosing the books with care and avoiding books that fill your head with anxiety or irritation. In some cases, reading too much of a genre of books that leaves you feeling empty or unhappy can cause you to hate all reading, and that's a terrible outcome! Instead, always be sure to choose books that are well written, contain good content and don't talk down to you. To this end:


Cultivate your inner critic. Read critically––do you believe what the author is asking you to believe? Do you think the author has substantiated his or her claims?
Learn to distance yourself from things the author says that you don't agree with, without discarding the whole book. Sometimes you'll see eye-to-eye on some things, but disagree on others. That's good––it means you're thinking critically and not buying into everything the author says. Also, learn to recognize the author's own experience trying to act as a universal experience––when you can see this happening (and it is a frequent slip-up), accept it for what it is (the author's experience) and don't feel you have to apply it to yourself.
Read books you don't agree with. Spend a little time reading things you find confronting. This will help you to learn about alternative perspectives and expands your mind. Don't feel threatened––feel empowered to be able to argue better with the proponents of alternative view, as you can demonstrate you know where they're coming from––it's just that you still don't agree!
Calm your inner worrier. Many of us read to find out ways to lead a better life––namely, the self-help genre. Unfortunately, much of this genre is about being better through making more money, as if being rich is the only means to happiness. This kind of thinking can make you feel unfulfilled and unhappy. Question any book that leaves you feeling less worthy or insists that you base your happiness on striving for things that are unrealistic.

, Allowing your mind to wander when reading is a major cause of giving up on reading. Put aside all thoughts of undone chores, things you'd rather be doing or the people you haven't yet texted this week. Commitment requires:


Setting aside distinct reading time. You can stop when the time's up but during that time, devote yourself to the book.
If you catch yourself daydreaming while scanning the words, gently remind yourself to come back to the present and dive right back into that book.
Avoid setting yourself ""so many chapters before I finish"" rules. Going by time is much gentler on yourself than treating the book as a chore of chapter checking off.

, There's no need to put aside a good read., Using your imagination to form the places, people and actions you're reading about will help you understand what's going on more easily. Much of this will come naturally, as your mind tries to build the places, people and situations you're reading about from what you already know. For what you don't know, your imagination will cobble together all sorts of fantastical images. Let this happen and enjoy the process because it's your own inner world jumping out alive from the pages––and it's fun.


Just beware of books that are made into movies. Your imagination will create one thing, while the movie will completely turn that upside down. It can be disconcerting and is one reason why many people who love a book will choose not to see a movie made from it.

, Get a notebook. Record your own thoughts, reactions and ideas as you read. It is an amazing experience at the end of a book, or even months or years later, to read back over your notes and see the things that mattered most to you. It's likely you'll discover that each book you've taken notes about has impacted your thinking more than you've cared to acknowledge. This is how you expand your mind and keep it receptive to new ideas and ways of seeing the world.

, This is a fun way to keep you interested. You may be right; then again, you may be wrong. It's always fun to have the author lead you on a merry dance, only to give you a very unexpected twist when you were sure of a different outcome.

, Put yourself ""in the book."" What would you do in the same or similar situations? Would you want to be like a character? Would you want to do the things the book explores or teaches you about? Can you see yourself in the same place or position as the biographer in years to come? By putting yourself into the shoes of the characters or author, or by visualizing yourself undertaking the suggested actions in a book, you can get a great deal more meaning from your read.

, Today's culture focuses on end results (and speedily done too). But with reading, focusing on the end will get you nowhere. You aren't reading to ""finish a book"" and tally it off. It's much more about the experience, the progress, the journey itself. Pause and imagine scenes taking place, and let yourself get excited and frustrated with the characters! Reflect about the plot (or lack of it) and how it makes you feel. When you do reach the end, spend some time thinking about where you'd take the story and characters next if you were to author the sequel.

, What can make content interesting is often defined in the delivery. Try reading out loud sometimes, putting emphasis into what you're reading.


Where you read can influence your enthusiasm. Find somewhere calm, quiet and comfortable for a good read. It is best to find a spot where you won't be distracted. If you have a pet that likes to cuddle up to you, this can be a lovely time to spend together peacefully.

Use a bookmark to prevent losing your place.,
Read certain pages several times if you don't fully understand them.,
Avoid reading important material late at night.,
Find a calming place to read.,
Take notes as you go along.,
Get involved with the book.,
Forgive yourself for neglecting the book.",How to Finish Reading a Book," Making dog ears, slipping the cover sleeve into place, or keeping the book upside down open to that page, are all certain ways of losing your place and therefore making the whole delving back into the book seem too hard. By using a bookmark, you won't only be certain of your place in the book, but it will also serve as a psyching mechanism, showing you that you've already reached that far in reading it, so why not keep going.;
, There is nothing wrong in doing this; it shows dedication, not dullness. Indeed, Benjamin Franklin taught himself good comprehension and writing structure by reorganizing the writings he read in the Spectator when he didn't understand them, scrambling the notes and making himself look at the scrambles of original writing weeks later to recreate the essay.



Distractions such as too many thoughts whirling about, noise around you, people making demands of you, and feeling unwell can all make for hard comprehension when reading. Find quiet times without such distractions and you'll take in the information much better.

, However awake you may think you feel, your brain is more active first thing in the morning or later morning. Early evening and night would be a more suitable time for general reading. If you must read more technical information for studies or work, try to leave the harder elements for morning reading when you're most refreshed, and the lighter aspects or revising for evenings. It may well be worth getting up earlier for!


Try to schedule a set time each day to return to the book. If this isn't possible, schedule set times per week. Read at least a chapter at a time, breaking it down into digestible chunks and finishing at logical end points.

, Make sure you don't have too many distractions like the sound of the television, radio, or other family members going about their daily business. If you have a particular favorite corner or chair, make this your ""reading corner.""

, If you have a bad memory or want to stay on track with the material you're covering, take simple notes in a notebook after each chapter or after each topic is covered. Refer back to this often.


If it's your own book and you don't mind writing in it, annotate in graphite pencil in the margins, using key words or symbols that help you to rediscover the information fast when needed. A well annotated book is a treasure for its owner.

, Imagine yourself in the situations described, put yourself in the characters' shoes. If it's a scientific or technical book, what can you do to prove to yourself the information is correct? What experiments could you do? Use your creativity to keep your interest in your reading. For other non-fiction, think about how the things you're learning inform your daily life. Even imagine yourself trying to help the character if you want!

, Tossing aside an unfinished book as ""too much trouble"" or ""not worth the effort"" because you feel a sense of guilt at not reading it, or a loathing to begin again, is a common problem. However, by forgiving yourself for not attending to reading it and letting yourself reread already read parts of the book without worrying too much that they're retracing old ground, you can get over any feelings that it's too much trouble and you may discover new insights by plowing back into the book. There is nothing quite so delightful as realizing you're glad you persevered with the unfinished book and discovered some new insights into your world and life!"

, If you don't care much for reading, reading in bed, or on a comfy couch may not be a good idea. You don't want to fall asleep!

, Try to dedicate certain times for your reading. Also, try to stick to those times.


Chose the timing for reading wisely. Reading right before bed may not be the best time for a non-reader. Try the morning, or during meals.
Read in spurts, ten minutes here, twenty there. Don't spend all day with a book if you don't have the time.

, Make notes in the margins, and ask yourself questions about what you've just read. The questions can be rhetorical, the idea is to turn the page into a grounds for thinking, books don't mind if you write on them.


Use highlighters, page tabs, and favorite pens/bookmarks. Believe it or not, this makes reading more study than tedious work.
Write a summary or take down quotations of passages with special meaning to you.
Write a piece of your own inspired by or in the style of what you have read. Reading can be an excellent inspiration and guide towards writing.

Keep quotations short and sweet.,
Write the conclusion.,
Proofread, proofread, proofread!!",How to Write a Reader Response," Becoming familiar with the questions before you begin the assigned will help you know what to look for and think about as you read. If the questions are not specified, use the following questions to guide your reading:


Do you like or dislike the text?
Can you identify the author's purpose?
Do you agree or disagree with the author?
Does the text relate to you and your life? If so, how? If not, why not?
Does the text agree with, or go against your personal world view?
What, if anything, did you learn from the text?;
, To write a good reader response paper, it is important to read the text fully and carefully. Take your time and think about how the text is making you feel and why. Take lots of notes. Bookmark important passages that you think you might use when you write your response, or write down page numbers of key sections.


Taking a bit of extra time during this phase will save you a lot of time in the writing process., Before you begin writing, it is helpful to take some time to think about the text as a whole, and formulate an overall impression of the work. Did you love it? Did you hate it? Is there something about it that really bothered you, or really spoke to you? Completing some or all of these sample statements can help you with this process. After reading the text:I think that . . .
I feel that . . .
I see that . . .
I have learned that . . .

, A good reader response paper must have a clear thesis statement or overall argument. If the assignment specified a central question to focus on in your response, the answer to that question should become your thesis statement. If not, your thesis should address you overall impression of the book.An example thesis statement might look like the following:


""Even though I found The Scarlett Letter hard to follow at times, Hester Prynne's story is still relatable, and made me think a lot about the effects of publicly shaming people online.""
""Some people believe the Old Man and the Sea is a book about failure, but it is really a story of perseverance that teaches us that success may not always come in the form we expect, and even disasters can lead to positive outcomes.""

, You will need to follow the directions for your specific assignment, but most reader response papers are about 2-3 pages long, and use the following general outline:


Introduction: 1 paragraph.
Analysis/Body Paragraphs: 3-4 paragraphs. How you organize these paragraphs will depend on the parameters of the assignment.
Conclusion: 1 paragraph.

, These should support your thesis statement, and provide clear examples of the kinds of things you want to talk about in your analysis. Is there a key bit of dialogue that really captures the protagonist's personality? Is there a scene that reminded you of something from your personal life, or taught you how you might handle a specific situation?

, Make sure that the introduction clearly specifies the name of both the text and the author. It should also include some description of the text, and what it's about. The Introduction should end with your thesis statement or argument.

, You should write 3-4 paragraphs that discuss the text and the reading questions in depth. You don't necessarily have to answer each question in order. Multiple questions can be combined and addressed in a single paragraph, or reordered in a way that flows well and makes sense to you.


It is often helpful to use the first body paragraph to include more information about the text, the plotline, major themes, etc., and then use the rest of the paragraphs to provide an analysis of how you felt about the text.

, As you write your paper, think about explaining not just how you felt about the text, but why it made you feel a certain way. (""Chapter 2 made me feel uncomfortable 3 because . . . "") Don't just state that the text taught you a lot, give an example of something you actually learned. (""I learned that sometimes we don't realize how our actions affect others . . . "")


Remember that a reader response is meant to be personal, so it's OK to incorporate personal anecdotes and opinions into your analysis.
Example: ""Forcing Hester Prynne to wear the scarlet ""A"" reminded me of a time when I was cyber-bullied in eighth grade, and my ""friends"" spread rumors about me online where the whole school could see.""

, Each body paragraph should include at least 1-2 specific examples from the text. These don't all have to be direct quotations. For example, you might simply describe a particular event or passage in the text.


Example: ""At the end of The Old Man and the Sea, Manolin promises to once again fish with Santiago, so the old man no longer has to be alone. This was Santiago's greatest wish, but it was a different kind of success than he initially set out to achieve.""

, Resist the temptation to string together multiple multi-line quotes, and make sure to include at least one sentence after each quote explaining how it relates to the point you are making.


Example: ""'My big fish must be somewhere,' said Santiago. This is exactly how I felt after I received my third rejection letter, but like Santiago, I kept trying, and eventually I was accepted.""
Make sure and cite your examples per class directions. You will usually be required to note the page numbers of any quotations or specific examples in parentheses at the end of the sentence.

, This should be one paragraph that summarizes your arguments so far, and brings the reader back to your thesis or main point.


A great way to think of your conclusion is that it's one last chance to explain to your reader how you see all of your points fitting together.

, Make sure and give your paper a thorough once-over, looking for typos, grammatical errors, and things that don't quite make sense.


Sometimes it's hard to see our own mistakes, so it can really help to exchange papers with a friend, and proofread each other's work.

Make sure you have the right manual in front of you.,
Look for specific sections detailing the type of service or repair you are going to perform.,
Read the Table of Contents to search for general topics.,
Look in the Index for key words or phrases related to the specific task you intend to perform if it is not covered in the Table of Contents.

,
Read the section which describes the task you are undertaking before you actually start.,
Look for specific warnings.,
Look for references to specific tools, gauges, or other specialized equipment required to perform your maintenance or repair.,
Try using other, ""outside"" resources mentioned in the manual for repairs or problems that the maintenance manual does not thoroughly cover.,
Obtain related manuals if you plan to do extensive work on your equipment.,
Follow instructions carefully when performing any maintenance until you are familiar with the procedure.,
Put a tab or bookmark on pages that you refer to frequently.

",How to Use a Maintenance Manual," This may seem obvious, and often it is, but since there are many similar pieces of equipment, and information may vary from one piece to another, check your manual to be sure you are using the right one. An example of similarly titled manuals might be: A Case 580C tractor is very different from a Case 580K, as is a 580K and a 580 Super K.;
, Here are some you may find in common equipment:


Lubrication. This section will describe the lubricating locations on the machine, the types of lubricants to use, and the capacities, if applicable, for each lubricant.
Inspection. Here you will find instructions for inspecting the equipment or machine. This may include electrical wiring inspections for damage or broken parts, corroded connectors, or blown fuses. You may find details regarding inspecting bearings, belts, hoses, or other items, depending on the equipment in question.
Scheduled maintenance. Here you will find a calendar-type schedule for regular maintenance. On heavy equipment it may include changing the oil, oil filters, or air filters, etc. On a smaller machine (like a sewing machine) there may be periodic, scheduled maintenance for lubricated, moving parts. Other equipment like air-conditioning systems have belts, bearings, filters, and coils which require routine, scheduled maintenance.
Troubleshooting tips. Most maintenance manuals have a section covering troubleshooting tips, which are helpful in diagnosing mechanical problems in almost any machine. Rather than randomly replacing parts to correct a problem, you can scan the tips for a description of the problem you are experiencing, which will be accompanied by a list of possible causes.
Specifications. This section, if your manual includes it, will give you facts about the machine's capabilities, performance, and capacities and may include a description of its size, weight, power and fuel requirements.

, On an automobile, for instance, the Owner's Manual (which may contain a very basic maintenance manual) will have topics such as ""Optional Equipment"" and ""Vehicle Care.""

,, This will help you understand what is involved and what tools you'll need to have on hand.

, Working on a machine with an internal combustion engine or equipment which uses compressed gases or other hazardous material requires caution and awareness of dangers and risks involved.

, Some of these are specific to only one type or (occasionally) model of machine. If you use the machine regularly, it may be worthwhile to invest in any tools or equipment used in servicing and repairing it.

, Many manuals include toll-free phone numbers and web addresses.

, These include parts manuals, service manuals, and publications covering diagnostics and specifications. These are sometimes available on CDs or DVDs from the manufacturer, and some websites specialize in selling downloadable copies at greatly reduced cost.

, Recheck your work, and test it if possible.

Reward yourself.",How to Prepare for Summer Reading," Whether required, optional, or just for fun you will want to review or create a list of titles to read over the summer. By knowing exactly what you can expect to read over the summer you will be able to obtain all the necessary titles and create a reading schedule. If you have the freedom to pick your own books, choose ones that you will love, making your summer reading fun and enjoyable.Some books might be required reading. These should take priority over any personal reading goals.
Optional and personal reading goals can take any form you want them to. Pick some of your favorite types of books to create a fun summer of reading.;
, Before you start to read the books found on your summer reading list you will need to obtain them. There are a few methods you can use to obtain your books including a visit to your local library, shopping at a book store, or purchasing the books from an on-line vendor. Whichever method you choose make sure to get your books as soon as possible so that you have enough to time to read them over the summer.Libraries are a great place to find the books you need and won't cost you any money.
Book stores can be a fast way to find any books you might need and want to keep.
Shopping on-line is an easy way to find books. However, you will have to wait for them to ship to your house and will likely need a credit or debit card to purchase them.
Both libraries and online vendors offer e-Books which can be instantly downloaded to your tablet, e-reader, computer or other digital device.

, Once you have your books you will want to create a schedule for your summer reading. Having a good schedule will help keep you on track and ensure that you finish all of your reading by the time summer is over.Find out exactly how much you have to read over the summer and break that total up into daily and easy to meet goals.
For example, let's say you have four books to read and each book has 100 pages. This means you have 400 pages total to read over your summer break.
Think about how long your summer break is. Most summer breaks are around 90 days.
You will have to read 400 pages in 90 days then. Dividing 400 by 90 results in a reading goal of at least 5 pages a day.
Don't forget to leave time for fun and breaks in your schedule. You might not want to read on the weekends, requiring you to read more during the days you are reading.

, Not everyone has the same reading style. Some people prefer a certain type of environment around them that helps them focus on what they are reading. Ask yourself some of the following questions to find out what environments might be a good fit for your reading style:Do you like to have music or some other sounds in the background while you read?
Do you need an absolutely quiet space to focus on what you are reading?
Do you read better in a brightly lit space or somewhere with low lighting?
Multitasking is a myth. You cannot focus on your reading and something else (like TV or Facebook) at the same time. Make sure your reading style helps you focus on your reading., Once you have discovered your own personal reading style and preferences you will need to either find or create a space that meets those needs. Making a great reading space will help you to focus and fully enjoy your summer reading.Your can easily set up your own room to meet your reading needs.
If you like a lot of background noise you might enjoy reading in a café or coffee shop.
Libraries can be quiet places that are generally brightly lit and free from loud or distracting noises.
A public park can be a good spot to enjoy your summer reading.

, As you work through your summer reading you will want to make sure that you are sticking to the schedule you have created for yourself. Check your schedule at the end of each day to make sure you are meeting your goals and to ensure that you will be able to complete all of your reading before the end of summer.


Review your goals at the end of each day to see if you have read the amount you had planned.
At the end of the day review your goals for the upcoming day so you know what to expect.
If you find yourself falling behind try to read more the next day in order to catch up.
Try to read at least a little bit every day.

, As you read your books over the summer try talking about them with friends and family. Talking about what you read is a great way to share the interesting stories or information you've come across as well as gain a deeper understanding of the reading through conversation.Try getting your friends or family to read the same things you are.
Share the stories or information you've come across.

, Like most activities, reading with a friend can be more enjoyable than doing it alone. Ask your friends if they want to share your reading goals and have regular discussions with you about your reading. You might even want to have a friendly competition to see who can read more over the summer.Reading with a friend can help you keep on schedule during your summer reading.
Talking with your friend about what you have read can help you remember details or have a deeper understanding of that reading.

, Meeting a goal or accomplishing something challenging is an important achievement. You might want to consider setting rewards for yourself once you meet your reading goals. Think about some of your favorite things and allow yourself time to engage in them after you successfully meet your summer reading goals.


Enjoy a healthy snack or treat after meeting your goals.
Reward yourself with some free time to watch your favorite show or play your favorite video game.

Look at the fourth string of numbers for title information.,
Look at the last digit to check the code.",How to Understand an ISBN Code," The title’s ISBN code should be found on the back of the book. Usually it will be over the barcode. It will always be identified with the prefix ISBN and will be either 10 or 13 digits long.


The ISBN should also be available on the copyright page.It is separated into four parts, each separated by a hyphen. For example, the ISBN for the classic cookbook The Joy of Cooking is 0-7432-4626-8.Books published before 2007 were given 10 digit ISBNs. From 2007 on, they have been given 13 digit identifiers.;
, One of the most interesting things you can learn about a book with the ISBN is the publisher’s scale of operations. 10 and 13 digit ISBNs have their own ways of identifying the publisher and the title. If the publisher identifier is long, but the title number is only one or two digits, the publisher only plans on releasing a handful of books and the book might even be self-published.


Conversely, if the title string is long and the publisher string is short, the book was released by a major publisher., If you plan to sell your manuscript in bookstores, it needs an ISBN, even if you are publishing it yourself. You can purchase an ISBN number at ISBN.org. You will need to purchase an ISBN number for each title you plan to publish and for different editions of the title, including hardback and paperback versions. The more ISBN numbers you purchase at time, the cheaper it will be.


Each nation has its own ISBN granting corporation.A single ISBN number costs $125, 10 cost $250, 100 cost $575, and 1,000 cost $1,000., This first string indicates the language and region that the book was published in. “0” indicates that the book was published in the United States. “1” Indicates that the book was published in another English speaking country.For English books, this string will typically only be a single digit, but it can be longer for other languages.

, The “0” will be followed by a dash. The string of numbers between the first and the second dash is the “publisher” identifier. Each publisher has its own unique ISBN string that will be in the code for every book that it publishes., Between the second and third dash in the ISBN number you will find the title identifier. Each edition of a book produced by a particular publisher will have its own distinctive title identifier., The last number is the check number. It should be predetermined by a mathematical calculation of the preceding digits. This is used to verify that the preceding digits are not being misread.Sometimes the last digit is an “X.” This is the Roman Numeral 10.
The check number is computed using a modulus 10 algorithm.

, The first three numbers are a prefix that changes overtime. Since the implementation of the 13 digit ISBN, this series has only ever been “978” or “979.”, Between the first and second dash in the ISBN you will find the country and language information. This ranges from 1 to 5 numbers and represents the language, country, and region of the title.For books published in United States, this number should be “0.” For books published in other English speaking countries it should be “1.”

, Between the second and third dash in the ISBN you will find the publisher information. This can be up to seven digits long. Each publisher has its own distinctive ISBN number.

, Between the third and fourth dash in the ISBN you will find the title information. This can range from one to six digits. Each title and edition will have its own distinctive number.

, The last number is the check number. It should be predetermined by a mathematical calculation of the preceding digits. This is used to verify that the preceding digits are not being misread.Sometimes the last digit is an “X.” This is the Roman Numeral 10.

Some publications may list the company name along with the symbol.
You can find the symbol for any publicly traded company by searching for it on a variety of financial websites.
Company websites often list their stock symbol on the website.

High/Low – The highest and lowest trading price the previous day.

Net chg – This is the change from the previous day’s closing price.

Shares – Number of shares held by investors.

Mkt cap – Total value of the company on the market.

, The current price is the price of one share at the close of trading the previous day. This price should only be taken as a guideline, because the price will continue to fluctuate even after the market has closed.









The price may not have a currency symbol next to it., 52-week high and low gives you a historical view of how much the stock has fluctuated. This information can be helpful in determining the general direction of a stock's price.








, Some stocks pay investors a dividend. A dividend is equity paid directly to the investor. Not every stock pays out a dividend. If the company does not pay a dividend, this section may be blank or occupied by a dash.









Dividends can be paid monthly, quarterly, semi-annually or annually.
In some cases, dividends are reinvested; that is, the investor receives additional stock instead of cash when the dividend is paid.

, The EPS is a measure of the current stock price compared to the earnings for the company over the last four fiscal quarters. It is calculated by dividing the net income of the company by the number of outstanding shares.








EPS is generally considered one of the most important aspects of determining the value of a stock.

, This number is the stock's current price divided by the most recent 12-month earnings amount per share (EPS). The P/E ratio is designed to show you if a stock price is overvalued or undervalued.









A high P/E ratio means that investors expect that higher earnings in the future. A low P/E means that they expect less.
Compare P/E ratios to other companies in the same sector to see how well it is performing.

, The volume is the amount of shares that have been traded in the current session (usually the last day). You may also see an average volume, which is the number of shares traded during a specific period. The length of the average varies based on which stock price report service you use.







, This will show you the stock's lowest and highest price of the day. This can help give you a sense of the volatility of a stock.








, The Net Change column will tell you how the stock has performed compared to the day before. If a stock is “up,” it’s because it traded at a higher value than the day before. Some stock price report services call this measure the open price instead of the closing price.








, This number is sometimes reported as shares and reflects the all shares, purchased and available for purchase, for the stock.








, This amount, which is generally called the market cap, is the total value of the company on the stock market. To arrive at this number, you multiple the total available shares of stock by the current stock price.

,How to Cite a Textbook in APA1,
"
Study the full citation before you try to replicate it.,
Put the author’s name first.,
End with the publisher’s location and then publisher’s name.,
Use an online citation generator.",How to Cite a Textbook in APA2," Before we break down each part, take a moment to look at a full citation example in APA Style, so you can follow it.


Example: Smith, P. (2012). Cut to the chase: Online video editing and the Wadsworth constant (3rd ed.). Washington, DC: E & K Publishing.
Here is an example without the specifics: Author last, first name initial. Middle name initial. (Year published). Book title: Subtitle (number ed.). City, State: Publisher.
In the specific example, Smith, P. is the author. (2012) is the year the textbook was published. The phrase in quotation marks is the title of the textbook. (3rd ed.) is the edition. Washington, DC is where the publisher is located. E & K Publishing is the name of the publisher.
You will need to follow this format with the specific information relating to the textbook you are trying to cite. Make sure to get all of the punctuation right. That matters too.

, Now, let's break down the sample citation by each of its parts. This is how you start the citation. Write the author's last name, and then the initial of the author's first name and then the initial of the author's middle name. As in: Author, A. A. Put the year of publication in parentheses after the author’s name, and end it with a period. As in: Author, A. A. (Year of publication).
Next, write the title of the work in italics. Capitalize only the first letter in the title. Use a colon if there is a sub-title, and capitalize and italicize the subtitle also. As in: Author, A.A. (Year of publication). Title of work: Subtitle

Include the edition of the book next. Don’t put the edition in italics, though. The edition should be listed after the title or subtitle if there is one, this way: (5th ed.)., For location, use the city and state using the two-letter postal abbreviation without periods.


Example: New York, NY. Remember not to write out the state name. Remember that the punctuation must be exact.
Multiple authors are handled the same way and linked with an & sign. Example: Helfer, M. E., Kempe, R. S., & Krugman, R. D. (1997). The battered child (5th ed.). Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press., You can find online sites that will generate the correct citation style for you.Be aware that APA style differs if you are citing a film, magazine, newspaper, and other materials, instead of a textbook.
The sites require you to enter key information about the book, including author’s name, publisher, and publisher location, and so on.

"
"
Using APA style for edited books.,
Use APA style for textbooks with translations.",How to Cite a Textbook in APA3," The big difference here is that you need to indicate (Ed.) for a single editor and (Eds.) for multiple editors after their names.


Example: Duncan, G. J., & Brooks-Gunn, J. (Eds.). (1997). Consequences of growing up poor. New York, NY: Russell Sage Foundation.
For an edited book with an author or authors write: Plath, S. (2000). The unabridged journals. K. V. Kukil (Ed.). New York, NY: Anchor.
For a multi-volume piece work, write the APA style this way: Wiener, P. (Ed.). (1973). Dictionary of the history of ideas (Vols. 1-4). New York, NY: Scribner's.

, Citation style is pretty similar for this scenario, but you need to indicate it’s a translation.


Note a translation this way: Laplace, P. S. (1951). A philosophical essay on probabilities. (F. W. Truscott & F. L. Emory, Trans.). New York, NY: Dover. (Original work published 1814)
Make sure you also include the date of the original work if applicable. As you can see, translations are pretty close to the original example, but you need to indicate who did the translating.

"
"
Cite a book accessed online.,
Use the doi number if it’s available.",How to Cite a Textbook in APA4," If you’ve accessed the textbook online, you need to indicate that via the citation. The first part of an online textbook citation looks identical to a print textbook citation. The only information you should leave off is the location and publisher information.


You need to list the URL where you accessed the textbook online at the end of the citation. The citation style is: Last, F. M. (Year Published). Book title. Retrieved from URL.
Example: James, H. (2009). The ambassadors. Retrieved from http://books.google.com.
For a textbook with software, include the software edition. Example: George, D., & Mallery, P. (2002). SPSS for Windows step by step: A simple guide and reference (4th ed., 11.0 Update). Pearson Allyn & Bacon.

, If there is a doi number for the online textbook (which is basically like a social security number for a book’s web location), you should write the citation with it.


Example: Rodriguez-Garcia, R., & White, E. M. (2005). Self-assessment in managing for results: Conducting self-assessment for development practitioners. doi: 10.1596/9780-82136148-1Doi numbers are usually found on the first page near the copyright or on the database landing site that you used to access the book.

"
"
Note where you got the information within the actual text.,
Cite quotations from the text in your article.,
Cite the author or authors in parentheses within the text.",How to Cite a Textbook in APA5," You will need to cite the textbook next to information you use from it within the text of your paper.


Introduce the author or authors in the sentence. One way to cite a textbook in APA format is to introduce the author in the sentence. Use the last name only. If there are no authors, but there is an editor, the editor should be listed instead. End with the publication year in parentheses.
Example: According to Smith, the theory is not sound (2000). Example two: Clark and Hernandez believe otherwise (1994).

, If you use a quotation or direct passage from the textbook, you also need to indicate the page.List the page number at the end of the quote as noted (p. page number).
Example: According to Jones (1998), ""Students often had difficulty using APA style, especially when it was their first time"" (p. 199).

, If you do not introduce the author in the sentence, you must include the author's last name in the parentheses that follow the quoted or borrowed text. If there are multiple authors, list all of them. Put a comma after the last name of the author and then the year of publication.


Example: This belief was proven wrong thanks to new research (Johnson, 2008).
Studies indicate otherwise (Smith, Johnson & Hernandez, 1999).

NOTE: This is not Algebraic Notation.,
Learn the squares first.,
In descriptive notation the pieces are represented the same way as algebraic except that columns are designated by their primary piece.,
Each square is designated according to the color you have.,
Count each square from the primary piece.,
Captures are recognized by one piece capturing another piece, so if a queen captured a queen, it would be written as QxQ.,
Castling is also designated differently.,
Special terms: En passant,, Check,, Checkmate or Mate, Resign or Draw are designated as written, where in Algebraic these terms have abbreviations and symbols.

",How to Read Descriptive Notation," Algebraic notation (AN), developed by Philipp Stamma, is the most common used worldwide system of chess notation and replaced the descriptive notation. You should learn both so you know what players refer to. Refer to Read Algebraic Chess Notation to see the other form.;
, The squares are named by the primary piece. From left on the White side the pieces are Queen's Rook (Castle), Queen's Knight, Queen's Bishop, Queen, King, King's Bishop, King's Knight and King's Rook.

, R is for Rook, Kt or N = Knight, B = Bishop, Q = Queen, etc. P, of course, is for pawn, while in algebraic pawns are recognized by the absence of a letter.

, In Black, the King is on the left while in White the King is on the right.

, If you have white, and you want to move the pawn in front of the King's Bishop ahead one space you would write ""King's Bishop Pawn to King's Bishop Three."" In the graphic King's Bishop would be in c1 and it would move to the space labeled c3. It's so much easier to say ""Bishop to C3.""

, Similarly, if a knight captured a bishop, it would be KtxB or NxB.

, It's simply called ""Castling Queenside"" or ""Castling Kingside.""

Get access to up-to-date currency chart information.,
Select a time frame for your currency chart.,
Observe your currency chart for the desired time frame.,
Look for specific chart structures.",How to Read Forex Charts1," In order to read and benefit from currency charts, you'll need to get them from a legitimate provider.


Most of the smaller traders and investors who profit from currency trading use charts that are offered directly from their brokerage services. New online brokerage services often include tools, like currency charts, in order to help their clients understand current pricing.;
, One of the most important steps in using currency charts, or any other kind of financial chart, is to set a specific time frame. The values that you view are only relevant to the specific time frames that you establish for them. With a paper chart, you can crop the chart for your specified time frame, where online tools often enable the user to change the view to a specific time frame, for example, 1 day, 5 days, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months or 1 year.

, You will see a line graph that represents changes and fluctuations in currency value over that period of time.


Look at your line graph against your Y axis. The Y axis, or horizontal axis, for a currency chart most often indicates a comparative asset price. When a line fluctuates, it shows how your selected currency performs against the currency or asset that is represented in the Y axis.
Check your X axis. The X axis for your currency chart represents your time frame. You will see that both of these axes have scaled, segmented values, where your line graph fluctuates in a variable way.

, Advanced traders and others look for specific visuals in a currency chart to try to predict which way future prices will go.


Understand candlestick charting to take advantage of this advanced financial resource. Candlestick charts show a range of traits for a specific trading day, with a top and bottom that illustrate price movement. Many currency charts include candlestick charting, especially online ones, and by observing these charts correctly, you can know much more about the price than just how it has changed over a period of time.
Look for items like Fibonacci retracement. A Fibonacci retracement is a specific kind of price spike or dip where a reversal can signify a general trend. Read up on this sort of predictive tool and apply it to your currency chart observation.
Look for movement against moving averages. Moving averages tell you how the price has changed over a longer time frame. These may be helpful when you are viewing your currency chart.

Understand what the chart consists of.,
Understand that candlesticks display the relationship between the open, high, low and closing prices.,
Learn the patterns.,
Understand how to read the Bullish Candlestick Formations:

The Hammer is a Bullish Pattern if it appears after a significant downtrend.,
Understand how to read the Bearish Candlestick Formations:

A Long Bearish Candle occurs when prices open near the high and close lower, near the low.,
Understand how to read Neutral Candlestick Formations.,
Understand how to read the Reversal Candlestick Formations:

A Long-legged Doji often signifies a turning point.",How to Read Forex Charts2," There are no calculations required to interpret Candlestick Charts. They are a simple visual aid representing price movements in a given time period. Each candlestick reveals four vital pieces of information:

the opening price, the closing price,






the highest price and the lowest price the fluctuations during the time period of the candle.






In much the same way as the familiar bar chart, a candle illustrates a given measure of time.






The advantage of candlesticks is that they clearly denote the relationship between the opening and closing prices.

, This means that they cannot be used to chart securities that have only closing prices. Interpretation of Candlestick Charts is based on the analysis of patterns. Currency traders predominantly use the relationship of the highs and lows of the candlewicks over a given time period. However, Candlestick Charts offer identifiable patterns that can be used to anticipate price movements.

, There are two types of candles: The Bullish Pattern Candle and the Bearish Pattern Candle:

A white (empty body) represents a Bullish Pattern Candle. It is used/denotes when prices open near the low price and close near the period’s high price.






A black (filled body) represents a Bearish Pattern Candle. It is used/signifies when prices open near the high price and close near the period’s low price.







, If the line occurs after a significant uptrend, it is called a Hanging Man. A small body and a long wick identify the Hammer. The body can be empty of filled in






The Pricing Line is a Bullish Pattern where the first candle is a long, Bear candle, followed by a long Bull candle. The Bull candle opens lower than the Bear's low, but closes more than halfway above the middle of the Bear candle's body.






A Bullish Engulfing Line is a patter strongly Bullish if it occurs after a significant downtrend. It may also serve as a reversal pattern. It occurs when a small Bearish candle is engulfed by a large Bullish candle.






The Morning Star is a Bullish Pattern signifying a potential bottom. The star indicates a possible reversal and the Bullish candle confirms this. The Star can be a Bullish or Bearish candle.






In a Bullish Doji Star, the star indicates a reversal and a Doji indicates indecision. This pattern usually indicates a reversal following an indecisive period. You should wait for a confirmation before trading a Doji Star.







,






The Hanging Man pattern is Bearish if it occurs after a significant uptrend. If this pattern occurs after a significant downtrend, it is called a Hammer. A Hanging Man is identified by small candle bodies and a long wick below the bodies, and can be either Bearish or Bullish.






Dark Cloud Cover is a Bearish Pattern that is more significant if the second candle's body is below the center of the previous candle's body.







,

Spinning Tops is a neutral pattern that occurs when the distance between the high and low, and the distance between the open and close, are relatively small.






A Doji candle implies indecision. The open and close are the same.






A Double Doji (two adjacent Doji candles) implies that a forceful move will follow a breakout from the current indecision.






The Harami pattern indicates a decrease in momentum. It occurs when a candle with a small body falls within the area of a larger body.







, It occurs when the open and close are the same, and the range between the high and the low is relatively large.






The Dragonfly Doji also signifies a turning point. It occurs when the open and close are the same, and the low is significantly lower than the open, high and closing prices.






A Gravestone Doji occurs when the open, close, and low prices are the same, and the high is significantly higher than the open, close and low prices. It also signifies a turning point.






Stars indicate reversals. A Star is a candle with a small, real body that occurs after a candle with a much larger, real body where the real bodies do not overlap. The wicks may overlap.

Talk to others about what you’re studying.,
Complete all of the work assigned.",How to Read a Textbook," Are there pictures or art that can give you a clue on the topics you may be studying? What about the title? Is this a book for beginners or for someone with more skill?


Use the title for a more specific idea on the course. If it's a history book, will you be studying World History or Early American History? What do you already know about this subject?
What about the authors, publisher and publishing date? Is this an old book or is it pretty current?;
, How many chapters does the textbook have, and about how long are they? What about sub-chapters? What are the titles of the chapters and sub-chapters?


Is there a glossary or a series of appendices? What about a bibliography? What types of words does the index have in it?

, Quickly flip through the pages. What immediately catches your attention? Take note of the chapter titles, bold words and vocabulary, photos, drawings, charts and diagrams. What do they tell you about things you’ll be learning in the book?


You can also skim to evaluate the difficulty of reading level for the text. Select one random page that is mostly text (not many visuals) and read it for comprehension. Time how long it takes you to read it.

, That’s right. Go to the end of the chapter, and read the summary and the questions that are there. This is the perfect way to for you to get an idea of what you’re about to read in the chapter. It will prep your brain and help it to sift through and make sense of all the more detailed information that’s in the actual chapter.


Next, read the introduction to the chapter. This also helps your brain get ready for the onslaught of information and helps it with processing., After each chunk, go back and look at your highlights, your margin notes, and your notebook notes. This will help you with longer term memory of what was read.


Complete the next steps in this section using the 10 page chunk recommendation. When you’ve finished 10 pages and briefly reviewed them, begin the next 10 pages. Or, take a quick break and then resume working on the next 10 pages., If you purchased the book (and you're not borrowing it from a person, library, or school), you should highlight. There is a specific way to do this correctly, so keep the following in mind:


Don’t stop to highlight or take notes during the first reading. This disrupts your flow of comprehension, and you may end up highlighting things that you shouldn’t.
Wait until you have read an entire paragraph or a whole short section (depending on how the sections are broken up) to go back and highlight. This way, you will know what is important enough to highlight.
Don’t highlight single words (too little) or entire sentences (too much). Keep it down to one or two highlighted phrases per paragraph. The idea of highlighting is that you should be able to glance at the highlighted phrases a month later and get the gist of what you read without having to re-read the whole thing., In your margins, (or on a post-it note if it is not your book that you bought), jot down one or two questions per paragraph or section that you should be able to answer from reading that paragraph or section. This could be “What years were considered the Renaissance?” or “What is the meaning of metamorphosis?”


After you have read the whole assignment, you should go back and try to answer these questions without re-reading.

, In a notebook for the class, jot down the main ideas of what you read for each section, IN YOUR OWN WORDS. It is extremely important to write your notes in your own words.


Writing your notes in your own words helps you avoid plagiarism if you have to write a paper, and you will be confident that you really comprehended something if your notes are not directly copied from the textbook., This will help you feel prepared for class discussions or lectures associated with the text. Be sure to pay attention and participate during class, and write additional notes! Your instructor may tell you if tests are based mostly on the book or on lectures, but sometimes they don’t tell you and it’s best to be prepared for anything.

, This is the time it takes an average college student to read the pages of a textbook. Keep this in mind as you schedule time for your reading.


For instance, if you have to read 73 pages for an assignment, that is 365 minutes, or approximately six hours of reading., If you calculate that you have four hours of reading, we don’t recommend trying to do all of it at one time. You may become tired and unfocused.


Read for an hour at your lunch break, an hour in the evening, etc. Try to spread it out a bit, taking into consideration how many days you have to complete the assigned number of pages and the hours it will take you to read them., If you fall behind, you will find yourself skimming and speed-reading, which causes you to miss important information. Schedule some time to read each day so you can chip away at the assignment slowly and less stressfully., This is very important. You can’t be expected to comprehend lots of information if there is noise around.


Avoid reading in your bed if possible. Your brain most likely associates your bed with sleep, and it will want to do that if you are reading there. Sleep experts also say that doing “work” in bed can lead to sleeping problems, and only relaxing reading and activities should be done in bed so you don’t start having a hard time falling and staying asleep.
Go to a quiet room in your house, the library, a quiet coffee shop, or a park to read. Anywhere that has little distractions for you is best. If you have a family (or roommates) or have lots of responsibilities at home, go out. If having any people around at all distracts you, but your home is fairly quiet, stay in. Whatever works for you; you may have to experiment and see where you can study best., Are you being asked to write a paper, or do you have a big test that covers the assigned material? If there is a test, did the instructor offer a study guide? Take all of this into account as you focus on what you should spend the most time reviewing while you study.

, If you read carefully, highlighted and took notes, you should only need to read the textbook once. What you will re-read during studying is your highlighted phrases, your margin questions and/or notes, and your notebook notes.


Read these as many times as necessary to fully understand the material. If you didn’t take great notes, you may need to re-read., Studies show that there are huge benefits to talking out loud about what you are learning.


Form study groups with your classmates, or talk with someone at home or another friend about what you are reading.
Be sure to attend all of your classes, not just on test days or days that papers are due. Most likely there are discussions or lectures happening about the textbook material, and these are extremely beneficial to your long-term learning of the readings., If the instructor gave you math exercises to complete, or short answer questions to write, but they aren’t necessarily graded, do them anyway. There is a purpose to the assigning of the work, and that is for you to further your understanding of the material from the book.

Identify the survey parts.,
Familiarize yourself with the legend.,
Locate the surveyor's certificate.",How to Read a Property Survey1," The property survey consists of two parts: the illustration and the written report. The illustration is basically a map of the area surveyed. Place the survey illustration on a large flat surface, as property surveys can be quite large. Keep the written report on hand for easy reference.;
, The legend is usually set in the corner of a survey illustration. It contains icons which indicate important property attributes such as wells, borders, structures, or utility lines.If any elements of the legend are unclear or need explanation, contact your surveyor.

, The surveyor's certificate should be signed and dated with an embossed seal. This certificate provides a legal foundation for the survey's validity. If absent, the survey will not provide you with legal protection in a court of law.

"
"
Orient yourself in the survey illustration.,
Understand the property boundaries.,
Find important features.,
Note the scale and scope of the survey illustration.",How to Read a Property Survey2," The illustration should include a compass indicating which way is north. This is often located near the legend, or separately in a corner of the illustration. A good survey will distinguish between magnetic north and astronomical north. If the survey does not distinguish between the two, it's probably based on magnetic north, but you should check with your surveyor to be sure., Property boundaries are denoted with both bearing and distance. The bearing is a series of degrees, minutes, and seconds with compass point letters before and after each element. The distance indicates how far from a given point a boundary line extends.


The bearing represents the angle between north or south and east or west. You can measure this angle from a central point with a protractor. For instance, you might have a bearing of N 38° 03' 09"" E. If you measured an angle of 38° 03' 09"" from the north to the east on the survey illustration, you could then trace that northeasterly line to identify one of your property's boundaries.Degrees, minutes, and seconds are the units of measure for property survey bearings. For example, N 38° 03' 09"" E would translate as 38 degrees, 3 minutes, 9 seconds from the north to the east.
The boundary lines, or ""legs,"" are often denoted in feet and listed directly below or after the bearing.

, The illustration and accompanying written report should include the following, where present:


Physical and overlapping boundaries
Water structures such as a lake or stream
Shared fencing, driveways or sidewalks with a neighboring property
Roadways or driveways that are nearby
Existing property points of entry or egress
Buildings, repairs, modifications or structural improvements on the property
Locations of utilities, including water pipes and other plumbing, electrical, cable and/or telephone lines, gas lines, and utility poles , There should be a scale near the legend which indicates how distances are represented on the survey illustration. The scale will help you gauge distances on the property in question, including distances between it and nearby landmarks. For instance, one inch might correspond to one mile on the land survey illustration.The illustration might also orient the reader by providing a vicinity map -- also called a location map -- to indicate where the property lies in relation to the larger locality. The vicinity map is a small square inset usually located in a corner of the survey illustration.

"
"
Read the notes.,
Read the written survey report carefully.,
Write down any points of confusion or concern.,
Put your survey to use.",How to Read a Property Survey3," Notes are found on the survey illustration and provide information pertaining to former ownership of the land being surveyed or nearby properties. A more thorough account of the property can be found in the written report.

, The report includes legal information and additional comments provided by the surveyor. This document may also contain:


Official property measurements.
Any easements that may exist on the property. An easement allows a third party legal access to a property. For example, when you give your neighbor permission to park in your driveway or allow a utility company to run electrical lines run through your property.Any other property improvements that may have occurred since the latest survey on file. The report will also indicate if these improvements meet the code standards set up by the local building department.
An indication as to whether the property is zoned for residential or commercial use.

, It might be good to have a friend or family member read the property survey with you so that they can offer suggestions or identify potential issues you might have missed. After reading the survey, contact your surveyor to clear up any misunderstanding. Remember, understanding your survey is crucial for establishing full control over your property.

, Whether you are buying a new property, looking to build on your land, or trying to sell some or all of your land, your property survey will help move the process along. If the boundaries of your property are ever in question, consult your property survey to settle the matter.

Know when you should see a doctor.,
Take it easy.,
Get appropriate medicine.,
Eat foods that are gentle on the stomach.,
Stay hydrated.,
Reflect on the cause of your illness.,
Don’t be afraid to go to the doctor.,
Don’t make any rash decisions.",How to Deal with Getting Sick During Solo Travel1," In some cases, your first stop should be a doctor’s office. Consider your symptoms and recent activity to determine if you should see a doctor. See a doctor immediately if you:Are suffering from diarrhea and a fever above 102 degrees Fahrenheit.
Have noticed blood in your stool.
Have flu-like symptoms while visiting an area that is known for malaria outbreaks.
Have gotten a bite or scratch from an animal.
Were in a car accident or have been injured in some other way.
Have been sexually assaulted.;
, If you’re sick when traveling alone, you should not aggravate your condition by expending unnecessary energy. Doing so could delay your recovery. Instead, give yourself time to heal by staying in bed, sleeping, reading, and generally kicking back until you start feeling better.While taking it easy is the best course of action if you are sick while traveling solo, there is no right way to decide what to do if you have tours booked and activities planned. Sometimes the fresh air will do you good. Other times, your sickness will only get worse when you decide to soldier on. Analyze your own condition and make decisions using common sense and your best judgment.
If you have any doubts about your ability to enjoy a tour or outing, cancel it. After all, the point of going on a tour is to have a good time, and you won’t have much fun if you’re excessively ill.

, If you haven’t packed a prescription or an over-the-counter medicine that can help you, check out the local pharmacy. Many pharmacies have over-the-counter medicines available that could help your symptoms. If possible, obtain over-the-counter medicine and use it as directed. For instance, if you are coughing, visit the pharmacy and get some cough syrup., If you are suffering from nausea, vomiting or diarrhea, stick with BRAT foods (bananas, rice, apples, and toast). Simple carbohydrates like porridge and plain noodles in broth are good options, too. These foods are unlikely to upset your stomach or make your condition worse.Additionally, take some probiotic foods in small amounts (yogurt, milk, and/or probiotic tablets).

, Only drink water that you are sure is clean and safe to drink while traveling.If necessary, boil the water or use purification tablets. Purification tablets are chemical additives you can drop into water you suspect harbors harmful bacteria to avoid illness. You can obtain them online, in large department stores, or at any hiking/camping shop.Avoid drinking sweet sodas and alcohol.Bring purification tablets along with you if you'll be traveling in areas where the water may not be safe to drink.

, If you ate something that you don’t usually eat, or found that a certain dish tasted a bit off, you might recognize that dish as the cause of your illness. Undercooked meats, eggs, and unpasteurized dairy and juices can pose a risk of food poisoning. Once you’ve identified the culprit, do not repeat your mistake by eating it again (or, at least, avoid the restaurant where you received the particular version of the dish that made you ill)., If your pain or sickness lasts more than 24-48 hours, you should see a doctor, even if the symptoms are not serious. Only a trained medical professional can provide an accurate diagnosis of whatever is ailing you.If you do not speak the local language, going to the doctor might be more complicated. Use your phrasebook and pocket dictionary to communicate what you’re feeling. Point to key phrases in your phrasebook such as, “I am ill” to describe your situation.
Another communication solution is to mimic your symptoms. For instance, if you have a cough and a sore throat, pretend to cough, then clutch your throat to help the medical personnel understand that your throat hurts.

, If you have tickets to travel to another destination, or have a tour booked, do not cancel or seek a refund as soon as you fall ill. It’s better to wait it out and see if you’ll recover than to immediately cancel your future plans.It is not uncommon to get sick while traveling, when you’re exposed to new pathogens, bacteria, and environments. But except in rare cases, you’ll recover after 24-48 hours.
Even if you’re sick while traveling solo, do not miss flights unless absolutely necessary. Getting a refund or waiting until a future flight has an available opening are your only options, and both can be difficult.
If you have a fever, it will probably go away in a few days. However, if your fever exceeds 103 F (39.4 C), seek medical attention.
If you have sinus pain, the pressure of the airplane cabin could make it worse. Reschedule your flight if you have sinus pain and/or a sinus infection.If you have the flu, you really shouldn’t travel.

Pack some over-the-counter medications.In addition to whatever the doctor gives you, you should pack some general pain reliever (ibuprofen, for example), lozenges, and cough syrup.,
Find out what you can do to safeguard your health.,
Avoid foods that might cause illness.,
Get a room of your own.,
Get travel insurance.If you get sick on the road and have to see a doctor, you might end up with a large medical bill.,
Have a plan in place.",How to Deal with Getting Sick During Solo Travel3," Before heading out on a solo trip, investigate what sorts of bugs, illnesses, and viruses are common in the area you’re headed. Use the CDC’s Travelers’ Health database to search for information about wherever you plan on traveling. Write the names of the common illnesses on a list.The CDC Travelers’ Health database is available at https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel.

, Armed with the list of illnesses you might encounter in your travels, ask your doctor to administer all recommended vaccines. Additionally, request a round of antiviral drugs that you can use if they become necessary. Ask your doctor if they have any additional recommendations regarding your specific health circumstances.If your doctor prescribes antibiotics or other medications, use them only as directed.

, Additionally, take a pack of multivitamins with you. Take at least one each day you’re traveling solo to ensure you’re getting all recommended minerals and vitamins.Additionally, you might pack some charcoal tablets. These tablets can help you detox. But don’t use them if you’re taking an antibiotic, as they will negate the antibiotics’ effect., Beyond getting vaccines and medicines from your doctor at home, there are often things you can do (or avoid doing) once you’ve touched arrived at wherever it is you’re traveling. For instance, you might need to boil the water before drinking it or avoid hiking in swampy areas with lots of mosquitoes. Follow travel tips and warnings for areas you’re traveling through solo.To find out what you can do to protect yourself in-country, visit your local public library and check out a few recent travel guides for wherever it is you’re headed. Read the guide carefully, scanning for information pertaining to health and wellness.
Travel guides often also list local medical facilities you can go in the event of a truly dire illness. Make special note of medical facilities in the area you’ll be traveling so you can locate them quickly if necessary.If you’re traveling solo through an area with questionable water, don’t eat the ice in beverages, shower with your mouth closed, and use bottled water to brush your teeth., Be wary of drinking tap water in certain countries. Avoid eating meat and fish that have not been thoroughly cooked.Avoid eating fruit picked right off of trees without washing it off in clean water.Meat should be brown all the way through, without any pinkness to its color. Never consume raw meat or fish.
If possible, check to ensure proper sanitation guidelines are being followed during your food’s preparation. For instance, if you’re browsing street food stalls and see that the chicken-on-a-stick maker is handling raw chicken and cooked chicken with their bare hands, look elsewhere., Having real peace and quiet can do wonders for the health. If you’re feeling a bit under the weather and have been staying in hostels packed with other travelers, consider springing for a private room to get some serious rest., But with travel insurance, any medical costs you incur (up through your policy limit) will be covered. Read your policy thoroughly before signing so you know what you’re getting and how to use it if need be.Before heading out on your solo trip, get a list of hospitals and doctors that your travel insurance covers. Bring the list with you. Only use one of the supported hospitals.

, Getting sick while traveling solo encompasses a range of experiences. It could mean that you have stomach cramps and nausea for 24 hours, but it could also mean that you’re vomiting blood. In the former case, your best bet is to wait it out, but the latter case requires immediate medical attention (as do other, equally serious cases). Whatever your situation, you should know what to do next and be ready to take immediate action.Before setting off on your solo travels, know phrases like, “Please take me to a doctor” or “Where is the local hospital?” Or, at the very least, take a guidebook containing such phrases with you so you can point to them to communicate with cab drivers and the like should it be necessary.

Trade in your pillow.,
Have a pre-sleep nighttime routine.,
Block out sensory information.",How to Make a Hotel Room More Comfortable1," Many hotels offer the option of swapping your pillow if yours is too hard, too soft, or too lumpy. Contact your hotel’s sleep concierge or housekeeping department in order to get a pillow that suits your sleeping style., Turn off your computer and TV at least an hour before you go to sleep. Set your phone alarm and set it aside for the night. This will prevent you from looking at the screen, which can make it harder for you to go to bed. You could also read a book in bed to help you relax., Use a sleep mask and earplugs to avoid being disrupted by goings-on either outside or in the next room over. Your earplugs should block sound 60 decibels and above. Your eye mask should completely block out light and sit comfortably on your face.These are especially important if you’re sharing the room with someone who snores or has a different bedtime than you.
Instead of earplugs, you could invest in a white noise machine.A white noise machine is a small device that drowns out the sound of external noises by producing a steady and pleasing low-volume sound of its own.

Unpack your things.,
Bring your dog.",How to Make a Hotel Room More Comfortable2," For instance, you might pack:a picture of your familya special rock
a small trophy you won
a stuffed animal

, Your hotel room will feel distinctly unpleasant and uncomfortable if you can’t find anything on TV to watch, or cannot find entertainment in your local language. Bring a portable DVD player, laptop, or tablet so you can watch movies and music of your choice.If you bring a portable DVD player, you should also bring some DVDs.
With a laptop, you could also play games or stream movies.
Consider bringing an HDMI cord so you can connect your laptop to the TV for a big-screen experience.

, Some people have one “must-have” object that they just can’t travel without. For some, it’s a special comb. For others, it’s their makeup. If you’re picky about your pillows, bring your own pillow or pillowcase from home. Whatever your special travel item is, don’t leave home without it. This will make your hotel experience more pleasant., For instance, if you often snack on unsalted whole-wheat crackers, you would be more comfortable in your hotel room if you have a travel pack of them with you during your hotel stay.If you have a longer hotel stay, you might opt to pack a larger package of your snack of choice.

, However, these toiletries might not suit your particular tastes, and you’d likely be more comfortable using your own. For instance, you might want to use your coconut-flavored soap and body scrub, or perhaps you’d prefer your mint-flavored toothpaste.You can easily pack your toiletries in a small toiletries case.

, After you’ve checked the room for bed bugs, unpack your things. This will help you settle in and feel more at home in your hotel room. Take advantage of the closet and the hangers. Don’t be afraid to ask for more from the front desk if you need them.Set your favored travel items where they belong. For instance, if you packed a picture of your family, set it up by your bedside.
If you brought your own toiletries, place them in the bathroom.

, If possible, take your dog along with you. Traveling can be a great adventure for your dog, and give the two of you some time to bond. You’ll feel more comfortable traveling with your dog. If you travel with your dog, be sure to place it in a crate when you’re not in the room to prevent it from marking its territory.Check with the hotel before you arrive to ensure that you can bring your pet into the room with you.
If your dog is averse to traveling, do not bring it in order to make the hotel room feel more comfortable (or for any other reason).

Do a quick cleanup.,
Clean the air.,
Bring your slippers.",How to Make a Hotel Room More Comfortable3," Hopefully, housekeeping has been doing its job and cleaned the room thoroughly in advance of your arrival. But you might feel more comfortable and at home in your hotel room if you wipe down areas and objects most likely to be sticky or filth-ridden. For instance, use alcoholic wipes to rub down the TV remote, telephone, door handles, and the handle on the mini fridge.You might also feel more comfortable if you run a wet hand towel or paper towel across dusty surfaces that housekeeping missed.
Be sure to check for bed bugs by lifting the sheets to check the mattress. If you see small brown or red specks dotting the mattress, ask for another room or just ask for a refund and find a better hotel.

, If you’re in a smoking room or if your room has a weird scent, you might be glad you brought along a portable air fresher. For instance, the GermGuardian GG1000 or the Hayata Mini-Mate are both effective at reducing odors.The GermGuardian plugs into an electrical socket and cleans the air as it removes the odors.
The Hayata is a rechargeable device and can be worn around the neck or placed on your nightstand.
Alternatively, you could bring a travel-size linen spray or scented candles.This will replace a hotel room’s disagreeable stink with a more refreshing odor.

, Slippers are like shoes, but are usually worn without socks and are meant for indoor use only. If you bring a pair of slippers to the hotel, your stay will be more comfortable, especially if you’re staying at a hotel during the chilly winter season. Plus, slippers will keep your feet off the sometimes grimy hotel room floors."

Change the temperature of the room.,
Open or close the curtains.,
Move furniture to your liking.",How to Make a Hotel Room More Comfortable4," If your room is too cold, you might want to increase the temperature. If the room is too warm, you might want to decrease the temperature. You can adjust the temperature in either direction by locating the thermostat. Set the thermostat at the temperature you desire to make the room to a more comfortable level.You should reduce the temperature slightly when going to bed. It is easier to fall asleep in a slightly cooler room.
Opening the window a bit is also a good way of adjusting the temperature. If the weather outside is cool, you can cool your room somewhat by opening the window. If the weather outside is hot, you can warm the room somewhat by opening the window.

, If the curtains are drawn, your room might feel dim, cramped, and gloomy. But if the curtains are parted, you will be able to let light in and make the room feel more refreshing. If you do not like seeing what’s going on outside or being woken up by sunshine in the morning, keep your curtains drawn tightly.If you have a particular distaste for sunshine, ask the front desk to provide you with a set of blackout curtains if any are available. These are extra-thick curtains specially designed for people who wish to see nothing of the world outside their window.

, When you rent a hotel room, you can move the furniture in any way you like. If you believe that the flow of a hotel room works better when the nightstand is on the left side of the bed rather than the right, give it a try. If you don’t like where you’ve moved a piece of furniture, you can always move it back, or move it to a different spot altogether.Experiment with the locations of various items of furniture to find an arrangement that makes you feel most comfortable.

Leave a welcome basket.,
Give guests a cheat sheet.,
Provide extra storage space.,
Leave a water pitcher and cups.,
Provide soft lighting.,
Put flowers in the room.,
Make the bed.,
Keep surfaces clean and clear.,
Emphasize open space.",How to Make a Hotel Room More Comfortable5," Guests will feel more at home if they receive a small basket of treats and snacks when they arrive. The basket might include bottled water, travel-sized snacks like granola bars or bags of crackers, and travel-sized soaps. Guests might also appreciate over-the-counter medications, mini lint rollers, and other gadgets and goods to make them feel comfortable., Provide your guests with a sheet that answers frequently-asked questions. For instance, you might draft a sheet that provides the wi-fi password, directions to the nearest tourist sights, and phone numbers for the hotel’s different departments (for instance, front desk, housekeeping, room service, and so on). This will save both you and the guest time.Give this cheat sheet to the guest as soon as they check in.

, Try not to fill up the closets with vacuum cleaners, ironing boards, and other objects. The closet should be storage for the guest’s clothes and suitcase. Find other places (beneath the bed, for instance) for these stored items, and include plenty of hangers in the closet for the guest., Place a water pitcher filled with cool, refreshing water on a table or counter in the hotel room. Put some cups nearby. You could use disposable paper cups, but you’re better off leaving some sturdier glasses with the water. These feel more substantial and make the hotel room feel more comfortable for the guests., Soft lighting make a room feel cozier than harsh overhead lights. Put a few lamps around the room to empower your guests to customize the luminosity of light in the room. Ideally, you’ll include lamps that have a dimmer, which allows for even greater customizability in lighting. , A room with a fresh bouquet of vibrant flowers will give any dull room a burst of color and a fresh scent. You could include tulips, roses, petunias, or mix of many different sorts of flowers when putting flowers in the room. Whatever sort of flowers you choose, place them in a tasteful vase of clear glass or white porcelain.Place the vase on the counter or table.

, When guests walk into a room and the bed is in disarray, they will be reminded that they’re not at home and feel out of place. Guests will feel more comfortable if they come into a room where the bed is made nicely, with the sheet beneath the comforter and the pillows fluffed nicely at the head of the bed. You might also drape a heavy folded blanket over the foot of the bed., Before guests arrive, get the room dusted, swept, and vacuumed. Remove magazines, city guides, and other objects that only clutter nightstands and tabletops. Likewise, remove decorative objects like dolls and small abstract sculptures. The less space you clutter, the more space will be available to the guest to use as they please., Cramped and claustrophobic hotel rooms are not comfortable. Your guest will be most comfortable if you fit the bed to the size of the room. Ensure that each room has at least one window. Keep the ceilings high enough that people don’t bump their heads on them.For instance, do not put a large bed in a small room. Instead, put a large bed in a large room, and a small bed in a small room.
Guests should be able to walk comfortably around the bed on all sides without bumping into either the bed itself or other furniture.
If you have a hotel room where easy movement is impossible, consider swapping the bed out for a smaller one and making it a room for a single person only.
Ceilings should be about four meters (12 feet) high. Any shorter and guests will feel confined.
Add one window and one mirror to the room. These maximize the light in the room and make the space feel more open.

Play board or card games.,
Play games that don't require extra items.,
Have a pillow fight.,
Make towel animals.,
Create a scavenger hunt.",How to Have Fun in a Hotel Room1," If you’re not alone in the hotel room, and especially if you’re there with children, a board game can be a lot of fun.


Even if you’re alone, you could play a game. If you have a deck of cards, try Solitaire! You could also play Solitaire online. There are many card games you can play if other people are in the room, like poker or gin rummy. You could also make up your own board game!
Some hotels even have board games you can borrow. Ask at the front desk! If not, make sure to bring some along! If you’ve forgotten a board game, you could just play Pictionary with paper and pencils or pens. The goal is to draw a picture that the other people have to guess.
Another fun game is the dictionary game. All you need is a dictionary. You choose a word, and all of the other players try to guess what it means. Then you read them one-by-one, including the real definition, and people guess whose definition is the right one. You get points if people guess your definition, even if it's fake, and you get points if you know the meaning of the word.;
, Let’s say you can’t find a board game. There are some games you can play without anything special, as long as there is another person in the room.


Try playing Charades. You write down movies, books, things and places on pieces of paper and the person who draws it, has to act out what is on the paper, for other people to guess.
Charades can work with large families if you divide everyone up into teams. You’re not allowed to speak words when playing Charades.
You could play I Spy. Choose an object. The other person must ask you a series of questions to try to guess what it is. Or you could sing 99 bottles of beer on the wall. ""Take one down, pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall."" And so on, until you get to 0., Be careful that you don’t break something! But having a pillow fight can be a lot of fun. Jumping on the bed can be too. You could also build a blanket tent or fort.This will help children expend their energy and see the hotel room as a lot of fun because they get to do something they can’t do at home.
Even if you’re there with another adult, a playful pillow fight might be a great way to lighten up the mood and have fun with each other. You could also ball up socks and try to see who can throw most of them into the garbage can., Kids will have a lot of fun making towel animals. Sometimes the maids in hotels make these for you. How cool to come back to the room to see a swan on the bed.


You could leave the towel animal as a surprise for the maid. Mostly, though, children will have fun trying to make them. You can make birds, dogs, cats, and other common animals.
Once they are done, have everyone try to draw the animals or play a game guessing what the animals are. You could also make animal shadows on the wall with your hands.

, This can be fun for children. Secrete items throughout the room and perhaps throughout the hotel hallway.


Write out clues for each item that you give to the children to see if they can crack the riddles and find the items first.
Be careful about safety and hotel rules, though. Never allow children to run around a hotel unsupervised. Either do the scavenger hunt in your room or follow them around.

Go online.,
Read the magazines or brochures in the hotel.,
Order room service.,
Write.,
Bring along entertainment options.",How to Have Fun in a Hotel Room2," Most hotel rooms have free WiFi these days, so ask for the password at the front desk. Is going on your computer fun? It can be if you’re stuck in a hotel room alone.


Read a book online, watch a video streaming service movie or TV show, or communicate with your friends on social media. The possibilities are endless.
Play games online, write emails, try to write a book. The great thing about hotel rooms is that the daily stresses of life aren’t there, so you’re able to focus.

, You could use the opportunity to learn about the location you’re visiting!


If you don’t have a computer along or simply don’t feel like going online, reading magazines or brochures can be a way to pass the time. Or buy magazines in the hotel gift shop, if there is one.
Educate yourself about the area. Maybe you’ll discover a tour or a new restaurant to try by doing so., It can actually be fun to order room service because it feels like a luxury to a lot of people. Once in a while, splurge on yourself!


Order something off the menu that you’ve never tried before to make it all more interesting. Order several items and have a tasting party!
You could also order into the room. Many hotels offer information about local pizza or Chinese food delivery services. Eating pizza in a hotel room can be fun.

, You could write someone a letter. The art of letter writing used to be very important in society, and today it can seem unusual and thus indicates to people you care about them because you’ve put a lot of thought into it.


You could also try to write a book or a poem. If that’s not your thing, you could start writing a journal, perhaps by chronicling your trip. If writing is not your thing, you could also try drawing. The hotel probably has stationary in the room that you can use.Some people get lost in writing. It’s a good way to pass the time and feel less lonely because your words can transport you to a different place or create an intimate bond with people you miss by writing words you know they will eventually read.

, Show up at the hotel room with some entertainment options in hand, whether it's equipment to play music or video games.


Take along a DVD you haven't viewed yet. Watch it if you have a DVD player in the room. If there is a DVD player, the hotel might provide new ones too, so ask at the front desk.
Load up songs and TV shows onto your MP3 player, iPod or computer. You could also listen to the radio. Most hotel rooms have one.
If you can, bring a game console. You can hook it up to the TV and play games. Some hotels provide a game system to use, but require a fee to rent the games

Get romantic.,
Give someone a makeover.,
Rent a movie.,
Meditate.,
Throw a secret party.,
Watch people!",How to Have Fun in a Hotel Room3," Depends if you’re there with your partner, and depends on your age, and depends whether children are around, but if you’re of age, and circumstances permit, here’s your chance to get romantic.


Ask for a hotel room with a whirlpool or at least a whirlpool tub. No question about it; in the right circumstances, this can make the visit a lot more fun!
Even if you’re in the hotel room alone, taking a whirlpool bath can be relaxing. If you just have a regular tub, try a bubble bath!

, This works well with kids. Let them give mom or dad or a sibling a makeover.


This can mean they get to put makeup on you or put your hair in a goofy ponytail. This will distract many children, and they will think it’s fun.Take hotel selfies. OK, maybe this one is a little goofy, but hotel lighting can make for some nice selfies because it’s sometimes dimmer. You will want to chronicle the makeover!

, Most hotels have movie on demand services on the television. Whether you’re alone or with family, renting a movie is a great way to pass the time.


You could also watch cable television in most hotels. If you’re renting a movie, hit up the vending machine so you have your own version of movie snacks.
Try watching a movie outside of your normal favorite genre. Look at your time in the hotel room as a time to learn about yourself and try new things. Everyone could wear pajamas and, climb into the same bed.

, The stresses are gone. For now, at least. So take the time to think. Write down plans for your future. Work through any problems.


Consider the hotel stay a “staycation.” You don’t have to be doing something. Pamper yourself by doing nothing. No worries. No deadlines. No pressures.Take a nap, catch up on reading, watch a TV show that doesn’t require much thought, turn off your cell phone, or just lie back and think. If the hotel has a spa, you could visit it for a massage or other service.

, Some people do this. They throw secret parties in hotel rooms. Do not do this if you are underage.


If you do this, keep guests to a minimum, and don’t destroy the hotel room or do anything that could attract the attention of the police!Secret hotel room parties usually involve sending out invites to select people a couple weeks before. You will have to smuggle in food and drink and limit people who show up. Again, do this at your own peril! Never violate any laws! Be careful not to be too loud or you could generate a noise complaint!

, It may sound absolutely mad, but it can actually be very interesting. It's even better doing it out of a window because no one will notice you're staring at them.


Choose one or two people to watch, and see how they interact with other people and objects.
See how much you can tell about someone's character by the way they walk, what they do, what they eat, what they drink, and about half a million other things. Humans are fascinating creatures.

Protect your belongings.",How to Live on the Street," Lack of sleep is a major issue for individuals living on the streets because you let down your guard when you fall asleep. Always carry your blanket so that you can take advantage of a good sleeping opportunity.Sleeping bags are warm and suitable for outdoors.
Try a bivy sack, which is like a body-sized tent. It’s collapsible and will protect you from the elements.If you live in a very cold area, sleeping on the ground is risky even if you have a sleeping bag and warm clothes because the ground will absorb your body heat. You will need an inflatable insulated sleeping pad to keep in your heat.;
, If you are able to make friends with other individuals who are living on the street, arrange to sleep in a group so that you can designate lookouts. Your group doesn’t have to be large to be effective. Even one trusted individual can make sleeping safer.Get to know someone before you trust them with your safety. Remember that you are all trying to survive.

, Shelters offer a roof and usually showers, but they can be difficult to get into. Most cities have one, and many cities with a high concentration of homeless people have multiple shelters. Google Maps can help you locate the shelters in your area.


Be aware of your surroundings when you sleep in a shelter because other people in the shelter may pose a threat.Shelters are commonly non-profit, but some are for-profit. You may be charged a fee for using the shelter, so discuss your options before taking a bed.

, You are most at-risk while you are sleeping, but sleeping during the day will help you stay safer. While it may be difficult to get used to sleeping while it’s light out, you are less likely to be a victim of crime or to be arrested during the daytime.


Try a public park. You can spread out your blanket as though you are on a picnic.
Take a beach nap. If you are near a beach, consider sleeping there during the day. You can fold your blanket like a beach towel so that you blend in with other sunbathers. Be careful to use your sunscreen and avoid the hottest parts of the day.

, This is especially important if you choose to sleep at night. While you may dislike having people see you sleep, stay safe by choosing well-lit, high traffic locations where you are less likely to be a victim.

, Find a hot meal and possibly other services at soup kitchens, which are commonly run by churches and charities. Soup kitchens also offer networking and outreach opportunities. You can get to know other people who are living on the streets, and may find someone who can help you better your circumstances.If you can’t find a soup kitchen, try religious facilities, which usually offer some type of charitable support. You may be able to get a few grocery items or a store gift-card.
Ask the soup kitchen staff for information about related services, programs that help the homeless, and opportunities for assistance in getting off the streets, but don’t ask them to give you money or let you stay with them.

, While you want to avoid walking up to people and soliciting them for help, panhandling for food can keep you fed while you live on the streets. People are often more willing to donate food than to give money.

, If you are able to blend in with other customers, go into grocery stores and collect the free samples. Don’t take multiple samples from the same booth unless the person working the table gives you permission. Keep track of which store offers the most samples so that you can return there.


Be sure to act like a customer. It’s a good idea to make a small purchase, even if it’s just a single piece of fruit or a pack of noodles.
Visit farmer's markets after closing to see if you can get leftover produce for free or very cheap.

, Stores and restaurants throw out food every day, and some of that food could be going into your stomach. Dumpster diving has become common because even people who can afford food choose to do it.


Check the area around the dumpster so that you can avoid confrontations with people who may not want you to remove items from that dumpster, such as a business owner or someone who already dives there.
When in doubt, don’t eat food that might have gone bad.

, Your diet will likely suffer when you’re living on the streets, but you can keep yourself in better health by making sure you get enough protein. While you might not be able to get meat, low cost options exist. For example, try peanut butter for cheap protein that doesn’t need refrigeration. Beans are another great option, though you may need to warm them., Supplement your soup kitchen meals, samples, dumpster scores, and donations by keeping a snack stash. Depending on how much money you can find or earn, purchase or collect low-cost, non-perishable food that you can carry in your bag. Try nuts, trail mixes, and nut butters, which contain protein and fats. You can also try dried foods like raisins, beef jerky, and granola bars that are light and often nutritious, though they cost more.Remove packaging from food to make it less bulky and reduce weight.Look for snacks while you’re dumpster diving. They may be past their sell-by date, but they are usually still good for awhile.
Collect free condiments that you can use in a pinch when other food is unavailable.

, Water is more essential than food, so keep a water bottle with you at all times. Fill up your water bottle every time you see a water fountain or clean sink, even if it isn’t empty. While water is easily found in the city, you don’t want to risk being caught with an empty bottle because dehydration is one of your biggest risks.If you aren’t in a city, then look for flowing water or catch rain water., Public bathrooms are essential when you’re living on the street. Aside from being a place to relieve yourself, they offer you free running water, soap, and privacy. While it’s best to carry your own toiletries, if you can’t afford to buy soap or shampoo you can use the bathroom’s hand soap.Look for available public bathrooms in places like fast food restaurants, shopping centers, airports, libraries, colleges, and office buildings.Try turning a stall into a private wash station by bringing a container of water and mirror into the stall. If you are able to purchase one, you can acquire a collapsible bucket from an outdoor store.This is a great option if you cannot find a private bathroom.

, While most of your bathing will likely consist of bathroom sponge-baths, there are options for showering. You can try shelters, but you may be able to find a public shower that you can gain access to.


Try visiting gyms or the YMCA.While you may have to pay gym fees, you can ask if the gym offers free trials. You may be able to take advantage of one of these options, giving you access to the gym’s facilities.
Use the showers at a beach or campground.While these showers may sometimes lack privacy, they make washing yourself easier than it is in a sink. Act as though you belong, and it’s unlikely anyone will question you.

, It’s easier to clean yourself than it is to clean your clothes, but keeping your clothes smelling good will keep more opportunities open to you because people are less likely to suspect that you are living on the streets. While going to the laundromat weekly is best, if that is impossible then you can wash your clothes in the sink.


Check with your local shelter or soup kitchen to find out if they offer facilities for washing clothes.
Collect change to use in the laundromat. Coin-operated washers and dryers often cost between $1-1.25.
Wash your clothes in a bathroom sink a few pieces at a time then hang-dry them.

, Baking soda is cheap and can be used to keep both yourself and your clothes smelling better. Use it to wash your clothes and to deodorize your armpits and groin area. You can even use baking soda as natural deodorant.

, Public and university libraries are excellent resources for people living on the street. You can use the computers, access the internet, apply for jobs, read a book or magazine, gain shelter, and take advantage of the bathroom. If you are interested in finding a steady job and housing, the library can help you attain that., You don’t want to alert people to the fact that you are living on the streets because they will make assumptions about you and are likely to want you to stay away from them. This is especially important for if you are accessing stores, office buildings, and other facilities. Look for somewhere safe to stash extra items, or reduce your possessions so that they easily fit into a backpack and tote.When carrying a backpack, try to look like you’re either a hiking-enthusiast or a bicyclist who carries a backpack for convenience.
Try to use a bag that looks like a standard tote or reusable grocery bag so that people will assume that you are on your way home from shopping.

, While you will have to pay for it, a post office box can be instrumental in helping you maintain a lifestyle or get back on your feet if that’s your desire. You can have mail sent to your post office box, store small items in your box, and use it as an address on job applications. You may not be able to use it as an address to get services, but some post office box options will provide you with a usable address, so ask about your options., Your safety depends on you being aware of your surroundings. Living on the streets can be dangerous, especially since you can’t always tell who to trust. In addition to some people posing a threat to your safety, people may assume that you are the threat. Be cautious and courteous.

, As the cliche says, there is safety in numbers. Try to form partnerships with other people living on the streets so that you can keep each other safe. Living as a group will also allow you the option of keeping more possessions because you can take turns watching each other’s stuff., While the police usually mean security, for a person living on the streets they can also be a threat. Because of prejudices against people on the streets, you may be viewed as a criminal, especially in certain neighborhoods. Know where they tend to patrol and use that information to make the best decisions about where to sleep and where to seek shelter.Depending on your area, a police presence could make a place safer or less safe for sleeping. If you have a good relationship with the police in your area, then sleeping on their patrols could be a good option for you.
Always be respectful when interacting with the police, even if you feel you are being treated unfairly.

, When you live on the streets, you have to know the law well enough to protect yourself. No matter what anyone says, you still have rights. For example, in the U.S. you can legally hold up a sign asking for money in a public location because that falls under the First Amendment. On the flip side, some cities do have laws and ordinances that address the homeless population, so you need to check with local nonprofits to get that information.You can find pamphlets and more information at organizations such as the ACLU and nonprofits that focus on helping those who live on the streets.If you don’t know where to start, ask for help at your local soup kitchen or use the resources at the public library to do research.

, During harsh weather, don’t follow your normal sleeping patterns. Storms present an emergency situation when you’re living on the streets. Try places like transit terminals where you can blend in with stranded riders, or walk the aisles of an open shop if it’s during the day. You can also look for 24-hr waiting areas at airports or hospitals.If you do have a local airport, blend in with fellow travelers, which should allow you to take a nap in the waiting area. Be sure to move around, though, so that no one becomes suspicious., The sun can be dangerous, so use a hat to protect yourself from exposure. Additionally, a hat can help you stay warmer in cold weather. Visit a thrift store to find an affordable option that goes with your clothing so that it looks like a style choice.

, While it costs money, sunscreen will protect you from both skin cancer and detection. Sunburn is a common ailment among those living on the streets, so keep your status hidden by avoiding a red face., Living on the streets means that you’ll have to either reduce your belongings to what you can carry or establish a home base. If you work with a partner or group, then you can take turns guarding each other’s possessions.


Find out if a local shelter allows for people to store items there.
Carry a large stick or umbrella to ward off possible thieves.
Cover your belongings when you sleep, and if possible wrap part of the bag around your leg or arm so that if someone tries to steal it they’ll risk waking you.

Never leave your room without your key.",How to Handle Being Locked Out of Your Hotel Room1," This goes without saying in the first place; you can easily avoid being locked out if you take the key with you when you leave. Always double check that you have it with you when you leave for the day, and when returning to the room at night. If you tend to be forgetful, put the key somewhere obvious before going to bed, like on top of your clothes or inside your shoes.

Dress well.,
Stand tall and behave in a confident manner.,
Speak clearly and with forethought.,
Have reasonable expectations of what ""VIP treatment"" is.,
Be generous.,
Take advantage of all the hotel has to offer.,
Stay at the right kind of hotel.,
Remember that your hotel experience is what you make it.",How to Get VIP Treatment at a Hotel," Do not turn up in rumpled clothing, your tracksuit or flip flops. Get some style! Wear really smart casual, or even a suit/professional outfit. Your luggage should also be in excellent condition, neat and of good quality.;
, Carry yourself with a sense of entitlement. Hotel staff (and anyone) will respond immediately to someone who ""fills the space"" with self-confidence and assurance. Note that this does not mean arrogance - that will put them offside immediately.

, You need to think about what you are going to ask of hotel staff. If you want an upgrade, be open and concise about it. Make suggestions as to how they might be able to accommodate your wishes and how these can make your stay a little easier. Gentle reminders of your continued patronage, former patronage and the patronage of your firm, family and friends can assist. Being friendly, understanding of their limitations and paying a little extra can also assist.

, It isn't about people kowtowing to you and having them clap their hands for instant service just for you. VIP service is about service staff wanting to give you treatment that goes beyond the normal, including access to special packages or bonuses that the hotel has on offer. You will be treated as a VIP if you make others around you feel like VIPs too.

, If you want good treatment, treat people well. Give them decent tips. Not only that, give them compliments and notice things about them that they appreciate being acknowledged - tell them they have a great smile, that their service is above reproach and that they have been a total help to you. People like to hear that they are helpful, good and special.

, You are more likely to get VIP treatment if you are using more than just their accommodations service.

, VIP treatment at your average run-of-the-mill budget hotel just doesn't feature. Why should it? These places are no-frills and your expectation of getting VIP treatment as such places would be really unreasonable. Choose the right hotel where you know that VIP treatment is part of the deal.

, Being sullen, angry and irritable won't win you any prizes. Be gracious if things aren't quite the way that you expected but the hotel staff do their best to try to accommodate you. A small room tonight can turn into the palatial suite the next night if you have shown to them that you are good-natured, ready to forgo a little now for something better tomorrow. Your helpfulness will be remembered and rewarded; just as any difficult behavior will be remembered and acted upon.

Assess the situation.,
If you're dressed appropriately to be seen in public, simply go to front desk and ask for a replacement key to your room.",How to Handle Being Locked Out of Your Hotel Room2," Are you dressed appropriately to be seen in public? Wearing anything from everyday clothes to simply pants and a shirt is acceptable. If all you have is a towel or underwear, it may be embarrassing, but still legal. Almost everywhere, being completely nude is illegal.;
, If one isn't available, ask to see if maintenance personnel can use a master key.

"
"
Stop and think.,
If no one is available to help, look for a phone or use your cell phone.,
If you cannot find a phone, look for anything you can use to wear.,
Look for something to cover yourself up with if nothing else is available.,
If you can't find anything to cover yourself, and there are no other options, use the stairs to reach the front desk and poke your head around the door.,
If there is no door, poke your head around the wall, or whatever is there.,
As a last resort, take a deep breath, put your hands where you need them to be, and run to the receptionist.",How to Handle Being Locked Out of Your Hotel Room3," Are you alone on your trip? Is there anyone else staying with you? If there is, go to their room and borrow suitable clothing from them to ask for a key, or have them ask the front desk for you. If a friend or family member is sharing the same room with you, but is not present, call them to come to the hotel and use their key.

, Some hotels have guest phones or payphones in the hallways you can use to call the front desk. Explain the situation, and ask them to send someone up with a key.

, A coat hanging on a door, a bath towel, etc. Go to the front desk wearing this, remembering to return the items once you can get back in your room.

, Be prepared to draw attention when holding up a potted plant or newspaper to yourself, but if it is all you can find, it is necessary.

, Call for someone to help, and explain your situation. Do not use the elevators to get downstairs; you'll want to create as little disturbance as possible.

, Call for security if the front desk isn't nearby, or if someone bothers you.

, If it helps you, pray to God that there is no one else around to see you, and quickly ask them for a key.

Arriving too early will only give the hotel management a sense of rush to get the room ready, and defeat your chances of upgrading to better digs.
Arriving later can also be a benefit if the hotel needs your standard room before you get there. Let the management know you’ll be arriving late so you don’t loose your room. At the same time, tell them you would be happy with an upgraded room if they end up needing your standard room.

Search in the areas you know you want to visit.,
Visit the AboutFrance website.,
Confirm availability and price.,
Ask about atmosphere.,
Visit - and book - through a hostel’s website directly.",How to Find a Hostel in Paris1," The location of your accommodations is an especially important factor while traveling. This is especially true in a city such as Paris, where there is so much to do and see. Accordingly, start your search in areas with close proximity to the specific places you want to visit in Paris. By using an online map that will allow you to search within specific areas, you can narrow your options according to what will put you in the best location to enjoy your stay.


Major areas of interest in Paris include the Latin Quarter, Bastille, Marais, Montmartre. On the other hand, look in less popular neighborhoods for a quieter stay and potentially lower fees.
For instance, if you know you want to spend an afternoon or two in the shadow of the Eiffel tower, look for a hostel in the neighborhood called the 7e arrondissement. Similarly, if hoping to walk to the Louvre, look for options in or near Tuileries.Account for your anticipated method of travel as well. For instance, if you're planning on riding a bus around the city, you may want to choose a hostel near a bus stop.;
, Despite a dated interface, AboutFrance.com is a valuable resource of information on hostels and more. From the homepage, click Accommodations, then Hostels in France, and finally Hostels in Paris. It recommends a handful of specific hostels., If you know you want to stay in a certain area, check to see if there is availability at the hostels located in that area. While many hostels posted information regarding availability on their websites, it is worth calling the hostel directly if you’re hoping to book lodging within 48 hours of arrival. Find specific hostels’ numbers online.


While on the phone with a hostel staff member, ask something like, “What are my options to stay Thursday through Sunday this weekend?” If there are multiple types of accommodations available, ask what the price difference is, as well as the difference in amenities for each option.

, If you’re hoping to stay a few nights starting that day or the next, it’s worth inquiring what the mood is like that the hospital. Call a hostel you’re considering and ask, “Hey, just wondering how full you are this weekend, and what types of groups are staying with you?”


Though these calls may not be too fruitful, they may give you important information. For instance, you may learn that the Fête de la Musique is happening, with plenty of events nearby the hostel. On the other hand, you may learn that several rugby teams are currently occupying every bed in the shared room save the one that could become yours.In any event, it’s worth asking for additional info regarding other guests and events in the surrounding area when speaking with a particular hostel.

, For instance, check out the website for the Auberge Internationale des Jeunes in Paris. On it’s homepage, there’s a brief description, a notification of its approval by Lonely Planet, and a link to book an extremely inexpensive stay in the Bastille neighborhood. For many travelers, you can get all the information you need from the hostel’s website alone.Booking directly through the hostel is the best way to avoid booking fees. Further, they will likely charge less than booking websites. Note that booking websites may make it seem like you’re getting a deal when you may actually be paying more than necessary.

Consider Hostelling International hostels.,
Check impartial online reviews.,
Read Lonely Planet’s review especially.",How to Find a Hostel in Paris2," Hostelling International (HI) is a organization of hostels that meet certain quality standards. You have to be a member (which costs a different amount depending on where you’re from, $18 if you’re a U.S. citizen) or pay an additional fee to stay at Hl hostels. There are three in Paris - Jules Ferry, Yves Robert, and Le d'Artagnan. While staying at an HI hotel does come with some reassurance the the hostel will be adequate in terms of amenities and security, it it not necessarily the best nor cheapest option.Independent hostels of comparable quality are often of comparable cost, if not cheaper. Essentially, whether or not a member is part of the HI network should not factor significantly into your decision.

, There are many different review websites online, in part because they do what they offer a valuable service: helping you decide all sorts of things, including which hostel is the one for you. Foremost, ensure that any hostel you’re considering is well-known. In short, ensure that reviews actually do exist, and that they are most often positive.


More specifically, make sure there are not multiple reviews about security concerns. While many hostels involve staying with strangers, some do a better job of offering you lockers, etc. to stash your goods.
Though it is a U.S. based company, Yelp is used by travelers from around the world. Many Parisian hostels are heavily reviewed on this website, and it can help provide useful information.

, The Lonely Planet website, although popular, is not necessarily the best way to search for hostels. It does offer pretty good reviews though. Look up any hostels you’re considering on Lonely Planet’s website and see if they’ve published a review about it. They usually do a good job of covering the main points you should know about a certain place concisely and accurately.Since Paris is such a popular place to visit, practically every hostel you may be considering has been reviewed by Lonely Planet. You can search hostels by name on the Lonely Planet website.

Limit noise and sound.,
Be courteous to other tenants.",How to Find an Apartment in Japan," Sites like Tokyo Roomfinder and Japan Homefinder are there to give you insight into what is available in the area you want to stay in.


There are foreigner-friendly rental agencies specifically to help people new to Japan find accommodations. Foreigners typically find difficulty finding housing in the traditional housing market.Apartment finders and real estate sites will have plenty of listings of potential places you should look into.;
, Here are some key terms to know:


1K is a one room apartment with a kitchen.
1DK is a one room apartment with dining room and kitchen.
2LDK is a two room apartment with a living room, dining room and kitchen.

, There are real-estate services that will have the connections to set you on the right course. If you're not yet fluent in speaking Japanese, it helps to bring a Japanese friend along with you to interpret what's being said.Only apartments that are currently vacant will be viewable by new prospective tentants.Real estates tend to focus their efforts on specific neighbourhoods. Because of this, you should figure out what neighbourhood you would prefer to live in before linking up with an agent.
Able is a well-known real estate service., Even if there's a specific area you're planning on living in, you should still have a fair degree of options available to you. Because Japan's urban layout is so dense, you may find multiple potential places that are all within walking distance of one another.


Apartment rates will vary wildly depending on the closeness to a city centre you're renting in. In a city centre, rates will vary from 100000-200000 ¥ per month. Outside of a city centre, rates tend to vary from 50000-150000 ¥ per month, depending on the size and amount of rooms in the apartment. This roughly equals to 1000-2000 USD and 500-1000 USD respectively.
If you're budget savvy, you may try getting a room at a jiko bukken. These properties are seen as tainted because a tenant died there from unnatural causes. Because a potentially ""haunted"" house is more difficult to sell, you may get a deal on it., Companies such as Leopalace21 and UR acknowledge the difficulties of finding lodging in Japan, and offer short-term accommodations that can be renewed on a weekly basis.


Leopalace21 hires staff with experience in English, making it a perfect choice for people coming from abroad., Here are the important documents you will need:


A copy of your passport (if you're a foreigner.)
A copy of your residence card.
Recent pay slips or bank statement, to prove that you have the money to pay.A domestic emergency contact, to call in case there's a problem and someone needs to get involved. This should be a Japanese person that can otherwise vouch for you.
Verification of employment. Many agencies will only hire you if you can prove that you will make at least 300% of what your rent will cost.A character reference. As in Western cultures, a character reference is a quick letter from someone indicating that they're dependable. This will give the landlord some bonus assurance that you're reliable when it comes to keeping the apartment responsibly.

, A guarantor is required in order to sign any tenancy agreement. This refers to an individual that will vouch for you and pay up the slack for you if you fail to meet the terms of the agreement. A guarantor needs to be a Japanese national. If you cannot find a guarantor of your own, there are agencies that will act as guarantor for you for a nominal fee., If you're looking for a place, you may need as much as six months rent just to get started with a place. Here are some of the fees you should look out for:


A real estate agent's fee called “Chukai Tesuryo"". This is non-refundable and is typically one month’s rent.
A security deposit called shikikin. This is typically two or three months' rent.You are also expected to provide a gift to the landlord. This is referred to as a reikin. Unlike the security deposit, this is non-refundable. It is typically between 1-2 months rent.
A reservation fee called tetsukeikin. It’s refunded as soon as you sign contracts. This is the agency's way of making sure you’re serious about the deal.

, Above all, the Japanese respect politeness, punctuality and civility. You should take great lengths to coming across as a consummate professional when you meet a landlord to discuss contract agreements. This includes being to the meeting on time (or early, if possible), and dressing as you would to a job interview.


Some landlords won't rent to foreigners or non-Japanese races based on the perceived friction it may create. If you're new to the country, this may make it more difficult for you.Unfortunately, discrimination cases don't usually go through in Japan currently. However, you should still file a complaint nonetheless if you feel you're being discriminated against based on your race.If you are having trouble finding a landlord who will take foreigners, you may want to go through a foreigner-friendly real estate agent.

, Once you have found a place you want and the landlord has accepted you, it's time to sign a contact. Take extra time to read through the contact, and get a Japanese friend to interpret the writing for you if you aren't yet fluent.


Make sure to have all of the money needed to pay your fees in advance of signing the agreement.

, Above all, Japanese apartments tend to be much smaller than their Western equivalents. The walls are thinner. This makes it so that sound carries between apartments easier. In addition, most older Japanese buildings do not have Western toilets. Instead, they have ""squatter"" toilets. If you're new to living in Japan, this may take some getting used to.

, Much like the West, outlets like IKEA and even Craigslist are perfect for finding furniture at a relative discount. In addition, because there are many foreigners staying in Japan for a fixed amount of time, some rental agencies will rent you the furniture for a given amount of time. This way, you won't have to buy the furniture new.

, Regulations and discipline are highly regarded in Japanese culture. Each apartment contract should have its regulations listed. Talk to your landlord if you're unsure.

, Japanese society values its peace and quiet. There is an understanding that you won't play music or be loud during the day or night. If you need to let loose, you may do so in a public area. Residences should be seen as places of rest rather than recreation.

, Above all, a successful stay in a Japanese apartment will be defined by how well you get along with fellow tenants in the building. Go out of your way to treat others with respect, and do what you can to accommodate them. Chances are the other tenants will offer you the same respect in turn.


If you are a Westerner planning on coming to Japan to stay, be aware of some of the negative stereotypes the Japanese people may have. Some Japanese see foreigners as unnecessarily crude and loud. If you show them how polite you can be, you'll force them to rethink this position.

Using these search engines to find and sort hotel rates can save time and money. Don't forget to check DealAngel to make sure the rate you book is actually a bargain.

, These sites can offer lower prices because the rates aren't available to the general public. Vacationist is a members-only site that holds special sales on luxury hotels around the world. Hotel Engine is a members-only site that offers discounted rates on a ton of hotels and claims to beat the prices found on other sites most of the time. Membership in both clubs is free.

, If you are flexible about the date of your stay, investigate different days of the week or an alternative week.

, If the hotel is merely a place to stay, consider a motel or inn instead, with a free continental breakfast so you can continue with your trip quickly. If you'll be staying at the hotel with loved ones for two or more days, consider spending more for nicer stays.

, Sometimes it will pay off to pay more for a hotel nearer your destination.

, These include free breakfasts, Wi-Fi, elevators, and swimming pools. Most places offer a free breakfast and Wi-Fi, both make your stay more convenient and efficient.

,, Investigate the prices on the site. Do they have any specials? Sign up to be notified of any specials by email. Note the prices for the date you'll be traveling.

,


Tell them you are interested in getting a good deal. When they say the price, make a counter offer and take a hard line when negotiating. Most hotels will offer very good deals for the night after 6:00 P.M. if they have a lot of unsold inventory (otherwise the revenue will be lost on those rooms). After 8:00 P.M., you may be able to negotiate to a 75% discount, especially with smaller, owner-managed, hotels.
Ask for any discounts. Most places don't advertise the discounts, but will offer them upon being asked. There are multiple types of discounts, so see if you'll qualify for one or two of them:

Automobile association cards
Senior rates
Entertainment cards
Business traveler rates
Government/veteran rates
Discounts for booking more than one room, or staying more than one night.


Ask if the hotel will match its price with a cheaper hotel of similar quality.

, After you've gathered the details, you can book your room and be confident that you are getting the best rate possible.

, If you are a walk-in guest (meaning you don't have reservations at the hotel) take advantage of the front desk staff. Tell them you're only looking for a place to sleep, and ask them for the best deal they can give you. Chances are, they'll lower their advertised price in order to keep you from walking out the door. Most hotels are willing to negotiate their rates down by about $20. In the eyes of the business, selling a room for $20 less than planned is better than not selling the room at all.

, If a hotel isn't full, you can often get an upgraded room, like a king bed or corner room, just by asking. This may not save money, but it will get you more for the money you are spending.

Avoid bringing anything unnecessary to your trip or that you will be upset to lose when traveling.,
If you have valuables with you when you're traveling, ask the hotel staff to lock them in the general safe.,
Never leave items lying around in your room exposed for the housekeeping staff to see, or for people to see through your windows.,
If possible, lock your hotel room door, windows, and balcony doors (if applicable) whenever you leave the room and before you go to sleep.,
Don't be flamboyant with your wealth.",How to Deter Hotel Thieves," Do you really need to bring jewelry on a beach vacation? Will you really make use of a fancy laptop on a camping trip? Ask yourself these kind of questions when packing, and bring only the essentials.;
, Most hotels will have one somewhere near the lobby, or behind the front desk. Better yet, many hotel rooms nowadays even have a personal safe which you can use yourself.

, Even if your room is located several stories up from the street, ambitious thieves have gone to great lengths to steal things of great value. Be sure to zip up suitcases and tuck away souvenir purchases before going out for the day, or store them away securely in your room's closet.

, Balconies are often built adjacent to one another, and a guest next door could climb across to enter your room or take something lying out on the balcony.

, Avoid looking like a clueless tourist, particularly when you're near the hotel or in the lobby, as people will notice you and sometimes target you as a vulnerable subject.

Do your homework.,
Consider your options.,
Keep your budget in check.,
Refer to the map.,
Set your priorities.,
Keep the time factor in mind.",How to Choose the Right Accommodation in London," This is the first step and perhaps the most important one! While you are looking for hotel websites, give preference to those websites that have a wide range of accommodation options available in the city. You can choose accommodation from such websites according to your requirements. In addition to this, see to it that the hotel website has a commanding authority and varied options available.;
, While you are browsing through a hotel website, make sure that you read each section given on it. Sometimes, there are special offers and packages on some selected hotels that may not be visible on the home page of the hotel website. Therefore, it is mandatory that you scour the site quite comprehensively.

, Frame your London trip budget well in advance, especially the budget for your accommodation. Formulate the projections of both your maximum and minimum limit of your accommodation budget. Other than this, take into account factors like location, facilities, star ratings, and services while framing the budget.

, If you want your hotel in London to be at a comfortable distance from the city centre, then always refer to the map while you are zeroing in on your desired hotel in London.


Mark out your priorities such as whether you want your hotel to be close to Central London or not and stick to them.

, What type of hotel do you want? Do you want a bed and breakfast hotel, or you simply want to book a budget hotel? Find answers to these questions before choosing the accommodation option for your trip to London. Not creating equilibrium between your priorities and your accommodation choice can cause discomfort to you. For example, if you were travelling to London with your family, then choosing a hotel with no family rooms would be extremely unwise.

, While deciding on the hotel options, do keep this factor into consideration. Would you be staying in London for an extended period of time or are you here for a long weekend? Certainly, a long trip will be heavier on your pocket than a short rendezvous in the city. Hence, choose budget hotels or cheap accommodation for a long trip even, if they are slightly farther from the centre of the city. You can always make up for the time, as you are on a long trip to the city.

Record.",How to Choose the Right Accommodation when Traveling and Maximize Your Budget," You may say it is something as general as a vacation or a business trip, but it is good to actually specify what you want. You may be traveling for a business trip yes, but you also may want to relax, or explore the country you are going to. You may want a vacation, but do you want try something adventurous, or you just want a spa? Deciding on these things will help you plan where to stay, and this could probably save you time and money too since you can choose the right accommodation that can cater to all your needs.;
, Knowing or setting the length of your stay can lead you to adjust your accommodation as well.A long trip will cost more if you stay in a hotel rather than a hostel, but a short trip and a slightly more expensive hotel near the area where you want can save you transportation costs as well. So know your time, and add some leeway of a day in case of emergencies.

, Draw up a budget table with possible projections on how high you would want to spend for you accommodation. Think of the services you want to avail and extra transportation costs if necessary.

, Now that you have your criteria for your accommodation, you have plenty of options regarding accommodation. Besides hotels, there are other types of accommodation that you may want to try to fit your needs. Look at your budget, the duration of your stay, and your objectives. Then look at the options that are available to you.
The various options are:

Hotels – Hotels are the most common accommodation that you will find. They are usually well advertised and are located in decent areas of interest at a certain tourist location or city. Most of them can be a little more expensive than most, but they pay that back with additional services. This is perfect for the business trip, or that indulgent vacation you've been planning. Most Hotels have their own websites already if you want to book online. Otherwise try going to websites like www.bookhotels.com or www.hotels.com to find a hotel.
Hostels – Hostels are famous for their cheapness. They are affordable because they have less services than a hotel, and sometimes a bit further away from important tourist sites. However, hostels have a culture unto their own as the less expensive rates invite a younger and more diverse crowd. There are in fact Youth Hostels that have age limits on people who want to stay. Hostels are perfect for the backpacker adventurer on a budget. It is also a nice option for those who want to stretch their budget and explore more. Some hostels do have a website where you can book a room. Otherwise, listing sites like www.hostels.com and www.hostelworld.com can help you find the hostel you want.
Rental Apartments/Villas – There is such a thing as renting a vacation apartment or villa. These are places, like an apartment, house or villa which you can rent for a long time for your vacation or business trip. This is perfect for those who want a private home away from home to themselves. Usually the rates on these apartments can save you money from hotels especially of you are staying for a significant amount of time. Some hotel services though may be lacking depending on the apartment being rented, but most offer standard even luxurious amenities. Some apartments may advertise online directly, but there are also directory websites that list the apartments for rent in a particular country. Websites like www.vacation-apartments.com or www.110apartments.com do this. Apartments are perfect for a couple or group of people who want their privacy, or a whole family that is staying for a long trip in a foreign country.
Bread and Breakfasts/Inns - Bread and breakfasts are similar to hotels, but at a smaller scale. More likely they are found across the country side of a country. They offer accommodation for a night and some breakfast (hence the term). But nowadays some “B&B's” operate almost at the level of a small hotel. B&B's are good for that quick overnight stay at a location. Most are cheaper than a full fledged hotel but offer some of the services that the hotels have.. Not all bed and breakfasts are listed online. Try searching for forums if there are “B&B's” in the place you are going to.
Camping Areas - By far the cheapest accommodation you can pay for is a camp site. Of course you need your own tent. Once you have it, you can search for listings of campsites that you can use in your target country. Sites like www.eurocampings.co.uk can let you locate the various campsites that are available and the price for pitching your tent. Most officially camping areas provide bathroom services to those who stay. Camping areas are of course for those who have a fair experience in backpacking and the outdoors.

, One of the many great uses of the Internet is that you can gather a lot of opinions. There are plenty of forums out there like Travel.com Travel.org and other travel related sites that exchange tips, opinions and suggestions about travel and accommodations. While reading and researching you should slowly form a good picture of the accommodation that you have decided upon. Also look into furnished apartments.

, Lastly, compare you research with the criteria you formed earlier. Look if the accommodation you chose matches or at least covers most of the things you want. Afterward, Book it!

, Once you get to your destination, take note of all your experiences in that accommodation. If you can SHARE the experience be it bad or good so that you can offer your wisdom somewhere else. Share it in the Internet.

If you teach history in chronological order, African American history should be covered in each century as it becomes relevant.;
, You can ask students to choose a date, research it, and present their discoveries at the beginning of each class., Students can only understand and absorb African American history lesson plans if they are catered to the style of learning that is most effective. The following are general guidelines for teaching African American history through the grades:

, Explain a lesson with a short story, and illustrate it with singing, a pageant, or an art project., If your state is rich in African American history, then bring your class to view a historic location. Ask the students to talk or do a short assignment on what they learned., They can understand the cultural, social and political implications of African American history.

Request to talk to the general manger.,
Contact the corporate entity, if one exists.,
Contact whoever you booked the hotel with.,
File a complaint with any relevant regulatory body.,
Post a review on internet websites.,
File a complaint with consumer report or better business websites.,
Tell friends and associates.",How to Complain About Your Hotel Stay," Your first step in complaining about a hotel stay is to talk to the person at the front desk of the hotel. This person will serve as your initial point of contact for lodging a formal complaint or seeking some sort of rectification. You can do this during or after a hotel stay.


Approach the front desk calmly and politely. Say: “Hello, I stayed in room 304 this last week and I experienced problems during my stay.
Clearly state your problem or issue. Say: “During my stay, bed bugs infested my suitcase.”
Explain what will give you satisfaction. Be realistic about what you want the hotel to do to make you happy. Rather than demanding that the hotel compensate you for replacing your wardrobe (after all, you can’t prove your accusation), request a refund for your stay and/or vouchers for the future.
Avoid cutting the person off when they are responding. Always listen carefully and attentively until it is your turn to speak.;
, If the front desk person is unwilling or unable to rectify the problem, you need to request to speak to a manager. Very often, managers have the ability (and knowledge) to rectify problems that other staff cannot.


Politely ask for the manager on duty. Say something like: “Thank you so much for your help, but I would like to talk with a manager.”
If you’re not on site, call the location and ask for the manager., After speaking to the manager on duty, you may still need to escalate your complaint. In the end, the general manager should be open to hear your complaint and to taking steps to resolve any outstanding issues.


Politely ask the manager or staff member for the general manager’s contact information.
The staff member or shift manager may be hesitant to provide the general manager’s contact information. Make sure to be polite and insist until they relent. Follow up initial phone calls or personal inquiries for this information until you get the general manager’s contact information.
Explain to the nature of the problem to the general manager. Be polite and compliment the customer service of their employees, if appropriate. Insist that you are unsatisfied and you think the problem needs to be addressed in a different way.
If you’re dealing with a large chain, like Marriot or Ramada, you may have an easier time finding a general manager who is willing to hear your complaint. Smaller chains or independent hotels may listen to you, but will be a lot less likely to offer you compensation., If onsite staff are unwilling to help, unable to help, or if you are still dissatisfied, you may want to contact the larger business entity. As the entity responsible for the branding of the business, a corporate office may be much more responsive to consumer complaints.


Do an internet search on the business and look for their corporate contact information.
Send an email or a letter to the appropriate person. Make sure to be polite and clearly articulate the problem or issue.
Call the corporate entity and ask for customer service or the customer complaint department. Be polite and clearly explain the problem. Say something like “Hello, I was a guest at your location in Boston’s Back Bay. I was extremely disappointed with the service and cleanliness offered there. I feel taken advantage of.”, If you booked the hotel through a travel or booking website, you may be able to complain directly to that business.


Be prepared to be put on hold for potentially long periods of time when contacting booking website customer service.
Clearly articulate your complaint.
Have your transaction number or receipt at hand.
Be able to provide evidence, such as photographs, police reports, or the names of customer service representatives at the hotel.
Be aware that hotel or travel booking websites are very often unresponsive to customer complaints. This owes to their high volume and slim margins on individual transactions.
If the booking business is unable to resolve your complaint, your last recourse is to post a negative review about the hotel in question on their website., Depending on your complaint, you should consider contacting the relevant regulatory body. As government agencies that oversee businesses that offer public accommodations, they’ll be able to deal with and issue appropriate sanctions.


If you’re complaining about a health and sanitation issue, contact the local health department.
Consider contacting the state or province’s division or department of hotels and restaurants. If your complaint is serious enough, the licensing agent may take action or launch an investigation into the hotel in question., You may also want to share your complaint with people on the internet. To do this, write reviews on popular internet travel and booking sites. By doing this, your complaint will reach a relatively wide audience.


Write up a short review of no more than a couple hundred words in a word processing program.
Post your review on websites like Yelp and TripAdvisor.
Do an internet search for travel and booking websites. Post your complaint at various relevant websites to better get the word out.
Know that some review websites have complicated relationships with hotels and booking companies. They may censor or remove your complaint., If sharing your complaint with people through travel websites does not give you satisfaction, step up your actions and file a complaint with consumer report type websites.


File a complaint on consumerreports.org.
Write a complaint on the Better Business Bureau website, at www.bbb.org.
Submit complaints to relevant organizations in the area or region the hotel servers. This way, you’ll let locals know about the problems or bad service you received., You may also want to share your bad experience with friends or associates. This is especially important if you’re complaining about a local hotel or a hotel in which your friends and other people you know may frequent.


If someone you know tells you they’re thinking about visiting that hotel, share your experience.
Don’t embellish your experience.
Avoid personal attacks on employees who work at the hotel.

Contact your local landmark preservation commission.,
Nominate your landmark.,
Attend the public hearing.,
Receive a copy of the commission's report.,
Follow the voting process.",How to Register a Historical Landmark1," Larger cities, counties, or metropolitan areas typically have their own commission to designate landmarks of local historical significance.Since the procedure for registering a local landmark varies greatly depending on the historical landmark registration laws in the state and the rules established by local governments, it's best to contact the commission directly to find out the specifics.
In some states, local designation is more of an honorary thing that doesn't come with many of the benefits available to locations registered as state of national historical landmarks.
Most local commissions, particularly in larger cities and metropolitan areas, have their own website. You also can find information about your local commission by checking with your state historical society.
Each city has its own criteria regarding which properties may be designated local historical landmarks. Typically they must be at least 30 years old and have a particular historical value or interest to the city, or be associated with individuals who have historical value to the city and its development.;
, The local commission typically will have an application form that you must fill out to nominate your location for designation as a historical landmark. If you are not the owner of the property, you typically also must have permission from the owner.In smaller locations, particularly where local designation is only honorary, there may not be a formal application. In those cases, you can send a letter or make a nomination in person at a city council meeting.
Cities with formal applications typically require information such as the location of the property, the name and contact information of the owner, and the reason you're nominating the location as a historical landmark.
Some cities may charge a fee to file an application. The fees typically vary in relation to the size of the property and specific structure you are applying to have designated as a historical landmark.
The fee typically will be a few hundred dollars, but may be more if you are not the owner of the property.

, Typically the formal review process begins with a public hearing at which anyone can testify regarding the location and whether it should be designated a historical landmark.The commission may review the application to confirm the location meets the city's criteria before approving it for a formal review process. Agency staff may visit the location and take photos or collect other evidence of the condition of the property and its historic significance.
You will be notified if there will be a public hearing on your application. The notice will include the date, time, and location of the hearing.
At the hearing, any member of the public can comment on the application. You may want to have family or friends attend who can testify as to the historical significance of the site you want to register as a local historical landmark.

, After the public hearing and additional evaluation of the location, the local commission typically will release a report with its recommendation on whether to designate the location a historical landmark.In some cities, this is the end of the process. After a public hearing, the commission makes a decision on whether to designate the location a historical landmark, and that decision is final.
In other cities, this is only the beginning of the process. If the city's historic commission recommends a property for landmark status, that recommendation is forwarded to other bodies such as the city council to vote on a final resolution.

, Different cities and counties vary widely in terms of what happens after the commission has decided whether a location should be designated a historical landmark. Some require additional rounds of voting by the city council, or approval by the mayor.For example, to have a property designated as a historical landmark in New York City, the commission must complete a formal review and vote to approve the designation at the public hearing.
After the commission vote, the City Council has 120 days to modify or disapprove the commission's designation – however, City Council approval is not required. If the City Council doesn't act within 120 days, the designation becomes final.
New York City also gives the Mayor the ability to veto a City Council vote within five days of the Council's decision. The Council then has 10 days to override the Mayor's vote with a two-thirds majority.
After designation as a historical landmark, you typically will have to fill out additional forms if your city provides tax credits or other benefits to historical landmarks. These applications may come with additional fees.

"
"
Review your state's criteria.,
Complete the application.,
Submit your application to the appropriate state agency.,
Attend the designation meeting.,
Follow through with registration.",How to Register a Historical Landmark2," Each state has its own standards for whether a property qualifies for registration as a historical landmark. You typically can find your state's criteria either by going to the state's historical preservation website or by visiting the office in person.Generally, the property must have architectural or historical significance, or be associated with an individual who is of historical significance – such as the only private residence designed by a famous architect, or the birthplace of a state resident who became President of the United States.
In most states the property must be at least 30 or 40 years old. However, other states such as California have no age requirement.
California's designation requirements focus more on the unique quality of a property or style of architecture, and the place's impact on major events of historical significance.
Some states such as Kansas have an additional stage of the application process, which requires you to first file a form with preliminary site information and receive an eligibility letter before you can proceed with your application for registration.

, The application form requires you to identify the property you want to register as a historical landmark and the owner of that property. You also must include information as to why that property qualifies as a historical landmark.In some states, the state application requires basically the same information as a national application would require. Other states develop their own application to reflect more state-specific requirements.
Some states require additional documents. Typically you can download a packet of information that will detail what must be included in the application.
Most states require permission from the owner if you are not the owner of the property. In some cases you also must file a notarized affidavit from the owner expressing his or her approval of the application.
In some states, you may be required to have a nomination sponsor or hired consultant to complete the application and certify the research on which the claims of historical significance are based.

, Once you've completed the application and any other required documents, make a copy of them for your records and submit them to the state historical society or historic preservation commission.Typically you'll need to submit the form to the same agency from which you received the application forms. There should be an address on the form itself, or included within the form's instructions.
After you submit your application, it may be evaluated by staff at the agency. You may be contacted with notes or revisions to your application, or questions regarding particular claims.
If more information or documentation is required, the state agency will let you know.

, After your application is received, your state's historical society may have an initial review followed by a public or semi-public meeting to discuss the designation of the property as a historical landmark.Typically you will receive a notice letting you know of the date, time, and location of the designation hearing.
You and others can attend the meeting to testify as to the property's historical significance.
Individuals opposed to the designation also may be able to attend the meeting and say their piece about why the property should not be designated as a landmark to be preserved.

, Each state has its own process for approving the designation of historical landmarks. As the applicant or owner of the property, you typically must attend additional meetings or fill out additional forms once the application is approved to complete your registration.For example, applications in Kansas are reviewed and ultimately approved by votes of the Kansas Sites Historic Sites Board of Review. Recommendations are presented to the Board by historic society staff or qualified professional consultants.
In California, the historic commission votes on applications after the public hearing. Approved applications are forwarded to the Director of California State Parks for final approval.
Once you receive notice that the application has been approved, you may have to complete additional forms to have a plaque installed or to receive tax benefits.

Receive notification of registration.",How to Register a Historical Landmark3," Registration of a national historical landmark begins by working with your state's preservation office to get the research materials, forms, and other information necessary to complete the process.You can get the forms in person by stopping by the SHPO office. Most states and territories also have a website where application forms, other documents, and instructions are available.
Staff at your SHPO also are available to answer questions and assist you in filling out the forms you must complete to nominate a property for registration as a historical landmark.
If the property is located on federal or tribal land, you must work with the nearest Federal Preservation or Tribal Preservation Office.

, Properties generally must be of the required age and integrity, and have national historical significance. In most cases, the property must have had historical significance for at least 50 years.The property must be old enough to be considered historic, generally at least 50 years old, and it must look substantially the same way it looked when the historic events that give it significance occurred.
Properties that achieved historic significance within the past 50 years may be eligible for designation if they are considered to be of exceptional importance.
The property must be associated with people, activities, events, developments, or achievements that were important in the past.
Historical significance includes architectural, engineering, or landscaping achievements, such as if a house was designed by a famous architect or the building was the first to incorporate a major structural development.
Birthplaces of major historical figures typically have more significance if there is no other property associated with the person's productive life.

, The registration form for the National Register requires you to provide significant information about the property you want registered as a historical landmark and make a case for that property's historical significance.You must establish and present reasons for the property's historical significance. You may want to attach photos or documents to support your claims, such as newspaper clippings from the time of the historical event associated with the property.
Examples of completed nomination forms for approved applications are available on the National Park Service's website. You also may be able to see completed forms at your SHPO.
Completed forms can give you a good example of what the National Park Service is looking for and the information necessary to get an application approved.
National Register Bulletins also contain information and instructions for nominating a property for designation as a national historical landmark.

, To register a national historic landmark, you must first submit your forms to your state historic preservation office. The state office will review the application and send the proposed nomination to the state's National Register Review Board.After your forms are submitted, the SHPO will notify property owners and local governments and ask for public comment on the nomination.
Although anybody can nominate a property for designation as a historical landmark, the nomination won't proceed unless the property owner agrees to it.
The SHPO and your state's National Register Review Board will review your application materials and determine whether to recommend designation. This process takes a minimum of 90 days.

, After a review of your application is complete, the nomination will be sent to the Keeper of the National Record of Historic Places along with certifying recommendations for a final listing decision.The National Park Service will make a decision on whether to list the property in the National Register of Historic Places within 45 days after the complete nomination is received.
If your property is listed on the National Register, this doesn't restrict your ownership rights in any way. You still have the right to use, transfer, or dispose of the property however you see fit.
However, there may be restrictions if the property is subject to local zoning restrictions or state designation. Many cities have their own ordinances related to preservation of historic properties.

Go to a museum.,
Watch a documentary.,
Find a good one-volume history of the War.,
Study more specialized subject matter.",How to Study the American Civil War1," While it won’t turn you into an expert, one of the best ways to get a feel for the Civil War period is by going to a museum or exhibit about the War. Naturally, the contents of museums vary, but there are many fantastic institutions with extensive collections of Civil War artifacts. Some of these include:


The American Civil War Museum, in Richmond, VA. This is one museum with three locations: the Tredegar Iron Works, which was the Confederacy’s largest Iron Works, the Confederate White House, and the Museum of the Confederacy, located in Appomattox, just outside of Richmond. It houses the largest collection of Civil War artifacts in the world.The Confederate Memorial Hall Museum, in New Orleans, LA, houses the second-largest collection of Confederate memorabilia in the world, including flags, weapons, and personal items. It is located just a few blocks away from the National World War II Museum, in New Orleans’ Central Business District.The National Civil War Museum, located it Harrisburg, PA, is just a stone’s throw from the Gettysburg Battlefield site. Affiliated with the Smithsonian Institute, the National Civil War Museum is among the youngest major Civil War museums, and has some the highest quality artifacts, mementos, and memorabilia anywhere.;
, Documentaries can be a fun and entertaining way to learn the basics of a subject that seems inaccessible. While there are a number of good Civil War documentaries out there for you to choose from, one stands out: Ken Burns’ The Civil War.The Civil War by Ken Burns is a 1991 PBS documentary series told in nine parts across 11 hours. Not only is it a great Civil War documentary, but it is one of the best all-around documentaries ever. You can stream several full episodes from PBS for free at http://www.pbs.org/kenburns/civil-war/watch-videos/. The series in its entirety is available on YouTube.
This will help you familiarize yourself with the basic issues of the war.

, Once you’ve soaked up what you can from museums and documentaries, it’s time to do some reading on the War. There’s simply no substitute for the detail and nuance the printed word captures, but as a new student of the War, you want to avoid starting off with books that are so specialized you get bogged down in the details. That’s why one-volume histories are good.


While eminent historians such as Bruce Catton, Shelby Foote, and Alan Nevins all produced multivolume masterpieces, they can be tens of thousands of pages long.Instead, try something like James McPherson’s Battle Cry of Freedom. Coming in at under 1000 pages, this Pulitzer Prize winning work did much to establish the modern consensus about the causes and conduct the War. McPherson is now considered by many to be the dean of the field of Civil War Studies. , Once you’ve gotten a handle on the War as a whole, you should pick narrower areas to study. These can be military or political campaigns, the Lincoln assassination, the home front, or even the psychosocial impact of the mass deaths that occurred during the period. With the depth of scholarship about the War, there’s virtually no limit to what you can study."

Look for stained glass.,
Look for mechanized brickwork, or uniformed bricks.,
Spot bay windows.,
Understand the importance of slate.Transportation options for moving materials in large quantity were limited prior to the invention of the steam engine, and so buildings were usually constructed using local materials.,
Check the roof for ornate elements.,
Note if you see iron railings.,
Note any homemade qualities to the structure.,
Understand geometric tiling.,
Look closely for cavity walls.,
Find Sash windows on the building.",How to Recognize Victorian Architecture," Non-religious stained glass is often seen in Victorian buildings, a result of a revival of the gothic style commonplace in European churches. In particular look out for floral and geometric patterns of stained glass surrounding entrance doors to domestic buildings.;
, The industrial revolution led to mechanized brickwork. The sharper, more uniform bricks allowed for a tighter construction and cleaner façade on buildings, and the process allowed for more variation in types of brick.


Victorians took advantage of this to create intricate patterns of different coloured brickwork in their buildings. In particular look out for variations in the use of the 'header' (the short end of the brick) and the 'stretcher' (the long side of the brick) to create yet more pattern types.

, Canted bay windows (straight front and angled sides) became popular in the Victorian era as developments in construction methods and manufacturing made more elaborate building elements more accessible for domestic architecture.

,


The proliferation of railways and canals during the Victorian period opened up more options for builders and architects, and slate was one material that experienced a boom as a result. Slate was shipped around the country from quarries in Wales, Cumbria and Cornwall for roofing and cladding.

, What better way to finish off your new slate roof than an ornate finial (an architectural device that adorns the apex of a gable). Finials were born out of the Victorian love of religious architecture and allowed everybody to have their own spire-like construction on the roof of their house.


These finials were often very ornate in design, mimicking Gothic and Rococo styles, either flora or fauna, and often mythical such as dragons.

, Similarly ornate in design are the iron railings that were often seen at the front of urban Victorian houses. The industrial revolution made ironwork much more affordable and accessible for domestic architecture and Victorians used iron railings to create an impressive welcome at the front of their properties.


The railings were often elaborately decorated with sculptural finials atop the spears. In London, iron railings are particularly linked to the Victorian era, as upon Prince Albert's death in 1861 (Victoria's consort) the railings of the city were painted black in mourning. The majority of railings in the city have remained this colour ever since.

, At odds with the mass production and severity of the industrial age, Victorians warmed to the much more 'home-made' aesthetic of the Arts and Crafts movement (particularly towards the end of Victoria's reign).


Common in more rural towns and villages, this style drew on local materials and craftsmanship, and laid bare for all to see the function of the materials and construction. The beauty of this style came from the hand-crafted quality of the workmanship rather than any elaborate decoration or adornment.

, Production methods made decorative clay tiles more accessible, and beautiful hallways and verandas created from colourful geometric tiles can be seen in many Victorian houses of the period.

, Less easy to spot than the others on this list perhaps, but the Victorians introduced the cavity wall to domestic architecture.


This method of building two 'skins' of brick to create the outer walls of a building creates a cost-effective method of insulating from outside temperatures and moisture.

, Perhaps the most beloved aspect of Victorian domestic architecture for modern inhabitants are the large, heavy sash windows. Although they were certainly around prior to the Victorian era, sash windows were not commonplace in houses until the production of sheet glass was introduced in the 1830s.


This allowed for larger windows with fewer, thinner bars. The 'sash' element of the window refers to the opening mechanism. Created using internally run cords, the sash mechanism literally 'hangs' the bottom half of the window construction from the top. This allows the bottom section to slide up in front /behind the top section, and a counterbalance system holds the window in place.

Read the Declarations of the Causes of Secession.,
Read a war diary or two.,
Research newspapers from the time period.",How to Study the American Civil War2," Everyone wants to know the causes of the War. There’ no better place to begin your search than by reading the Declarations of the Causes of Secession. While all eleven Confederate Sates didn’t issue such declarations, South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Georgia, Texas, and Virginia did. All but Virginia’s are long documents.You can find the declarations at http://www.civilwarcauses.org/plat.htm


, War diaries have a way of conveying the immediacy of the War in the way an academic history can’t, and even the worst diaries allow you to see what the authors thought of their experiences. There are hundreds of diaries available to view, whether held in private collections or widely published.


To get an idea of the soldier’s experience, read All for the Union, by Elisha Hunt Rhodes, and Co. Aytch, by Sam Watkins, a Confederate soldier.For a view from the home front, try A Diary from Dixie, by Mary Boykin Chestnut, and Volume 3 of The Diary of George Templeton Strong, who was a New York attorney who helped found the US Sanitary Commission. Both works are masterpieces of the diary format; pithy, insightful, and representative of the larger thinking., Another great way to research the Civil War period is by looking up newspaper articles that are contemporary with an event you are studying. The Civil War was the heyday of the “partisan press” period of US history, when the media made no effort at conveying the news objectively, so the tone is quite different than what you might find in a modern newspaper.


For example, if you’ve developed an interest in the battle of Antietam, a good way to research the contemporary impressions of the battle is by searching a newspaper’s archives for the dates surrounding the battle.
Almost all extant newspapers will let you search their online archives for a fee, and many allow the public to search the archives for free. The most comprehensive free source is probably the New York Times, but there are thousands of digitized pages available for free on the web. One of the most comprehensive is the collection curated by the Virginia Polytechnic Institute. You can view the indexed listing of archived papers at https://dcr.emd.vt.edu/vital/access/manager/Browse/sm_description.

Visit a battlefield.,
Go on a plantation tour.,
Watch a battlefield reenactment.",How to Study the American Civil War3," Many of the thousands of Civil War military engagements has been preserved by the US Park Service or corresponding state agencies. There is probably no better way to get an understanding of the Civil War’s scope than by visiting the battlefield sites of the larger battles.


The battles of the Civil War were simply enormous. During the Seven Days Battles outside of Richmond, 103,000 Union soldiers squared off against 92,000 Confederate soldiers. For comparison’s sake, the largest stadium in America holds 107,000 people.The Civil War Discovery Trail, a list collected by the Civil War Trust, is a great place to find a battlefield or historic site to visit. Go to http://www.civilwar.org/civil-war-discovery-trail/ for more details.

, While plantations aren’t strictly Civil War historical sites, the fabled plantation lifestyle was made possible by the institution that sparked the conflict. Any plantations toured today were owned by the ultra-rich of the Civil War period, so they aren’t representative of the lifestyle most people lead. But it does give an idea of the Southern ruling class’ decadent and degenerate lifestyle, a lifestyle made possible by the wholesale theft of labor and liberty.Many plantations either whitewash slavery or present it as an afterthought altogether, but not all. For example, Laura Plantation, in Vacherie, Louisiana, is known for an unflinching take on the institution of slavery. It is also among the most highly regarded historical tours—of any kind—in the United States. Another good tour is the tour of Whitney Plantation in Wallace, LA, which treats the story of the Plantation and the slaves who worked it as inseparable.

, Although it certainly isn’t as dangerous, terrifying, or large as the real thing, attending a battlefield reenactment can be a fun way to further immerse yourself in the history of the Civil War period.


Reenactments are usually low-cost or free. The best way to find a reenactment is to look at the schedule for the particular battlefield you’re interested in, the Civil War Trust maintains a schedule as well.

Pull out your notetaking supplies.",How to Read Like a Historian," Before you even open the work, search online for the author’s history. Find out where they graduated and when. Look up their other publications and what they focused on. You might even find an article discussing why they chose to write this particular work and why they think it is important.


This also helps to make the reading process more personal and less of the “same old boring history.” Now you are reading something that someone worked on, for years, to create.;
, Reading isn’t about memorizing a list of facts. As a critical reader, you will focus on how the author interprets historical knowledge. What this means is that different historians can (and do!) come up with widely varying interpretations of the same event, person, place, or thing. It is your job as a critical reader to approach the work with an open, but skeptical mindset.A good example of varying interpretations are the numerous works discussing the development of women’s rights in the United States. Some historians argue that the 1840s is the most important period, while others choose the 1890s, 1920s, or even 1960s. As a critical reader, you will want to make up your own mind based on the evidence presented to you.

, Paging through the text quickly will give you a foundation for a deeper read later. When you skim you want to start by looking closely at the titles and subtitles of chapters. Look for what they tell you about the topics that will be covered and the dates that will be discussed. Next, read the first and last sentences of each paragraph in the introduction and conclusion. This will give you a glimpse of the thesis and how the argument unfolds and concludes.Don’t get bogged down with questions at this stage. Write down any questions that you have in your notes and you can try to answer them when you spend more time with the text.

, In the page margins, write down any questions that you have about what you are reading. You can also write brief phrases to remind yourself why a particular passage is important. For example, “Our class lecture overlaps here.” Use a pen to underline or a highlighter to highlight important passages as well.Please don’t write in library books or books that don’t belong to you. Even pencil leaves marks and diminishes the reading experience for others.
You may be tempted to highlight whole sections of a book or article. Resist this urge as it will only confuse you later on.

, In addition to your in-text notes, you will want to keep a longer set of notes on paper or on your computer. Stick to bullet points as they will keep you from re-copying whole paragraphs. Don’t doubt yourself either. If you think something might be useful for later, write it down. , If you encounter a word, phrase, or concept that you don’t understand, stop reading and look it up online (or ask your classmates if that is an option). You don’t want to miss out on a later point because you ignored a paragraph that was confusing to you.

, As you read, note the author’s writing style and tone. Are they overly formal or do they seem more relaxed? This will help you to determine the intended audience for the work. Look for word choice and sentence structure patterns. Being aware of the author’s writing traits will make it easier to identify instances of bias or open interpretation.


For example, if an author describes a historical character as “evil” or “ruthless,” you will have to decide if you agree with these words based on what you’ve read so far.

, A historical work is only as good as its evidence. Look at the bibliography or works cited pages to see what types of sources are used by the author. You want a fully traceable paper trail whenever possible, enough so that someone could reproduce the research if they desired. Look at the footnotes and endnotes to see if they appear complete.


There are three different types of sources: Primary sources are first-hand accounts of historical events. They are the building blocks of history. A diary is one example. Secondary sources are sources created by using primary and other secondary accounts. A book written by a historian about Pearl Harbor is one example. Tertiary sources are factual overviews. An encyclopedia is one example.When you look at the sources, try to see if they are pulled from works over the years. If they just stuck to one decade, it could tell you that their work might be out of date or that the materials about this particular event can only be found in that period.

, If you are reading a work of history, then it presents an argument or thesis. This is a statement (sometimes multiple sentences) that tells you what the author intends to prove to the reader. The argument will be debatable and it is the heart of the work. Once you’ve identified the thesis, you can understand how the rest of the work is structured to present a compelling case.Locating the thesis is not always easy. Most authors will place it near the start of the work, almost to provide a roadmap for readers. However, in other works, it is almost impossible to identify the thesis until the concluding paragraphs.
Watch for keywords such as, “This work argues,” “I argue,” “I contend,” “This work presents the case that.” Some authors will use these phrases to direct your attention to their main argument.
Also, read very carefully when it appears as if the author is disagreeing with another historian. This can often lead into a work’s argument. For example, “This work takes issue with McSweeney’s study and instead finds that…”
Tracing a work’s argument is like peeling the layers off an onion. You will find a main “outer” argument and then other small arguments or “layers within” to support it. This entire structure is designed to convince you that the author’s point is valid.

, When an author creates a work, they do not do so in isolation. Their work is influenced by those who have come before them and their work then shapes the future works of others. Historiography is the study of historians writing history. To read like a historian, you will want to think about how the work you are reading is connected with other historians.Looking for these moments of interaction between authors can be really frustrating at times, especially if you are unfamiliar with a particular field of history. Watch for when your author mentions the names of other scholars. For example, “Patrick Smith makes an excellent case in his work….”
As a critical reader, you will also find that scholars frequently call attention to where they disagree with others in the field. So, they might write, “While Sally Risch believes this event signaled the end of an era, this work argues something quite different.”

, After you’ve finished your deep read, do a final quick skim read. Look over the introduction and conclusion once more, paying attention to the areas that you’ve identified as particularly important. Maybe make a few extra annotations. This skim read should allow you to see the book as a whole package, instead of just pieces and parts.

, Discuss your reading with your family, friends, classmates, or co-workers. Find anyone who will listen and tell them at least one interesting thing about the text. If you can explain an argument to someone else, you are one step closer to truly understanding it.


For example, you might say, “I just read this book about WWII. The author says that…”

, Look up reviews online by searching for the author’s name or the book’s title. Only read those reviews that you find on reputable websites or in established history journals. H-Net puts out a variety of digital reviews that are always a good starting point. For history books, reviews are often not available until at least three months post-publication. Books written for the wider public, instead of primarily academics, will get reviewed sooner.When you read the review look to see if they picked up on the same general argument as you. It is okay if there are slight variations, but reviews provide a good touchstone. Read them after you’ve completed your read, however, so that the review won’t influence your initial take on the work.
If you have to write a paper over your reading, make sure to be very careful when looking at reviews. It is quite easy to accidently include sections of a review within a paper, thus committing plagiarism.

, Sit down and write 250 words discussing the reading from a critical perspective. Explore the strengths and weaknesses of the work. Offer suggestions for further study. Spend time examining both the content and the writing elements. This is a quick way to test your knowledge of both the details and major points of a reading., After you’ve finished that final skim, leave your notes and the book and walk away for a bit. This will give you time to formulate your overall impressions of what you just read.


If you have an exam or book discussion coming up for a class, try your best not to rush reading. Cramming weakens your retention of details and larger points., Everyone has a personal, preferred reading location. Consider where you feel the most comfortable, mentally alert, and focused. A library, your room, your home office, or a coffee shop are all possible spots. Try out a few different places to see what works the best for you.


If you choose to study in your bedroom, avoid working on the bed itself. It will possibly make you drowsy and can lead to gaps in reading concentration.
Choose a reading site where you will have a desk or table to take notes on while reading. Juggling a book, notepad, highlighter, pen, etc., in your lap could impact your productivity in a negative way.
Make sure that your reading area is well lit. You want to be able to see the text clearly without squinting or straining your eyes. Bright lights can be just as bad as dim ones, so go for subtle lighting. Many people prefer to read near a shaded lamp for that very reason., Tell friends or family in advance that you will be using a certain time to study or read. If it helps, you might place a sign on the door asking for quiet. In you will use your computer to take notes, close all windows and avoid social media until you are done. Turn off your phone as well. You want to be able to read at your own pace until you feel ready to stop, as opposed to stopping because you are interrupted.Be aware that your room can be a distraction too. If you have a mess that needs to be picked up, you may keep dwelling on that instead of concentrating.
It may be helpful to set aside a specific time for reading and to stick to that schedule. Many historians look for a time when they feel the most mentally energized and that is when they do their heavier reading and writing.

, Turn on some instrumental music and dive right into your work. The music can signal your brain that it is time to concentrate. Music can also drown out other distracting noises. Sip some coffee or tea while you read. Do whatever you need to do to boost your concentration., Arrange your space so that you can take notes quickly and easily. You will want a reliable pen, a highlighter (yellow is often a good choice), and paper. You can also take notes via computer if you like. If you’ve borrowed the book or can’t write inside it, you can purchase multi-colored note flags that stick to the pages or you can use post-its for more writing space.

Think of how useful history is. Not only does it show how the world has evolved through time but you can learn from the mistakes of the past to create a civilized earth where love, compassion, understanding, and knowledge are the goals of humanity, not revenge and greed. Once you gain the knowledge of history the world is yours. It shows you how the world has changed and how the people changed your history.
Think of how the world would have been if history did not exist.
Familiarize yourself with the different areas of study/branches in history.;
, The History Channel has excellent programs that often re-enact historical battles or explore old technologies.

,, You can get to know history and still have some fun.

, Most history classes focus on historical events in isolation.  Try to figure out how the participants in the events got there; why were they there? How did the event lead to subsequent events? What would have happened if the outcome had been different?

,  These might make the time period feel more realistic to you.  Keep in mind that they may not be historically accurate - try to identify the inaccuracies.

, Do not just start reading until you're tired. Try to be organized. Find a technique to approach the study of history that best suites your intellect. In other words, find a theme for your studying. Some start by studying personalities and historical figures and tie all other aspects to them. Some prefer places and locations.

, Rephrasing what you learned in your own words will help you to understand what you are studying.

, Studying history doesn't have to be all paper and pen. Try to use your talents and interests in studying history.

, How did the introduction of rifling change the outcome of battles?

, What if the US was better prepared at Pearl Harbor? What if both Lenin and Woodrow Wilson had lived longer and had met?

State historic societies often have additional information and guidelines regarding the preservation and restoration of historic cemeteries.
Keep in mind that registering the cemetery does not confer any physical protection, funding, or restoration. Having the cemetery listed in a historic registry is merely a commemorative honor.;
, The National Park Service and state historic preservation offices have particular criteria that must be met for a cemetery to be designated a historic landmark. These criteria differ from the criteria other landmarks must meet for designation.Generally, a cemetery qualifies for registration as a historic landmark if people are buried there who have transcendental historic importance, or if the cemetery itself is historically significant due to its age, design features, or association with historic events.
For example, a slave cemetery located on the grounds of a former plantation potentially would qualify for registration as a historic landmark.
To qualify on the basis of age, that age must be important in the context of the development of that particular geographic area. For example, a cemetery from the community's original settlement in the 1700's would qualify.
Keep in mind that if you nominate a cemetery based on design values, your ability to restore old grave markers may be limited. Cemeteries cannot qualify for registration based on design if the grave markers have been replaced.

, To register a cemetery as a historic landmark, you must fill out the forms identifying the cemetery and the reasons it qualifies to be registered and preserved.As part of your nomination forms, you generally must present and establish reasons for the cemetery's historic significance. Photos of markers of historically important or influential people can be included to support your reasons.
You also might want to include documents related to the founding of the cemetery, or archeological data from excavations that tie the site to a historically significant time period or group of people.
Looking at the nomination forms of historic cemeteries that have been listed in a state or national cemetery can give you some ideas on the type of information needed to prove your case.

, Whether you intend to nominate the cemetery for designation as a state or national historic landmark, you must submit your nomination to the SHPO of the state in which the cemetery is located.After your nomination is received, the SHPO will solicit public comment. In some cases, there may be a public hearing at which people can come and testify as to why the cemetery should be designated a historic landmark, or why they oppose such a designation.
If you nominated the cemetery for national registration, your application also will be reviewed by your state's National Register Review Board.

, After your nomination is received and evaluated, you may have to attend public hearings or answer questions from SHPO staff before your nomination will be approved.Whether you are seeking state or national recognition, your application should be processed within four to six months.
You will need to keep in touch with the SHPO to find out what you need to do as the process continues. The SHPO will notify you if your application is accepted.
Once the cemetery is designated a historic landmark, the state or federal government will issue plaques to commemorate the site and notify the public of its status.

, If the cemetery's location isn't recorded in the county deed records, you should have its boundaries recorded so the site can be preserved.Many states such as Texas provide for county deed records to be updated to reflect the existence and location of the cemetery through the state historic cemetery designation process.
Boundaries of the cemetery should be marked using deed records so you can take other steps to secure the property if necessary.
Creating a notice of existence within the county's deed records that establishes the location and boundaries of the historic cemetery often is one of the most valuable legal protections for a cemetery if you want to preserve it for future generations.

, Unless the cemetery is located on your private property, you will have to get permission from the owner of the land or from the government before you take steps to preserve it.Many historic cemeteries are on land controlled by state or local governments. You must obtain written permission from the government with jurisdiction over the area before you can begin your efforts to protect and preserve the historic cemetery.
In some states and localities, cemeteries are governed by cemetery associations. Not only must you get permission from the association, but you also should become familiar with the association's rules and regulations so you don't run afoul of any restrictions while attempting to preserve the site.
If the cemetery is only accessible through private land, you'll have to negotiate access with the landowner before going any further.

, Protect your investment of time and money by making sure the location is physically secure against destruction or vandalism before you commit extensive resources to preservation efforts.Securing the area may require building a fence around the cemetery, or repairing any existing fences or gates.
If the fence and gate structure are themselves historic, you may want to talk to a preservation expert before you begin any repairs.
If the cemetery is surrounded by private lands, consult the landowners for ideas on how to keep the site secure and enlist their assistance.
You also may want to consult the local police department and let them know that you're beginning an effort to restore the cemetery and would like them to patrol the area regularly.
Get a sense of the area so you have a better understanding of the level of security that will be necessary. For example, if the cemetery is the frequent target of vandals, you may want to consider hiring a private security guard.

, Because your preservation efforts may have significant cultural and archaeological implications, you should consult people with training and experience in preservation to devise a plan to preserve a historic cemetery.The types of people you need to involve in your planning depend on the type of cemetery you're restoring and its historic significance.
Archaeologists can be of assistance if the cemetery contains a number of unmarked graves. You also may want to consult a historian to identify historically significant individuals buried in the cemetery.
If the grave markers and other features have architectural or sculptural significance, you may want to enlist the assistance of an architect.
Many of these professionals may be willing to donate their time and expertise to preserve and protect a historic landmark. Talk to staff in your SHPO to get the names and contact information of professionals who have volunteered on other preservation efforts in the past.

, To plan your preservation strategy, you will need a detailed map of the entire cemetery, including graves and the locations of various landscape features such as trees or bushes.Your map should note the orientation of all marked graves, as well as those that are unmarked if the location is known. Include the size and type of any markers, including headstones and footstones.
Each physical feature should have a control number on your map. As you and historians or anthropologists research the cemetery and the people buried in it, you can tie information to the numbers and create a guide to the cemetery.
You also should photograph all the physical features, and note the control number of that feature on each photograph so the photos can be organized using the map. Note the condition of each feature and the work that must be done to repair or restore it.
Once your map is complete, you can divide the cemetery into zones and plan your preservation efforts accordingly. The map allows you to effectively assign projects to particular professionals or volunteers and keep track of their progress.
Keep in mind that the general layout of the cemetery, including landscape features such as trees and bushes, may be of cultural significance to the historic community that created the cemetery. Respect these features and don't move them or destroy them if at all possible.

, Concerned citizens often can do much of the work required to maintain a historic cemetery, including basic cleaning and restoration of grave markers and clearing of the grounds.Talk to people in the community surrounding the cemetery to gauge interest in volunteering to assist in the clean-up and preservation process.
You also may be able to find volunteers by presenting your plans to historic or genealogical societies and local heritage groups.
For cemeteries with particular historic or archaeological significance, you may want to speak with university professors about getting groups of students together to work on cemetery preservation. Some professors may even be willing to offer student-volunteers extra credit for participation.
Publicity in local newspapers or on local news also can attract volunteers interested in assisting the preservation effort.

, To avoid disturbing graves or damaging markers, the bulk of the brush on the grounds of a historic cemetery should be cleared without the use of motorized clippers or mowers.Keep in mind that much of the work involved in cleaning up a historic cemetery is pain-staking and labor intensive. Rotate volunteers frequently among tasks to prevent burn-out and carelessness.
Protect the safety of your volunteers by establishing rules of conduct and keeping a first aid kit on hand at all times if anyone is injured while working at the cemetery.
Take note of any toxic plants such as poison oak on the grounds, and make sure anyone with responsibility for clearing brush in those areas wears protective clothing.
Where possible, have professionals train volunteers so everyone working has an understanding of what constitutes brush or debris that should be removed and what stones or other material is a part of the natural order of the cemetery's design and shouldn't be disturbed.

, After the brush is cleared, the bulk of the grass in a cemetery can be mowed using a hand mower, although care should be taken to first flag the markers and not mow over them.If you hire a landscape company or other contractors to complete mowing, make sure they understand the delicate nature of the site and are willing to take precautions to avoid upsetting historic markers or destroying landscape features.
Any agreements with landscapers or outside contracts should be in writing, so everyone understands the nature of the project.
Use push mowers rather than riding mowers. If possible, non-motorized mowers are preferable as they create the least disturbance and lower the risk of damaging historic artifacts and grave markers.

, Chemicals can upset the balance of delicate cemetery soils and cause further erosion of old markers, particularly if they are made of porous stones such as limestone.If toxic plants need to be cleared, consult a plant or landscape professional on methods to remove unwanted plants without harming other vegetation.
Keep in mind that some plants and vegetation may have cultural significance. The basic makeup of the historic cemetery's landscape should be kept intact as much as possible.

, Before you begin the process of cleaning markers, you should first determine what material the markers are and whether that material is intact enough to be cleaned without doing further damage.Many historic grave markers are made of relatively soft stone that was easy to carve. As a result of their softness, these grave markers also are more easily eroded and worn down by years of exposure to the elements.
If a stone grave marker has a grainy or crumbling surface, or large cracks, you shouldn't undertake any efforts on your own to clean or repair it.
Make note of unsound grave markers on your map so a professional can look at them and determine what steps must be taken to restore them.

, Provided the stone is sound, many grave markers can be cleaned gently by hand without need for any training in specialized techniques.Don't sandblast the gravestones or use excessive water pressure to clean them. Many markers can be cleaned by brushing it off with a soft-bristled brush, then wetting it with warm water and brushing some more.
You can use a mixture of one part ammonia and four parts water to clean the stones, but don't use any other cleaners or abrasive materials, as they can further weaken and damage the stone.
If a particular marker doesn't respond well to gentle cleaning, cease efforts and consult a professional. Potential delays to the project are better than causing additional damage.

, If a marker has deteriorated to the point that attempts to clean it could result in its destruction, you should seek assistance from a stone conservator or preservation specialist to restore the marker.As you continue your preservation plan, historic photos of the cemetery can help you understand how it looked when it was originally constructed, giving you a better idea of how to focus your restoration efforts.
Make sure any agreements with professionals are in writing, even if the person is volunteering his or her time. Written agreements ensure everyone understands the goals of the project and your expectations for the professional.
When a professional volunteers their time, it can be tempting to simply take anyone willing. However, protect the integrity of the cemetery and your restoration project by conducting a thorough background check of any professionals to ensure they have the requisite qualifications and that any certifications or licenses are valid and up to date.

Raise money to fund the excavation.",How to Protect and Preserve Archaeological Sites," The existence of an archaeological site should be noted on the deed to the property at the county recorder's office. The deed also provides the boundaries of the property itself, so you can determine if additional permissions will be required to excavate the site.When you begin excavation plans, an archaeological preservation easement should be created. This is a deed limitation that allows archaeologists to continue plans to excavate and preserve the site even if you sell the land.
Because the artifacts at an archaeological site typically are underground, you may not be able to determine the exact area of the site until excavation begins.
While you may only be able to protect the portion of the site on your own property, you may want to let neighbors know of the possibility that artifacts may be located on their property as well.;
, Each state has a historic preservation society or office that handles registration of historic and archaeological sites. There may be a local office you can visit, or you may be able to get the information you need from the office's website.If you're seeking national registration as well as state, your state office can give you information on the requirements for both. Typically national registrations must go through the state office first.
Get copies of the forms and instructions necessary to complete your application for registration, so you'll know the types of evidence you'll need to establish the site's archaeological significance.
People working in the office also can give you additional information on the registration process or assist you in gathering information and filling out your forms.

, States have different requirements regarding the proof necessary to establish that a location on private property should be preserved as an archaeological site.Most state requirements are similar to the federal requirements, although the scope of significance may be different.
National registration typically is available only for sites of national historic or archaeological significance, while sites that have state, but not national, significance still may qualify for state protection.
Keep in mind that you may need to work with a professional archaeologist to amass sufficient evidence that the site should be registered as archaeologically significant. Someone at your state's historic preservation office may be able to put you in contact with someone who conducts preliminary assessments of locations such as yours.

, Once you have all of your evidence together, you're ready to fill out the application and file it with your state's historic preservation office. The process varies widely among states, so make sure you've included everything required.Typically you must include details about the makeup of the site, the nature of the artifacts located there, the location and owners of the property, and the site's historic significance.
The site also may be inspected by a state historic preservation office professional to verify the claims in your application.
If your application is missing necessary information or documentation, it may result in a delay or even rejection of your application.
Some states charge a fee to file an application, typically a few hundred dollars.

, If your property meets the requirements of your state's historic preservation office, it will be registered as an archaeological preservation site. Once the registration is in place, you can begin plans to excavate the site.Registration also should be filed along with the deed at your county recorder's office. The designation may come with tax benefits depending on your state's property tax laws.
Registration means the site falls under state or federal criminal laws, which make it a felony to loot or disturb an archaeological site.
Both before and after your application is approved, avoid doing anything to disturb the artifacts located at the site.

, To get a good understanding of the types of measures that may be necessary to secure the site, you need to know what possible threats exist, or if the site has a history of destruction or looting.If you live on the property where the archaeological site is located, you probably already have a good idea of how secure the area is.
However, if your home isn't located on the same property, you should consider spending several hours there both during the day and at night to determine what measures would be helpful in securing the site from looting and destruction.
Keep in mind that in can take months, if not years, to develop a sound excavation plan and raise the funds necessary to begin. In the meantime, your top priority must be keeping the site secure and intact.
Let neighbors know about the existence of the archaeological site and the need to keep it secure. They may be able to help. At the very least, they can alert you to suspicious activity.

, If the site can be fenced without disturbing any artifacts, it can help to keep looters off the property as well as simple trespassers who just want to look but might inadvertently damage or destroy the site.Check the boundaries of the property and make sure the fence doesn't encompass land beyond the boundaries recorded in the deed.
You may need to have a property surveyor come out and mark the property line so you know where you can place a fence.
Provided the site isn't located in a residential area where it might disturb neighbors, flood lights also can provide a measure of protection. Lights can stay on all night or be triggered by motion detecting sensors.

, If the area in which the site is located is prone to erosion or is suffering damage due to the elements that might threaten artifacts of archaeological significance, you might want to consider the use of tarps or other means to keep the area intact until it can be properly excavated.You may want to have a professional land conservationist or surveyor come out and look at the property. He or she can suggest ways to reinforce or preserve the surface if it is at risk.
Additional barriers or other protections may be necessary if the area is prone to flooding or landslides.

, Since looting or disturbing an archaeological site is a crime, you may be able to get your local police department to conduct periodic patrols of the area to deter would-be looters and help keep the site secure.Contact the police and sheriff's departments and let them know about the location of the site. Many law enforcement offices also will provide a free security consultation in which they come out to the property and suggest ways to keep it secure.
If the area around the site has heavy foot traffic – for example, if it borders public or commercial property – you may want to consider hiring private security guards to patrol the premises, particularly during night and evening hours.

, Only a licensed professional has the knowledge and skills necessary to assess the site and come up with a detailed plan to safely excavate the artifacts found on the site.Beyond the required expertise to accurately assess the property, state and federal law require anyone working on a registered archaeological site to have up-to-date licenses and permits for excavation.
Your state historic preservation office typically will have a list of licensed archaeological contractors who are approved by and registered with the state to excavate registered archaeological sites.
Interview several archaeologists if you can before you choose someone, and make sure the person you choose has experience working on artifacts from the same historical period as those found on your site.

, If your site is located near a university with an archaeology department, professors and students may be able to take on the excavation as a research project, providing access to valuable university equipment, materials, and labs.If the site is unique or has major significance, you also might contact archaeology departments at larger or more prestigious universities, even if they're located at some distance.
Check professors' credentials and areas of expertise on the university's website before you contact them. Choose people who focus on the type of artifacts likely to be found on your site.
For example, if you believe there are ancient Native American artifacts on your property, including some remains of a settlement, you want to work with a department or professor that specializes in Native American history and archaeology – not someone whose experience and expertise is in excavating dinosaur fossils.

, The archaeologist in charge of the excavation of the site will survey the area and conduct tests to design a detailed plan of action for excavating the property, as well as potentially revealing the size and scope of the site and the excavation that will be necessary.Initial surveys will reveal the nature of the archaeological site and the types of artifacts likely to be present.
The archaeologist also may get some information about the location of articles and the density of artifacts located in particular parts of the site.
The entire area of the site will be mapped and gridded so excavation can be planned.
The survey also will account for the types of soil present and the depths where artifacts may be uncovered.
You may be able to make use of volunteers through your state historic preservation office to assist in site recording and monitoring.

, Even with university assistance, professional excavations can be costly. The head archaeologist should include a proposed budget with his or her plan, which you can use to pursue grants and funding from state, national, and nonprofit archaeological societies.The assistance or involvement of a university department of archaeology can greatly assist in obtaining grants for the project.
You also can engage in traditional fundraising efforts to solicit donations from nonprofit organizations, businesses, and community members. Your state historic preservation office likely can assist in these efforts.
In addition to grants and donations, you may be able to get a conventional loan or mortgage to cover the costs of the excavation. However, you should try to raise as much of the necessary funds as possible through grants and donations rather than loans.

Take an advanced course.,
""Personalize the Material.""",How to Stay Awake During a History Class," With your back straight and head held up high, you'll look confident and you'll be more relaxed. This will work with any class, not just history.;
, Paying attention will really help you on the test. Most History teachers are great speakers and tell amazing stories that will help you remember concepts on the tests.

, If you talk during class, you will only slow it down even more. Let your teacher finish lecturing, then he/she might give you a few minutes at the end to do what you want.

, When you engage yourself in the lesson, you'll find it much more interesting than if you passively listen and take notes. Really think about what your teacher is saying, and if you disagree, don't be afraid to raise your hand and say so! Discussion is a major part of History class, and oftentimes your teacher will purposely say something controversial to spark debate.

, If you think the class will be boring, it will be. Even if you think you have the worst teacher in the world, think about how many History teachers there are. There must be a worse teacher out there!

, Science has shown that people who fidget are more likely to pay attention and show better concentration and learning. If you feel your concentration waning, try bouncing your leg up and down with your toe planted on the ground. This simple repeated movement increases blood flow to the brain and grounds the mind.

, If you enjoy English, think of History as a really good story to analyze. If you like Science, think of History as the record of all scientific discoveries. History is anything that happened in the past, from the time of the caveman to your Internet browsing history.

, Even if you really hate History, taking an advanced course has many advantages. If you take it as an AP class, you can get college credit for it and possibly not have to study it later depending on your college and major. Also, schools reserve the best teachers for the advanced classes. You'll be sure to get the most entertaining teacher in the building and that's worth the extra work right there.

, If you can, think of a way to make the boring material applicable to your life. For example, use the mindset ""I have to use this to pass the AP test,"" or ""If I take in this material, I will do well on the tests and get an A."" If you think of reasons why you need to use this specific material, the class will seem a bit more interesting.

Make flashcards of key terms, people, and dates.,
Say information out loud as you read and write notes.,
Use mnemonic devices to memorize facts.",How to Prepare for a History Exam1," Studying history involves memorizing lots of dates, names, events, and other facts. Look through your notes and textbook and identify keywords. Make a list of them, then create flashcards with a word on one side and its definition or explanation on the other.If you have trouble coming up with a list, try asking your teacher what key dates, figures, and other information might show up on the test.;
, Seeing, saying, hearing, and touching at the same time help your brain make stronger connections and memorize information more easily. Try reading your textbook out loud as you study, and say what you’re writing as you create your flashcards.You could also try recording yourself reading your textbook or flashcards. As you listen to the recording, follow along in your notes or flashcards.

, Memorization can be boring, but using quick, silly ways to remember facts can add a little fun. Even better, they’re also an effective way to keep your facts straight.For example, the mnemonic device Neighbors Actually Persuaded Lovely Yvonne To Shut Her Window will help you memorize the British royal families in chronological order: Norman, Angevin, Plantagenet, Lancaster, York, Tudor, Stuart, Hanover, and Windsor."

Read the course syllabus to identify overarching themes.,
Synthesize information by making an outline or study guide.,
Create a chart or map to make connections between facts.,
Ask your teacher for help.",How to Prepare for a History Exam2," Your course syllabus is the sheet of paper that lists each session’s topic and required reading. Look over the titles, units, and other information listed in the syllabus to find clues about how the course’s larger themes fit together.Ask yourself, “How does the syllabus organize these facts and figures? Does it mention or hint at any key critical questions? What connections does it make between individual class sessions?”

, You can make a study guide or outline once you’ve looked over your syllabus and gotten a feel for how the class organizes information. Use the syllabus as a guide to structure and consolidate your study guide.Your study guide won’t do you much good if it simply copies your class notes. Look for key themes in your class notes, pull out the essential information, and put it in your outline.
For example, if you’re outlining class sessions on the Wars of the Roses, you could list key members (along with their dates and titles) of the houses of Lancaster and York in one section of your study guide. Then, you could outline underlying causes of the rivalry between the houses. Finally, you could list key battles and their dates, temporary truces and how they broke down, and the conflict’s resolution.  

, When studying history, charts, drawings, and maps are sometimes the best way to visualize how the information fits together. In addition to being great study tools, making visual aids like timelines, family trees, and flow charts will help give you a bird’s eye view of the material.For example, making family trees and a timeline would come in handy if you’re trying to prepare for an exam on the Wars of the Roses.  

, Your teacher is there to help you! If you’re not sure what they are looking for, ask them.For example, ask them what the exam's format will be, what the unit's main theses (or key ideas) are, and what information is most important.

You can study more intensely as the test approaches, but you’ll have a solid foundation and won’t have to cram., Do your best to get as clear an idea as possible of what the test will look like. Ask your teacher whether you should prepare for multiple choice questions, essays, or both.Multiple choice or fill in the blank tests stress memorization, so you’ll know that you should put your flashcards to good use.
If your test includes or is only made up of essays, you should be prepared to analyze a set of historical facts or compare and contrast two interpretations.

, Put yourself in your teacher’s shoes and try to come up with potential test questions. Practice writing essays and, to prep for multiple choice questions, have someone quiz you on your flashcards.Study groups are great for coming up with potential test questions, since everyone can make up a question and quiz each other.

, If you’re preparing for school exam, make and exchange practice tests with someone in your class, or have a family member test you. If you’re taking an AP History, SAT subject test, or other standardized exam, look for practice tests on CollegeBoard.org.You can also find exam tips, sample responses, and other useful resources on CollegeBoard. Just search for whichever standardized test you’ll be taking.

, Don’t stay up late cramming the night before the test. Try to go to bed on time, relax, and get a good night’s sleep. On the day of the test, have a full breakfast and, if the test is late in the day, a good lunch.

Being direct is especially important for short essays, which typically require you to provide just a few sentences and often deal with definitions.When studying, refer to your list of key terms and concepts, and make sure you can concisely define them.
Have someone quiz you on your flashcards. Try to get to the point that you can give a complete but brief answer without asking for any hints.

, Look over your syllabus or textbook for your unit's key points. Those theses, or main ideas, are the best way to predict what a long essay question will ask.Understand the unit's main concepts, then use the facts and figures you've memorized to back up those key points. Remember there's no ""U"" in history: leave personal opinions out of essays!

, A long essay can take up a major proportion of the test grade, so do your best to be sure you're answering the essay question the right way. When it's time to take the test, take a moment to understand what a long essay is asking you to do.Look for words like analyze or compare and contrast, then plan your essay accordingly. For example, historians disagree about the degree to which feudalism in the Late Middle Ages set the stage for the Wars of the Roses. Your exam could include an essay asking you to defend one position and explain why it’s a more accurate interpretation.

A vertical timeline moves from top to bottom, so you will add your timeline events to the left and right of the line demarcating your timeline., A circle timeline is used to show a process that starts and ends in the same place. For example, it could be used to show the passage of the seasons or the life cycle of a plant., A parallel timeline is really two timelines that chart the events for two different topics during the same period of time. This allows you to relate the two topics.For example, you could chart your favorite author’s career and compare it to the career of one of their contemporaries.

, If you prefer to use technology over paper and pen, you can create your timeline digitally. You can find a timeline generator online, or you can simply create slides in PowerPoint or Prezi.There are many options for creating a digital timeline:

, Learn about your topic. As you read and collect information, begin making notes about possible events to include.You need to provide a well-rounded history of your topic, so make sure you use several sources.Conduct internet research, check out books from the library, or visit the museum.
Try to use multiple websites, books, articles, and maybe even a documentary. Aim to have at least three different sources.

, You will want to include the important events for your topic, but also add in relevant interesting events. While your timeline should maintain focus, you want it to be fun for the viewer and show that you understand the topic.Include events like:

Personal details such as births, deaths, and other important dates
Historical events that impacted the topic of the timeline
Important events that shaped the topic
Intriguing facts about your topic

, Keep your events narrowed to a manageable number. You want enough details to show something about your topic, but don’t include so many that the important facts become buried., Create the type of timeline that you chose to use by drawing out the line or circle. Sketch out the line using a pencil, then trace over it with a dark pen or marker. Label the timeline with the project title and the boundary years.Use a ruler if you are making your timeline by hand.
If you are creating a digital timeline, choose a template or create your presentation in PowerPoint or Prezi.

, You need to set boundaries for your timeline. Your boundaries need to allow you to explore your topic, so start and end your timeline with enough space to cover all of the events.Create a larger narrative by presenting smaller events.You don’t have to start with someone’s birth or end with the person’s death.
Consider your topic and narrow it to select the right start and stop point.
Narrow it based on the number of events on your timeline.

, Depending on the span of time you're working with, you might choose increments in decades, years, months, or even days. Figure out what makes sense for your subject and the number of events you're including. Make the appropriate number of evenly-spaced lines perpendicular to the main timeline between your start and end dates., Go along the line and mark the spots where the events will go. Draw a line that is perpendicular to your main timeline to show the years in which the events occurred, and write down a short description of each one.Organize the dates sequentially. The events need to be on the timeline in chronological order, not in order of importance or interest. For example, events listed throughout a year should start in January and end in December., Choose an engaging title that tells the viewer what your timeline is about. Make sure that your title encompasses all that you’ve included in your project, rather than just the topic. For example, don’t title your project “NASA;” instead, choose a title like “NASA: The Quest for the Moon.” Example titles include:

The Life and Times of Nelson Mandela
Beverly Hills, 90210: A Recent History
JD Salinger's Storied Career
California's Ancient Redwoods
NASA: to the Moon and Beyond
A Day in the Life of a Praying Mantis

, There are many ways to display your events, depending on your preferences. You will need to create an entry for each event, and they will all need to fit on the timeline.Try to include fewer than 20 events.Write the events.
Print out events and glue them to the timeline.
Draw or use images.
Create a slide if you’re using a digital method.

, For each entry, write a short explanation about what happened, including facts such as who was involved, the impact of the event, and any numbers related to the event, such as the number of people killed in a war. Add the details that help you tell the overall narrative of your timeline., Your words need to be easy to read, so write clearly. Alternatively, type up your entries, cut them out, and glue them onto the timeline. Use as few words as possible to explain the events to avoid taking up too much space with one event.If you’re creating a digital timeline, type up your entries.
Don’t elaborate or be too wordy.

, You can add visual interest to your timeline with some pictures to go along with the events you're including. Find images online, copy them from books, or get creative and draw them yourself."

Create strong visualizations.If you can create vivid images to associate with a date, you will have a much easier time remembering it.,
Use your body.You can create very strong associations by actively using your body when trying to memorize dates.,
Organize your information.If you can group the dates you need to learn in any meaningful way, you will have a much greater chance of memorizing them.,
Assign a letter to each number in the date.You can improve your memory by creating associations, such as between a letter and a number.,
Make detailed associations.You will recall things like dates better if you can make more detailed and illustrative associations.,
Concentrate on the dates you need to learn.We often immediately lose 50% of what we are studying, so it is very important to concentrate when studying dates.You can begin by simply reminding yourself that you want to and/or need to remember the dates.,
Repeat the dates frequently.The more you can repeat information you need to learn, the more likely you are to memorize it.,
Use flash cards.Flash cards are a common way to practice memorizing information.,
Use the dates.",How to Memorize Dates," The more ridiculous, silly, and strange the image, the better!


For example, if you are trying to remember the date 1732, the year in which George Washington was born, every time you think of that date, imagine a small boy wearing a Washington-type wig and chopping down a cherry tree while saying “I cannot tell a lie!”
Similarly, you could also imagine a person dressed as George Washington “making it rain” with $1,732 dollars in one-dollar bills (which feature a portrait of Washington on the front).;
, Pacing while you study, creating hand motions to learn along with certain dates, and even singing out dates can all improve your memory. For instance, you could:


Raise your arm up dramatically like a Roman orator when trying to remember the date 44 BC, the year in which the Roman Emperor Julius Caesar was assassinated.
Memorize dates by singing them to the melody of your favorite song.

, This is because it is very difficult to memorize a set of unconnected bits of information. As you spend time each day practicing the dates you need to remember, look for ways to classify and organize them. For instance:


If you are learning a set of historical dates, make a timeline as you seek to memorize them. This helps to put the dates in some kind of relation to each other, and to show logical connections between them. The more you can contextualize the dates, the more meaning they will have to you; the more meaning they have, the greater your chances of remembering them.
If you are learning birthdates of your family members, map them out on a family tree that you draw out. As you practice memorizing the dates each day, you can visualize “climbing” the family tree to recall all of the dates.

, For example, you could memorize the date “1066” (the year of the Battle of Hastings), the date “1215” (when the Magna Carta was drafted), or the date “1776” (the year of the signing of the Declaration of Independence), by associating them with the alphabetic strings “TZGG,” “TNTL,” and “TKKG,” respectively, according to the following scheme:


0 = Z, because the word “zero” begins with “z”
1 = T, because the numeral “1” and the letter “T” are both written with a single downstroke
2 = N, because if you rotate the letter “N” clockwise ninety degrees, it resembles the numeral “2”)
3 = M, because if you rotate the letter “M” clockwise ninety degrees, it resembles the numeral “3”)
4 = R, because the numeral “4” looks like a backwards letter “R” (and the word “four” also ends in the letter “R”)
5 = L, since “L” is the Roman numeral for “50”
6 = G, since the numeral “6” and the letter “G” resemble each other
7 = K, because if you rotate the letter “K” clockwise, it resembles the numeral “7” mirroring itself
8 = B, since the numeral “8” and the letter “B” resemble each other
9 = P, since the letter “P” looks like a mirror image of the numeral “9”

, One technique is to use the strings of letters you form using the previous step to develop fun and memorable sentences. For example, imagine:


You are trying to memorize the date “1776,” the year the Declaration of Independence was signed.
You form the string of letters “TKKG” using the previous step.
You develop the phrase “That Kooky King George,” where the first letter of each word in the phrase corresponds to the string of letters “TKKG”
This phrase will help you remember the date because it uses the string of letters associated with “1776,” and because the Declaration of Independence was written to declare the independence of the American colonies from Great Britain, which was ruled at the time by King George III.

, Concentrating in this way can help you remember 20% to 60% more information.There are various practical ways to concentrate while studying. For instance:


Reduce distractions; try to study in a quiet, stress-free environment.
Intentionally focus your eyes on a written date that you are trying to memorize. ""Trace"" the date with your eyes.
When you come across a date you need to learn, take a moment and carefully write it out, thinking “I need to remember this” as you do.
Visualize yourself writing the number any time you think of it. For instance, imagine yourself writing the date on a chalkboard in your mind.

, Since we lose the greatest amount of information within 24 hours of learning something, it is important not just to repeat the information immediately, but frequently. If you keep practicing and going over dates every day, you increase your recall and memory; if you keep trying to memorize them for thirty days, you are likely to remember them for years to come.If you need to learn a set of dates for an exam or other purpose, go over them as frequently as you can, spending at least a few minutes each day reviewing the information.

, If used correctly, they can be a big help.


Using a set of cards (or an electronic flash card program), write each date you need to memorize on one side of a card, and the significance of that date on the other side.
Quiz yourself by shuffling the cards, looking at the date on each one, and seeing if you can remember the significance of it. You can also reverse the cards and look at the “significance” side, and see if you can recall the date associated with it.
As you go through the cards each session, take out the ones that you remember well, and repeat the ones you cannot, until you can remember all of the dates.
Practice using the flashcards frequently, but work in small bursts of just a few minutes at a time. If you try to memorize too much at one time, the information won’t really stick.

, The more you use the dates you need to learn, the more likely you are to remember them. Talk about the dates you are learning with family and friends, think about them to yourself, and write about them whenever you can. Keep doing this, and you’ll memorize them all!

Read everything assigned, attend lectures, and participating in discussion. Ask your teacher or professor about anything you’ve read or heard in class that you don’t understand or are curious about., You know you’re facing an essay an exam, but what are the specifics? Often, educators will provide a list of possible essay questions, or may even let you know of the questions beforehand. If these are not provided, ask your teacher or professor for examples of the type of question that will be on the test.Acquire all the information you can about what type of essays you’ll have to write. At the least, make sure you know the rough length of the essays and the broader topic or topics they will likely cover.
For instance, preparing for a 300 word essay on Robert E. Lee’s role in a failed American rebellion is different than a 600 word essay on the reasons several southern U.S. states waged war upon their own country.

, Based on what you know about the most likely types of questions and the content you’ve covered in class, practice writing essays that meet the essay requirements you’re aware of. In particular, if you know you’re going to have a certain amount of time to write a certain length essay, set a timer and try to write an essay of the appropriate length about some of the course material you think will be on the exam.If only a few specifics about the essays are provided, ask your teacher what type of essay you should prepare for.
For instance, ask “Should we prepare to provide a synopsis of a historical event, compare and contrast theories or argue on behalf of a certain perspective?”
Make sure you practice writing a brief synopsis of all the major events you’ve studied in your class, as well as summaries of major theories.

, You need to make sure you will be able to mention specific events, facts, and names of historical figures in your essays. Accordingly, study your material enough to ensure that a lot of this information is committed to your memory.Use acronyms, rhymes, or visual images to help remember key information.
For instance, pause to mentally picture key historical events while you’re reading about them. In your mind, watch JFK’s convertible approach a grassy knoll, with Jackie smiling beside him in the back seat. Hear a gunshot ring and watch a man who appears to be Lee Harvey Oswald being chased through the streets of Dallas. Committing these images to memory will help you remember the names as well.

, Aside from what occurred and who did it, be sure to pay particular attention to when certain things happened, and in what order. Remembering the correct order of events of emergence of ideas will help the rest fall into place. Keep this is mind while studying. For each major event, write a brief description, two different theories about why it occurred (including specific events that might have prompted it), and two other major events that followed.

, As soon as you are given the test, write down a list of all the dates and events that you remember from the material. This will get the important years and names down on the page, and allow you to focus on formulating your essay instead of trying to remember a bunch of specifics., You may have multiple questions to choose from. Or, you may have to respond to multiple essays. To know what you have to do and how much time you’ll have for each task, read over all of the questions and instructions provided on your exam., Planning a schedule for how you will approach the exam can be extremely helpful. For instance, if you have to write two essays of equal length and point value and you have 90 minutes, decide to dedicate 45 minutes to each.Plan specific amounts of time for each essay that include planning, writing, and reviewing slots. For instance, If you have 45 minutes to write one essay, spend 10 minutes planning, 25 writing, and 10 minutes reviewing.
Start by writing the essay you know you will be able to finish more easily. This might give you extra time to work on essays you’ll need to think through more extensively.

, For each essay you write, no matter the length, you should have a clear thesis. Your thesis should essentially be a one sentence answer to the essay question. You should even borrow key words from the question to use in your thesis. You should also take a position with your thesis statement. For instance, consider the essay prompt: “Explain in detail how the behavior of an individual of your choosing contributed to the passage of the U.S. Civil Rights Act.” Your thesis might be: “The Civil Rights Act was passed in part because of the behavior of Sheriff Jim Clark.”

, Once you’ve decided on your thesis, write a quick list of the supporting points you’ll make in your essay. If the essay question has multiple parts, make sure each part is specifically answered. Your outline should include the clear point you’re hoping to convey, the evidence you’ll use to support this point, and the logical order in which you will present the evidence.If you have the space, plan to write double-spaced, as this will make any revisions easier.

, A strong introduction is extremely important, as it will help get your teacher or professor interested. Further, a good introduction will tell them what they are about to read, and clearly convey the logic of everything you include in the rest of the essay.Essentially, write your outline out in full sentences, culminating in your thesis. Write in short, clear sentences that briefly acknowledge each point your essay makes.

, Follow your introductory paragraph with a paragraph for each piece of supporting evidence. Include a topic sentence summarizing the point in each paragraph. Think of these sentences as the introductions to each paragraph. Topic sentences should always be clear and straightforward.For instance, a topic sentence for a paragraph arguing that Jim Clark's violent behavior brought increased attention to the illegal and abusive treatment of African Americans might read ""Jim Clark brought more attention to the Civil Rights Movement by causing greater media coverage of several key Civil Rights Marches.""

, Your conclusion is significant because it offers the chance to neatly tie up all the points you've made and reiterate your essay's main arguments. Keep if concise, but make sure you reference your thesis again, and briefly mention the most convincing pieces of evidence you included in your essay., When re-reading your essay, look for sentences that can be edited for greater clarity. Short, clear sentences are best. Make sure the writing is legible, and check again to make sure each part of a question has been answered. When comparing or contrasting perspectives, emphasize your understanding of the differences by stating each separately, and then stating how they compare, as well as how they differ.Re-reading also ensures that you catch unintended grammatical errors that could hurt your score.

, In order to keep on top of your time schedule, periodically check your clock. You should make sure you give the essays that are worth the most the most time. If you are struggling with a particular essay and beginning to cut into time you may need for another, adjust your approach. Write down quick notes as guided by your outline, to show you know the material, and to quickly come back to the essay if you have extra time after answering the remaining questions., Avoid simply writing down everything you know that’s relevant to the essay prompt. Only include points that contribute to your thesis. In other words, include as much information as you can, but only do so if you’re also able to say why it is relevant to the argument you’re making.Similarly, don’t waste time repeating or elaborating on points you’ve already clearly made.

Conclude with something of interest.",How to Make Your History Report Amazing," It can be tempting to answer the question you want to answer, rather than the question you are given. That is a certain recipe for failure. Pay close attention to what the prompt is asking for. Ideally, you should find a clear point to argue for or against.If the question is asking what caused the Civil War and you are just reading books about dramatic battles in the Civil War, you won’t be able to answer the question properly. Instead, you might just try to provide a list of dates and events. An excellent history paper though, does more than just talk about some things that happened in the past.
Pay attention to all parts of the question. The prompt might include follow up questions that point in you in the direction of some arguments you can make. For example, “What caused the Civil War? Was it a conflict over slavery or state’s rights?” In this case, the second part of the question proposes some positions that you could make in your paper.;
, Some teachers have different expectations for a history report. Not all teachers agree about what makes a paper exceptional. Ask your teacher for clarification about what they want. If you find the question to be unclear, talk to your teacher about specifically why that is and ask for further instruction.

, Your response to the question will not be precise if it you don’t use clear terms. The meaning of some historical terms are contested and unclear. You can define them as you wish, as long as you provide a good justification for why you are using the definition you choose.”Socialism,” for example, has meant many things in different places and times, from total state control of the economy to the implementation of even small welfare programs. If, however, you confuse the New Deal with the Soviet Union, your teacher will likely have an issue with your paper.
Similarly, if asked how “democratic” 19th century America was, you need to explain whether you are defining democracy as simply a system in which people vote or a system in which all citizens have equal political and social rights.

, Sometimes, you will be asked to pick your own subject to write about. When doing so, you need to pick a question that can clearly be argued about and that is not too large a subject to cover in your paper.For example, don’t pick a subject that isn’t really a question or a point of argument. “The Civil War” is not a question, but “what caused the Civil War?” is.
You should also pick a topic about which people can and do argue. You can’t really argue, for example, about “Why the New Deal was enacted in the 1930s” because everyone would agree that it was a response to the Great Depression. A more specific question like, “Did Franklin Roosevelt always intend to pass Social Security?” is actually a subject you could argue about.
In general, more focused and specific questions are easier to answer. While you could write about the causes of the Civil War, you might find it difficult to cover the hundreds of books that cover the question. Something more focused like, “Why did the Known-Nothing party rally to the Union cause despite its prejudices?” is easier to cover completely in a short essay.

, There are plenty of systems available for note taking nowadays. You can write notes by hand, but computers now allow you to keep extensive, easily searchable notes. Be sure to record the all of the information for the sources that you are using.


If you record every word you read, your notes won’t be that useful. When reading, think closely about what pieces of evidence might be useful for your argument. You can also underline and highlight quotes that you aren’t sure of, to find them more easily in the future.
Be sure that when you take notes, you include the page number you got the information from, the author, title, publisher and date of publication. When recording quotes, be careful to write them accurately.
There are now programs that allow you to record all of your citations and notes. Computerized notes make it easier to search through your materials quickly and find what you are looking for.
To take full and accurate notes without typing too much, you can also use a copy machine or take a picture of relevant pages. There are now devices that also make it easy to quickly take pictures of pages without missing any material.
Consider having a separate document for each source and possibly organizing sources into separate files, depending upon where they fit into your papers. You can also include a personal reminder of what you think that the evidence recorded is important., It has never been easier to do research, but many websites include inaccurate information. Also, your peers will also be looking at those websites and the last thing you want to do is turn in a paper that sounds like everyone else’s.


Ask a librarian if he can help you find the sort of books that you are looking for.
Pay attention to the publisher of the book. If possible, use books that have been published by a university; the more prestigious the university, the better.
Sometimes you can also use your text book for information. But your teacher will be more impressed if you include outside readings.
Few if any teachers regard Wikipedia as a valid source. Refrain from consulting it during your research.

, Library computers will often have access to specialized websites like JSTOR and EBSCO that the general public can’t access. In these databases you can do quick searches that will allow you access to high quality articles written by academics.


Leading academic journals include the Journal of American History, American Historical Review, Environmental History, Social Science History, Journal of Modern History, Journal of African History, Journal of British Studies, Journal of Contemporary History, Journal of Social History, Journal of the History of Sexuality, International Review of Social History, Ethnohistory, English Historical Review, Journal of Interdisciplinary History, Journal of Family History, War in History, and the Journal of the Gilded Age and Progressive Era., Once you find a book, look through its footnotes for other books that address the topic that you are researching. Oftentimes, encyclopedias will also include a short list of some of the most relevant books on a subject. Now, you can even use the internet to quickly see which authors interact with one another.


Be particularly careful with footnotes when you see that the topic is relevant. For example, when you see a point in the book that is important to you, look to the closest footnote. The books there will likely cover the point that interests you in greater detail.
With Google Scholar, you can type in the name of a book and ask it to search for authors that have cited that book. This way, if you find an important book on your subject that is decades old, you find books that came after it that discuss the same subject.

, Before you can begin work, you need to know what your argument is. Work hard to come up with a sentence that completely summarizes the argument of your paper. The thesis should be clear and everything else in the paper should be evidence that supports this argument. It will usually come at the end of your introduction.


A strong, original, or provocative thesis is the single most important thing for making your paper exceptional.
A truly exceptional thesis must be original. Perhaps it goes against the grain of standard historical interpretations by pointing out some examples of when historians have been wrong or, at the very least, overstated their case.
Alternatively, you can look at a subject from an entirely new perspective. Plenty of people, for example, have written about the American colonies. But, until a couple of decades ago, no one had ever written about how colonists interacted with the environment. When they did it represented a major change in the field.
You can also try to surprise readers with arguments that they would never expect. Successful historians, for example, have argued that pirate ships were extremely democratic societies that passed radical, anti-establishment ideas around the globe. Prior to this, no one had ever really written much about pirates or considered the possibility that they were politically significant.
The thesis should be as precise as possible. To be original when writing about a subject that has been densely covered by other authors, it helps to be nuanced and specific.
From the research to the writing phase, you should always have a working thesis so that you know what you are trying to prove. However, as you come across new evidence and think about how evidence fits together, you will probably want to revise that thesis., Each body paragraph will have a particular argument that helps to prove your thesis. That argument will be your topic sentence, which generally comes at beginning of each body paragraph.

, Your outline should include your thesis statement and topic sentences. Underneath each of these, briefly sketch out the facts will go into each paragraph. Possibly list the books and quotes that will go into each paragraph.


If you took notes electronically, you can copy and paste notes directly into your outline. However, if you are using direct quotes, be sure that you are putting them in quotes and attributing them to the correct author.
How you organize your paragraphs can vary. Sometimes you might want to make each of your paragraphs advance chronologically. Other times, you might want to progress from your weakest to your strongest argument., The key to good writing is rewriting. Write down all of the basic arguments and facts of your case. Structure them to make sure that they follow in a logical way. Don’t be too closely wed to your first draft, because you will probably want to change it after taking some time off.


It is good to draft the paper in advance. If you give yourself time to forget what you wrote, you won’t be so invested in it when you return to it. With less bias, you will be able to more honestly understand what works and what doesn’t work about the essay.
When you return to redraft the paper, you should pay attention to grammatical and spelling errors. However, you should also think more broadly about how your paper works. Is the argument clear? Does your evidence really support what you say? If you didn’t already know about the subject, would you understand the paper? It is best to start with these bigger questions and then move on to writing errors, because if your argument doesn’t work, you might need to rewrite much of the paper., A good title will suggest to the reader the argument of your paper. While it can’t and shouldn’t make the entire argument, it will set the reader in the right direction so that he can understand what is coming. Try to excite the reader with a title that is bold and provocative.Consider incorporating into the title quotes or phrases that are relevant to the subject and draw the reader in.
If it is might not be clear otherwise, consider include a specific date range and location at the end of the title to give the reader a better sense of what you are writing about., The most important part of the introduction is your thesis argument. However, before giving your reader this, you should try to provide him with a reason to be interested. Start out with a provocative quote, a surprising story, or interesting statistics. Alternatively, begin with a quote that sets up the idea that you are trying to argue for or rebut in your paper.For longer papers, the entire first paragraph might be a hook. You can begin with an extended anecdote that will make your reader feel like he is in the period you are writing about. Once you have immersed your reader in the topic and gotten them interesting, you can move into a second paragraph that sets up your argument. If the paper is any less than 10 pages long, however, this will be squandering valuable space that should be reserved for putting forth your argument.

, A good history paper isn’t just a summary of facts. However, it should demonstrate a mastery of those facts by giving specific names and dates. Using generalities like “progressive presidents” does not allow you to make more nuanced arguments about change over time.


Generalities like “since the beginning of time” make your argument implausible.
While a phrase like “the times of slavery” might not be as implausible, they don’t make it clear what time you are referring to. They also make it seem, wrongly, as if slavery did not change over the period that it existed. Instead, you want to refer to specific decades or even precise dates., There are plenty of ways to cite sources and the rules can get complicated in light of all of the different types of sources available. Your teacher should, however, indicate what style of citations he wants you to use. If not, pick one. The most important thing is to be consistent. Always use the same citation style throughout the paper.Citations are important for giving credit to writers and allowing people who evaluate your scholarship to go back to your sources and see if you are using them correctly.
For advanced works in history, footnotes are generally used instead of in text citation. In a footnote, you don’t have to just give the name of the source though. You can also write a short summary of what the source says or how the source fits into your argument. You can also provide additional information that reinforces your case. Footnotes can be a great way to incorporate additional information that is useful, but would bog down your paper if you included all of it in the body of your text.

, Historiography is the study of how historians have argued about past events. Including the opinions of historians can help make a better paper, but you should try to prove your argument with quotes, events, and other facts from the period in question.Historiography is most important when defining how your argument is unique and interesting. For example, writing about political corruption in South Carolinian during the 1870s is, in and of itself, not particularly interesting. However, the subject becomes more important when you note that one school of historians used to argue that the failure of Reconstruction governments during the period proved that universal male suffrage was flawed, but that modern historians now believe it led to important reforms.
On the other hand, it isn’t valid to argue that Reconstruction was a success because a particular historian says it was. Instead, you should try to cite something like the number of new public schools built by Reconstruction governments.

, Quotes are important pieces of evidence. Because of that, you should make sure that you fully explain its significance. Don’t just put the quote in the paper. Either before or after the quote explain why it is significant.For example: ""Abraham Lincoln, for his part, provides plenty of evidence that the union had no interested in abolishing slavery, only limiting its advance to the Western territories. In a speech at New Haven, Connecticut in 1860, the future president told his audience that 'We think slavery a great moral wrong, and while we do not claim the right to touch it where it exists, we wish to treat it as a wrong in the territories, where our votes will reach it.'""

, When making your argument, consider how someone might critique it. Answer his critique with concrete evidence showing that it is flawed. Otherwise, make a small concession, acknowledging that the other side has a point, but that it doesn’t diminish your argument.If, for example, you are arguing that the North did not enter into the Civil War to end slavery, you can acknowledge that there had long been abolitionists in the North, but that ultimately they had little bearing on the situation because President Lincoln claimed throughout his administration that the war was not about slavery. This is a concession that does not invalidate your point.
This is another situation in which historiography can be important. When listing possible objections, it can sound like you are making a straw man argument—rebutting a weak argument that no one believes in order to make your argument seem stronger. However, if you can name a particular historian who has argued the point you are trying to rebut, then you should like a serious scholar, engaging with important ideas.

, A good conclusion will wrap up the argument that you have put forward, making how it all fits together clear, if your reader hasn’t already gotten it. However, if possible, you can add to what you’ve already done by concluding with a new point that suggests why your argument is important or how it fits into what other people have argued in the past."

This confrontation involved the European Axis Powers (mainly Germany and Italy) against the Soviet Union and other Allied Powers.The Eastern Front was where the majority of concentration camps were located and, thus, played a major role in the Holocaust.
The major battles fought on the Eastern Front include Stalingrad and the battles that led to the recapture of Kharkov by the Soviets.;
, The Western Front was the site of many conflicts between Germany and other Western European countries like Denmark, Norway, Luxembourg, Belgium, France, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands.The first phase of the war in the Western Front involved many of these western countries fighting Germany in attempts that culminated with the Battle of Britain.
The second phase saw a lot of ground combat between the two sides that began with the landing in Normandy and lasted until the German defeat in 1945.
The major battles fought on the Western Front include the Normandy D-Day landing, the Battle of the Bulge, the Battle of Britain, and the Battle of Arnhem., After the Japanese attack on American’s military bases at Pearl Harbor, the US launched a counterstrike against the Japanese who had overextended their military forces, resulting in massive air battles that usually resulted in greater losses for the Japanese than for the American Allies.The major battles fought in the Pacific Theater included Pearl Harbor, the Battle of Midway, and the Battle of the Philippine Sea.

, The major players in World War II included the Axis and the Allied Powers. These were the entities between which most of the major battles took place.The Axis Powers included Germany, Italy, Japan, (and less significantly) Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, Thailand, Finland, and Iraq.
The Allied Powers included Britain, China, France, the Soviet Union, the United States, (and less significantly) Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, Greece, Luxembourg, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, South Africa, and Yugoslavia.

, Books can be the most important source for gathering information. Primary sources are books that are written by someone with firsthand experience about the topic. So, in this case, primary sources about WWII would be written by people who actually participated in the war in some way (mostly memoirs and autobiographies).Keep in mind, though, the relative bias of sources because you’re usually just getting one person’s point of view. Some notable primary sources include:


Memoirs of the Eastern Front


A Writer at War by Vasily Grossman


Memoirs of the Western Front


The Second World War by Winston Churchill

To Hell and Back by Audie Murphy (America's most decorated WWII soldier)


Memoirs of the Pacific theater


Goodbye, Darkness by William Manchester

Isles of the Damned by R.V. Burgin



, Secondary sources are written by people who don’t have firsthand knowledge of the event, but who have done extensive research on the topic. Be aware these are interpretations by people who were not necessarily there. Some notable secondary sources include:


Eastern Front


Berlin by Anthony Beevor

Stalingrad by Anthony Beevor


Western Front


Armageddon by Max Hastings

Overlord by Max Hastings


Global


The Meaning of the Second World War by Ernest Mandel

The Origins of the Second World War by A.J.P. Taylor



, Many public libraries contain books and encyclopedia articles that can give you a broad overview of World War II or more specific information about individual events or aspects of the war.. There is a vast array of information available in a public library. You might even stumble upon something you didn’t know you were looking for.

, Watching films about WWII can be a great way to learn about what happened during this time in history. Just be careful to watch movies that are historically accurate and not simply sensationalizing the past for entertainment value.


Remember that few films are primary sources except for propaganda films.

, The Eastern Front was one of the most volatile areas of the entire WWII conflict. Nearly half of all of the casualties from the war took place on the Eastern Front.Some examples of historically accurate films about the Eastern Front include:



Cross of Iron (1977)

Stalingrad (1993)

Enemy at the Gates (2001) (Stalingrad)

Downfall (2004) (Berlin)

Defiance (2008)

Valkyrie (2008)

, The Western Front consisted mostly of air warfare between Germany and Britain as well as the infamous D-Day landing in Normandy.Some examples of historically accurate films about the Western Front include:



Das Boot (1981)

Saving Private Ryan (1998)

The Longest Day (1962) (Invasion of Normandy)

A Bridge Too Far (1977) (Operation Market Garden)

Band of Brothers (2001). This is a mini-series produced by Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks that is based on Stephen E. Ambrose's book of the same name. The series follows Easy Company, a company of paratroopers in the 101st Airborne Division, 506 Parachute Infantry Regiment, from their training in Fort Bragg to the occupation of Germany, covering scenes such as Operation Overlord (commonly known as D-Day), Operation Market Garden, the Battle of the Bulge, and Easy company capturing Hitler’s Eagle Nest.

, The Pacific theater mainly involved the conflict between Japan and the United States during World War II. This includes the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Battle of Iwo Jima, and many other crucial events in the war.Some historically accurate films to watch about conflict in the Pacific include:



The Thin Red Line (Guadalcanal)

Flags of our Fathers (2006) (Iwo Jima)

Letters from Iwo Jima (2006)

The Pacific (2010). Like Band of Brothers, this is a miniseries produced by Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg. Unlike Band of Brothers, it details the stories of soldiers of the 1st Marine Division at Guadalcanal, Cape Gloucester, Peleliu, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa and is based on three separate books. It is also an extremely accurate depiction of World War II.

, Talk to a veteran and get their perspective on the war.

Gather your materials together and find a quiet place to work.,
Start by making a very broad outline of the material you need to remember.,
Read your assigned text.,
Follow your reading by reviewing any class notes.,
Continue building your outline until you have a complete description of the main events you need to learn in your own words.,
As you study, focus on the overall narrative.,
Study your outline.,
Test yourself.",How to Memorize History Lessons1," Get rid of distractions. Get away from the computer (or log out of email, Facebook, and your instant messenger) and put your phone away.;
, Chronological order is a good basic way to start. Use your textbook as a guide (many of them have an outline or list of key concepts). Just list the big events in chronological order. Leave a lot of space between them because you will be filling them in with details.

, As you read, fill in key details on your outline. Don't write everything down - you can't memorize everything. Instead, think about what are the most important things and write them on your outline.

, The information covered in class will be what your teacher thinks is really important. So be sure to include that in your outline.

, You can draw arrows from one person or event to another and add notes to them to show relationships between events.


Make a timeline. There are many online places that allow you to make a digital timeline of your own. When you make it yourself, it tends to stay in your memory better, as it's your own creation.

, Big events in history don't just happen. Remember to think about the story in history. This is how you will really make sense of everything.

, You can review your outline much faster than you can read the whole text or go over all your notes. Make flashcards for important things you need to review.

, Once you have studied your outline and know things pretty well, put your outline away and try to recreate it from memory. This will tell you what you really know. If you don't get everything right the first time, at least you now know what to study. Once you can recreate everything from scratch, you know you have your history lesson memorized!

Use italics to cite a specific article in text.,
Place quotation marks around direct quotes.,
Format citations in your footnotes.,
Cite all paraphrases and summaries in your footnotes.,
Use full citations in your bibliography.",How to Cite the Federalist Papers1," If you are writing about a specific article in The Federalist Papers, place a citation in text right after the quote. The citation should also note the article number.The citation would look like: Book title, article number.
For example: The Federalist Papers, No. 51.
You can also place the citation in a sentence, such as: “In Federalist Paper No. 51, Alexander Hamilton observed…” or “As Hamilton pointed out in Federalist Paper No. 51…”;
, It’s important to note any direct quotes from The Federalist Papers in your text by using quotation marks.So the citation would look like: As Alexander Hamilton noted at the beginning of Federalist Paper No. 78: “We proceed now to an examination of the judiciary department of the proposed government."", The citation should be in the following form: Author, Article name, in Book Name, ed. Name (Publisher, Publish Date), page numbers.For example: James Madison, Federalist No.10, in The Federalist Papers, ed. Clinton Rossiter (New York: New American Library, 1961), pg 77-84.
In your full citation in footnotes, you need to note the editor of the article. The Federalist Papers were not published as a unified work. They were gathered together over time by various editors.
Your footnotes should begin with “1” and follow numerically. They should be superscript at the end of the quoted sentence or phrase. Using a word processing program, the footnote should automatically also appear at the bottom left of the page., In the Chicago Style, you can cite any paraphrased sentences or summarized sections with a corresponding footnote. You do not need to cite the paraphrased sentence or summary in the text.For example, if you are paraphrasing the first line from Federalist No. 1 by Alexander Hamilton, you may write: “In Federalist No. 10, James Madison talks about deliberating the new Constitution and how important the subject is to the state of the Union.”
Though you have simply restated the first two lines of the article, you must still cite these lines as a footnote in your text. The footnote should have a full citation: James Madison, Federalist No.10, in The Federalist Papers, ed. Clinton Rossiter (New York: New American Library, 1961), pg 77-84.

, You will need to cite The Federalist Papers as a source in your bibliography. If you used a specific article in your paper or document, you will need to specify this in your citation.The citation should look like: Author, Article, in Book Name, ed. Name (Publisher, Publish Date), page numbers.
For example: Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 68, in The Federalist, ed. George W. Carey and James McClellan (Indianapolis, IN: Liberty Fund, 2001), 351–52.
If you are just using The Federalist Papers as a whole, you can cite it as one source. So the citation would look like: Carey, George, and James McClellan, eds.The Federalist. Indianapolis, IN: Liberty Fund, 2001.

Create full citations in your bibliography.",How to Cite the Federalist Papers2," If you are directly quoting from an article, include the author of the article, the year of publication, and the page number (preceded by “p.”) at the end of the quote.


For example: He noted: “After an unequivocal experience of the inefficiency of the subsisting federal government, you are called upon to deliberate on a new Constitution for the United States of America.”(Hamilton, 2001, p. 23)You would use 2001 as the date because the source you are using (Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 68, in The Federalist, ed. George W. Carey and James McClellan (Indianapolis, IN: Liberty Fund, 2001), 351–52.) was published in 2001.

, APA style does not encourage the use of footnotes or endnotes. But if you feel you need to use notes in your text to prevent plagiarism, APA style has two types of footnotes:Content footnotes: these notes provide supplemental, or extra, information to your readers. Be brief and try to limit the footnote to one small paragraph. You should also point readers to information that is available in more detail elsewhere.
For example: 1 See DeWeese (2000), especially Chapters 1 and 2, for an insightful analysis of Hamilton’s article.
Copyright permission notes: If you quote more than 500 words of published material, or think you may be in violation of “Fair Use” copyright laws, you must get formal permission from the author(s). The other sources can appear in the reference list at the end of your paper or document. Follow the same formatting rules as the content footnote. Then, attach a copy of the permission letter to the document.
Begin the copyright permission footnote with “Note”. The format is: Note: From Article Title by Author, Journal Title, Journal Number, page number. Copyright Date by Copyright Holder. Reprinted with permission.
For example: Note: From The Federalist Papers: A Study by D. DeWeese, 2000, American Letters, 20, p. 122. Copyright 2000 by Flag Publishing. Reprinted with permission.
For both types of footnotes, always insert the number in superscript at the end of the sentence, after the punctuation mark. If the footnote appears in a sentence in parentheses, the footnote should appear within the parentheses.

, According to the APA guideline, your citation should make reference to the author and year of publication in the text. APA style also encourages you to provide the page number for the source, but this is not required.For example: According to Hamilton (2001), the union is crucial to the Constitution.
The citation of a summary or paraphrase could also appear as: He argued that the union is crucial to the Constitution. (Hamilton, 2001, p. 99)

, Just like in Chicago Style, you will need to cite The Federalist Papers as a source in your bibliography for your paper in APA style. If you used a specific article in your paper or document, you will need to specify this in your citation.The citation should appear as: Author (Year of publication). Title of chapter. Editor (Eds.), Title of book (pages of chapter). Location: Publisher.
For example: Alexander Hamilton (2001). Federalist No. 68, ed. George W. Carey and James McClellan, The Federalist (351–52). Indianapolis, IN: Liberty Fund.
If you are just using The Federalist Papers as a whole, you can cite it as one source. So the citation would look like: Author or editor, (Year of publication). Title of work. Location: Publisher.
For example: Carey, George, and James McClellan, eds. 2001. The Federalist. Indianapolis, IN: Liberty Fund.

Use the author-page method of in-text citation.,
Only use endnotes and footnotes when necessary.,
Create full citations in a Works Cited page.",How to Cite the Federalist Papers3," In MLA style, the author’s last name and the page number (s) from which the quotation or paraphrase is taken must appear in the text. A complete reference should also appear in a Works Cited page. The author’s name can appear in the sentence in the text or in parentheses following the quotation. The page number should always appear in parentheses.For example: Hamilton stated that the union was “crucial to the Constitution” (99).
It could also appear as: In Federalist No. 51, he also stated the union was crucial. (Hamilton 99)

, MLA style discourages the use of endnotes and footnotes as long explanatory notes can be distracting to readers. But if you need to use endnotes or footnotes, in MLA style, there are two types:Bibliographic notes. These are other publications your readers can consult for extra information on a particular topic.
For example: 1 See DeWeese (2000), especially Chapter 1 and 2, for an insightful analysis of Hamilton’s article.
Explanatory notes, or content notes. These are brief notes of additional information that might be too long for the main text.
For example: 1 In a 2000 interview, he stresses this point even more strongly: “Reform is essential to the union”. (DeWeese 124)
All footnotes should appear as numbers in superscript at the end of sentences, after the punctuation mark. If the footnote appears in a sentence in parentheses, the footnote should appear within the parentheses.

Be aware of the origin of The Federalist Papers.,
Cite all quotes, paraphrases, and summaries from The Federalist Papers.,
Don’t overuse citations of The Federalist Papers.",How to Cite the Federalist Papers4," While The Federalist Papers were published anonymously, three of the founding fathers, Alexander Hamilton, who became Secretary of the Treasury, John Jay, who became Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, and James Madison, who served in congress before becoming the fourth president were later revealed to be the authors of the articles. The Federalist Papers are legally established as important references to the creation of the Constitution., Even if you paraphrase or summarize a quote or section from the articles, you still must cite it. Failure to cite the original source of a quote or a paraphrase of the original source is considered plagiarism.Paraphrasing and summaries are restatements in your own words of written or spoken text. A paraphrase usually restates a portion of the text in a few sentences. A summary condenses larger chunks of text. When paraphrasing and summarizing, you must reword the information completely and not just substitute a few words from the original text. You must also be careful not to change the original meaning in the original text with your rewording.All three citation styles require you to cite all quotes and paraphrasing in text. However, each style cites paraphrasing in different ways.

, This may draw criticism from legal experts who think that the influence of The Federalist Papers on the Constitution are not well founded, or a professor who wants to see you use more than one source for your paper.Some legal experts believe The Federalist Papers are self-contradictory or that they may not have persuaded the ratifiers of the Constitution at all. They also argue that The Federalist Papers were written to support the ratification of the Constitution, rather than to explain it and that they are an unreliable source for determining the original intent of the founding fathers because of the secrecy of the Constitutional Convention.
All of these critiques of The Federalist Papers are valid. But none of them work against the articles in a significant way. So if you are going to make a claim about the original meaning of The Federalist Papers, take the counterarguments noted above into account."

Create a heading.,

Ascertain the rule of law.,
Describe the court's reasoning.,
Understand what a material fact is.,
Keep in mind the particular subject you are concerned with.,
Read the facts of the case.,
Determine how each fact fits in.,
Identify the material facts.,
Create a statement of facts to include in your brief.",How to Determine the Material Facts in a Case (Common Law)," Before you brief a legal opinion you should read through the whole case once. This will help you understand the overall story and will give you an idea of what you will be looking for the next time around.


When you read the case, pay attention to any facts and highlight them as you go.;
, You will always start your case brief with a heading, which will include the case's identifying information. This information will make your brief easily identifiable and will help you incorporate a citation into a piece of work down the road. Everything you need for the heading can be found near the beginning of the judicial opinion.


In general, your heading will always include the:

Case name;
Court name;
Date of decision; and
The page number where the case appears in the applicable reporter.Try and create a heading that conforms to a legal citation manual (e.g., the Bluebook or ALWD Manual). For example, you might try using a heading that looks like this: Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973).

Within that citation is the case name, the court name, the date of decision, and the page numbers where it can be found.



, The procedural history of a case is its disposition in lower courts.For this section of your brief, you will want to explain how the case got to the court whose opinion you are now briefing.Be sure you include the decisions of the lower courts (i.e., who won and why), the damages that were awarded, and who appealed and why.The procedural history can usually be found near the beginning of a judicial opinion when the judge discusses the facts and issues of the case.


For example, if you are explaining the procedural history of Roe v. Wade, you might state that the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas ruled the Texas abortion statute unconstitutional and there was a direct appeal by Texas to the United States Supreme Court.

, When you identify the issue of a case, you will need to include a statement of the point of law in dispute.This statement should be in the form of a question. The issue of a case is often stated explicitly by the court writing the opinion, but sometimes you may have to tease the issue out.For example, the issue in Roe v. Wade might be stated like this: Does the Texas abortion statute violate the Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution?, The holding of a case is a statement of law that directly answers the question posed in the issue.This is the majority's basic answer to the legal question and should include the vote count if there is one.


For example, the holding of Roe v. Wade is: (Vote: 7-2) Yes: The Texas statute is unconstitutional because the Constitution and the Ninth Amendment recognizes the right to an abortion., This is the rule the court applies to determine the holding of the case.The rule could come from a statute, judicial opinion, or regulation.While the rule may be explicitly stated in the opinion, it may also be implied.In Roe v. Wade, the rule of law is the test used to reach the holding, which was that the Texas statute was unconstitutional. In that case, the rule of law was announced that during the first trimester of pregnancy, most abortion regulations would be invalid.During the second trimester of pregnancy, some regulations may be okay.During the third trimester, abortions can be outlawed., The reasoning is how the court applies the rule to a particular set of facts.This section is extremely important when you are trying to identify the material facts of a case. If you can correctly identify a court's reasoning, you will be able to quickly find the important facts as well.


Within the reasoning, a court will explain the particular facts of the case that lead them to use the law they did and to decide the outcome the way they did.
For example, in Roe v. Wade, the court reasoned that a woman has a privacy right, as well as an interest in avoiding physical and psychological harm, and therefore abortions cannot be outright denied.The court further stated that while the state of Texas had legitimate interests in banning abortions, those interests had to be balanced with the interests and rights of the female.As a pregnancy progresses, the interests of the state become stronger.This reasoning gives you clues to what some material facts might be. For example, the fact that Texas' abortion law was an absolute prohibition is material. This is the case because the court concludes that while Texas has interests, they have to be balanced. Put a different way, if Texas' law would have allowed abortions in some circumstances, perhaps the case would have turned out differently.



, A ""material fact"" is a fact that is crucial to the determination of an issue at hand.Without this particular fact, the court's determination of the issue would have been different.


Material facts can also be thought of as those facts which a party would use to prove his or her case.Think about who the parties are, what their dispute is, and how they got to where they are., Case briefing helps you put cases in context.However, cases are rarely only about a single issue. The court's opinion may cover more issues than are relevant to the subject upon which you are focused. This additional information can distract you from the purpose of your assignment.


For example, if you are briefing a case for your contracts course about an office lottery pool, you will want to focus on what the court says about the agreement between the parties, and pay less attention to what the court says about the tax consequences to the lottery winners.

, The court's opinion usually has a recitation of the facts near the beginning. This section tells the story prior to the presentation of the analysis of the facts and applicable law. Although you cannot be certain which facts the court considered material until you have finished reading, highlight or take note of the facts that seem most important to you as you read.

, To do this, look through the case and determine how each fact affects the holding and reasoning of the opinion. If a particular fact affects the holding or reasoning, then it should be considered material. If, on the other hand, a fact does not have any bearing on the holding or reasoning, you can safely assume it is not a material fact.


You should brief your entire case before determining the material facts for this reason. If you know the holding and the reasoning, you will be able to better analyze the facts.
In general, if a fact is brought up in the reasoning of a case, it is likely going to be a material fact.
For example, in Roe v. Wade, ask yourself how the fact that the Texas statute outlawed all abortions affects the holding and reasoning of the case.

, For each factual detail, ask yourself, ""If this fact were changed, would the outcome of the case be different?"" This helps you separate the material facts from immaterial background information and explain why the court reached the conclusion that it did.


Example A: The plaintiff emailed a contract to the defendant. The plaintiff and defendant disagree on specific terms of the contract. Thus, the method of sending the contract is not a material fact, because the method of transmission does not affect the court's interpretation of the terms of the contract.
Example B: The plaintiff emailed a contract to the defendant. The defendant refuses to perform because the contract did not arrive in time. Plaintiff sues for nonperformance. Now the method of sending the contract is a material fact, because the details of the method of transmission, whether by email, postal service, etc., is necessary for the court determine whether the contract arrived in time.

, When you include your statement of facts in your case brief, identify the parties and their relationship and identify the material facts of the case.Try writing the statement of facts in chronological order so as to create a mini story of the important pieces of the case.

Identify the parties to the case.,
Find out if the defendant was arrested.,
Analyze the harm done by violating the law.,
Consider the legal protections available to the defendant.,
Determine the applicable burden of proof.,
Compare burdens for affirmative defenses.,
Understand how burdens shift.,
Find out if the defendant faces jail time.,
Understand the difference between fines, restitution, and monetary damages.,
Consider the purpose of the trial's outcome.",How to Distinguish Civil and Criminal Law," One of the key distinctions between civil and criminal law is who initiated the proceeding. Civil cases have plaintiffs which are private individuals or businesses, while criminal cases are initiated when government attorneys file charges.If a case title lists the names of private individuals or organizations on both sides of the ""v."" it is assuredly a civil case.
However, this doesn't end your inquiry, because sometimes the government can sue or be sued. Just because the government is a party to a case doesn't necessarily mean it's a criminal case.
In criminal cases – excluding appeals, in which the defendant's name will be first since they appealed a conviction – the government always is the first party in the case. It will be the state (styled as ""The State of,"" ""The Commonwealth of,"" or ""The People of,"" the state in question) or federal government, depending on whether the defendant is charged with a violation of state or federal law.
When the government is a party in civil cases, on the other hand, you typically will see the name of a particular government department or agency, or the title of an office. For example, a civil case might be ""The Department of Education v. Sally Sunshine."";
, No matter how egregious the offense, people generally cannot be arrested because someone sues them in civil court. Some offenses such as assault and battery present the possibility of both criminal charges and civil liability; however, if the defendant is arrested it is in conjunction with the filing of criminal charges.Civil defendants can be held in contempt of court and arrested for contempt if they refuse to follow the court's order. However, they will be released as soon as they comply with the order.
For example, suppose a group of neighbors sued a nearby hog farm for polluting their water supply in violation of health and safety regulations. The owners of the hog farm cannot be arrested, since they have not been charged with a crime.
However, if the owners of the hog farm are found liable for the neighbors' damages and are ordered to clean up the water, they can be jailed for contempt if they violate the order and refuse to conduct the required clean up operations.

, It's a somewhat more theoretical distinction, but defendants are charged with crimes because they have harmed society as a whole by their actions. Civil lawsuits remedy harm to particular private individuals or businesses.While some crimes do result in harm to an individual, the victim isn't a party in a criminal case. In most situations, the victim doesn't even have to consent to the criminal prosecution of the defendant. Criminal charges are filed by state or federal attorneys regardless of the victim's desires.
Keep in mind that in many situations, the victim can tell the prosecutors that they don't want to press charges, and the prosecutors will go along with this preference. However, don't confuse that with thinking that the victim's permission is required to press charges.
Even if the victim says they don't want to press charges, prosecutors can do it anyway. This is because a criminal case is brought to correct a wrong against society – not a wrong against a particular person. In fact, some crimes have no specific victim at all.
Civil cases, in contrast, are brought by plaintiffs who want to be compensated for some wrong that has been done to them. If they win their case, the defendant will be ordered to do something or to pay them money to compensate for their losses.

, Someone charged with a crime has a number of Constitutional rights, including the right to an attorney. If a criminal defendant cannot afford an attorney, the court will appoint one.Criminal defendants have a number of other Constitutional protections, because the outcome if they are found guilty is potentially a loss of freedom. Civil cases typically only involve paying money, which is a much lesser threat than the loss of liberty.
For example, criminal defendants in most cases are entitled to a trial by jury. You typically are not entitled to a jury trial in civil court and may have to pay additional court fees to get one.
Some of these rights may appear in civil cases. For example, a witness in a civil case may ""plead the Fifth"" and refuse to answer a question.
This right against self-incrimination can be used in a civil trial because something the person says in the civil trial could be used against them in a criminal trial. However, the right against self-incrimination does not extend to admissions of things that would indicate civil liability.
Keep in mind that some states guarantee the right to an attorney in civil court in limited circumstances – typically in cases related to child custody in which the person could potentially lose their parental rights.
These are still considered civil cases, but states that provide court-appointed attorneys in these cases recognize that parental rights are perhaps as important as personal freedom and should not be taken from someone unless he or she has the opportunity to be represented by legal counsel.

, You may be familiar with the criminal burden of proof, ""beyond a reasonable doubt."" Plaintiffs in civil cases never have to prove their cases to such a high degree of certainty.The standard burden of proof in a civil case is ""preponderance of the evidence."" This means the plaintiff must prove that the defendant more likely than not is responsible for the injuries or losses the plaintiff suffered.
In contrast, for a defendant to be found guilty in a criminal trial, the prosecuting attorney must prove that there is not a shred of doubt that he or she committed the crime. The criminal justice system is based on the idea that someone's life or liberty should not be taken from them unless there is no question they are guilty.
For this reason, a criminal defense case typically consists of poking holes in the prosecution's theory of the case, introducing doubts that the defendant did it. Examples of this include demonstrating that the sole eyewitness to the crime had a vision impairment that would have made it impossible for them to positively identify the defendant, or that they were under the influence of alcohol or drugs at the time of the incident.
These methods of impeaching a witness's testimony also are used in civil cases. However, the defendant must demonstrate substantially larger holes in the plaintiff's case to prevail in a civil matter than they would in a criminal one.

, Affirmative defenses essentially are excuses that, if proven, would absolve the defendant either from guilt or liability. While defendants carry the burden of proving any affirmative defense in both civil and criminal cases, the weight of those burdens differs substantially.Most people are familiar with affirmative defenses such as the insanity defense in criminal cases. Being found not guilty by reason of insanity can be much more difficult than simply poking holes of doubt in the state's case, because the burden is on the defendant to prove that they were incapable of distinguishing between right and wrong or understanding the consequences of their actions.
If a criminal defendant proves an affirmative defense, he or she usually is found not guilty of the crime. Likewise, a civil defendant who successfully raises an affirmative defense may be found not to be liable for the plaintiff's damages.
Since the prosecution must prove its criminal case beyond a reasonable doubt, the bar for any affirmative defense is correspondingly lower than it would be for the civil defendant.
This is why plaintiffs often are able to prevail in a civil case against a defendant who was found not guilty in the criminal case arising from the same incident.

, Some civil cases employ a proof mechanism that shifts the burdens of proof back and forth between the plaintiff and the defendant. Essentially, if the plaintiff is able to show specific facts, it creates a presumption in favor of the plaintiff and moves the burden of proof to the defendant.One example comes in a civil lawsuit for copyright infringement. If the plaintiff has registered their copyright, that registration establishes that they hold a valid copyright in the work infringed. If the defendant wants to argue the copyright isn't valid, they bear the burden of proof.
This type of burden shifting isn't allowed in criminal cases because it would violate the defendant's Constitutional rights.
One exception is strict-liability crimes, which typically are called ""violations,"" involve local law, and can only be punished by payment of a fine. Traffic or health and safety violations may be classified as strict liability. If an inspector finds a health and safety violation, it's up to the defendant to show some reason they shouldn't have to pay the fine.

, Courts generally cannot punish civil defendants with jail time as a penalty for their actions, no matter how harmful. Criminal offenses, in contrast, may include a jail sentence depending on their seriousness.While a civil defendant can be placed in jail for being in contempt, the charge of contempt typically requires an additional hearing in which the person is formally charged with contempt. They are given the opportunity to either comply with the court's order or go to jail.
However, a civil defendant won't face jail time if they lose their civil case. For example, if you are sued by a credit card company for defaulting on your credit card, and you lose your case, the judge cannot put you in jail.
The credit card company will get an order against you for the amount you owe, which it can enforce by placing liens on your property or garnishing your wages, but not by getting you thrown in jail.
In contrast, a person convicted of a crime may be sentenced to jail for a period of time until it is determined that they have repaid their ""debt to society.""

, Although the defendant may be ordered to pay money in a criminal case, these amounts have a different purpose than the monetary damages paid in a civil case.Generally, a criminal fine must be paid to the state, while civil damages are paid to the person who initiated the lawsuit.
Criminal fines have nothing to do with any losses incurred by anyone as a result of the defendant's actions. Rather, they are designed to punish the defendant for violating the law.
Criminals also may be ordered to pay restitution to their victims. However, unlike civil damages these amounts are sought by and paid to the state. In some cases the state pays the victims of the crime and then the criminal defendant is responsible for paying the state back.
In contrast, the court has nothing to do with enforcing civil judgments. Once a plaintiff wins a civil lawsuit it's up to them to file another legal action to enforce the order, for example by garnishing the defendant's wages, if the defendant doesn't voluntarily pay the amount ordered.

, Ultimately, a criminal trial is intended to punish someone who is guilty of a crime, while a civil trial is intended to right the wrongs committed by one private individual or business by compensating the victim for their losses.Criminal law uses the concepts of guilt and innocence, while civil law relies on the concepts of negligence and liability. A civil defendant may be found liable for a plaintiff's damages as a result of an accident, without the plaintiff having to prove the defendant intended to cause the injuries or losses.
In contrast, most criminal offenses require the prosecution to prove the defendant acted with some level of intent. To a certain degree, it is that intent that is punished – not necessarily the commission of the act itself. This is why proving stronger levels of intent results in greater punishment for the defendant.

Write the name of the case.,
Identify where the case was published.,
Place the year the case was decided in parentheses.,
Include conditional items.,
Add parenthetical information.",How to Cite Legal Research1," A legal citation to a court case begins with the title of the case itself, as it appears in the case reporter you're using. Generally, you should only use last names or business names.Don't include the phrase ""et al."" to indicate there is more than one party to the suit.
Italicize the phrases ""In re."" or ""ex rel."" If the reporter says ""on behalf of,"" or ""for the use of,"" change that to ""ex rel."" If the reporter says ""In the matter of"" or ""Petition of,"" use ""In re."" in your citation.
Table 6 of the Bluebook contains abbreviations that must be used. Any words in the name of the case that are listed on that table should be abbreviated according to that table.
Generally, omit the word ""the"" from the beginning of a case name.
Abbreviate states unless they are parties. Then you must spell them out. If you're referencing a state case, just use ""State"" or ""Commonwealth."" However, if it's a federal case and the state is a party, use just the name of the state.
For example, if you were citing a U.S. Supreme Court case, the name would be ""Virginia v. Smith,"" not ""The Commonwealth of Virginia v. Mary Smith."" However, if the case was a Virginia Supreme Court case, the name would be ""Commonwealth v. Smith.""
If you're citing the case within the text rather than in a footnote, the case name should be italicized. In court documents such as briefs or motions, the case name typically is underlined.;
, Place a comma after the name of the case and follow it with the volume number of the case reporter, the name of the case reporter, and the page number on which the case begins.For U.S. Supreme Court opinions, you must use the U.S. reporter. The abbreviation is ""U.S."" with no spaces.
For Federal Court of Appeals cases, use F., F.2d, or F.3d, with no spaces. Federal District Court decisions normally are cited from ""F. Supp."" Note that there is a space between the abbreviations.
The volume number of the reporter is the first number after the comma following the case name. Then type the name of the reporter, followed by a space, followed by the page number on which the case starts.
If you are citing a particular page of the case rather than the case as a whole, put a comma after the first page of the case, add a space, and then put the page number of your pinpoint cite.
For example, at this point your citation might look something like this: ""Virginia v. Smith, 60 F.2d 313, 327.""
If the material you are citing covers several pages, provide the first and last page of the excerpt with a hyphen between them: ""Virginia v. Smith, 60 F.2d 313, 327-30."" Note that you should only use the last two digits of the ending page if the first is identical.

, Follow the page numbers with a space, then put the year of the case in parentheses. The name of the court that decided the case also should be included in parentheses, if it isn't obvious from the reporter used.For example, the United States Reports only includes U.S. Supreme Court cases. So if your citation is to a Supreme Court case published in the U.S. Reports, you can just use the year, like so: ""Virginia v. Smith, 24 U.S. 283, 287 (1982).""
For federal Court of Appeals cases, you must provide the circuit. If you're citing a federal District Court case, identify the district. If the court is the highest court in the state, you would include the state abbreviation. Put a space after the court identification, then the year the case was decided.
At this point, a federal Court of Appeals citation would look something like this: ""Virginia v. Smith, 60 F.2d 313, 327 (2d Cir. 1979).""

, If you're not citing a majority opinion, or if anything happened to the case after the decision you're citing, this should be included next, using the explanatory phrases and abbreviations included in Table 8 of the Bluebook.Descriptions having to do with the case itself are included in parentheses. For example, if the opinion had no author, you might put ""(per curiam)"" after the year, with a space between the parentheses, such as ""Virginia v. Smith, 24 U.S. 283, 287 (1982) (per curiam).
To add procedural history – that is, something that happened to the case after the opinion you're citing that may affect the authority of that particular case – put a comma after the parentheses, then a space, then write the applicable phrase.
Keep in mind that the explanatory phrase should be italicized and followed by a comma. For example, suppose the federal appeals court decision you are citing was affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court. Your citation would look like this: ""Virginia v. Smith, 60 F.2d 313, 327 (2d Cir. 1979), aff'd, 24 U.S. 283 (1982).""

, After all of the citation information, you may feel it necessary to add some information in parentheses that explains specifically why you're citing that case, or what importance it has to your own argument.This information is never necessary, but you should consider adding it if you think it would enhance the citation for the reader.
One circumstance where it arguably is necessary is if, in the portion of the case you're citing, the judge is paraphrasing or citing another case.
Parenthetical information typically is a phrase beginning with a gerund, such as ""(holding cupcakes are form of self-expression protected by the First Amendment)."" If you're using such a phrase, there are no capitals, and the phrase is not italicized.
In other instances, you may want to draw the reader's attention to a particular passage in the opinion. Put that in parentheses with quotes around it. For example, you might write ""(""Words written in icing are entitled to no less protection than words written in pen..."").""

, Your major or concentration can be in any subject, as law schools do not require a particular set of undergraduate courses for admission. Thus, you can choose between a BA, BS, BBA, or other degree.


Choose a degree in a subject you like. Then, you are more likely to earn good grades, receive good preparation, and get to know professors who can write strong letters of recommendation for you when you apply to law school.
At the same time, choose courses that will challenge you to think critically, write well, and learn to do research—all skills that will serve you well in law school and afterwards.
Whatever degree you choose, good preparation includes courses in English, philosophy, history, government, economics, and sociology.Work hard to earn high grades as an undergraduate. The average student admitted to law schools in Canada has an undergraduate GPA above 3.5 on a 4.0 scale, and at the most selective schools, the average GPA hovers around 3.9., The LSAT is held four times a year. There are five 35-minute sections of multiple-choice answers on the test, as well as a writing section. The test is designed to evaluate your reading, analytical, and logical skills.The LSAT is scored on a scale of 120 to 180. The average student admitted to a law school in Canada has an LSAT score of 160 or above.Scoring well on the test is important for admission to law school. You can take the LSAT several times in an effort to improve your score, but find out if the school(s) you are applying to look at the lowest score, highest score, or an average.Many students take the LSAT the summer after their third year of a university degree program, or during the first term of their fourth year.
You can take an LSAT Prep course. Many prep courses have a fee, but you may be able to find a free course or a fee waiver You can also do self-study exercises to prepare for the test. A free sample test and sample exercises are available from the Law School Admissions Council (LSAC), which administers the LSAT., Quebec law is based on French Civil law, while law in the other provinces and territories is based on English common law. Practically speaking, you will need to train in the kind of law applicable to where you want to practice as a lawyer. , In addition to your GPA and LSAT score, law school admissions councils may consider your academic record and course selection, work experience, and volunteer efforts, and other elements.Personal statements are typically required as part of law school applications. These are a chance to show off your writing skills, and to explain your personal, academic, and professional motivations.
Letters of recommendation are also required for many applications. Depending on the school you are applying to, these will consist of academic references from professors who know you, non-academic references, or a mix.Give your letter writers plenty of time to write a recommendation for you--let them know you need one months ahead of time, if you can. Not only is this courteous, it also gives them time to write the strongest letter they can to support you.
Each law school may weigh each aspect of your dossier differently. The LSAC provides information on how each school evaluates applicants.You can use this information to help you choose schools that seem like a good fit for you.

, Choose schools based on a variety of factors that depend on your needs, interests, and preparation.


In making your choice, consider things like: school size, location, and prestige, the cost of attendance, availability of financial aid, job placement statistics, the types of students that attend, and whether or not it includes courses in French.
In addition, you should compare the profile of admitted students at each school against your own application dossier (including LSAT score, undergraduate GPA, record of accomplishments, personal statements, and letters of recommendation) to decide which schools are most likely to admit you. Some schools offer special programs that you may want to consider, including programs combining law and social work, law and business, and dual J.D. and Ph.D degrees.
Pay attention to application deadlines for law schools, which are usually in the fall of each year.

, (juris doctor). You will begin with introductory courses in the first year, learning the basics of legal research and writing. In your second and third years, you will take more courses based on your interests and potential areas of specialization.First-year courses are typically compulsory and cover subjects like contracts, criminal law, and legal writing.
First-year students are sometimes required to participate in ""moot court,"" where you practice running a mock trial.You may choose from specializations including environmental law, patent law, corporate law, and many others.
Courses in law often utilize the ""case method,"" in which you are asked to understand the implications of judicial opinions drawn from a variety of perspectives.Your law professor will ask questions that probe students' ability think critically about legal situations, so you will need to be prepared to participate.

, Even if you excelled as an undergraduate student, law school can feel very demanding. Developing strong study habits will help you stay on top of a grueling course load and competitive atmosphere.


Exams are very important in courses at law school. Often, grades in a course are determined solely on an exam given at the end of the semester.Joining a study group can be a way to find support, although maintaining a group takes diligence., This will give you opportunities to network and gain experience, which is invaluable when it comes time to finding a job.


Seek out opportunities to participate in legal aid or interning to do legal research for private practices and government.Writing for your school's law review can also provide tangible experience, bolster your professional credentials, and impress potential employers.

, Articling, or working for a licensed and practicing law professional, will give you valuable legal experience. After receiving your J.D., you are required to article for a time in order to become certified to practice law.

, As difficult as it is to achieve, earning a legal degree is not enough to practice as a lawyer; you must also become licensed. The bar association of each province has a particular set of requirements for you to become certified to practice. The bar examination itself is offered three times a year. It tests your knowledge in several practice areas. There are two parts: the Barrister examination tests your knowledge of public law, criminal procedure, family law, and civil litigation; the Solicitor examination tests your knowledge of real estate law, business law, wills, trust, and estate administration. Each part is about seven hours long.

, You may work for a private practice, or for public legal services. How long you are obligated to article for depends on the province, but it ranges from several months up to a year.


In Ontario, you may instead complete the Law Society of Upper Canada’s Law Practice Program (LPP), which consists of four months each of training and work placement. , Your options include private practice, public service, government, business, and other sectors.


Jobs at prestigious law firms or government departments are highly sought after and can be hard to come by. Don't overlook openings with small firms and local governments. You can also look for relevant non-attorney work, such as a job as a legal clerk. Such positions can provide valuable experience and get your foot in the door with a potential employer, in case a position as an attorney opens up., Networking, as in many fields, can be critical for finding a job as a lawyer.


Experience articling, volunteering, or interning is a great way to make contacts in the world of law, and can sometimes lead directly to a job.
If you feel like your network is too small, you can try informational interviews. Even if a firm isn't hiring, you can ask to meet with attorneys to find out about their practice, and develop contacts in the process. In general, think of every time you meet a legal professional as an opportunity to network.
Don't overlook the importance of your social media presence. Potential employers will notice how you are presented online. Make sure you display yourself professionally. Think of your online identity as an extension of your personal ""brand"" as a lawyer.

, The job search might take a while, and a lot of effort. Be confident while you are searching, and concentrate on developing your experience and expertise any way you can.

Write the name of the act.,
Include the volume and name of the code.,
Indicate the section referenced.,
Add the date of the code.",How to Cite Legal Research2," The official name of a statute isn't strictly necessary, but should be included if the statute is commonly called that, or if it makes it easier for your readers to identify. If you do include the name of the act, it should be listed first in your statutory citation.If you do include the title of the law, there is no special formatting such as italics required.
If the law you're referencing is spread out over several sections of the code, you should cite to the session law instead of a code section if you intend to cite the entire law. The session law is the law itself as it was enacted by the legislative body, before it was recorded into the legislative code.
This situation may occur if you are referencing a law such as The Patriot Act, which amended many other laws already on the books.

, A statutory code is a compilation of laws enacted by a particular legislative body, such as a state legislature or the U.S. Congress. These volumes are similar to case reporters that contain court decisions.For example, you would cite a federal law by writing ""28 U.S.C.,"" which indicates the volume (28) of the U.S. Code (U.S.C.) where the law is located.
Table 1 of the Bluebook lists the approved code compilations for state laws and their abbreviations.
While there are official code compilations, there also are code compilations published by the legal publishers LexisNexis and West. If you are using one of these code compilations, this should be indicated accordingly.

, After you've written the name or abbreviation of the code compilation in which the statute appears, put a space and indicate the particular section with the information you're citing.Use a ""§"" before the number to stand for ""Section.""
If you are referencing multiple sections, this should be indicated by ""§§."" If you intend to reference several sections together in a series, connect the first and last section with a hyphen. To indicate a reference to two or more separate sections, put the section numbers separated by a comma and a space.
An example of multiple sections in a series would be ""28 U.S.C. §§ 402-407."" In contrast, multiple sections not in series would look like this: ""28 U.S.C. §§ 402, 409."" You also can combine the two methods, for example: ""28 U.S.C. §§ 402-407, 409.""

, At the end of your statutory citation, put the date the code volume was published – not the date the statute itself was enacted – in parentheses.The purpose of this date is to allow your readers to find the same edition of the law that you used in your work.
You can find the date you need by looking at the spine of the volume, the volume's title page, or the volume's copyright information. You should check these places for the year in that order. In other words, if the date isn't on the spine, check the title page. If you can't find the date on the title page, check the copyright information.
Keep in mind that even if you're looking at a statute online, you technically should check the bound volume to find the information necessary for your citation. Compare the online text to the text in the volume to make sure you have the correct volume and the two versions are identical before citing.

Write the volume number.,
Provide the full name of the author.,
Include the full title of the book.,
Indicate the portion of the book you are referencing.,
Put the edition and year of publication in parentheses.",How to Cite Legal Research3," Legal treatises often are multi-volume affairs, and require you to include the volume number in which the material appears that you are referencing. Regular books typically won't have this information.The volume number is not followed by any punctuation such as a period or a comma. Rather, you simply type the volume number, then a space, then begin the next part of the citation, which will be the name of the author.

, The Bluebook requires the author's entire name, written just as you would write it in text – first name, middle initial, last name – rather than with the last name written first as in some other citation style guides.If there is more than one author, connect their names with an ampersand. For more than two authors, you typically would only use the first author's name followed by the phrase ""et al.""
However, include the other authors' names if they are somehow significant. For example, if you are citing a book during the course of your argument that Judge John J. Jameson, Jr. wrote extensively about cupcake decency laws and their implications on freedom of speech, you would want to include his name in your citation of a book he co-authored on the subject, even if he was the third author listed.
If the author is a business or institution rather than a person, simply write the name of that entity where you would normally cite the author's name.

, After the name of the author, put a comma and a space and then write the full title of the book, either underlined or in italics.All words in a title other than articles, prepositions, and conjunctions should be capitalized.
There is no punctuation following the title of the book.

, For a regular book, you typically would would write the page number or numbers where the material you want to cite is located. Some legal treatises are organized in sections, so you should cite the section rather than the page number.Cite to sections using the symbol ""§"" for a single section or ""§§"" for multiple sections.
If you're citing to a series of pages, the page numbers should be connected by a hyphen. If the first of three or more digits are repeating, only the last two digits are needed for the last page in the series, such as in ""Cupcakes and First Amendment Freedom of Expression 290-95.""
If you are citing to multiple pages not in series, separate the page numbers with commas. You also can cite a series of pages and a single other page.
To cite a footnote appearing on a particular page (or in a particular section), put a comma after the page (or section) number, add a space, and type ""n."" followed by the footnote number.
There is no punctuation following the page number citations in Bluebook citation format.

, If there are multiple editions of the book, you must indicate the one you used. If there's just one edition of the book, all you need is the year in which it was published.The year of publication typically can be found either on the book's title page or within the book's copyright information.
A full citation of a book might look something like this example: John J. Jameson, Jr. Cupcakes and First Amendment Freedom of Expression 290-95 (2005).

Write the full name of the author.,
Provide the title of the article.,
List the name of the periodical and the page number on which the article appears.,
Include the year or date of publication.,
Add descriptive information if necessary.",How to Cite Legal Research4," A citation to a periodical article, whether in a law journal, magazine, or some other publication, starts with the full name of the author, written in order of his or her first name, middle initial, and last name.Include any suffixes, such as ""Jr."" However, omit any initials or titles used to indicate degrees or affiliations, such as ""Dr."" or ""Ph.D.""
If there are two authors, list them in the order listed on the article, connected by an ampersand.
If there are more than two authors, you can cite them using the name of the first author followed by ""et al."" You also can list all authors if you choose to do so, or if the names of all authors carry some significance.
Institutional authors should be listed using the same rules, such as if the article has a company or educational institution listed as the author rather than an individual person.
Do not reduce middle names to middle initials unless that is how they appear in the article itself.

, After the author's name, put a comma and a space and then write the full title of the article you wish to cite. The article's title typically is underlined in court documents such as briefs or motions.All words should be capitalized, except articles, conjunctions, or prepositions, unless these are the first word in the title or the first word that follows a colon.
Do not omit words or abbreviate any words in the title.

, How you format the name of the periodical depends to some extent on what sort of periodical it is. Law journals typically begin with a volume number, then the name of the journal, then the first page on which the article appears.If the periodical is a law review or journal, its name should be abbreviated using the rules in Table 13 of the Bluebook.
How you format the page number depends on the way the periodical itself is paginated. Many law journals use consecutive pagination – while there may be four issues of a single volume, the volume starts with page one in the first issue and the pages continue in order for each issue.
In other words, the journal doesn't start over with page one at the beginning of each issue, as most magazines and other periodicals do.
If the periodical uses consecutive pagination, you simply follow the name of the periodical with the page number, as in ""12 Case W. L. Rev. 392.""
For periodicals that do not use consecutive pagination, but instead start page numbers over with each issue, the page number on which the article appears should follow the date of the periodical and be preceded by the word ""at,"" as in ""National Geographic, Mar. 2005, at 17.""

, The next portion of a periodical citation is the date of publication, although the format differs depending on whether the publication uses consecutive pagination.For periodicals that use consecutive pagination, you will place the year of publication in parentheses immediately following the page numbers.
If you're citing a periodical, such as a magazine, without consecutive pagination, the date of the issue should be included between commas before the page number.
The citation for periodicals with consecutive pagination looks like, and follows many of the same rules, as a citation to a judicial opinion. You start with the volume number, then the name of the journal, then the page number where the article starts. If you're providing a pinpoint citation to a particular page, add a comma and a space and then follow with that information.

, If you want to add a parenthetical description that explains the significance of the article or provides additional information regarding the reason you cited it, you can include this information in parentheses following the citation itself.As with a citation to a judicial opinion, you can add parenthetical information that assists your reader in understanding why you cited a particular article, or what relationship it has to your text.
These descriptions typically are written as phrases beginning with a gerund such as ""stating"" or ""arguing.""
You also can provide a brief quote or beginning of a quote from the text, particularly if you want to point your reader to specific language in the article.

, Prior to applying to law school, you will need to take the LSAT, which is a standardized test that law schools will use to evaluate your suitability for the study of law. It tests your reading comprehension, analytical reasoning, and logical reasoning capabilities.The test is administered on several dates in June, October, December, and February and costs $175.The test consists of five 35-minute sections of multiple-choice questions, along with a 35-minute writing section., After you take and pass the LSAT, you will need to gain admission to a law school approved by the ABA.To apply, you will complete and fill out an application to the law school(s) of your choice, and submit along with your application your LSAT score, resume, undergraduate transcript(s), letters of recommendation, and a personal statement (along with an application fee).You do not need to attend a law school located in New York state in order to practice law there.

, After being accepted at a law school, you will need to attend, complete the course of study, and graduate with a J.D. (Juris Doctor) degree.A J.D. program usually requires three years to complete, and is quite expensive.


The New York State Bar requires that, after you begin law school, you complete your studies in 24 to 60 months.You also must complete at least 83 semester hours of study prior to graduation, 64 of which must come from classroom study and two of which must come from a course in professional responsibility., After you graduate from law school, you will need to take two tests to become an attorney: (1) the MPRE and (2) the New York State Bar Exam. The first of these—the MPRE—measures your knowledge of the rules relating to a lawyer's professional conduct and consists of a two-hour, 60-question multiple-choice test.The test is administered three times a year and costs $84.You must achieve a score of at least 85 in order to practice law in New York., The second test you will have to pass in order to become an attorney in New York is the New York State Bar Exam. This test is offered on the last Tuesday and Wednesday of every February and July, and you must apply in November for the February exam and in April for the July exam.The application fee is $250.


The bar application is quite lengthy, and requires you to provide a lot of information. Make sure you leave yourself adequate time to complete it and assemble required documentation.
You can apply online to take the bar exam., The test is administered over two days. On Tuesday (the first day), you will be tested on New York law, which consists of five essay questions, 50 multiple-choice questions, and a written multistate performance test that measures your practical legal ability. On Wednesday (the second day), you will take the Multistate Bar Exam, which consists of 200 multiple-choice questions and is part of every state's bar exam.You will need a final total weighted scaled score of 665 in order to pass the bar exam.Otherwise, you will have to retake the test.

, Before you can apply for admission to the New York Bar, you must perform 50 hours of law-related services aimed at improving access to justice for low-income or otherwise-disadvantaged individuals.Some examples of this type of service include:Helping a low-income individual fill out legal forms.
Helping disadvantaged litigants prepare to appear in court.
Assisting an attorney with trial preparation for a low-income or disadvantaged individual.

, After you take and pass both the MPRE and the New York State Bar Exam, you will be officially certified for admission in one of the four judicial departments in New York, based on your address.The State Board of Bar Examiners sends your name and address to the judicial department (there are four in total) that corresponds with your address.You will need to complete and fill out the application package for your particular judicial department and submit it along with any required documentation.Part of the application is a character & fitness evaluation, in which you will be required to provide extensive information regarding your personal background, including employment and criminal history., After you have been certified for admission following a successful bar exam, completed the application package for your judicial department, and passed the character & fitness review, you must register with the New York Unified Court System and pay a fee of $375.You will need to renew your registration (and pay an additional $375) every two years, within 30 days of your birthday, in order to continue to be properly licensed to practice law in New York., After you have completed all of the above requirements, the final step to becoming an attorney in New York is to take the oath of office, which is administered in public court, and sign a public record for newly admitted attorneys.In taking this oath, you are agreeing to uphold both state/federal law and state/federal constitutions in addition to maintaining the professional standards of a public officer of the courts of the State of New York.After taking this oath, you will be licensed to practice law in New York.

, Newly licensed attorneys in New York are required to complete a minimum of 32 hours of of CLE courses by the second anniversary of their admission to the New York Bar (16 during the first year, 16 during the second).Each 16-hour period must contain: 3 hours in ethics/professionalism, 6 hours in skills, and 7 hours in law-practice management or areas of professional practice.Following this, all attorneys are required to complete 24 hours of CLE courses every two years (coinciding with the biennial registration-renewal requirement), at least four of which devoted to professionalism/ethics., Throughout your career in law school you will have various opportunities to partake in on campus interviews (OCIs). During OCIs, your law school will invite employers from New York, the rest of the country, and the rest of the world to your school to interview students.These opportunities are often open to second and third year students, but some first year students may be able to apply.


To take part in these interviews, you will generally submit resumes, transcripts, cover letters, recommendations, and writing samples to your school's administration so they can review them. Once they have been approved, your materials will be available for you to use when you apply. You will choose the jobs you want to apply for and submit your materials to those employers. If you are chosen for an interview the employer will contact you or the school directly.

, An informational interview is an informal conversation with someone in the field you are looking to break in to. These interviews are great networking opportunities and can lead to job offers you did not even know were available. To conduct a successful informational interview:


Research possible career fields. Before you begin, think about what you want to do. If you are interested in corporate law, look up some corporate firms in New York as well as businesses with in-house counsel. If you are interested in government law, look up a government agency you think would be a good fit.
identify people to interview. Once you know what you want to do, research possible interviewees and log their contact information. You can pursue your own contacts, ask your friends and family for possible contacts, or you can call organizations directly and ask for their staff attorney.
Prepare for the interview. Before you contact the people you have found, you will want to develop a short introduction about yourself and why you are calling. Prepare as if the individual will want to conduct the informational interview on the spot.
Make contact. Make a phone call or send a formal email and introduce yourself. Mention how you found their name and why you are calling. Be sure you tell them you are looking for a conversation only and you are not expecting a job. Ask if the person has any time available to meet in person for about 30 minutes. Be prepared to conduct the interview if the person says they are available at that moment.
Conduct the interview. When your time comes, sit don with the person and begin the interview. Be sure you introduce yourself again and reiterate your reason for meeting. Give the person a brief idea of who you are, your educational background, and your career goals. Ask open-ended questions about the person's career and how they got where they are. Importantly, ask if they have any other contacts or people they could refer you to. Be sure you listen and take notes if you need to.
Follow-up. A day or two after your interview, follow-up with the person and thank them for their time. Keep in touch with the person and let them know how you utilized the information they gave you., A lot of job opportunities are posted online and you should utilize this resource whenever possible. Do a search online for ""legal jobs in New York"" or something related to that. Visit New York state, city, and county websites as well to look for jobs. When you find a job posting, read it carefully and submit all required documents on time. Be sure you follow-up with the employer and let them know you are interested.

, If you are having trouble finding a job, try to work alongside experienced attorneys in New York. Oftentimes attorneys who have their own practice will be happy to share space and costs with you. If you are willing to pay rent in order to share an office, other attorneys may be happy to let you in. If you find an attorney willing to take you in, ask if they have any overflow cases you can work on. This can be a great way to gain experience and to network with other lawyers. Look for small boutique firms online and give them a call.

, When you are really desperate to get started in the legal field, you may have to offer your legal services for free. A lot of jobs are looking for attorneys with years of experience, and one way to get great experience is to volunteer. If you find a firm you really want to work for, or an attorney you would really like to work with, call them and see if they need any extra help. Let them know you are willing to work for free if you need to. If you find a volunteer opportunity, treat it as if you are getting paid. These opportunities may lead to paying jobs so you want to show off your skills and abilities.

Review bylaws regularly and keep them current.",How to Write Bylaws," Bylaws are an organization’s written rules. Bylaws are important because they can help resolve problems or conflicts that arise. For example, if you have difficulty with an officer of the organization, then you can read the bylaws to see what steps you are authorized to take. Bylaws can also cover the following:the organization’s name
the organization’s purpose
membership requirements
the titles and responsibilities of officers
how officers are assigned
how meetings will be conducted and when they will be held;
, To start, it is necessary to consult with most or all members who helped to start an organization. Pull in at least two or three other people to give input and help write the bylaws.


If you are starting a non-profit organization, for example, you will need a board of directors who will then give input and help write the bylaws. Working as a team ensures that all perspectives will be represented and accounted for in the bylaws.
Try to make sure that the bylaw committee reflects an accurate cross-section of your organization.Do not tilt it too heavily with people from one section of the organization or one level of the organization’s hierarchy.

, To properly draft bylaws, you need to understand the organization: its purpose, how officers will advance that purpose, and the future of the organization. To gather this information, meet with all members of the organization and talk about how they envision the organizations’ purpose and what jobs will be necessary to make that purpose a reality.


You also want your bylaws to be consistent with other core documents, such as your articles of incorporation, governance policies, and any other documents that reflect how the organization is operated. Gather those documents as you prepare to draft the bylaws.
In particular, make sure the number of board positions and position descriptions are the same on all documents. Make sure too that the meeting days are the same, along with other minor details. If you are affiliated with another entity, such as a state department of education or similar, you should confirm that your bylaws are consistent with that entity’s expectations and requirements., Try to find bylaws for organization similar to yours. You should never simply copy them, but they can serve as a useful guide when drafting your own.Call organizations like yours and ask if you can see a copy of their bylaws.

, Consulting with a lawyer who specializes in non-profits can be useful in making sure that your bylaws cover the necessary ground. An attorney can also make sure your bylaws harmonize with your state’s non-profit law. Non-profit laws may contain prohibitions, such as limitations on proxy voting, and you should be aware of these before drafting your bylaws.Any bylaw article that violates your state’s non-profit law will be void.


You can find an experienced attorney who specializes in non-profits by visiting your state’s bar association, which should run a referral service.
If costs are a concern, you may be able to get help from a pro bono organization in your area. Legal aid organizations typically help indigent individuals, but many also help non-profit organizations. You can search for legal aid organizations by visiting this website.

, Bylaws are typically written with section headings called “articles” and paragraphs called “sections.” This structure will make your bylaws more readable and standardized with other bylaws. This format also facilitates finding information on voting rules, committees, and other elements you may have questions about as the organization gets going., These headings will be in all capital bold letters and numbered with Roman numerals. Center this heading on the page.


For example, the first article would be titled: ARTICLE I: ORGANIZATION. The second article would be titled: ARTICLE II: PURPOSE.

, For each section in every article, number them clearly and give a one- to two-word descriptor of the section.


For example, you might write: Section 1. Regular Meetings. This would be followed by a brief description of the protocol for regular meetings. Then you’d write: Section 2: Special Meetings. This would be followed by a brief description of protocol for special meetings., Bylaws are legal documents, so you want to sound professional. When looking at a bylaws template or sample, study the language they use. Keep an appropriate tone and use understandable vocabulary.


Although bylaws are legal documents, you do not need to use obscure “legalese.” Instead, you should use simple language that is easy to understand.Keep details for policies, not the bylaws. The bylaws are the guidelines with which to implement specific policies. Therefore, the bylaws should be flexible and able to be interpreted in conjunction with more detailed policies. Keep the bylaws fairly general.

, Many templates and other instructions regarding writing bylaws are intentionally general so that they can be tailored to your organization. Your organization might have specific needs that require certain elements that other organizations do not.



Writing church bylaws: A church’s bylaws will include a section about the congregation’s minister. This section would address the minister’s relationship to the congregation, the qualifications the minister should have, and the process for bringing on a new minister or dismissing the current one.Sample language might start out with: “The Minister is the religious and spiritual leader of the church. He or she shall have freedom of the pulpit and of speech. The Minister is an ex official member of the Board and of all committees, except the Nominating Committee.” Writing corporate bylaws: For corporate bylaws, you might also include sections that address frequency of shareholder meetings, issues pertaining to company stock, and so on., This is a brief statement that identifies the official name of your organization. You can also give the primary operating location of your office in this article. If your organization is not physically fixed to a location (if you are a primarily online group, for example), you do not need to include an address.


You might write in this section: “The name of the organization shall be the ABC Elementary PTO.”, This article will include your mission statement and vision for the organization. This can be a fairly basic one-sentence statement. You can make it more complex, if you so choose.


Sample language might read: “The organization is organized for the purpose of supporting the education of children at ABC Elementary by fostering relationships among the school, parents, and teachers.”, This article will address several sections, including eligibility (who can become a member and how), dues (do members need to pay a fee to join? Do they need to pay a fee annually?), classes of members (active, inactive), requirements for how to remain a member, and how to withdraw from membership.Sample language for the first section under the Membership heading might read: “Membership is open to all who sympathize with the church's purposes and programs, regardless of race, creed, gender, sexual orientation, age, national origin, and mental or physical challenge.”Continue with subsequent sections describing dues, requirements for remaining a member, and how to withdraw from the organization.

, This article will address several sections pertaining to officers, including listing each office, the duties related to each office, how officers are nominated and elected, terms of office (how long they can serve in their position), and how to handle vacancies.


For example, for the first section, you might write: “The officers of the organization are a president, vice president, secretary, treasurer, and three directors.”Then you will follow this with the other sections regarding officers, providing a description of each officer’s duties, and so on.

, This article covers several sections that outline how often meetings will take place (quarterly? Semiannually?), where the meetings will take place (at the primary location of operation?), and how votes can be cast for motions.


This article also establishes the number needed for a quorum, or the number of board members who must be present for motions to be carried. If an organization has nine board members, and the bylaws require two-thirds of the board to make up a quorum, then at least six board members must be present to make decisions for the organization. Some states may require a minimum for a quorum; check with your Secretary of State to find out your state’s requirements.Sample language for the first section of this article might read: “Regular meetings of the society shall be held on the first Tuesday of each month.” Then proceed to address the other sections in the rest of this article.

, These committees are specific to your organization, but they might include a volunteer committee, publicity committee, membership committee, fundraising committee, and so on. Include a brief description of each of these committees. Follow this section with a brief description of how committees can be formed (appointed by the board of directors?).


Sample language might read: “The society shall have the following standing committees,” followed by a list and brief description of each committee that you have.

, You should specify when a budget will be created, who will be responsible for keeping financial records (usually the treasurer), how expenses are approved, and what will happen to funds should the organization dissolve.For example, you could write: “A budget shall be drafted in the summer for the following fiscal year and shall be approved by a majority vote of the Board.”
Then, you can assign to the treasurer (or another officer) responsibilities for keeping financial records: “The treasurer shall keep accurate records of any disbursements, income/credits, and bank account information.”, Parliamentary authority is the set of guidelines that govern your procedures for how your organization is run. Many organizations abide by Robert’s Rules of Order, a guide for how to run meetings in an assembly of people in order to ensure that voices are heard and taken into account.An article on parliamentary authority will also name the specific resource that guides the bylaws, procedures and operation of the organization.
Sample language might read: “Robert’s Rules of Order shall govern meetings when they are not in conflict with the organization’s bylaws.”, While the bylaws are intended to be useful and to accommodate many situations that might arise in an organization’s life, from time to time they do require amendments. You should write into the bylaws what amendment process you will use. Including an amendment process will demonstrate that your organization is flexible and understanding of change.


Do not make it too difficult to amend the bylaws. Instead, choose a process that is appropriate for the culture and politics of your organization.You can also include a section here that states your fiscal year, or you can include a separate article that states your fiscal year.
Sample language regarding amendments might read: “These bylaws may be amended or replaced at any meeting of the society by a two-thirds (2/3) vote of those present and voting. Notice of any proposed change shall be contained in the notice of the meeting.”, Your organization should protect itself against a personal or financial conflict of interest from the board of directors or other officer. Include an article that specifies what should happen if someone has a conflict of interest.


Sample language might be: “Whenever a director or officer has a financial or personal interest in any matter coming before the board of directors, the affected person shall (a) fully disclose the nature of the interest and (b) withdraw from discussion, lobbying, and voting on the matter. Any transaction or vote involving a potential conflict of interest shall be approved only when a majority of disinterested directors determine that it is in the best interest of the corporation to do so. The minutes of meetings at which such votes are taken shall record such disclosure, abstention and rationale for approval.”, Some state laws require a dissolution clause, or a statement that describes how the organization can be closed down. This can be a good idea even if your state does not require this clause, as it can help protect your organization in the event of in-fighting.


Here, you might write: “The organization may be dissolved with previous notice (14 calendar days) and a two-thirds vote of those present at the meeting.”Some states require organizations to include a dissolution clause in their bylaws. Check with your state’s Secretary of State for specific information., Use consistent formatting throughout the document and use one font and one font size (11- to 12-point font is most readable). Include a title page with the name of your organization, the date of the last revision of the bylaws, and when the bylaws go into effect.

, Your bylaws will outline procedures by which to run the organization, conduct meetings, elect officials or committee leaders, and so on. These procedures are based on rules that dictate what happens first, how many people need to vote to reach a decision, who can vote by proxy (sending in their vote instead of voting in person), etc. A professionally credentialed parliamentarian is someone who is an expert in these rules and procedures.


Parliamentarians can be found by contacting associations such as the American Institute of Parliamentariansor searching online for “professionally credentialed parliamentarian” in your state. You will likely need to pay a consulting fee for their services.

, The bylaws need to be accepted by the organization in order for them to take effect. The director of the organization generally has the authority to adopt the bylaws.Include a statement at the end of your bylaws that attests to their adoption, and include the date of adoption. The secretary of the organization should sign this statement as well.

, Some states require that bylaws are filed with the state, while other states require only periodic reporting of key personnel and financial information.Check with your Secretary of State to find out if you need to give a copy of your bylaws to your state agency.


Corporate bylaws are typically not filed with any official agency. Many states require that corporations write bylaws,but you don’t have to file them with your state. They may be shared with stockholders and other key individuals, however., Store them in a binder with your articles of incorporation, minutes of meetings, list of names and addresses of directors and other principal executives of the organization, membership records, and so on.It can be a good idea to make your bylaws easily accessible to your members by posting them on your website or having them readily available at your offices. While there is no requirement that bylaws should be publicly available, doing so could make your organization seem more accountable and transparent., Having the bylaws on-hand will be useful when you hold membership or executive meetings. Consult the bylaws when you are voting on a motion, deciding on committee or board members, or otherwise engaging in activities specifically outlined in your bylaws. Your meetings will run smoothly, and members will be reassured that their views are properly represented.

, As your organization changes, your bylaws may also need to change. The key to making the bylaws adaptable to change is to make them flexible and amendable in the beginning. For example, you can include a range of the number of board members the organization will have instead of a hard number.Then you can either amend the bylaws to accommodate minor changes, or revise the bylaws to incorporate more substantial changes.


You can make minor changes with amendments, which may cover the addition of a new committee, for example.
If you are going to revise the bylaws, you should first hold a meeting of the organization’s members in order to provide input on what the revisions should be. Give notice to your membership that you will be holding a meeting to discuss and revise the bylaws, and give them the opportunity to submit changes for consideration.
A few subcommittees should work on the revisions: one subcommittee can write the revisions, another subcommittee can check these revisions for inconsistencies, and a third subcommittee can check the revisions for spelling and grammar. Present the final revisions to the membership to vote on the changes."

For example, assume a bill is introduced in the Senate, and the subject of the bill is education, and the rules state that the Parliamentarian will choose the committee it gets referred to. If this is the case, the bill is likely to be referred to the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions., Once a bill is referred to a committee, it will be put on the committee's calendar.When a bill is up for consideration in a committee, the committee may choose to refer the bill to a subcommittee or it may choose to debate the bill itself.If a bill is passed on to a subcommittee, that subcommittee will review the bill and determine its chances of success.If a committee does not act on a bill, it will die and another bill will have to be introduced., Once a subcommittee or full committee has had a chance to review the bill, the committee or subcommittee will usually hold public hearings about the bill.At public hearings, committee members will hear oral testimony from people about the bill.After the public hearings are done, the committee or subcommittee will take part in what is known as the ""mark-up session.""During the mark-up session, committee members will look at the bill, the testimony, and any other information they have, and they will amend the bill if they feel it is necessary., Once a bill has been reviewed and marked up, the committee or subcommittee will vote on the bill.A committee may vote to table a bill or report it.If a committee votes to table a bill, that means the committee will take no further action on the bill and it will not be referred along.If this happens, the bill will die and a new bill will have to be introduced.
If a committee votes to report a bill, a Committee Report will be written.A Committee Report describes the purpose and scope of the bill and the reasons for recommended approval., Once a bill has been reported, it will be put on the Senate or House calendar, depending on where the bill originated.When a bill's date comes, the bill will be introduced to the entire chamber of the legislature where the bill originated, and that chamber will debate the bill., Once a bill has been debated in one of the chambers of the legislature, that chamber will vote on the bill.After the vote, the bill will either have passed or been defeated.If a bill is defeated, it will be considered dead and a new bill will have to be introduced.
If a bill is approved, it will be referred to the other chamber of Congress.

, Once a bill is referred to the other chamber of Congress, the entire process discussed above will be repeated, this time in the other chamber.If, after the process is completed, the bill is defeated, the bill will be considered dead and a new bill will have to be introduced.
If, after the process is completed, the bill is approved, it will be sent to the President of the United States of America., Once a bill has been approved by both chambers of Congress, the President will have to sign the bill into law or veto the bill."

Some programs may not accept online high school diplomas either, so be sure to check with the paralegal program advisor to be sure.You may need a copy of your high school transcripts or the diploma itself.
Copies of transcripts and/or diplomas are available from your high school.;
, There are a few different options for getting an education to prepare you for a paralegal career. Shorter programs are generally intended for those who already have a degree in another field or are already working in the legal field, such as in a legal secretary position. A longer program of two to four years may be geared more toward those with no other college degree. Employers may favor baccalaureate program graduates over others, with the possible exception of post-baccalaureate program graduates. Program options include:


A two-year associate or certificate program at a community college.
A four-year bachelor's degree program at a college or university, usually leading to a major or minor in paralegal studies.
A program from a specialized, proprietary institution leading to a certificate in paralegal studies, lasting anywhere from 3-18 months.
A post-baccalaureate program leading to a certificate in paralegal studies, generally lasting from 3-18 months.

, Some programs that are available that are at an accelerated pace, completed solely online, or offered by for-profit schools may not be accredited. Accreditation is granted to those programs that maintain a standard of quality that is deemed worthy of effectively preparing graduates for practice in the field.You can search to determine whether your college or university is accredited here.


The American Bar Association approves those programs in the USA that maintain this and other standards of quality.If you complete a program that is not accredited, you may have difficulty finding a job, as employers will be looking for employees with degrees from accredited institutions.

, The breadth of the coursework will vary between schools, but programs usually involve learning how to conduct legal research, introduction to legal software, and more.Many firms hiring paralegals are now seeking paralegal with specialization, especially larger firms. You may want to see if your program offers any specialization.


Not all Paralegal Studies programs are approved by the American Bar Association (ABA).Though your employer may not require that you be ABA approved, it will give you an advantage over other applicants. Check with schools in your area to determine whether the program is ABA approved.

, Writing, time management, effective communication, problem-solving, decision-making, and critical thinking skills are necessary for paralegals.These skills will serve you well in the profession, so it would be useful to develop them to the best of your ability in order to be the most desirable job candidate you can be.


Some colleges, universities, or other schools where paralegal programs are offered may also offer courses that help with the development of these kinds of professional skills.
Computer skills play an important role as well, from familiarity with office suites to web browsers and email applications.

, Many employers prefer candidates who have had at least one year of experience working in a legal environment.Find a job or internship at a law office doing administrative tasks like filing or answering telephones, or working as an assistant to other paralegals.


These kinds of jobs will not only look good on your resumé, they will also familiarize you with the legal environment and allow you to gain hands-on training from professionals in the field.

, Though paralegal certification is not required by all employers, it will give you an advantage over competing candidates. If you have already graduated with a bachelor's or associate's degree in an unrelated field, it might be a good idea for you to become a certified paralegal. The National Association of Legal Assistants (NALA) offers certification.Many other certification programs are available that are taught by practicing attorneys and give you the hands-on skills that you can apply directly to your job working as a paralegal.These programs generally last between 6-12 months.
Consider taking a certified paralegal examination. This may or may not be part of your certification program. The NALA is the main organization that offers these exams., Your resume should include a sentence-long career objective passage that explains the type of job you are seeking, including your desired specialization, unless you are interested in general practice. Be sure to include your education and experience as well, followed by a passage that lists your skills, such as computer skills—including industry-specific software applications., Once you have achieved the proper education and work experience, you can start applying to jobs. Check job listings in your area, and apply to various law firms and law offices. Send your resumé, cover letter, and any other information that the potential employer requests. Other positions may be available outside law firms, such as in corporations, real estate firms and title offices, public defense offices, non-government organizations (NGOs), and more.The paralegal profession is very competitive, so apply to as many jobs as possible and be prepared to have many different interviews before landing a job.

, Paralegals can take additional courses or attend seminars in order to advance their careers. Sign up for continuing legal education (CLE) courses in order to stay up-to-date with the ever-changing field of law., An informational interview is an informal conversation with someone working in the field you want to find a job in.The goal of an informational interview is to gain information and advice, not necessarily to find a job.However, informational interviews can lead to jobs, so take this process seriously.

, Reach out to people with the hope of setting up an informational interview. If you are looking for a job in the paralegal field, try making the following contacts:


Contact family, friends, professors, and former employers.While these people may not be in the paralegal field, they will most likely know someone who is.
Try calling organizations and law firms directly.While this may feel awkward at first, it is important to put yourself out there and get out of your comfort zone. Law firms and paralegal services get these types of phone calls every day; they know how to handle them and they are usually happy to entertain an informational interview.
Read newspapers and magazines (or their internet equivalents) to learn about companies that may be out there.Find a company that interests you and reach out.
Contact professional associations.For example, contact the National Federation of Paralegal Associations or the Association of Legal Assistants.

, Once you have an idea of who you would like to contact, you will need to plan for the interview.Start by developing a short introductory statement about yourself, including your background and interests.Follow-up your introduction with a series of open-ended questions. These questions should get the contact talking about their professional experience and the ideas they may have about potential jobs. For example, ask how they got their first paralegal job and who they worked for. If it is a local organization, ask for the organization's contact information and if you can use them as a reference.

, Once you have planned for your informational interview, you should contact the person by phone.Tell them how you found their information and introduce yourself.Ask them if they have a few minutes to talk and be sure to emphasize you are not looking for a job.Ask if there is a convenient time for them to have a sit-down, but be prepared to ask your questions on the spot if the person says they have time now on the phone., If you set up a time to meet face-to-face, go to your informational meeting and be there early.Dress professionally and conduct the conversation as if it were an interview.Give the brief interview of yourself and then begin with your questions.Let the conversation flow naturally and try and take notes.Most importantly, be sure to ask for names and contacts of people that may have job openings or that might be willing to talk with you.After all, this is the reason you are there.

, Once the interview is completed and one or two days have passed, send a thank-you note thanking them for the time and information.Utilize the information you received and reach out to the new contacts you made.


Be sure you stay in touch with the person you have the informational interview with.It is important to show them that you are taking their input seriously and that you are following up on their advice."

Pick the right major.,
Focus on your GPA.,
Integrate extracurricular activities.,
Take an internship.,
Mind the timeline.",How to Get Into Law School1," Unlike medical school, there are no prerequisites for law school so choosing a major can be particularly tough. In fact, The American Bar Association itself does not recommend any undergraduate majors or group of courses to prepare for a legal education and says so on its web site. Choose a major with a higher degree of law school acceptance. Consider majoring in philosophy, economics or journalism--in a recent review of data from the Law School Admissions Council (LSAC) those majors have a high rate of acceptance.
Think twice about prelaw. While the name seems to suggest that it would be a good path to follow on your way to law school, not everyone agrees. Check to see how much of the coursework in the prelaw program at the school you're considering seems related to the work you'll do in law school.
Undergraduate majors that involve lots of reading and stress critical thinking offer good foundations for law school. Critical thinking, logic, and good writing skills are crucial to success in law.
Don't just pick a major because it sounds like a law school will approve of your choices. Many different undergraduate majors feed well into law, and the fact that you're passionate about something can and will show up in the way you portray your experiences.;
, Getting the best possible grades is essential for a strong law school application. Whatever major you choose, focus on excelling in all of your classes.


The median GPA for law school acceptance is 3.42. Higher tier schools have much more rigorous requirements. For example, the median GPA for acceptance to Yale Law School is 3.9, Harvard is 3.89 and Stanford 3.85.
Start strong. Since a good GPA is so important, plan to work on your grades right away. Attend classes regularly, set aside ample time to read and study and if you need help, work with a tutor.
GPA isn't the only consideration for law school acceptance, but it's extremely important and should be your main focus during your undergraduate years.
Whether or not you do take on graduate school (before or during your law degree), your undergraduate GPA still matters. Law schools look at everything - be prepared.

, While good grades are essential, you want to present yourself as a well-rounded candidate, so plan to get involved in some extracurricular activities.


Get involved right away. Admissions committees will want to know how long you have been involved in each activity and what meaningful contributions you've made. If you wait until senior year to join a group, it may be perceived as a move you're making purely to increase your chances of acceptance rather than an involvement that sprang from a genuine passion or interest.Limit the number of groups you join. The depth of your involvement is much more important than the number of activities in which you are involved. Explore all of your options--affinity clubs, intramural sports, service organizations--then commit to two or three that you really connect with.
Keep track of your hours of involvement because the applications often ask you to specify how many hours you spent on each activity per week.


Consider larger, more established organizations. Many prestigious nonprofits, like UNICEF and Habitat for Humanity, have college chapters on campuses all over the country.Take on a role in student government or on a school publication (newspaper or journal). These are highly valued by law school admission's committees. Secure a leadership position. Whatever organization you choose to become involved in, be sure to step up and take a leadership role. It's essential that you be seen as someone who can take charge, manage multiple responsibilities and people and achieve results.
Again, don't just pick something because it sounds good. Get involved and get passionate about something because you can, as these areas of interest can also be considered by law firms as you're looking for a job later.

, Working as an intern can help familiarize you with life in a law firm or other relevant business, give you valuable skills and introduce you to professionals whose advice and guidance can benefit you.


You don't have to intern at a law office. Look for internships in related fields such as government, community activism or journalism. A law firm internship may sound great, but if all you did was answer phones and make coffee it won't give you much to talk about on your applications.
Search for internships online or at your school. There a lots of sites that list internship openings, and the career guidance office at your university should also have listings that you can use.
Plan ahead. Internship positions fill quickly. Apply for summer positions in the winter; submit applications for fall and spring term positions at least one semester in advance.
If you cannot afford to go unpaid, try for a part-time or summer job in an area that you're interested in. Law schools do want applicants who have experience, but they do understand that not everyone can afford to get it for free. In the same vein, search for stipends and programs that have extra time allotted, so that you can get the experience while not going into debt preemptively. These are great experiences to learn if something is really right for you, but don't close other doors in the process.

, If there's one piece of advice that merits attention when it comes to getting into law school, it's the importance of planning ahead. Not only must you be thinking about grades, activities and internships right from the start of your college career, you must also be thinking about the multiple requirements and deadlines of the law school application process.


According to Assistant Dean for Admissions and Financial Aid at UCLA School of Law Rob Schwartz, “It’s best to start thinking about getting recommendations and preparing for the LSAT at least a year in advance and preferably even as much as two years in advance because the recommendations are a very critical part of the admissions process...."" Take the LSAT early. For a fall admission, plan to take the LSAT by December of the previous year. If you think you may want to take the exam more than once, make your first testing date in June or October. "

Set up a Law School Admission Council (LSAC) account.,
Use LSAC's Credential Assembly Service.",How to Get Into Law School2," LSAC is the group that administers the Law School Admissions Test (LSAT), which you must take to gain acceptance into law school.


You'll create a user name and password for your LSAC account and then enter basic information about yourself. You'll continue to update information here as you move through the admissions process.
Access your LSAC account to view reminders about important application and registration deadlines, learn more about the LSAT, purchase test prep materials, register for the exam and receive your tests scores early. , Once you create your LSAC account, you will also have access to the organization's Credential Assembly Service (CAS). This service helps to simplify and streamline the process of applying to law schools by creating a report that summarizes your undergraduate work and combines all of your documents with your LSAT score and writing sample. They then send the report to the law schools to which you apply. Using CAS is simple; once you have your LSAC account set up, it's simply a matter of submitting the proper documents and paying a fee.

Make sure there is a reportable LSAT score in your LSAC file.
Provide information about the schools you attended to LSAC.
Make sure all required transcripts are sent to LSAC.

Register for the LSAT.,
Study for the LSAT.,
Take the exam.",How to Get Into Law School3," The Law School Admission Test (LSAT) is a half-day, standardized test designed to measure reading comprehension, critical-thinking and reasoning skills and analytical ability. The test is offered four times a year (February, June, October, December) at designated testing centers world-wide. The test takes half a day to complete and consists of five 35-minute sections of multiple-choice question and a 35-minute timed writing sample.


Register online using your LSAC account; you can also register by phone or through a mail-in registration form.
There is a registration fee for the LSAT; you can pay with check, money order or credit card but not cash. An additional fee is charged for late registration for the exam.

If you meet certain criteria, you can apply for a fee waiver of the LSAT registration fee and the Credential Assembly Service (CAS). View the calendar on the LSAC website for notifications of when the registration period begins and ends for the exam.

, The LSAT is a rigorous exam, and you'll perform better if you give yourself plenty of time to prepare. You can study for the LSAT on your own or take advantage of tutoring services and programs that focus on getting students ready for this exam.


Take a class. Choose a professionally designed LSAT course to give you an overview of the exam and tools and practice you'll need to earn the best possible score.

Be sure the class is taught by a highly qualified instructor and is small (under 20 students) so you can get individual attention.
Note: Some of these classes can cost between $500 and $1,300. Budget carefully or consider going to the library to get prep books. Part of the appeal of the class is the notion that you've sunk so much into paying for it that you know you'll spend that much time. Make sure you are taking that much time.


Take the class a few months before your LSAT date; that way, you'll have time to study on your own, reinforcing what you've learned in your class.
Work with a tutor. Receiving one-on-one instruction for a professional LSAT tutor can help address your specific needs and fill in knowledge gaps you may have.

Choose a tutor who's been teaching for at least two years and plan to meet a couple times a week for maximum benefit.


Take practice exams. One of the best ways to get ready for the LSAT is to spend time answering the kinds of questions that will be on the real exam. Becoming familiar with the questions and the format of the test will increase your preparedness and make your more comfortable when your testing day rolls around.

You can take practice exams on your own. LSAC offers a free online prep test, and there are sample tests on other sites and in LSAT study guide books you can buy.
Join a group. Taking a proctored exam with other students simulates the real-world testing environment. Your prep test will be timed, and you'll have a sense of what it's like to maintain your focus in a room crowded with other students.
Some LSAT classes offer practice testing as part of the curriculum. If your plan to take a class, choose one that includes a testing component.
Don't underestimate the importance of practice. In an article written for U.S. News and World Report, the author recommends taking at least 30 full-length practice tests in preparation for the real LSAT., Anxiety is common when facing this important exam, but knowing what to expect and being ready will help put some of your fears to rest.


Don't forget your ticket. Once you've successfully registered for the LSAT, you'll receive an admission ticket that you must present on the day of the exam. There is no getting into the exam without this ticket.
You'll need valid identification and a photo. You must attach a photo (passport size) to your LSAT admission ticket. It must be a recent photo of you (no more than six months old) and be no smaller than 1""x1"" and no larger than 2""x2"". Bring test-taking materials. Be sure to have #2 or HB wooden pencils as well as a pencil sharpener with you on test days. Mechanical pencils are prohibited but you can bring highlighters if you'd like. You won't be able to bring your digital watch or cell phone to the test site, but if you want to monitor the time, you can bring an analog watch. Check the LSAC website for other items that are permitted on test day.

Search for law schools.,
Select all the law schools you wish to apply to.,
Apply through your LSAC account.,
Pay the fees.,
Complete your applications.,
Request your transcripts.,
Ask for letters of recommendation.,
Mind the timeline.,
Wait for a response.",How to Get Into Law School4," Law school is a huge commitment of time, money and effort. Be sure to pick the one that best suits your career goals.


Look at specialties. If you want to practice family law or criminal law, for example, it makes sense to apply to schools who specialize in those fields. Do some online research to check out a school's area of expertise.
Consider your chance of acceptance. Top-tier schools receive thousands of applicants and accept very few. That doesn't mean that you shouldn't aim high, but you need to be realistic as well. Pick one or two ""reach"" schools (ones you may not get into) as well as schools whose average LSAT and GPA rates are in line with your own.

Graduating from a top-tier school does open doors for you in the professional world, but it's not the only factor. Don't be overly influenced by a school's ranking.


Talk to graduates. Nobody can give you the low-down about a school the way alumni can. Seek out people who attended the schools you're interested in for insight into the school's academic and social environment.
Consider cost. Law school is expensive, so cost can clearly be a factor when you're deciding where to apply. If a school you're interested in seems out of reach financially, check into scholarship opportunities they may offer. In general, state schools are less expensive than private schools so put those at the top of your list if cost is a major consideration.
Be aware that you'll be paying back your law school loans for years after graduation. Do you best not to overburden yourself with student loans--it could cause you considerable stress or even limit your career options.
Look into location. Law school is tough enough without being isolated from family or living in a city that doesn't suit you. Consider how far away you can be from your support group, how easily you make friends and whether you're a city-lover or more of a small-town-dweller when looking at schools.

Also consider location for after law school. Some schools have strong regional placement, such that attending means that most of the jobs you will find are within 50 or 150 miles. Other schools have more national or international placement. If you're set on a particular area for after graduation, you may pick a very different school than if you're looking to explore different destinations.



, How many schools you apply to depends on a number of factors including LSAT scores, desired location and budget.


Let your LSAT score guide you. One recommendation is to apply to two to four schools where your LSAT is at the 25th percentile; three to five schools where your LSAT is in the mid-range of accepted applicants and two schools where your LSAT is at the 75th percentile. Don't be afraid to ask for a fee waiver. Law schools will often provide you with one to get you started, whether for merit, economic need, or other reasons - it doesn't hurt to ask.
If you're unable to move to attend law school, apply to the schools in your area where you would be competitive, plus a ""reach"" and a ""safety"" school. If you can or want to move, do the same in the area where you hope to relocate. , Now you'll turn to the CAS associated with your LSAC account to complete your application process. As mentioned above, there are several must-dos:


Make sure there is a reportable LSAT score in your LSAC file
Provide information about the schools you attended to LSAC
Make sure all required transcripts are sent to LSAC
Be sure all required letters of recommendation and evaluations are sent to LSAC

, There are a number of costs associated with applying for law school, so it's good for you to know upfront the money you'll have to invest in this process.


CAS charges an overall fee plus an additional fee for each school to which you apply.
Law school application fees range from $40 to $100.
Don't forget the cost of travel. You may choose to visit law schools as part of your decision-making process. Those trips will come with costs for gas, airfare, lodging and food, all of which should be factored into your budget.

Some schools offer stipends for travel.



, It takes several hours to complete a law school application, so plan to set aside time to focus on this task. You do not want to rush through this process as what you write and how well you write it will be examined closely as part of the application process.


The basic information of the application is pretty straight forward. Have all the information you may need to refer to on-hand to streamline the process.
Invest time in your essay or personal statement. Your personal statement or essay can allow you to stand out from the crowd and deserves your time, thoughtful consideration and multiple revisions. Among other things, the admissions officers will want to fully understand what attracted you to law and your particular field of interest. Ask people who know you well and can give constructive feedback to read your statement or essay. Ask them to judge whether or not it is successful in communicating your character and a clear sense of purpose.
If you're very interested in a particular school, give more information about the specific programs, faculty, or other factors that are drawing you.



, Submit a request for your transcripts to the registrar's office at your undergraduate university. Make your request three to four months ahead of your application date.

, Admissions committees want to hear about you from others who know you well. Get letters of recommendation from people who can offer positive impressions of you and predict your success as a lawyer.


Each school has a different requirement for the number of recommendations they want. Plan on at least two and as many as four.
Ask professors who know you well or community or group leaders with whom you worked. If possible, provide them with a copy of your personal statement so that their comments can support what you've shared about yourself and reflect your career aspirations.

, While law schools often list their application due dates as occurring sometime between January and April, most schools use a rolling admissions process that heavily favors those people who submit their applications as early as possible.


Aim to submit all of your applications by late November or early December, if not earlier.
Give yourself about a year to complete all of the necessary steps. It's not the end of the world if you start a bit later, but being prepared and getting your application in early will give you an advantage over procrastinating peers.

, It can take anywhere from days to weeks to hear whether or not you've been accepted to law school. Do your best to stay calm and focus on the fact that you did your absolute best.


While it's difficult to wait, you can use that time to reflect on why you wanted to attend law school in the first place. Those thoughts can keep your spirits up while you wait or help fortify you if you don't get the response you hoped for.
If you don't get accepted to the school you wanted, there are things you can do to make yourself a desirable candidate in the future. Consider retaking the LSAT's (you can take them three times in a two-year period), working for a year or two before reapplying, attending graduate school, or even transferring into the school with good grades from your first year at another institution.

Choose a large cooking pot.,
Add baking soda.,
Pour in white vinegar.,
Wait until the liquid stops fizzing.,
Make sure the liquid is completely clear.,
Boil until the first trace of a film appears on the surface.,
Scrape off the crystals on the side of the pot.,
Transfer to a sealed container.,
Chill the container in an ice bath.,
Add a bit of crystallized sodium acetate to your aqueous solution.,
Watch your hot ice form.",How to Make Hot Ice1," This must be a clean pot made of steel or Pyrex, and should hold about two quarts (two liters) or more. ""Hot ice"" is non-toxic, so don't worry about ruining your cookware.


Do not use a copper pot.;
, Measure out three tablespoons (45 mL) baking soda into the pot.









You cannot use baking powder, which contains other chemicals that interfere with the process.

, Measure out about one quart (liter) white vinegar, then pour it bit by bit into the container. It will fizz immediately, so don't pour too quickly or it might overflow.









This measurement assumes you're using 5% acetic acid, which is a common concentration for commercial vinegar. This doesn't need to be a precise measurement, though.

, The vinegar (acetic acid) and baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) are reacting to produce sodium acetate, along with the carbon dioxide that causes all this fizzing. Give the liquid a good stir as it fizzes to make sure all the baking soda is mixed in, then wait for the reaction to end.








, If you still see a single grain of baking soda, add more vinegar until they all disappear. Any baking soda left in the liquid could freeze your ""hot ice"" before you want it to, later in the process.








, Vinegar is mostly water, which you'll need to boil away. Once about 90% of the liquid is gone — which could take half an hour of boiling or more — a crusty film will begin to form on the surface. This means all the excess water is gone and you need to turn off the heat as fast as possible. If you let too much of a crust develop, your liquid will get cloudy and not work very well.









If it does get very brown and cloudy, add a bit more vinegar and boil again.
The sodium acetate starts out as ""sodium acetate trihydrate,"" meaning it contains water. Once all the water around it is gone, those water molecules start to evaporate and the sodium acetate becomes ""sodium acetate anhydrous,"" meaning ""without water.""

, As the water level gets lower, you'll notice powdery sodium acetate crystals sticking to the inside of the pot. You'll need these later, so use a spoon to gather them in a separate container. You can do this at any point while the mixture is boiling.








, Ladle the liquid into Pyrex glass or another container that can safely hold hot liquid. Make sure not to get any solid crystals into this container. Cover tightly.









It's a good idea to add 1 or 2 tablespoons (15–30 mL) of vinegar. The vinegar will help keep the solution in its aqueous state, instead of forming that crust again.

, Wait until the container of sodium acetate cools to room temperature or lower. This should take about 15 minutes in a bowl of ice water, or longer in the fridge. The goal is to ""super-cool"" the sodium acetate trihydrate. This means it will drop below its freezing temperature, but still remain liquid.









If the liquid freezes during this stage, there might be a solid piece of crystal in it, or some other impurity. Add more vinegar, return to the stovetop, and try again. This is a difficult process, so it's rare that you'll get it on your first try.

, Use the powder scrapings you removed from the pot while you were boiling down the solution. Start with a small pinch or two; if they have no effect, add more.








, The solid sodium acetate provides a seed crystal for all the super-cooled acetate to grow from. Since the sodium acetate is already super-cooled and ready to freeze, this should set off a rapid chain reaction, freezing the entire solution. This releases heat, which you can easily feel if you put your hands near the container.









If this does not happen, there is a problem with your solution. Add more vinegar and boil again — or try the more reliable store-bought method below.

Find sodium acetate trihydrate.,
Place in a boiling water bath.,
Chill immediately.,
Touch the cool solution with solid sodium acetate.",How to Make Hot Ice2," Although this is an inexpensive, nontoxic ingredient, it’s not commonly available in local stores. You'll probably have an easier time buying it online. (You may be able to take it from a squeeze-activated warming pad instead.)









Sodium acetate is also sold as ""sodium acetate anhydrous,"" and some vendors do not specify which form they mean. The instructions below cover both forms.

, Place the sodium acetate in a steel or Pyrex container, then place that container in a pot of boiling water. It should melt to pure liquid sodium acetate trihydrate, or ""hot ice.""









If the sodium acetate does not melt, you've bought sodium acetate anhydrous. To turn it into sodium acetate trihydrate, add hot water while it's still in the boiling water bath. It will take about 2 mL water for every 3 grams of sodium acetate to fully dissolve the substance.
Don't use all of your sodium acetate. You'll need a little for later.

, Transfer to a clean container, cover, and place in an ice bath or fridge until it reaches room temperature or below. Make sure not to get any solid sodium acetate in this container, or it will freeze too early.








, The solid crystal is a nucleation point, meaning it allows the other sodium acetate molecules to stick around it and expand into a crystal form. Soon the whole container should look like a block of ice — except it's radiating heat!









Other impurities can trigger the freezing if they happen to be the right shape. This means you can sometimes trigger it by touching it with a toothpick or your finger, but solid sodium acetate is the only reliable way.

If you’re outgoing, jump into the fray and meet as many people as you can. Also try to meet people outside your section.
If you’re married, look if there are student groups for married students. This is a good way to meet other couples.;
, Most 1Ls are obsessed with grades. Unfortunately, you probably won’t receive any grades until you take final exams, so you will spend your entire first semester comparing yourself to other people in your section. Avoid this temptation.


Other students will exaggerate how much they are studying, so take everything they say with a huge grain of salt.Don’t be impressed by students who talk all the time. They don’t always finish at the top of the class. In fact, you’ll notice many will become quiet in the second semester. Why? Because they got their fall semester grades!

, The easiest way to keep up with your reading is to develop a schedule early and stick to it. In undergrad, you might have been able to sleep until noon, but in law school you’ll have to attend classes early in the morning and get all of your reading done in the evening. Develop a schedule and stick to it.


Also schedule time to get away from law school. The worst thing you can do is to spend all of your time in the library or around law students.
Remember to take care of your health. The stress and workload will take a toll on your health, so remember to schedule regular exercise., In a study group, you can compare your notes, bounce ideas of each other, and commiserate. Study groups are also helpful for getting to know people, though this isn’t their primary purpose.


Make sure your study group is small—usually no more than four people.If you decide to join a study group, commit to keeping up and staying in the group throughout the entire semester. For this reason, you might want to wait a few weeks before forming your study group.This will give you a chance to scope out who you think knows their material.

, Law schools are usually small—fewer than a thousand students in total. Also, your section might have around 40 students. This environment will feel a lot like junior high.Whatever you tell someone will probably get repeated.

, Most days you can roll into class wearing your PJs, but you’ll be surprised by how often you need to look professional. For example, you might have to attend a lecture given by a federal or state judge. You’ll also need a suit if you participate in moot court. It’s probably best to buy one early in your 1L semester, if not before school starts.


Make sure your suit fits you well—but isn’t too tight. Students often gain 15 pounds or more during their 1L year.You don’t want the waistband to cut off your circulation by the end of the spring semester.

Identify the courses you will take.,
Learn how to brief a case.,
Keep up with your reading.,
Take notes in class.,
Do your best when called on in class.,
Outline your course material.,
Use commercial supplements intelligently.,
Stay calm.",How to Survive Your First Year of Law School (USA)2," Most law schools follow the same curriculum. Although you will be able to take a couple electives, most 1L courses are assigned. Here is a typical 1L curriculum:



Contracts (fall semester). You’ll learn the legal requirements for forming a contract and defenses you can raise if you break one.

Torts (fall semester). Torts are civil wrongs: trespass, assault, battery, personal injury, defamation, etc. The injured party can sue whoever injured them and get money compensation.

Civil Procedure (fall semester). This class will cover the rules for filing lawsuits in federal court.

Criminal law (fall semester). Learn what the state must prove to convict someone of murder, assault, rape, etc.

Legal writing (fall and spring semester). You’ll learn how to write objective legal memos and persuasive appellate briefs. Legal writing is usually a small section of about 20 students.

Property (spring semester). This class covers the rules of property—how you get and pass title, as well as restrictions on property.

Constitutional law (spring semester). Learn how the meaning of the U.S. Constitution has evolved over more than 200 years.

, Everyone talks about “briefing” cases, which is usually helpful at the beginning of the semester. To brief a case, do the following:Read the case several times. Legal writing is dense, particularly cases written in the 19th Century. You’ll probably read very slowly at first. Don’t skip anything as you read.
Write a short summary of the facts. Who is the plaintiff (the person bringing the suit)? Who is the defendant? What happened? What court are they appearing in? If you’re called on in class, you may have to give a short summary of the dispute.
Identify the issues in dispute. For example, a case might be about whether a celebrity living in California can sue someone in a California court when the defendant hasn’t stepped foot in the state.
Write down the court’s holding. This is what the court decided. Also include some bullet points on the reasons given.
Describe any dissenting opinion. Go back and read the majority’s opinion to see how they rebutted the dissent.
List any questions you have.

, You’ll probably be assigned hundreds of pages to read each night, so it is very easy to fall behind. Make it a point to stay on top of your reading. You might have been able to procrastinate in undergrad, but you can’t anymore., Most students take notes using their laptops. That way, you can easily transfer your notes to your outline.You’ll want to write down what your professor thinks about the cases, because they will be grading your exam.


Most law schools have Wi-Fi, and you’ll be tempted to surf the Internet while in class. In fact, almost everyone does at one point or another. However, if you want to focus on the class discussion, then take handwritten notes. This will force you to focus.

, If you watch the movie “The Paper Chase,” then you’re familiar with the Socratic Method. This form of questioning often leaves students confused and humiliated. The good news is that few professors use a full-on Socratic Method anymore. Instead, they might use a watered-down version: they’ll have you summarize the case and then ask a series of questions meant to get you to think critically about legal issues.For example, you might think “Nobody can tell me what to do with my body” is a good legal rule. However, your professor will probably pose a series of hypotheticals: can the state criminalize public dueling? Nudity around children? Nudity around other adults?
The primary purpose of these questions is to get you to think about the hidden assumptions in your thinking. As a class, you can then work through these blind spots. In fact, there might not be any “right” answer.
Another purpose of questioning is to get you comfortable thinking on your feet. If you represent clients in court, you can expect a judge to ask you sharp questions, so get comfortable early with the process of thinking aloud.

, Outlining is a helpful technique for seeing how all of the material in a subject relates to each other. If you don’t know how to outline, get sample outline from 2Ls or 3Ls who took the class from the same professor.Use them as guides.


One key to outlining effectively is knowing when to start. Don’t get into a competition with other students. Some might claim to be outlining by September, which is too early. Instead, wait until you’ve covered a good portion of the syllabus.
Always revisit your outline as the material becomes clearer. You may need to supplement or change information.

, There’s a lot of supplemental material on the market—case briefs, commercial outlines, nutshells, etc. Don’t rely on them too heavily. They are helpful for seeing the big picture, but ultimately you need to understand what your professor thinks about the material.These supplements can also be quite expensive. Try to get a copy from the library or a used copy on Amazon or eBay.
If you want to use a supplement, know which ones to get. For example, many people use Chemerinsky’s supplement for Constitutional Law.Ask 2Ls what supplements they found helpful.

, Everything might not be crystal clear when you begin. This is normal! However, you should consistently strive to understand the material as much as you can. Visit your professor during office hours to ask all of the questions that weren’t answered in class. Many classes will also have a student teaching assistant, who is a 2L or 3L who can answer your questions.


Avoid thinking about exams until around November 1.If you obsess earlier in the semester, you’ll only make yourself nervous.

Take a couple practice exams.,
Review the sample answers.,
Sit for your exam.,
Avoid discussing the exam with others.",How to Survive Your First Year of Law School (USA)3," Practice exams are essential.They will help you understand the law so that it becomes second nature. Take them as you would a real exam. Find a quiet spot in the library, time yourself, and type out your answers.You can usually get practice exams from your professor, who might have posted them online. Use old exams from your professor first. If nothing is available, look at exams from other professors who teach the same subject at your school.

, The practice exam should have a sample answer. Read this carefully, because you will learn a lot about how to spot issues and structure your answers., Exams are generally “issue spotter” exams. You’ll be given a fact pattern, which is like a very short story. Then you’ll be told to identify all of the legal claims and defenses each person in the fact pattern has. You’ll write up a memo identifying the issues and explaining whether you think the person has a reasonable chance of success. When taking an exam, remember the following tips:


Read your professor’s instructions. Don’t skip this step! Your professor might want you to focus on certain issues or keep the exam under a certain word limit. If you fail to follow the directions, your grades will suffer.
Check whether you can use an outline. If not, don’t pull it out during the exam or else the monitor will eject you from the exam room.
Read the fact pattern thoroughly. Don’t immediately plunge into typing up your answer.
Outline your answer. Many people use the IRAC method: identify the issue, state the rule, apply the facts to the rule, and then state a conclusion.
Don’t dump everything you know onto the page. You won’t get credit. For example, don’t start rambling about an insanity defense if that’s not supported by the fact pattern. Instead, identify the key issues first and develop them the most.

, There’s really no reason to talk about the exam once you finish. Chances are, you missed an issue someone else caught, which will only increase your anxiety.Instead of commiserating about the exam, schedule some fun time immediately after.

Crack and flex your glow stick bracelets to activate the chemical glow.,
Open the plastic eggs, add a glow stick and some candy to each, and close them up again.

,
Hide your eggs outside, or turn off the lights and hide them indoors.",How to Make an Easter Egg Glow2," Tie each glow stick into a knot or pretzel shape so it will fit easily into the plastic egg.


Glow sticks can be obtained - very cost effectively - at art, party, and some grocery/one-stop-shopping stores.

Wrap rubber bands around eggs before dyeing or painting them.,
Draw on eggs with white crayons before dyeing them.,
Use multiple dyes on one egg.",How to Make an Easter Egg Glow5," After the dye or paint dries, remove the rubber bands. The covered areas will be white and free of paint, leaving cool-looking stripes behind.

, This technique works for raw or hard-boiled eggs (not plastic). The wax of the crayon will repel the dye, leaving white space in whatever shape or design was drawn on the egg.

, If you put an egg into a small glass or tumbler with about an inch of dye in it and just enough width for an egg, the egg can soak just its bottom half in the dye. Let the egg dry, turn it over, and put it white-side down into a similar glass with a different color of dye.


You can also experiment using larger, flat containers with shallow (several millimeters) of dye in them.
Sit an egg carefully in the shallow dye, so that it does not roll. Take it out and let it dry.
This will result in a 'spot' or circle of dye on one side of the egg. Turn the egg so that another area faces downward and soak in the dye. Dry off and repeat until you have created a spotted egg.

Rinse out a large soda or water bottle.,
Add oil, water, and food coloring to the bottle.,
Add salt or an Alka-Seltzer tablet to the water.,
Put the cap on and tip the bottle back and forth (optional).,
Place a strong flashlight or searchlight under the bottle.,
Understand what's happening.",How to Make a Lava Lamp with Household Ingredients1," Any tightly sealable container works, but you probably have an empty water bottle laying around somewhere. Try to find one that holds at least 16 ounces or 500 milliliter, so you can clearly see the display.


This method is safe for kids to follow on their own, and much faster and easier than making a permanent lava lamp. Young kids can ask an adult to do the pouring for them.;
, Fill the bottle ¾ of the way full with vegetable oil, then top it off with water and about 10 drops of food coloring (or enough to make the solution appear fairly dark).








, If using a salt shaker, sprinkle it in for about five seconds.For a more exciting, fizzing lava lamp, instead take an Alka-Seltzer tablet, break it into a few pieces, and toss them all in.









Any other tablet labeled ""effervescent"" will work. These are often sold as Vitamin C tablets at drugstores.

, This will cause the tiny droplets of colored water moving around inside the oil to join together, making bigger lava-squirt blobs. That's what scientists call them, anyway.









Add more salt or another effervescent tablet whenever the blobs start moving.

, This will illuminate the bubbles for maximum effect. But don't leave your bottle on top of a heated surface! Plastic will melt and you'll get oil everywhere.








, Oil and water never mix into one fluid, instead just breaking into the strange blobs you see slipping past each other. Adding the last ingredient really stirs things up. Here's why:









Salt sinks down to the bottom of the bottle, dragging a blob of oil with it. Once the salt breaks up and dissolves in the water, the oil floats up to the top again.The fizzy tablet reacts with the water to make tiny bubbles of carbon dioxide gas. These bubbles attach themselves to the blobs of colored water and float up to the surface. When the bubbles pop, the colored blobs sink back to the bottom of the bottle."

Do your history research first.,
Look in your backyard to scout out earthworks and other signs.,
Look at your local landscape and consider why people decided to live there in the first place.,
Look for a good place to dig in your own backyard (or your neighbour's if they give you permission).",How to Explore the Archaeology of Your Backyard1," It can save a lot of time looking at the history of your local area as that way you will have a fair concept of what to expect, if anything is in your area. If your home has been occupied for many generations, you will likely find a better structure of the history to analyze. Places with little records, or that were known to have phases of occupation and desertion can be just as fascinating.


It is important to know the local history or local myths. If your area is said to have history dating back hundreds of years, it can be a far more complex job to correctly identify layers, whereby if you are in a new development, the likelihood of finding old and complex human activity is minimal. In this case, interesting finds or anything you don't understand should be referred to the local museum or archaeological authority.;
, Earthworks can include signs of ploughing, levelling, terracing, or raising the earth to build on. There can also be banks and ditches, which can have a range of interpretations––these changes may have been recent, or much older and may be very subtle. Other useful signs to look for include:


Parch marks or stunted growth in grass or fields. While this can be caused by plant pathology and soil fungus, regular shapes or marks where the soil is dry can be signs of compacted earth and foundations of buildings or other structures (including smaller things such as old bird baths, sundials, ponds and other garden furniture).
Natural stone close to the surface could be of geological interest.
There may be evidence of chemicals or waste dumping in the past. In this case, proceed with great caution, as exposing yourself to dangerous chemicals can be harmful or even lethal. (Contact your local authority if you are concerned this is the case.)

, It might be near a river or stream for water supplies, good soil for agriculture, forests for wood and hunting, local hills and valleys that protect from the elements and other aspects. Why you live in your area isn't always the reason why older generations decided to live there


Very often, you may find existing structures, such as the garden shed, compost bin, fencing and paving. This is the archaeology of the future as the installation of these will leave telltale marks in the soil for the future archaeologists to discover. What you are doing is looking for the activity of generations past, which have also left traces for you to find.
Google Maps or other satellite maps can be a great free source as you can zoom into your target for an aerial view. Several recent world discoveries in dangerous war zones and inhospitable terrain have been made using satellite maps from home offices.
If you have ever watched any history or archaeology shows such as the History, National Geographic and Discovery Channel, or watched programs such as ""Time Team"" in the United Kingdom, you can get an idea about what's involved.

, Seek permission before you dig, as not only do you need the land-owners permission and local government permission if necessary, it can be important to check if there are existing services such as gas, electricity, sewerage, etc., in the place you wish to dig. Many nations and local governments have a ""Dial before you Dig"" program where you can get advice (and financial penalties for failing to seek the advice first.)

Make this lamp only with adult supervision.,
Get a glass container.,
Pour in a small cup of mineral oil or baby oil.,
Mix in 70% rubbing alcohol and 90% isopropyl alcohol.,
Put the jar onto a sturdy, hollow object.,
Add the heat source.,
Give the lamp time to warm up.,
Troubleshoot if necessary.",How to Make a Lava Lamp with Household Ingredients2," The alcohol and oil used in this lamp are flammable, and must be treated with care when heating them to get the lava moving. Children should show an adult these instructions and ask for help, and not attempt this on their own.


Commercial lava lamps use a proprietary combination of melted waxes. The homemade version doesn't achieve exactly the same look, but after some tweaking your ""lava"" should bob up and down in similar, gooey glory.

, You can use any clear, glass container that you can seal tightly and shake. Glass can withstand heat much better than plastic, making it a good choice for a lava lamp.

, This will be the ""lava"" bobbing up and down in your lamp. It doesn't matter how much you use, as you can always pour in more later.









Starting with plain oil for your first attempt is a good idea, but you can mix in artist's oil paint first if you want colored ""lava."" Be aware that the paint might separate later, gathering on the top or bottom of the jar., Both types of alcohol are sold in drugstores. Once these are mixed in the perfect amount, the liquid will be almost the same density as the mineral oil. Here's how to achieve this:









Mix together 6 parts 90% alcohol and 13 parts 70% alcohol.(You can estimate this by filling a small cup with 90% alcohol once, then 70% alcohol twice, then pouring in an extra dash of 70%.)
Pour this into the jar and wait for the liquid to settle. The oil should end up on the bottom, but bulge upward slightly in the center. If it looks flat, you can pour in slightly more 70% alcohol, but you don't need to get it perfect at this point.

, Screw the lid on the jar tightly before you start moving it around. Place the jar on a stable, heat-safe surface, such as a large, upside-down flower pot. This should have enough space underneath it to cover a small lamp.

, Once the oil and alcohol are very close to the same density, all you need to do is add heat beneath the lamp. Heat causes materials to expand, but causes the oil to expand slightly faster than the alcohol around it. When this happens, the oil floats to the top, cools down and shrinks, then sinks again. Let's get started:









Select an incandescent bulb carefully. For a jar 12 ounces (350 mL) or smaller, use a 15 watt sewing machine bulb. Larger containers can use a 30 watt or 40 watt bulb, but never higher-powered ones, due to the risk of overheating or shattering the glass.
Place this bulb in a small, directional lamp below the jar, pointing upward.
For maximum control over the light and heat, install a dimmer switch on the lamp.

, Some lava lamps take a couple hours to warm up enough to start floating, but this homemade oil version usually starts moving in less time than that. Wrap your hand in a cloth and touch the jar every 15 minutes. It should get quite warm, but not searing hot. If it is too hot, turn off the lamp immediately and replace the bulb with a lower wattage.









Try rotating the lamp gently once in a while as it warms up, using a cloth or oven mitt to touch it.
Don't leave the lamp on when you leave the room, and turn it off to let it cool after a few hours of being on, at most.

, If the oil is still stuck at the bottom after a couple hours, turn it off and let it cool completely before you mess with it. Once it reaches room temperature, carefully unscrew it and try one of the following adjustments:









Stir in a few spoonfuls of salt water to increase the density of the alcohol mixture.Shake the lava lamp gently to separate the oil into smaller blobs. Don't overdo this, or you'll end up with sludge instead of lava.
If the oil has separated into tiny balls, mix in a spoonful of turpentine or other paint solvent. These are dangerous chemicals, so don't try this if the lamp is reachable by children or pets.

Gather your holography supplies and household materials listed in the ""Things You'll Need"" section below.,
Define your laboratory space.,
Prepare the subject of your hologram.,
Prepare your diode laser (or laser pointer).,
Position the laser until the subject is fully illuminated.

,
Turn off all lights.,
Block the laser light from reaching the subject with a book.,
Remove one holographic film plate from its box in the darkest part of the room.,
Slowly lift the “shutter” slightly off the table a half inch (1cm) while still blocking the laser light from reaching any part of the plate, and wait a few seconds for any vibration to subside.

,
Lift the shutter all the way up to expose the holographic plate and object for about 10 seconds.

,
Block the laser light again by placing the book back on the table.

,
Process the plate according to instructions that accompany the holography processing kit.,
Dry the holographic plate vertically.,
View your hologram after it is completely dried with a point source such as that from a projector, flashlight, spotlight, LED white light, or the sun.",How to Make a Hologram,";
, Choose a sturdy table or counter in a dark room that is free of noise, vibration, air currents, and small movements (creaky floors, etc.). If you don't have a sturdy table, a concrete basement floor works well.

, Place the subject securely on the sturdy table. If you have a computer mouse pad or tray of sand, place the subject on top of that. This helps minimize any vibrations.

, Place it about 30 centimeter (11.8 in) away the subject by bracing it with a clothespin (UK clothes peg) and then sticking the clothespin into a cup of salt or sugar.


If your diode laser has an adjustable lens, take off that lens and position the laser so that its beam spreads out horizontally in an elliptical shape (it looks similar to that of a loaf of bread).
If your laser doesn't have an adjustable lens, secure an optical diverging lens to another clothespin and cup of salt so that the laser beam shines through it to spread the light.

,, You can use a nightlight placed under the table or even slightly crack open the door to see in the darkened room. Block any direct light from reaching the holography system. The room should be dark enough that one cannot read.

, The book will serve like a shutter of a camera.

, Carefully lean it against the object. Wait 10-20 seconds to let the plate settle against the object.

,,,, This process takes about 3-5 minutes total. For making basic holograms, the process of developing is actually quite simple:
Mix the dried powder photochemicals with distilled bottle water to form two solutions: the developer and the bleach






Dip and wiggle plate in developer for 20 seconds






Rinse in water for 30 seconds






Dip and wiggle plate in bleach for 20 seconds






Rinse in water for 30 seconds






Dry with hair dryer








The dried chemical powder photochemicals can be individually put together by going to a photochemist, but is more expensive since only 1 gram of several chemicals is needed, and few photochemists sell in such small amounts. The JD-4 kit recommended in this article puts all the chemicals into a kit and is happens to be the only such kit available. It is preferred by beginners.

, A simple way to do this is by placing the plate on a paper towel and lean it against a wall. If time is limited, you can carefully blow warm air across the holographic plate using a hair dryer from at least foot (30cm) away. Avoid high heat.

, Shine the spotlight from the same angle your laser beam shone on the plate during exposure. You can't use diffused light sources such as frosted bulbs and fluorescent lamps.

Create a “rougher” or more adhesive point of contact.,
Press the two surfaces together harder.,
Stop any relative motion.,
Remove lubrication between the two surfaces.,
Remove wheels or bearings to create sliding friction.,
Increase the fluid viscosity.",How to Increase Friction1," When two materials slide or rub against each other, three things can happen: small nooks, crannies, and irregularities on the surfaces can catch on each other; one or both surfaces can deform in response to the motion; and, finally, the atoms within each surface can interact with each other.For practical purposes, all three of these effects do the same thing: generate friction. Picking surfaces that are abrasive (like sandpaper), deform when pressed (like rubber), or have adhesive interactions with other surfaces (like tacky glue, etc.) is a straightforward way to increase friction.


Engineering textbooks and similar resources can be great tools when picking which materials to use to generate high friction. Most standard building materials have known ""friction coefficients"" — that is, measures of how much friction they generate with other surfaces. Sliding friction coefficients for just a few common materials are listed below (higher coefficients indicate greater friction):Aluminum on aluminum: 0.34
Wood on wood: 0.129
Dry concrete on rubber: 0.6-0.85
Wet concrete on rubber: 0.45-0.75
Ice on ice: 0.01;
, One fundamental principle of basic physics is that the friction an object experiences is proportional to its normal force (for our purposes, this is basically the force with which it presses into the object it's sliding against).This means that the friction between two surfaces can be increased if the surfaces are pressed into each other with greater force.


If you've ever used a set of disc brakes (for instance, on a car or bike) you've observed this principle in action. In this case, pressing the brakes pushes a set of friction-generating pads into metal discs attached to the wheels. The harder the brakes are pushed, the harder the pads get pressed into the discs and the more friction is generated. This can stop the vehicle quickly, but can also release lots of heat, which is why a set of brakes is usually quite hot after heavy braking., That is, if one surface is in motion with respect to another, stop it. Up until now, we've focused on kinetic (or ""sliding"") friction — the friction that occurs between two objects or surfaces as they rub against each other. In fact, this friction is different from static friction — the friction that occurs when one object starts to move against another. Essentially, the friction between two objects is greatest right when they start moving against each other. Once they're already in motion, friction decreases. This is one of the reasons why it's harder to start pushing a heavy object than it is to keep moving it.Try this simple experiment to observe the difference between static and kinetic friction: place a chair or another piece of furniture on a smooth floor in your house (not rug or carpet). Make sure the furniture doesn't have protective ""foot pads"" or any other sort of material on the bottom that might make it easy to slide across the floor. Try to push the furniture just hard enough so that it starts moving. You should notice that as soon as the furniture starts moving, it immediately becomes slightly easier to push. This is because the kinetic friction between the furniture and the floor is less than the static friction.

, Lubricants like oil, grease, petroleum jelly, and so on can greatly reduce the friction between two objects or surfaces. This is because the friction between two solids is generally much higher than the friction between those solids and the liquid between them. To increase friction, try removing any lubricants from the equation, using only ""dry"", un-lubricated parts to generate friction.


To see the friction-reducing potential of lubricants, try this simple experiment: Rub your hands together as if they're cold and you want to warm them up. You should immediately notice them heat up from the friction. Next, put a fair amount of lotion in your palms and try the same thing. Not only should it be easier to rub your hands against each other quickly, but you should also notice much less heat.

, Wheels, bearings, and other ""rolling"" objects experience a special kind of friction called rolling friction. This friction is almost always much less than the friction generated by simply sliding an equivalent object along the ground. — This is why these objects tend to roll, rather than slide along the ground. To increase the friction in a mechanical system, try removing wheels, bearings, and so on so that parts rub against each other rather than roll against each other.For instance, consider the difference between pulling a heavy weight along the ground in a wagon versus pulling a similar weight in a sled. A wagon has wheels, so it's easier to pull than a sled, which drags against the ground, generating lots of sliding friction as it goes.

, Solid objects aren't the only things that can generate friction. Fluids (liquids and gases like water and air, respectively) can also generate friction. The amount of friction a fluid generates as it passes against a solid depends on several factors. One of the easiest of these to control is the fluid viscosity — that is, what's commonly called its ""thickness"". Generally, highly viscous fluids (ones that are ""thick"", ""gooey"", etc.) generate more friction than fluids that are less viscous (ones that are ""smooth"" and ""liquid"").


For instance, consider the difference in effort you might experience when blowing water through a straw versus blowing honey through a straw. Water, which isn't very viscous, is very easy to suck into and blow out of a straw. Honey, on the other hand, is quite a bit more difficult to move through a straw. This is because honey's high viscosity generates lots of resistive friction as it's forced through a narrow tube like a straw."

Gather your tools.,
Dig a test pit.,
Start to take the soil back one layer at a time.,
Keep an eye out for soil changes.,
Dig as far as the evidence takes you.",How to Explore the Archaeology of Your Backyard2," Ideally, you should have a shovel, a medium garden trowel or a small cement trowel, a scraper and a brush. If you are lucky enough to have any finds, you should have a tray to keep them in, a camera and a ruler or yardstick. It is also recommended to have a tarpaulin or a wheelbarrow to add your soil and any turf-grass or paving stones onto without making a large mess.

, Otherwise known as a sondage, this pit should be a few feet (60-90cm) across, but generally no larger than a metre across each way, otherwise it can become too large a job that requires a long time to excavate. Start by measuring with string and pegs, marking paint or a frame. Lift the turf or paving stones. Put these aside neatly on the tarpaulin so you can easily put them back afterwards with minimal effect. After you have lifted all the turf, check the soil to see if there is anything there. This layer will be the most recent and will be unlikely to have anything very old, although you may find something a few decades old such as an old coin, discarded bottles and other recognisable items.


Photograph anything interesting you may find. For young children, anything can be interesting, including old bottle caps and scrap, but genuinely interesting finds are directly related to human activity, as well as dating evidence.

, As a very rough metaphor, imagine a loaf of bread. You cut the bread in even slices rather than make random holes on the loaf and that's roughly what you are endeavouring to do, by digging layer by layer, revealing even slices. This is the slower way of doing it, but it is arguably the proper method to reveal each layer and get an understanding of the contexts.


For most excavations, it's best to obtain a soil sieve from your local hardware store and check the ""spoil heap"" and/or hire or purchase a metal detector to check for small traces of metal objects. Both ways provide opportunities to find the subtle clues of history.
The key method of layers is that if a coin from 1970 is found in that layer, then it's highly improbable that the layer is older than 1970––unless it was buried there––which in itself is an interesting discovery. If you find a very old layer, yet it has modern debris in it or below it, then old soil may have been shifted to that location, or there has been modern disturbance. This inconsistency is all part of the story.

, The study of layers is often referred to as Stratigraphy and for very complex layers, it can be connected with paleontology.


If you find darker patches, this may be remains of charcoal; its presence may be as simple as a bonfire or campfire remains, or alternatively an older dumping ground for kitchen and other waste which has enriched the soil. Small or isolated patches of burnt material are more likely human made rather than a seasonal; naturally produced fires typically would form an even ash layer that can be found when digging several pits in an area. Intense or prolonged burning (such as an ancient hearth, forge or demolition) often leaves red traces in the soil. Other changes to the soil such as lighter and darker layers can show either natural accumulation, chemicals or metals being dumped, or humans digging holes for a fence post, digging a trench to bury something or part of land management, such as building an earthen or stone wall. The key to being a good archaeologist is to decipher these changes.
Photograph anything you uncover using your ruler as a scale reference. In particular, keep records of anything that can indicate unknown human activity, or activity that you wouldn't think is normal in a household backyard. It is best to record everything you find and observe, including depth and location in the test pit.
Be mindful about the soil types. If you find soil that is different or not naturally occurring, this is a find all on its own. It may be something as simple as someone digging a garden bed using introduced materials or it could be something more complex, such as a quake or a novel building foundation; deducing from the earth what people in the past were doing there is what archaeology is all about.

, If you're likely to dig more than 1 foot (30cm) deep however, it's generally best to call in additional help, or leave the test pit and ask your local school, university or local historical society to get involved. Deep pits may need structural support for safety and if the water levels are high, may fill with water and be unsafe or just very difficult to excavate.

"
"
Record the data that comes out of the trench.,
Put aside any of your finds and take them to a historian or your local museum for advice.,
Consider your conclusions.,
Close your pit by replacing the soil and turf.",How to Explore the Archaeology of Your Backyard3," Ideally, photograph or draw each layer or interesting find in context. This data can often be very important for a historians to learn from.

, Most people can recognise a coin and scrap of ceramic as the things they are, but a local historian can give a far more interesting and informative analysis of how old the find really is and may provide interesting historical facts with it.


Be careful to examine and record everything that comes out of your test pit. Chunks of wood may be remains of a dead tree stump or branch, but if they also carry tool marks, this shows human activity even if it was simply chopping up firewood and a piece fell behind. The same applies to stones, especially flint-like stones if you live in an areas with known or suspected ancient occupation. These stones may be plain and natural, but some stone may be ""worked"", meaning it has been shaped for decorative or functional purposes. Traces of cement, mortar, plaster or chiseling frequently reveal that a stone has been part of something, such as being part of a tool, or could denote a place that these materials were produced.
Anything very delicate should not be cleaned by a hobbyist if it may be of any historical or analytical importance. Most finds can be brushed clean or even lightly cleaned in water if they are robust enough to tolerate it.

, While the chances of finding an ancient treasure is rare, you may find some evidence of people being in your area many decades before you, perhaps even one hundred years ago. Don't neglect the banal––everyday objects help to rebuild a picture of life as it once was, revealing what people did in times now gone and can tell you things such as the level of wealth or lack of it, the technological state of the community and the reliance on local or imported products.

, Be sure to mark out where you made the pit––this is useful not only in case you found something or wish to return to the site later, but finding nothing is a result, so you wouldn't want to re-dig it when you already know what's there. It's recommended to either draw a map, or print out a satellite image of your backyard from Google Maps or other online map programs and to outline on this map where you placed your trench.

Survey the text before you read.,
Ask questions.,
Read the text.,
Recite what you just read.,
Review the material.",How to Read for Comprehension1," Previewing a text increases the chances that you will comprehend what you read, and it is really easy to do. Simply flip through the pages and look at the chapter title and subheadings. When you are finished, you will have a good sense of the main ideas that the chapter will cover.If the chapter includes an author summary, then you can read the summary as well.
You should also look at any charts, graphs, or other images as you survey the text.;
, Generating some questions to help guide your reading will help you to stay focused and it can also increase your comprehension of the text. Consider the topics you encountered in your survey of the text and use these to help you generate some questions about the reading.You can use who, what, when, where, and why to help you generate questions about the subheadings you encountered in your preview. For example, you could take the title of a subheading called “Reading Comprehension Strategies” and turn it into a question called “What are some effective reading comprehension strategies?”
Some instructors include reading questions for you to answer as you read. If you have been provided with a list of reading questions, then use these to help you stay focused as you read.

, Next, you will need to read the text and use your questions to help you stay focused. If you use your questions, highlight important information as you go, and take notes on what you have read, then you should only need to read the text once.Make sure that you read at your own pace and stop to take notes as needed.

, It is important to stop after you finish a section and put what you just read into your own words. If you cannot do this after you have read a section, then you should reread that section again.Try to explain the material to a friend or write a brief summary of the material. Remember to explain it in your own words. Don’t simply repeat the wording you encountered.

, To keep the concepts that you have read about fresh in your mind, you will need to review it now and then. You do not need to reread the whole text, but you do need to go over what you underlined and review any notes that you took as well.Try to review what you read about once or twice per week leading up to an exam. This will help to ensure that you retain the information and that you will not need to reread the whole text before an exam.

Increase the viscosity of the fluid.,
Increase the area exposed to air.,
Use a shape with a greater drag coefficient.,
Use a less streamlined body flow.,
Use a less permeable material.,
Increase the speed of the object.",How to Increase Friction2," The medium through which an object moves exerts a force on the object surfaces which, in aggregate, make up the frictional force acting on the object. The denser a fluid is (more viscous), the more slowly an object under the effect of a given force will move through the fluid. For example, a marble will fall more quickly through air than water and through water more quickly than molasses.

Viscosity of most fluids can be increased by lowering the temperature of the fluid. For example, a marble falls more slowly through cold molasses than molasses at room temperature.

, As noted above, fluids like water and air can generate friction as they move against solid objects. The friction force that an object experiences as it moves through a fluid is called drag (this is sometimes referred to as ""air resistance"", ""water resistance"", etc.) One of the properties of drag is that object with bigger cross-section — that is, objects that present a bigger profile to the fluid as they move through it — have greater drag. The fluid has more total space to push against, increasing the friction on the object as it moves through it.


For instance, let's say that a pebble and a sheet of paper both weigh one gram. If we drop both at the same time, the pebble will fall straight to the floor, while the paper will slowly drift to the ground. This is the principal of drag in action — the air pushes against the big, wide face of the paper, producing drag and causing it to pass through the air much more slowly than the pebble, which has a relatively small cross-sectional area.

, While the cross-sectional area of an object is a good general indication of how great its drag will be, in fact, drag calculations are slightly more complicated. Different shapes interact with fluids in different ways as they pass through them — this means that some shapes (for instance, flat plates), can have a greater drag than different shapes (for instance, spheres) made out of the same amount of material.Since the quantity that measures the relative amount of drag a shape makes is called a ""drag coefficient"", shapes with high drags are said to have large drag coefficients.


For example consider an airplane wing. The shape of a typical airplane wing is called an airfoil. This shape, which is smooth, narrow, rounded, and sleek, passes through the air easily. It has a very low drag coefficient — 0.45. On the other hand, imagine if an airplane had sharp-edged, boxy, prism-shaped wings. These wings would generate much more friction because they wouldn't pass through without great resistance. In fact, prisms have a higher drag coefficient than airfoils — about 1.14., In a phenomenon related to the different drag coefficients of different shapes, objects with bigger, boxier ""body flows"" generally generate more drag than other objects. These objects are made with harsh, straight edges and don't usually get skinnier toward the back of the object. On the other hand, objects with streamlined body flows are narrow, have rounded edges, and usually taper off towards the back of the object — like the body of a fish.


For example, consider the way the average family sedan is constructed today versus the way it was constructed decades ago. In the past, most cars had a boxy appearance and were constructed to have lots of straight, square edges. Today, most sedans are much more streamlined and incorporate lots of gentle curves. This is on purpose — streamlined body flows make a car have less drag, decreasing the amount of work that the engine must do to move the car (and thus increasing the fuel economy)., Some types of materials are permeable to fluids. In other words, they have holes in them that the fluid may pass through. This effectively reduces the area of the object that the fluid is able to push against, lowering the force of drag. This property holds true even if the holes are microscopic — as long as the holes are large enough to let some of the fluid pass through the object, the drag will be reduced. This is why parachutes, which are designed to create lots of drag to slow the speed of the user's fall, are made out of strong, light silk or nylon and not cheesecloth or coffee filters.


For an example of this property in action, consider the fact that a ping pong paddle can be swung faster if a few holes are drilled in it. The holes let air pass through as the paddle is swung, greatly reducing the drag and allowing the paddle to move faster.

, Finally, no matter what shape an object is or how permeable the material it's made from is, the drag it creates will always increase as it goes faster. The faster an object goes, the more fluid it has to move through, and, thus, the greater drag it experiences. Objects moving at very high speeds can experience very high friction due to drag, so these objects usually must be very streamlined or they will fall apart under the force of the drag.


For instance, consider the Lockheed SR-71 ""Blackbird"", an experimental spy plane built during the cold war. The Blackbird, which could fly at speeds greater than mach 3.2, experienced extreme drag forces at these high speeds in spite of its streamlined design — extreme enough, in fact, that the metal fuselage of the plane would actually expand from the heat generated by the friction of the air in mid-flight."

Highlight important words and phrases.,
Write in the margins.,
Review your annotations.",How to Read for Comprehension2," Annotating is a way to keep your mind active as you read. Highlighting or underlining important words and phrases can help you to retain more of what you read and it will also make it easier to go back to find important passages later on. Make sure that you always read with a highlighter and pencil on hand.Underline or highlight things that are confusing, interesting, important, or that you want to ask questions about in class.

, Writing in the margins can help you to draw connections between concepts and register your reactions to the text.Keep a pen handy at all times and jot down your ideas and questions in the spaces next to the text.


You can write whatever you want in the margins. For example, you can sum up your reactions to passages by using words like, “interesting” or “confusing.”
You can also use sticky notes to expand on your annotations.This is a good option if you have a lot to say about what you have just read or if you cannot write in the text, such as because it is a library book or rental.

, After you finish annotating a text, go back over your annotations and read through them.As you do so, write any questions that you have about your annotations or anything that you’d like to bring up in class.For example, if you underlined something because it does not make sense, then you might turn it into a question, such as “How does annotating help you to retain more of what you read?” For simple questions, you can search for an answer to this question on your own. For more complex questions, you can ask your instructor to clarify for you.

Connect the reading to something familiar.,
Define new words as you read.,
Complete the reading in small chunks.,
Try reading out loud.",How to Read for Comprehension3," Drawing connections between a reading and something that is familiar to you can also help you to retain more of the information.Try to draw connections between your existing knowledge and new concepts as you read.


For example, if you are reading about a new concept in a biology textbook, try to relate it to a concept that you already understand.

, Another way to improve your reading comprehension is to look up words that are unfamiliar to you.If you do not understand a word, then it can make an entire sentence confusing. Take a moment to look up new words as you read.


Try keeping a vocabulary journal where you record and define any words that are unfamiliar to you.

, You can also improve your reading comprehension by reading a text in smaller chunks and giving yourself breaks. For example, you could follow the Pomodoro system suggestion to take a quick break every 25 minutes.Set a timer for 25 minutes, read until it goes off, and then take a five minute break.


Another option is to set a goal for how many pages you want to read. You could set a goal to read 10 pages and then give yourself a five minute break after you have done that.
Try getting up and walking around or stretching for a few minutes during your breaks. You can also check your social media profile, watch a short video, or look up something that has been on your mind.

, Reading out loud is an effective strategy for teaching literacy skills to children. Children can understand more complex stories and information when they hear it than when they read it silently.Reading out loud is also extremely helpful for editing your writing.Therefore, reading a text out loud may help you to make connections, understand a difficult text, and retain more of what you read.


You don’t have to read the entire text out loud, but reading certain passages out loud may be helpful. For example, if a passage is confusing, or if you are having trouble staying focused, then reading out loud for a few paragraphs may help.

Gather your notes together.",How to Analyze Fiction," Analyzing fiction involves asking yourself a series of questions and possibly reviewing the material for content. Although most of the work with analyzing fiction is done through thought, notes are important if you plan to discuss or use the information.;
, This is called the plot.


Ask yourself the following questions: What is the main series of the events that take place in the story? Are these events in chronological order or do they flash back or forward? What is the main conflict in the story? What is the turning point in the story?
Plots can be unified, meaning they work in order with a beginning, middle or end. They can be episodic, held together through how they affect the protagonist. Plots can also be polyphonic, which means that smaller subplots are interwoven through the main plot to enhance the overall meaning of the events.

, Where does the story take place? What is the time period? How does the setting affect the story? Could the story be told in another setting? How does it affect the characters?

, This is an important step in analyzing the viewpoint from which the events and the setting are recounted to you. Is it a subjective or objective point of view?


If the narrator uses the words ""I"" and ""me"" throughout the story, it is a first-person narrative. Is your protagonist narrating the book, or is it an observer of the events? Is the narrator reliable or unreliable? Is the character aware of narrating the book?
If the narrator only uses ""I"" and ""me"" in dialog, then it is likely a third-person narrative. Choose whether the third-person is omniscient, all-knowing of the events, or if it is limited, or told from perspective of 1 character.

, You may want to write a list of all the characters in the story. Which character changes most during the plot? This is called the protagonist. Who causes the change in the character? This is called the antagonist. What do the appearance, actions and dialog tell you about their interests and beliefs?


Although the antagonist is sometimes called the villain, there is not always a good guy and a bad guy in a story.

, The theme is the main idea of the story, or the unifying concept. There can be a number of themes in a story. Which theme do you see as the most important?


Take a look at the book in a larger context. What does the story's theme say about the world, human experience or human values? What was the author trying to convey? Themes are highly subjective.

, What imagery does the author use? This is easiest to identify if you take notes throughout reading or watching the story since it can be a chapter or just a few words. In what places does the author evoke your senses: touch, taste, smell, sight and hearing?

, Symbolism means the use of objects, people or elements of the story to represent something else. They often represent subjective concepts, like greed, wisdom or motherhood. For example, the use of the color green throughout a stockbroker's office could represent hidden greed in the character. A fox can represent trickery or stealth.


Do any of the characters symbolize something? Is the setting symbolic? Symbolism is easier to spot the second time you watch or read a story, when you are already aware of the general events of the story and can focus on the underlying meaning.

, Is it formal or informal? Does the narrator make you laugh or feel sad? The ways in which sentences and chapters are structured can have a large effect on how you respond to the story.

, Figurative language is similar to imagery and symbolism. It is a way that the author uses words to mean more than 1 thing. The most common ways to do this are through simile, metaphor and personification. Simile is to compare something using the words ""like"" or ""as."" Metaphor compares to things without using ""like"" or ""as."" Personification is using human qualities to describe inanimate things.


An example of a simile is: the tree branches are like my mother's hair. An example of metaphor is: trees are tangled strands of hair. An example of personification is: the silky branches were braided together.

, If you are writing an analysis, you may want to choose elements to write about or dwell on some more than others.

Connect your writing to broader themes.",How to Analyze the Hero's Journey," The Hero’s Journey is populated with distinct, mythic, universal characters. Being able to recognize these characters can make analyzing the Hero’s Journey an easier task, since you’ll know who the players in the game are, so to speak, and how they interact with each other. Archetypes include:The hero. This is the central figure in the story.
The villain. The hero may come across multiple villains or enemies along his journey, and each helps prepare him for future challenges.
The ally. Much like villains, allies populate the hero’s journey, complementing the hero’s quest and helping the hero meet his goals.
The mentor. This is the hero’s guide and usually appears right before the hero decides to embark on his or her journey.;
, These are the virtues of the hero and can range from perseverance to resourcefulness to integrity. Being able to recognize heroic qualities will ultimately allow you to analyze the inner journey of the hero.

, These are the Ordinary and the Special Worlds. The former refers to the hero’s home, where he begins and ends his journey. The Ordinary World is disrupted by a problem which the hero must solve by going to the Special World. The Special World differs significantly from the Ordinary World both physically and in terms of the emotional development that it prompts in the hero.Recognizing the differences between these two worlds will help you contextualize the hero’s growth and development by placing the hero against different backdrops, each of which prompts him to act a specific way.

, The hero lives a normal life until he feels the Call to Adventure. This is a call to action which prompts the hero to realize that he must embark on a journey to meet a specific challenge. Initially, the hero will refuse this call, content in the safe haven that is the Ordinary World, until he meets his mentor. The mentor instills confidence in the hero and advises or trains him to face his fears. The hero then decides to cross the threshold into the Special World.The hero is often introduced sympathetically so that readers or viewers can relate to him and identify his needs, problems, and motivations as well as the flaws or characteristics which make him unique.
The Call to Adventure can take multiple forms, ranging from a sudden storm to a death to the arrival of a villain.The mentor is typically a person but can also be a map, hieroglyphics, or a log book.The hero is prompted to cross the threshold when he has to confront an event that raises the stakes. This event could be anything from an abduction, as in the film The Searchers, to agreeing to go on a first date, as in Annie Hall.

, Once the hero has crossed the threshold into the Special World, he will encounter trials, allies, and villains. These will all shape the hero in preparation for future challenges and will set the grounds for what to expect in the Special World.


Ask yourself how the hero you are analyzing is being shaped by the characters he encounters. Do they make him act a different way than he would have back in the Ordinary World? Is he more or less confident in his actions? Asking yourself such questions along the way can help you notice nuanced character development.

, The hero will overcome initial obstacles easily and in time approach the Inmost Cave. This could be an actual location or an inner conflict, both of which present significant danger to the hero. The hero will then face an ordeal, an ultimate life-or-death challenge. The hero may come close to death or may witness the death of an ally or a mentor. However, the hero will ultimately win and be rewarded for his brave actions.The reward for overcoming the ordeal could range from an elixir to reconciliation with a loved one., The hero must return to the Ordinary World promptly because of a potentially dangerous event. This could be anything from a situation threatening the destruction of the Ordinary World to the brief reappearance of a villain. The hero then faces his most dangerous feat, his final test. By applying all the wisdom and experience he has gathered up to this point, he is able to destroy his enemy. The hero then returns home, transformed., In his journey, the hero goes through a variety of emotions. He begins by being unaware of a problem, content in the Ordinary World. He is resistant to change until a mentor helps him overcome his fear. He commits to and prepares for change and gains mastery over the situation as he faces the ordeal and the final challenge.Take note of any moments that strike you as the hero experiencing some kind of emotional shift. It could be that where the hero would typically shy away from a challenge, he now embraces it. These are signs which can help you pinpoint where your hero lies along the narrative arc that is the Hero’s Journey.

, Whether you are analyzing the Hero’s Journey in a film, in a work of literature, or in another format, write down the moments along the way that you think represent a change in the character’s demeanor. The list will help you delineate the story as you go along. Return to this list once you have finished the work, then reassess whether these really were the major moments of change.


For example, the Trojan War in The Odyssey may be the crossing of the first threshold in the Hero’s Journey. In that case, Odysseus is being introduced to a world unlike his own, though he has not begun to change just yet.

, Each myth or contemporary work that follows the monomyth structure will represent the stages of the Hero’s Journey differently. Make an outline that shows the various parts of the monomyth format as they pertain to the specific work you’re analyzing. Create and refer to this outline throughout your reading of the literature or viewing of the film.


You can also create an outline after you are done reading or watching a particular work.

, Annotating can help you get a deeper understanding of the text. Your notes will also help jog your memory if you stop reading and return to the text after some time. Ways to annotate a text include:Highlight passages and words that you think are significant.
Write key words and questions in the margins.
Underline any words you don’t know and circle definitions.

, Do this as you read the book or watch the film so that you can then clarify all the points you missed. Writing down any questions that you have and referring to these when you have completed the work can help you notice and fill in gaps in your understanding.

, A strong thesis or claim will be debatable and will not reiterate something that is already generally agreed upon. It is your task, through your analysis, to persuade the reader about a specific, narrow enough aspect of the Hero’s Journey in your given text(s) or film(s).For example, you could argue that in The Matrix, Neo enters the Special World when he chooses between the red pill and the blue pill. Make sure that you can back up this claim with evidence.

, Every claim you make will need to be backed up by evidence from the text so that readers can follow your thought pattern. If you claim that the Call to Adventure in The Hobbit occurs when Gandalf arrives, you should provide evidence that speaks to the larger framework of the novel to explain why this is a turning point.

, Not all works will interpret the Hero’s Journey in the same way. It may be of interest to analyze where the specific story you’re studying deviates from the original, aforementioned structure of the Hero’s Journey and to consider why that is significant.


For example, The Lion King is arguably an example of the Hero’s Journey, but the stages of the journey are not in the typical order. Analyzing this break from the norm might yield important, innovative results., A successful analysis may go over specific examples each of which represent a given stage of the Hero’s Journey. It will analyze each example in depth. At the same time, it will also relate these smaller examples to a broader theme or element of the Hero’s Journey, such as the growth of the hero.


For example, a successful analysis might consider how blowing up the Death Star, arguably the supreme ordeal in Star Wars, affects the development of the hero in the story. What does he learn from this final challenge, and how does it relate to his growth throughout the earlier part of the story?"

Select three passages from a book.,
Type the three paragraphs into Microsoft Word.,
Hit “Spelling & Grammar.” After typing the three paragraphs you selected, you need to hit the spell check button in Microsoft Word.",How to Determine the Reading Level of a Book2," After reviewing the number of pages in the book, pick three pages at random. Try to pick pages from different parts of the book. Then, verify that each page you’ve chosen has at least one full paragraph. If it does not, choose a paragraph from the next page.If the book has 80 pages, select page 5, 25, and 75. Then make sure each page has a full paragraph. If page 25 is an illustration, use a paragraph from page 26.

, Do so slowly and accurately. It’s important that you include all three paragraphs, since this will give you a large enough sample so you can get a true idea of the reading level of the book., When you hit spell check, Word will check your spelling and then generate statistics on the passages you typed. Read through the list until you see “Readability.” Under that, you’ll see the Flesch-Kincaid grade level.If your Word does not display the Flesch-Kincaid Scale level, go to File, then go to Options, click on Proofing, and then click the box that says, “Show readability statistics.” Now, whenever you use the spell check function, Word will display the grade level of whatever you have typed.

Choose 30 sentences from a book.,
Circle and count any word that has 3 or more syllables.,
Calculate the square root of the 3-syllable words.,
Add three to the square root.",How to Determine the Reading Level of a Book3," Make sure to pick 10 from the beginning, 10 from the middle, and 10 from the end of the book. It is important that you choose sentences from all parts of the book, as that will give you a much more accurate idea of the level of the book., Go through your chosen sentences and circle all words that have three or more syllables. This will include repetitions of the same word. Tally these words up. Count:


Hyphenated words as one word.
Long numbers that are spelled out.
Abbreviations as if they were spelled out completely., Take the total number of 3-syllable words in the 30 sentences you selected and calculate the square root. Round the square root to the nearest whole number.To give you an example, if your 30 sentences had 45 3-syllable words, the square root would be 6.7. Round this to 7.
You can calculate square root by hand or by calculator.

, After you round the square root to the nearest whole number, you’ll need to add 3 to that number. This will give you the SMOG grade level (reading level) of the book you choose.


For example, if you had 45 3-syllable words with a square root of 6.7, you should round that to 7, and then add three. This will give you a SMOG grade level of 10. This means the book is appropriate for children in the 10th grade."

Consider reading an annotated edition.,
Start reading and keep reading.,
Make comments in the margins of the text.,
Try reading and learning with a group.",How to Read and Understand Classic Literature2," Many classic texts were written with a vocabulary or historical context that may be lost on contemporary readers. Reading an annotated version, which includes supplemental information and explanations, is an easy way to engage with an otherwise complicated text.


In addition to reading an annotated text, try keeping a dictionary or reader's guide on hand when you read. These supplemental materials can help you work through difficult terms and confusing chapters.

, Even if you struggle with the text, it is important to stick with it if you want to understand it. After sticking with it for a while, the language, setting, and characters may start to become more familiar to you.If you encounter a difficult passage that you do not understand, mark the page and skip it for now. You can always come back to it after you have a basic understanding of the text.
Skip footnotes on your first read because these may slow you down.
Keep in mind that with difficult texts, it is often necessary to read through them more than once. After you have read through a piece of classic literature once, your second read through should be much easier and concepts that were confusing to you should make more sense.

, If you're trying to gain a better understanding of a difficult text, underlining passages may not be enough. Instead, try making comments in the margins to fully engage with the text.Your comments/notes can do any of the following to help you gain a better understanding of the material:


summarize the attached passages
make notes on passages that relate to other passages from earlier/later in the text
write (and answer) questions on anything you didn't understand
agree or disagree with what a passage is saying

, Some readers learn better while working within a group setting. Joining a book club or enrolling in a literature class at your local community college can give you the opportunity to discuss a novel with other readers and gain valuable insight from an instructor.


You can find book clubs in your area by searching online.
If you're not able to enroll in a class at your local college, you may want to consider taking a massive open online course (MOOC). These courses are often free or very affordable and are frequently offered through prestigious educational institutions.

Write a summary or summaries.,
Tell someone about what you have read.,
Watch a film adaptation.",How to Read and Understand Classic Literature3," After you finish the text or finish a chapter, commit to writing a brief summary of everything important that happened. Restrict yourself to about a half page or less, and make sure you address the major plot points, how those points affected each character, and how that chapter fits into the context of the larger book.Write your chapter summaries without consulting the text or your notes. This will help test your understanding of what you've read., Telling something about something you have learned is a good way to help you understand t better yourself. If you have a friend who also has an interest in classic literature, then you might consider telling him or her about the text.


Even if you have not yet finished reading a text, you may benefit from describing what has happened so far in your own words.

, For many readers, visualizing the characters, setting, and plot points of a book make it easier to absorb the narrative.While watching a movie is not a substitute for reading the actual book, it may help you arrive at a better understanding of the book.


For example, if you are reading a play by Shakespeare, then check out a filmed version of the play. While some versions use creative staging and may cut some of the dialogue, you will still be able to see most of the text come to life.

You’ll want to emphasize these important spots so your audience can better understand your message. Some of the ways you can emphasize these words or phrases are to speak them slower, faster, softer, or louder.For example, if you’re reading the word “Boom!” you should increase your volume when you speak this word. However, the words “Shh, listen,” may require you to say them in a soft voice for emphasis.
Don’t rely on being able to remember where you should vary the pace or volume in your reading. Make notes in your text that tell you when to do so and what type of emphasis to use.;
, Figuring out where you should breathe is important in keeping continuity in your reading. You’ll want to make sure you aren’t constantly running out of breath in the middle of a sentence. Before reading your selection to the audience, go through your text and mark where the breaks in the phrases and sentences are. These places are where you should breathe.


When you do take a breath, take one deep enough to allow you to continue reading comfortably until the next marked break., Deciding where to pause in the text provides emphasis and creates a dramatic effect. It also allows your listeners a chance to digest what you’ve just read and let your words sink in. Again, mark the places you will pause in your text to help yourself remember where to do this.


Be sure you indicate which marks are for breaths and which are for pauses. Your pauses will be longer than simply taking a breath., It can help to watch others read aloud as an example of what to do.As you’re watching them, note the things they do that make you take interest or that make it easier for you to understand the text. Keep a notepad handy so you can jot down notes while they are speaking.


Look for videos of engaging speakers online. A quick Internet search should come up with some good examples, like Martin Luther King Jr. or Apple CEO Steve Jobs. Study what they do and try to mimic it in your own speaking.

, Before going in front of your audience, practice reading the text aloud in front of a mirror or some friends or family members. Not only will this help ease any nerves you have about reading aloud in front of others, but it will also give you a chance to get used to what you have to say. Being familiar with the text will make your presentation smoother and allow you to focus on doing the things that will help you connect with and engage your audience.


Make sure you’re practicing emphasizing the words and phrases you’ve marked, breathing at the appropriate times, and adding in any dramatic pauses you’ve identified., When reading aloud, the speed at which you read can significantly affect your listeners’ understanding and attention. Choose a pace that is not too fast or too slow.You should read slow enough that your listeners are able to understand everything you’re saying and have enough time to process the information. However, you also want to keep the story moving and propelling forward so that listeners will not become bored.


Nerves can cause you to speak faster than usual, even though it might not feel like you are. When you’re in front of an audience, speak unusually slow, even if it feels a bit unnatural to you. Chances are you’re talking faster than you think.
When setting the pace, it is better to speak slower than faster. The audience will likely still pay attention if things are moving a little slow, but you may lose them completely by talking too fast., Mumbling or mispronouncing words can make it difficult for your audience to understand what you’re saying. To improve your pronunciation, practice articulating certain sounds more emphatically through exercises.


One thing you can do is highlight each word that ends in the letters t, d, p, b, k, or g, and practice over-pronouncing them. Doing so will help you pronounce your words more clearly in your regular speech.Performing daily tongue twisters can also help you articulate your words more clearly. Some tongue twisters you can use are “red-leather, yellow-leather” and “eleven benevolent elephants.”If there are words you constantly mispronounce, take some extra time learning how to properly say these words and practice until you get it right.

, On the day you will be speaking, keep your voice warmed and ready by singing or humming throughout the day. This will help ensure your voice is ready when you go to speak so you don’t sound strained. You can also repeat tongue twisters throughout the day to relax your tongue and lips.


Repeat the phrase “You see Oz” in an exaggerated manner to stretch your jaw and bring more flexibility to your tongue., What you eat and drink can affect how your voice sounds. Make sure you are drinking plenty of water, including a cup before and after you drink any caffeinated beverages. It is best to avoid caffeinated beverages altogether, if possible. Mints, nuts, and other fatty foods can cause heartburn or hoarseness in your voice, so avoid these when possible., Making eye contact with your audience can be tricky when you also have to read the words on a page. Doing so, however, will help you connect with your audience and engage them in what you are saying. When you’re reading aloud, look at the page only briefly if you can, scanning ahead in the text. Then, raise your head and make eye contact with your listeners, repeating the words you’ve just scanned. Keep a finger on the last sentence you read to help you keep you place in the text.


Make sure you sweep the audience when you make eye contact. Look at people in the front, middle, back, and each side of the room. If you have trouble remembering to do this, try making notes in your text to help remind you.Also, make eye contact with specific people. Whichever direction you’re looking, lock eyes with one person while you deliver an entire sentence. This tactic can help you make a deeper connection with your audience., Listening to someone read in monotone is not only boring, but it may make it harder on your listeners to follow along and understand the main ideas of your story. When you’re reading aloud, use inflection, which is where you stress certain words or phrases, and change the pitch, tone, and volume of your voice for effect.For example, when reading a story, speak in a higher tone during a really exciting part, and a lower tone of voice during parts that are more pensive or sad.
If you’re reading a story with several characters, give them each a different voice. This can be difficult, so decide what each character should sound like and practice their voices ahead of time., While you’re reading, remember to use facial expressions that support the text. You can use facial expressions to show shock, happiness, disappointment, concern, anger, or relief, and myriad other emotions.


For example, smiling will let your audience know you believe in what you’re reading. In turn, you’re audience will be more invested.If you’re reading a passage where there is a surprising or startling event, show that surprise on your face by widening your eyes and opening your mouth.

, In addition to using body language to convey confidence in your message, like maintaining eye contact and smiling, you can also use body language to help convey the message you are trying to get across from your reading. Move your head, arms, and body in ways that reinforce your point. Make sure any body language you use if purposeful and deliberate..


An example could be nodding your head up and down while you read a section of text you want the audience to agree with.
Avoid body language that doesn’t add to your reading. For example, involuntarily moving your hands while you read with no purpose behind it can be distracting to your audience.

, Doing a simple breathing exercise before you have to read aloud can help calm any nerves you have. Learning to control your breathing can help decrease your heart rate and blood pressure, and put your body in a relaxed, calm state. Try this breathing exercise to calm your nerves:


Sit still with good posture somewhere comfortable.
Close your eyes and start breathing in and out through your nose.
Inhale for one count, hold the breath in for one count, and then exhale, counting to four. Hold the breath out for one count.
Set a timer for five minutes and practice this breathing pattern the whole time. You should notice a difference in your mood when you are done., No matter the topic, you’ll likely have a few people in the audience who don’t agree with what you are saying, are bored, distracted, or maybe even asleep. Ignore these people. Instead, focus your attention on the people who are engaged with your reading. Focusing your attention on these people will help you feel more relaxed and confident.


Look for people who are nodding their heads “yes,” sitting up straight, and making eye contact with you., It’s normal to feel nervous when you have to do something in front of a group of people. You may show signs of nervousness, like clammy hands, sweating, shaking, or butterflies in your stomach. When you start to feel nervous, however, try telling yourself, “You’re not nervous, you’re excited!” Convincing yourself you’re excited (which can exhibit many of the same symptoms as nervousness), can help you relax and feel more confident., Despite the saying “Practice makes perfect,” accepting ahead of time that you are going to make mistakes can help you deal with any nerves you’re experiencing. No matter how much you practice, there’s a good chance you’ll fumble over a word or two somewhere during your reading. Public speaking is a common fear, so many of the people in the room will be understanding of any mistakes you make.If you do make a mistake, just keep going. For example, if you say the wrong word or skip a line of text, there’s a good chance your audience didn’t even notice. Unless the mistake will hinder your audience’s understanding, keep moving as if nothing happened."

Take note of verifiable facts as you read.,
Consult referenced data.,
Talk to a scientist.",How to Verify the Science You Read1," Whether the science you read is an article, book, or web page, read the text in its entirety. As you read, pay attention to details. Write down or make a mental note of things that are confusing or unclear. Use a highlighter or pen to underline, circle, or highlight facts that can be verified.Verifiable facts are those which are based in objective reality rather than on opinion, conjecture, or unfounded belief.;
, All verifiable science relies on the work of other scientists to establish its credibility and inspire further studies. One way to verify the science you read is to follow up on the information provided in the study’s footnotes. Check referenced sources to ensure that their conclusions and statistics match those presented in the science literature you’re attempting to verify.If you’re reading science in a popular publication, sources will be cited in the text rather than in footnotes or endnotes.
Non-specialized sources should describe specific studies but might not refer to published peer-reviewed article by name. They might also refer to certain scientists or authors, or to the titles of scientific journals where relevant publications appeared. Use this information to track down more information whenever possible.

, If you’re confused about the science you read, contact a relevant scientist to help you verify it. For instance, if you wish to verify an astronomical report you read, you could contact an astronomer. If you wish to verify a physics issue, contact a physics professor.When you’ve discovered someone to help you verify the science you read, contact them and pose your question. Always be polite and professional when communicating with professional scientists.
Preferably, you will contact more than one expert in the field of the science you read. This will give you a range of opinions regarding whether the science you read is accurate.

, You can find water treatment tablets at sporting goods stores, since they are often used by campers, at pharmacies or stores that cater to travelers.

, Take care to buy a filter that will adequately clean the water in the place you are visiting and rigorously follow the instructions for using and maintaining the filter.

, Make sure that all meals you are served come to you piping hot so you can be sure they've been cooked well enough to kill any microorganisms. Avoid dairy products, which may not have been pasteurized, and shellfish.


Some developed countries do not pasteurize their dairy products, so never assume that dairy products are safe to eat.

,, You have no way to ensure that vendors follow any kind of standard for preparing and storing the food they sell. In many countries, the government doesn't regulate them.

, Check on what fish is available in the place you're visiting and whether any of them are high-risk due to toxins. Avoid this kind of fish, but feel free to eat other kinds as long as they're thoroughly cooked.

, Washing the fruit in tap water will only introduce microorganisms. Peel the fruit carefully so the outside of the peel doesn't touch the fruit and wash your hands after peeling.

Look at declarative statements.,
Check the terms used.,
Beware of facts that are stated absolutely.,
Look for internal inconsistencies.",How to Verify the Science You Read2," If you read science that has lots of declarative statements (for instance, “It is large”) and is low on quantifiable (numbers-based) data, steer clear. Verifiable science will utilize specific numbers, measurements, and sizes when reporting results., Look out for vague or imprecise language. Likewise, avoid science that uses common scientific terms in a novel way. Verifiable science will use terms that other scientists in the field would readily understand.For instance, if the science you read says, “The heart-consciousness will heal you when you are ready,” you can safely discount it, since there is no “heart-consciousness” known to heal the human body.

, Many scientific questions are settled and have been for many years. For instance, the science you read might contain clear and categorical explanations regarding why the stars shine or why trees grow. However, some scientific questions are still open to exploration, and the answers are less clear. If the science you read contains facts stated absolutely with little or no corroborating research behind them, you should consider that a red flag.For instance, the scientific understanding of why we dream remains imperfect. So if the science you read states, “This is why we dream,” instead of a more cautious statement like, “This may be why we dream” or “This could be why we dream,” be wary.

, If the science you read has charts and statistics that do not jive with the conclusions drawn by the author, you can discount the publication as flawed. Likewise, if the science you read has two conclusions which are at odds, or two data points that contradict each other, the science should be considered untrustworthy."
"
Choose trusted publications.,
Only use sources which are free of apparent bias.,
Compare the science you read to other publications on the subject.",How to Verify the Science You Read3," High-quality science might come from trusted governments, universities, individuals, peer-reviewed journals, and some nonprofit organizations. When checking a book or article for quality, it should be written by someone with significant experience in their scientific field. If you’re reading a scientific article or textbook, the scientist who authored it should have a PhD and long experience at a university or research institution.Lay publications will, of course, likely be written by someone without a PhD. The author might even be a student. If the lay publication is trusted, you may consider it a reliable source.
Choosing high-quality sources means someone has already verified the science for you before you read it.

, Poor quality sources are those which have a vested interest in the scientific results or data they are verifying or refuting. For instance, if you read science produced by a fossil fuel company regarding the polluting impact of their products, the company is producing scientific research which could directly impact its fortunes. In such a situation, you should be skeptical of the data.Good sources will provide a high degree of transparency, and include disclaimers regarding funding sources. They will also name all participants in the scientific research.

, One way to verify the science you read is to check it against other sources on the topic. After reading a scientific article or publication, look the topic up in an encyclopedia or another trusted text. This way, you will learn what the consensus view on the subject is.Comparing the science you read against many other publications will help you determine whether the science you read is consistent with mainstream scientific thought.

This means that diarrhea-causing microbes are often present. Stick to bottled water rather than water from a tap or well whenever possible.If you must drink water from a tap, then you should sterilize the water by boiling it for at least three minutes (five minutes if using it to mix baby formula).You can also use iodine tablets to sterilize drinking water or a device with a micro-strainer filter, both of which are available at camping stores.This means you must also avoid ice cubes in beverages since they’re typically made from tap water.(This includes blended drinks, which are blended with ice).
This also means steps you might not consider, including keeping your mouth closed in the shower and using bottled or sterilized water on your toothbrush.;
, Any beverage on which you break the seal—water, soft drinks, juices, beer, wine, etc. are safe to drink.Ensure you break the seal on these, especially juices to ensure they’re not being mixed from concentrate using local tap water.


When it comes to hot beverages that you can’t bottle such as coffee and tea, ensure that they’re served to you piping hot, which will mean that they’re sterilized.For milk, cream, etc. ensure that it has been pasteurized.However, even this isn’t a guarantee. You may choose to use non-dairy creamer during your travels.

, Food from street vendors, especially items that require lots of handling and little cooking, are responsible for many cases of traveler’s diarrhea.While you likely want to experience the local cuisine on your travels, you should avoid it from street vendors.

, You should avoid raw fruits and vegetables unless you rinse and peel them yourself.Ensure that you rinse these items in sterilized water. Request to peel the items yourself whenever possible to make sure the peeled items aren’t handled or rinsed with tap water., Shellfish, rare meats, and raw items such as salads are prime vectors for the microbes that can cause traveler’s diarrhea.Avoid shellfish and raw dishes, and always order items well done since heat kills bacteria.Be cautious around foods that are cooked but then sit around as well, such as with buffets., You should be extra careful when using the utensils in restaurants.Examine them to ensure that they’re clean before using them. Whenever possible, drink beverages directly from the bottle rather than using a cup or glass.

, Washing your hands is always a great step for avoiding germs.If you’re traveling with children, have them avoid touching dirty items and then putting their fingers in their mouths.You should additionally keep a hand-sanitizing solution that is at least 60 percent alcohol on hand for situations when you can’t wash your hands., As with other sources of water, you should be cautious around swimming pools, ponds, etc.Ensure that any swimming pool has been treated with chlorine, and don’t open your mouth in the water.

, Some people will get traveler's diarrhea not from contamination, but from unusual and/or excessively spicy foods. This is not what doctors would consider traveler's diarrhea, but if you really want to avoid diarrhea in general, stick with fairly tame foods.

, Bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol) is a preemptive step that you can also take against developing traveler’s diarrhea. It may prove unnecessary, but it will fight diarrhea before it becomes a problem. Most short-term side effects are harmless (black coloration to your tongue and darkened stool).However, you should not take the medicine for more than three weeks., If you unfortunately come down with a case of traveler’s diarrhea, staying hydrated is the most important step. You need to counteract the water and electrolytes lost to the diarrhea (or vomiting in extreme cases). Try to drink eight to ten glasses of water a day from safe or sterilized sources.Try to drink at least one cup of water for every attack of diarrhea you have.In moderate to severe cases, you will also want to drink an oral rehydration solution (ORS).These solutions contain the exact combination of clean water, electrolytes, and carbohydrates your body needs to stay hydrated. Follow the directions according to the ORS you buy and drink after each episode of diarrhea. You’ll know you’re staying hydrated if your urine maintains a pale color., Eating smaller meals more frequently is a better way to ensure proper nutrition than three big meals a day while you have traveler’s diarrhea.The smaller portions are also less likely to upset your stomach.


Including salty items such as well-cooked soups and sealed sports drinks will also help you replace electrolytes lost to the episodes of diarrhea., Excess potassium loss is another concern in addition to dehydration when suffering a bout of traveler’s diarrhea. You should add some potassium-rich options to replace the lost mineral, such as bananas (remember to peel them yourself), bottled fruit juices, and well-cooked potatoes., Anti-motility agents (loperamide, diphenoxylate, and paregoric) are available over the counter to treat diarrhea. However, you should avoid these options, especially if your symptoms include fever or bloody stool, because they slow the transit time of matter through your digestive tract.

Adjust your sleep schedule ahead of time.,
Exercise while you're on vacation.,
Schedule your return trip with a few days to acclimate.,
Enjoy the experiences and memories you have.,
Introduce elements of your trip into your daily life.,
Reassess your life.,
Carry reminders of home while you travel.,
Know what to expect when you return.,
Bring a vacation souvenir back to your workplace.,
Begin planning your next vacation as soon as you get back.",How to Overcome the Post‐Vacation Blues," Many travelers experience jet lag after traveling, especially if the trip crossed one or more time zones.Jet lag can affect your ability to sleep on a normal schedule, and that lack of sleep quality and/or quantity could contribute to feeling disoriented and depressed that your vacation is over.


Get yourself re-acclimated to your home time zone by getting up and going to bed several hours earlier or later (depending on which way you're traveling) for several days before you plan on returning.
Try to stick to your usual sleep schedule from home while on vacation, if at all possible. Staying on schedule can help make the transition back to your normal life a little easier.
Avoid all alcohol and caffeine for at least three to four hours before you plan on going to bed.;
, Having a workout routine that you stick to while you're traveling can help keep you in shape and reduce stress and fatigue. If you continue that workout regimen after you return from your trip your body will have a sense of physical stability.Exercise also releases endorphins, which can help fight depression as well.Exercising while you travel may seem daunting, but with a little planning it can be very easy to accommodate.
Pack a pair of athletic shoes and some workout clothes, or put on your swimsuit and swim laps in the pool.

, The hardest thing to adjust to when coming back from a trip is returning to your normal work/school schedule. However, if you give yourself a day or two to acclimate back to your normal routine, you can make that transition much easier.Even if you haven't crossed any time zones, it can be difficult to adjust to your day-to-day routine after the fun and spontaneity of a vacation.
If at all possible, try to return to work on a Tuesday. That way you'll skip the hectic nature of a Monday workday and you'll only have a four-day week to return to.
If you plan on resuming work on a Tuesday, make sure you return home on Saturday or Sunday at the latest.

, In many cases, changing the way you think about something can alter the way you feel about it, too. This type of cognitive shift may not happen overnight, but with regular practice you can change your frame of mind to appreciate the experiences you've had, rather than mourning the inevitable return to your daily life.Try to see the enjoyable moments of your trip as part of a lifelong series of new experiences and lasting memories.
Be grateful that you had the chance to experience your vacation. Remember that many people cannot afford to travel or are limited by other life factors.

, While you may not be able to jet set across the globe every week, you can incorporate some of the things you enjoyed into your home life. If you really enjoyed the cuisine on your trip, make a point of learning to cook dishes from that culture at home. If you loved hearing and speaking a foreign language, commit to taking language or culture classes at a local community college.By infusing your home life with elements of your trip, you can keep the excitement and sense of discovery alive wherever you live.
Bringing back elements of your trip can also help you grow as a person and expand your sense of identity and culture.
Just be sure that you're respectful of the cultural elements you bring back, as appropriating certain elements of culture is generally considered offensive in many societies.

, If you find yourself truly unhappy and unfulfilled when you're back at home, perhaps you're not just missing your vacation. Vacations are fun because they offer a break from the tedium and familiarity of life, but if you're miserable being at work or at home, you may want to consider making changes to feel happier. Doing this may help you see the good things in your life and eliminate the things that make you unhappy, like your job or your current neighborhood.Give yourself at least 3 days before committing to any huge life decisions. You may find your everyday life not so horrible after settling back into a routine.
Don't rush into any big life changes, but do use the time after a vacation to reflect on what elements of your life you'd like to change.
Think about whether you feel challenged or appreciated at your current job. You can also reflect on whether you feel comfortable and ""at home"" in your current apartment, house, or neighborhood.
Talk to close friends and family members before making any big decisions. Even if reassessing your life leads you to realize how happy you are with your current situation, you'll have had a great epiphany that might make you feel more content.
Talk to your doctor as well. You may be suffering from depression, which can affect your ability to adjust to life changes.

, Some studies suggest that bringing reminders of home with you when you travel can help reduce the sense of being in a new and different environment. This may help ease the transition back into your normal routine when you return from your trip. Even small, easy-to-pack items like a photograph of your family, your favorite blanket or pillow, or some other frequently-encountered object (like a coffee cup) can help reduce the sense of being away from home and/or your loved ones., For many people, part of the discomfort of returning to work is the stress that comes back after being away. However, one way to cut down on that stress when you return is to contact a coworker a day or two before you'll be returning to work. Your colleague can fill you in on any changes and let you know about anything you might have missed, which can make the transition back into your workplace a little less stressful than coming in blind to those issues.While it's good to keep in contact with coworkers, you also shouldn't be worrying about what's happening at work the whole time you're on vacation.
Try to avoid contacting your coworker(s) until just before you leave to return home. That way you'll be able to enjoy your time away while still getting a quick update to start planning for.

, If you're worried you might have a hard time adjusting to being back at work, school, or just being home in general, having a souvenir around might make that transition a little smoother. Souvenirs can remind you of the fun time you had, and studies have shown that imagining being back in a fun, relaxing place is often enough to relieve stress and anxiety after returning from a big trip.If you have an office, decorate your desk and/or your wall with some photographs of your trip. You can also bring little desk-top statues or a calendar with photos from your vacation.If you don't have your own office or desk, try bringing back something you can wear to work. Even with a strict dress code you might be able to get away with wearing a bracelet or necklace that will remind you of your trip.

, Having another vacation on the horizon, even if it won't be for quite a long time, can help you adjust to being back at work/school. It can be psychologically upsetting to be back in your old routine, but knowing that something just as fun is in your future will brighten up your day and give you something to look forward to.If possible, schedule your vacation time immediately. Just the act of putting time aside for vacation next time is an act affirming that you will have vacation time again.
Any time you find yourself feeling down, think about fun things you'd like to do on your next trip. You can even begin researching the things you'd like to see and do in your free time (but don't do this at work or you may get in trouble).

Read.,
Progress to more challenging reading.,
Find a book group.,
Set personal goals for reading.,
Choose well-known books.,
Enjoy reading.",How to Become Literate," First, read what interests you. Maybe you aren't really into big novels - you find them too unnerving, too much. Instead, why not try magazines at first, or graphic novels? Or pick up a book of short stories - read in small, easy to digest bits at first. But the most important thing you can do is simply commit to reading, even just a little, each day.;
, After a month or two of reading a snippet here or there of this or that, try moving up to things that are a little more challenging. For example, choose a modern classic, like Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (or Philosopher's, depending on where you live) or one of the Lemony Snicket books. These are not just for children - they are books that have been read and enjoyed by millions of people. If you try one of these and still have trouble committing to the longer length of the read, try Reader's Digest - it offers condensed versions of regular books, along with newsy, chatty articles from lots of different magazines.

, Once you've begun reading, you will want to talk over the books you're reading. Lots of people join or form book clubs. It can be simple - call your sister or brother, or a couple of friends. Meet for coffee, and there, agree on a book that you will all read. Meet again a month from that date, and hopefully you will all have finished the book, and can discuss it. Talking over things you've read can really enhance your experience of the book, as you share with friends the feelings the book evoked, or the fun you experienced as the story unfolded. Not only that, but a book club keeps you reading - you know you will be talking about this book in just a few days, so you have a goal in mind as you read.

, Lots of very literate people do what is known as ""parallel reading"" - or reading several books at the same time. Maybe you will keep one in the bedroom and read for a bit before you sleep each night. Maybe you will keep one in the bathroom and read there for a while, or one in the den, etc. Even if you don't wish to get this crazy, you can still set goals, like, ""I want to spend this next year reading classics"" or ""I will read all of Shakespeare's comedies this year, and next year, maybe I'll tackle the tragedies."" Even if you don't achieve the entire goal, you will have still read some of what you set out to read. And that's good. Try setting a time frame within which you want achieve your reading objective.

, If you enjoy reading offbeat things, that's fine. But if you want to become more literate in the conventional sense, you will want to choose books others have heard of. Ask your librarian to help you. Reading well-known works has two benefits: First, it gives you a common frame of reference for things you may hear from lots of other people, and second, it educates you in ways you may not have thought of. For example: Most people have heard of ""To Kill A Mockingbird."" At a party, one of your friends might express distaste for racial bigotry. While none of your friends are bigots (hopefully), this friend is the one who publicly took a stand against it. Saying, ""You're the new Atticus Finch"" is a tremendous compliment to such a person, plus you will seem very literate saying it.

, Perhaps your taste runs more to science fiction than to classic literature - there's no shame in that. Or maybe you like more romantic fare. There's plenty to be found in literature. Or maybe you will find that you like English poetry, but are not so crazy about American. Whatever. Anything you read makes you a more literate person. It exposes you to new words, and to ideas from people all around the world, and from different times in our history. Whatever you like to read, there will certainly be plenty of reading material. So you aren't a Shakespeare buff, but you know all of Asimov's Laws of Robotics - you're still literate, and you will gain more enjoyment from your choices if you read what you are interested in.

Learn about your destination.,
Manage your stress when traveling with others.,
Be mindful of your mood.,
Stay active.,
Practice relaxation techniques.,
Keep in touch with people at home.,
Keep a journal.,
Choose nutritious foods.",How to Mind Your Mental Health when Traveling1," Traveling can be fun, exciting, and relaxing, but it can also be stressful. You may worry about only knowing a few people, not knowing the customs, or not knowing your way around.One way to make traveling less stressful and better for your mental health before you even leave home is get as much information about your destination as you can.


Research the location online or check out travel guides from your local library.
Learn what you can about the weather, terrain, people, language, and accommodations.
Use an itinerary to help you avoid the stress of not knowing when and where you're supposed to be.;
, Traveling with someone you trust can have a lot of benefits. Companions can help alleviate the stress caused by the uncertainty of travel by reassuring you and helping you manage your mental health. If possible, try to travel with someone who is supportive, rather than someone who already stresses you.


If you’re comfortable enough with your travel mate, let them know that you’re trying to mind your mental health while you’re traveling.
If you're traveling with someone who generally stresses you, then make sure you're doing everything you can to manage your stress in other ways.

, This means being aware of what you’re thinking, sensing, and feeling at each moment. It means being fully present in the moment. While you're traveling, make sure you're paying attention to subtle changes in your mood. Doing this can help alert you to potential mental health issues that are arising.Ask yourself several times a day, “How am I feeling right now? What emotions am I experiencing? How does my body feel?”
Be particularly mindful during times of high stress or when there are unexpected events or changes in your travel plans. For example, you might pay extra attention to how your feeling if your flight is delayed.

, Physical activity is an excellent way to maintain your physical health, manage your stress, and mind your mental health. This is true whether you’re at home, traveling for business, or on vacation. It can help relieve tension, energize you, and improve your mood.While you are traveling, make time each day to get some physical activity.


Take a five-minute walk each day after lunch to explore your new surroundings.
If your accommodations have a fitness facility, take advantage of it and start your day with a brief workout.

, Having a variety of ways to relax can greatly reduce the stress of traveling. Being able to calm yourself when you start getting angry, lonely, anxious, or over-excited will help you maintain good mental health while on your trip. You’ll be better equipped to handle unexpected changes and situations in your travel plans.Try deep-breathing to help calm you. Practice slowly inhaling through your nose, holding it for a few moments, then slowly letting it out through your mouth.
Practice visualizing yourself someplace peaceful doing something relaxing and calming.

, It’s not uncommon for people who are traveling to feel isolated and a little stressed because of the unfamiliar setting. This can be especially true for people traveling abroad or for people traveling for a long period of time. It can cause you to feel depressed or anxious. It can also lead to a relapse of pre-existing mental health issues.You can overcome this and mind your mental health by staying connected with friends and family at home.


Make use of technology and social media. Video chat with loved ones to share your experiences with them. Ask them to post pictures and videos of things going on at home so you don't feel left out.
Let someone at home know the details about any changes in your travel plans as soon as you make them. This keeps you safe and helps your stress less — and the stress levels of your loved ones.

, Journaling is a great way to document your travels and preserve your memories. It’s also a way to document, monitor, and work through any emotional or mental concerns you might have while on your trip. Take some time each day to write an entry in your journal.


Write about your experiences and activities while you’re traveling. Make note of both positive and negative events.
Include information about your mood, stress levels, and mental health. For example, you might write, “I was really stressed when my connecting flight was delayed. It made me feel anxious.”

, When you’re traveling it can be easy to eat foods that look and taste good, but lack nutritional value, as you sample the local cuisine. Make sure you’re balancing this by also eating foods that are good for you. Choose foods like vegetables, fruits, lean protein, and whole grains that can help you stay focused, give you energy, boost your mood, and support your brain health.Avoid processed foods and those high in refined sugar like those sold in most transportation and travel vending machines.
Make sure you are eating plenty of protein and whole grains. For example, you might select grilled chicken on whole wheat flatbread for lunch.
Drink plenty of water. If necessary, take or buy bottled water to make sure that you’re staying hydrated.

Update your mental health professional.,
Continue taking your medication.,
Set up services in that area.,
Visit a local support group.,
Avoid substance abuse.",How to Mind Your Mental Health when Traveling2," Letting them know about your travel plans is a good idea for several reasons. They can help you plan what services you'll need to continue and which you can temporarily suspend while you’re traveling. They can also help you access services at your trip location.


For example, you might say, “I’m going to be traveling soon. Could we talk about how I should handle my treatment plan while I'm gone?”
Or, you may want to ask, “Are there parts of my treatment plan that I can take a vacation from while I'm traveling? Which parts should I continue?”

, If you're currently taking medication to manage a mental health issue, it’s important that you continue taking it as prescribed while you’re traveling. The novelty, excitement, and even relaxing feeling of travel can have you feeling you don’t need your medication. But changing your medication could cause mental health issues or other negative side effects.Plan for things like changes in time zone or being in transit when it's time for you to take your medication.
Make sure you refill any needed medications before you leave for your travels.
Check airline and other transportation policies regarding the proper way to pack and label medication.
If you are traveling abroad, check to make sure there are no border restrictions on any of your necessary medications.

, This can be an important step if you’re traveling for an extended period of time or if your mental health professional recommends it. Having access to therapy and other forms of treatment can help you prevent mental health issues while you're traveling.


Ask your mental health professional about helping you set up services at your destination. You might say, “Could you help me find a reputable psychotherapist in that area?”
Ask them to forward or provide you with any documents you might need to receive the appropriate services. You could say, “Could you send an overview of my treatments to my travel therapist?”

, This is a good way to meet people in that area, as well as help you cope with the stress of traveling and any mental health concerns you might have. The people in the support group can provide encouragement, companionship. They can also provide strategies for minding your mental health in general and while you’re traveling.Consult a website like Mental Health America at http://www.mentalhealthamerica.net/find-support-groups for information about support groups in your destination area.
Consider joining an online forum or support group if you aren't confident about navigating the area or if you’re traveling to an area without an appropriate support group available.

, When you’re traveling it can be easy to feel as though it’s okay to indulge a little in alcohol or other substances. It may be legal or even encouraged where you’re traveling to. You should be careful, though, to avoid thought- or mood-altering substances while you’re traveling. They can interfere with medications and other treatments. They can also put you in danger by altering your perception and functioning. In addition, they can cause a relapse in mental health problems


Look into ways to explore and enjoy your destination that don’t involve alcohol or other substances.
Practice politely, but firmly, declining anything that may have a negative effect on your mental health.

Rest and relax.,
Treat yourself.,
Strengthen relationships.,
Increase your gratitude.",How to Mind Your Mental Health when Traveling3," You probably have a number of responsibilities and obligations that keep you busy in everyday life. During your travels you may feel the same urgency to do everything, go everywhere, and see everything. But this can leave you feeling more stressed and tired than you do at home. Use your trip as an opportunity to get some of the rest and relaxation you miss out on at home.This can help you release stress and tension in general, which helps promote good mental health.


Take advantage of layovers and other down time by taking a brief nap, reading, journaling, or peacefully exploring your destination.
On professional travel, carve some time out from preparing, meeting, and negotiating to just sit quietly and calm your mind.
Take into account the effects of jet lag and time zone changes and make sure you’re giving your body time to adjust.

, It’s natural to want to look and feel a little special when you’re away from home. In fact, it’s a good thing. Splurging on yourself a little can boost your self-esteem, mood, and outlook on life. In other words, it helps you maintain your mental health. So, do something special to treat yourself while you’re traveling.


Put together a new outfit or try out a new hairstyle to wear out and about on your trip.
Treat yourself to a special meal (including dessert) and try some of the local cuisine. Remember to keep most of your other meals healthy, though!

, If you’re lucky enough to be able to travel with a loved one or a friend, use the trip as an opportunity to strengthen your relationship with them. The time together sharing new experiences without the stress of day-to-day life can boost the quality of your interactions.This can help relieve any tension in the relationship, which means less stress and better mental health for you.


For example, you could use your trip as a way to rekindle the romance with your partner.
Or, as another example, if the relationship between you and your teen is strained, you could use the trip as a way to reestablish communication by talking about the experience.
Talk to your travel companion about anything concerning you. They can offer support and help you problem-solve.

, It can be easy to get bogged down in your day-to-day life and lose sight of all the things you have to be grateful for. But evidence suggests that being grateful can help promote good mental health by helping you to remain positive about yourself and your life. Traveling is one great way to take a step back and appreciate all that you have in life.Be grateful for the small, positive, things that happen while you're traveling. For example, you might be grateful that your train left on time and wasn’t full.
Or, for instance, you might appreciate the amenities you have at home compared to what's available at your travel location.

In the U.S., you can call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 or Safe Alternatives at 1-800-366-8288.
The International Association for Suicide Prevention at http://www.iasp.info/resources/Crisis_Centres/ provides a great list of crisis services worldwide.

, Knowing that you have someone whom you can alert if there’s a problem and will be checking in on you can help you manage a mental health emergency when you’re traveling. This might be your travel companion, a person you trust in the destination location, or someone at home.


Ask someone close to you at home to check on you every so often. You might ask your friend, “Could you call me every few days just to check in and make sure everything's going well?”
Make sure your emergency contact has up-to-date information regarding how to get in contact with you, where you’re staying, insurance information, medications, etc.

You may want to use lighter creams and moisturizers in warmer, more humid places.
Carry a couple of soft washcloths or towels with you to avoid irritating your skin. You can also use your hands to lather up without rubbing too harshly.

, One thing that can happen as a result of too much sun exposure or damage to your skin from a scrape or scratch is the formation of psoriasis plaque at the injured site. Protecting your skin at your destination can minimize the risk of developing new psoriasis or causing existing patches to flare up.Cover your skin with loose, comfortable clothing. If you’re in a cold climate, layer clothing for warmth and natural moisture.
Apply sunscreen every couple of hours to prevent sunburn. Use a water-resistant sunscreen with broad-spectrum protection of SPF 30 or higher.

, Keeping your skin moisturized can minimize flare-ups and itching.Protect your skin with a layer or moisturizer in the morning and evening.

, Often, car sickness is caused by motion outside the car. For this reason, you may find relief when you block your view. Alternatively, special motion-blocking eyewear may accomplish the same result.


Simply closing your eyes may help, especially if you can fall asleep.
You can also try sunglasses or sleep masks to block your view enough to curtail the symptoms of car/motion sickness.
Dry eyes or fatigued eyes can also contribute to motion sickness. Using eye drops or splashing water on your face can help. Taking out contact lenses and using glasses instead may be beneficial.

, Some people benefit from ginger products to alleviate motion sickness. You can try ginger chews, ginger ale, ginger cookies, and many other ginger products. If you are prone to motion sickness, keep one or more of these products on hand to take if you should become sick., Some data has shown that eating something dry, such as soda crackers, may help alleviate the symptoms of motion sickness. This is because the dry food may soak up excess acid in the stomach.

, Putting pressure on a particular point of your body may help treat the symptoms of motion sickness. Specifically, Nei Guan—acupressure point P6, on the underside of the wrist—may be pressed to help with an upset stomach.Locate by finding the area in which a wristwatch would lie. Find the mid-point on your wrist, which is a small ""valley"" in which you can feel your tendons. Pressing your fingertip there should offer relief in about 10 seconds.
If you have a wristwatch or tight wristband, you can make a pressure band to help with motion sickness. Make a small wad or paper or paper-like substance (like a gum wrapper) about the size of a pea. Wedge this in the wristband as described in the pressure point above.

Plan ahead.,
Make a schedule and preserve the special nature of mealtimes.,
Make your coffee or tea at home.,
Buy a cooler.,
Eliminate distractions.,
Make informed choices.,
If you're like most drivers, staying alert during a long drive can be challenging but is obviously crucial to safe driving.",How to Eat Healthy While Traveling in a Car," While it's easy to say, it's harder to implement but planning ahead is a way of overcoming the unhealthy eating choices. Package your home cooked meals the day before your trip. Use thermos style lunch containers to keep foods warm where needed. You'll be more likely to bring food with you on a trip if it's already pre-packaged, easy to eat while driving, and handy.


Prepare of purchase plenty of healthy snacks such as small carrots, cut cucumber slices, fruits, snack bars, nuts, etc. Ensure that items are in easy-to-open and hold bags. Few to none of the drive-through windows will sell you an apple, a banana or a handful of nuts.
Don't try to cook food for taking on the morning you're heading off––you won't as it will seem like a waste of time, especially amid last-minute packing and fixing the house, etc. However, you can usually spare 5 minutes or so to warm up pre-cooked food for placing in the thermal lunch container.

, You know when you get hungry. If you eat dinner every day at 6, you'll be hungry right around that time, every day, wherever you are. So don't let hunger surprise you. Try to stick to your normal eating schedule, even when you are on the road. This will prevent you from overeating, eating too frequently or getting your internal clock all out of whack. If you delay eating until later, it's likely you'll feel cranky and over-indulge when you do actually stop to eat.


Don't make the mistake of treating meals as temporarily unimportant when on a long trip. They remain important because they provide a chance to break the journey, walk around and stretch and relax, refocus you and give you a chance to realign your posture. Choosing a lovely spot to eat, such as a park, by a river or a tourist spot can also give you the opportunity to discover something interesting or beautiful, which is different from your usual day-to-day routine.
Stopping when hungry is also a perfect opportunity to refresh, making the continued drive safer because you'll be more alert, especially from exercising such as walking about and stretching.

, Making coffee or tea, or whatever beverage you like to drink, will allow you to drink it the way you like it, when you need it. A thermos full of coffee or tea will go a long way and will prevent you from being tempted at the drive-through window when you stop for your daily brew. ""Would you like a sugar-packed doughnut with that coffee?"" You'll be tempted to think: ""It's only 78 cents... don't mind if I do!"" Also, coffee brewed at home may contain less caffeine (commercial machines extract more caffeine due to their better constant heat retention) and may be more flavorful (a subjective decision) than the coffees you would get from fast food outlets and you're likely to put less sugar in your drink if you make it yourself. And if you like coffee, try making cold-brewed coffee ahead of the trip––it's less acidic than its hot counterpart (less heartburn)., If you take long trips, a cooler and a couple of bottles of water put in the freezer the night ahead (hint––this means planning) will save you tons of money and will also help you eat more healthily. The cooler can keep both food and drinks cool, allowing you to have luncheon meats, dairy products and other perishables like berries.


If you're on a very long trip, consider investing in a small car fridge that runs off the power of the car or even a solar version. This will allow you to take along milk, meat, dairy products, vegetarian analog products, etc. and you can make good meals from these items. Throw in a small cooking stove used for camping and you have everything you need for a meal within 10 to 30 minutes.

, Whatever it takes, keep your eyes on the road and don't look at the billboards. Many of these will show you juicy looking burgers and golden fries, targeted at making you pull in to the next fast food franchise coming up in the next 50 miles (80 km). You're most unlikely to ever see a billboard advertising anything to encourage you to eat healthily. Turn off the radio, bring along an interesting audiobook or a bunch of podcasts and listen away. You can also keep your eyes occupied by trying to make up words from people's license plates. After a while, you won't even notice the billboards and their inviting morsels.


If you can, stay away from busy highways where most of those billboards are found. Take the scenic route! You'll have plenty of beauty to feast on instead.

, If you must eat from the drive-through window, take along a book like ""Eat this, not that"" or download one of the many apps will let you see the nutritional value of the items on your favorite fast-food joint menu. And even if you're not a vegetarian, reading the suggestions for vegetarians in fast food outlets will often provide healthier choices (not always, use your common sense). Reading ahead about what is healthier in the array of fast food choices will enable you to make better informed choices.


Any fast-food chain where you can pick and choose what goes into your meal is always best. Think Subways or Harvey's. You can at least decrease the amount of mayo that goes into your sandwich, chose a whole grain bread and less fatty meats.
Think thrifty. The reason why many food items find themselves on the ""dollar menu"" is because of their smaller portions. They may not be healthy choices, but at least they don't typically contain 1000 calories each. If you must indulge in something calorie-laden, keep the portion really small.

, Caffeine can be one choice but too much caffeine can bring about the jitters, headaches and other problems and not everyone wants to resort to dosing up on caffeine anyway. The following food tricks might be of use to help keep you alert when driving:Begin each travel day with a healthy breakfast. Don't skip this important energy starter of the day. Focus on whole-grain toast or bagels, peanut butter, fruits, cereal with yogurt and eggs.
Eating fruit on an empty stomach: This will ensure that the glucose in the fruits enters your bloodstream faster, giving you a quick boost.
Having more frequent meals during the drive than usual. Instead of 2-3 meals, try 4-5 meals to keep your glucose levels even. Each meal should be light but packed with energy giving foods.
Avoid eating too much meat as it takes longer to digest, requiring more energy.
Drink a lot to stay hydrated.
Include whole grains in the food you're eating. These will mete out energy gradually and avoid the high followed by a crash of refined and processed foods.
Choose healthy snacks mid-afternoon, a time many people crave something sugary to inject more energy. Try fruit, crackers and cheese, nuts and vegetable pieces with hummus or salsa.
Apples are considered by some to be helpful due to the chewing activity and the fructose levels. Equally, peeling an orange and releasing its strong aroma may be helpful too.
Chew peppermint flavored chewing gum. The chewing activity and the strong mint flavor can help keep you alert.
Don't overdo foods that can make you feel sleepier but do have them closer to bedtime. These include foods containing a lot of tryptophan such as milk, bananas, turkey breast and low-fat cheese.;

Prevent motion sickness-related nausea.,
Sit where you will feel the least amount of motion.,
Avoid visual stimuli for motion sickness.,
Use medication.,
Consume ginger.,
Avoid smoking.",How to Deal With Car Sickness2," Do not travel on an overly full or very empty stomach. Motion sickness is usually aggravated by a full stomach, so avoid heavy meals before travel. Any food that you know doesn't agree with you should be avoided. This includes foods that might make you feel too full as well as foods that are spicy or high in fat.Some people may also have trouble travelling on an empty belly.
Avoid having foods in the car that have strong odors as well, as this can also help prevent nausea.

, Because motion sickness results from a discrepancy between the motion, you feel versus the motion you see, choosing a seat where you do not feel as much motion (or any) could help you prevent car sickness. The front seat of a car usually is the best place.Never sit backwards of the direction of travel—this can activate car sickness.

, Some of the things that can make you get car sick are visual in nature. For instance, you should not read while travelling in a car. The movement can make it difficult to focus on the words, making reading while riding in a car dangerous for those who suffer from car/motion sickness.It might help to keep your gaze focused on a single point as your travel to help minimize the effects of car sickness.
If you are riding with someone else who gets car sick, seeing them get sick—or even talking about it—may trigger car sickness.

, Several over-the-counter medications including anticholinergics such as scopolamine, antispasmodics such as promethazine, and sympathomimetics such as ephedrine are available to help prevent motion sickness. Most of these contain a drug called meclizine, which is anti-nausea, as well as being an antihistamine and antispasmodic. It specifically targets the area of the brain that is related to motion to help prevent motion sickness that people can experience in cars (and other vehicles).If your motion sickness is especially severe, your doctor may prescribe scopolamine, which can be administered orally, intravenously, or topically (on the skin).
Always discuss drug interaction and side effects with your doctor or pharmacist before using prescription medication.

, Ginger can be used as an alternative medication that may be an effective way to prevent car sickness for some people. For prevention, you can mix 1⁄2 teaspoon (2.5 ml) of ginger powder with a glass of water and drink it down or take two ginger capsules 20 minutes before travelling.Keep ginger products on hand to aid in the prevention of car sickness. Carrying ginger candies or ginger cookies in your purse or pocket might come in handy.

, Smoking can be a cause of motion sickness, so it is best to avoid smoking.A small study showed that nicotine deprivation overnight avoided motion sickness susceptibility. If you are a habitual smoker, you may be able to curtail your smoking in a variety of ways. For additional information, check out: https://www.wikihow.com/Quit-Smoking.

Accept that you might be one of the people built to be miserable.,
Know how to move the needle.,
Get on the ""hedonic treadmill"".,
Buy happiness.,
Immerse yourself in noise.,
Commute long distances.,
Have no control.,
Shun the ""self-esteem"" hawkers.,
Choose your friends wisely.",How to Use Modern Psychology to Live a Miserable Life," Blame the cortical lottery.About half of all humans are born in the negative half of the ""affective style"" spectrum. In a nutshell, some people are just born pessimists.


Thanks to your genes, you are predisposed to focus on threats, and lack confidence to deal with them. You develop coping styles that rely heavily on avoidance and other defense mechanisms. You work harder to manage your pain than to fix the problems. You tend to think that the world is unjust and uncontrollable, and that things turn out for the worst.Knowing this can help you stop trying to fit a square peg in a round hole, so to speak. With all the emphasis on happiness, your life might be more functional knowing that you're miserable by default, and that nothing is unusual or dysfunctional about that.;
, In order to be functional, it's good to become familiar with ways to move around on the spectrum of misery and happiness. There are three clinically-proven methods to move negative affective predispositions toward the positive end of the spectrum; either avoid these methods completely or use just enough of them so that your productive misery doesn't kill you:


Meditation,Cognitive Behavioral Therapy,Medication (mainly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors)., Work as hard as you want, accumulate all stuff that you want, and get fabulously famous. This will raise your expectations, you will keep wanting more, and be no better off than you were before., Those who think that money can't buy happiness just don't know where to shop.Buy things that make you happy. Preferably, ostentatiously expensive things, like a Gucci Soft Stirrup Crocodile Shoulder Bag, Shipwrecked 1907 Heidsieck (if you can't afford that, Cristal works too), Nike Air Force 1 sneakers or, if you are a revolutionary, the Nike Ajax surface-to-air-missile. Unlike spending on unforgettable experiences with family and friends, spending on ""stuff"" won't keep you happy for too long. This is the ""adaptation principle"" at work., Humans never fully adapt to noise, especially if it is variable or intermittent.It is guaranteed to increase your stress. Move to a busy intersection, if you can.

, People don't fully adapt to long commutes, particularly if these involve driving in heavy traffic. Even after years of commuting, those who deal with heavy traffic arrive at work and home with higher levels of stress hormones.Bonus points if you have long traffic-ridden commutes because you bought a big house in an expensive neighborhood far away from work. Although people don't adapt to traffic, they quickly adapt to having more space., A sense of control is one of the most effective ways to increase your sense of engagement, energy, and happiness.You may need to assert some control to produce your painting, novel, music, or revolution, but try not to assert more control than is absolutely necessary.

, Misguided attempts by schools, self-help gurus, and the popular press to raise self-esteem in children have fostered narcissism, and other dark sides of high self-esteem.The popular obsession with ""Beauty"" has led to disorders such as anorexia and bulimia. But although attractive people are not generally happier than unattractive ones, some improvements in a person's appearance do lead to lasting increases in happiness.So if you don't think highly of yourself, or of how you look, you're exactly where you need to be.
, This is the big one.The strength and number of your relationships trump all other factors in your pursuit of misery.Bad relationships make people miserable, and miserable people attract bad relationships(misery does, in fact, love company). People never adapt to personal conflict.You can count on that bullying patron, editor, lead vocalist, grim-and-determined comrade, or spouse to constantly add to your misery, even when they are not physically present (just ruminate on the conflict).

Determine the obstacles you want to overcome. Choose something that you really desire. Make sure it is consistent with your other goals, specific and detailed, not harmful to others, and is challenging but realistic.;
, Make sure the autosuggestion is believable to yourself. If you don’t believe it, then it will not work. For example, instead of saying “I make $100,000 per year,” say “I choose to earn $100, 000 per year.”, In order for an autosuggestion to work, it must trigger feelings. The more meaningful the the autosuggestion is to you, the more effective it is., The autosuggestions are for you and no one else. Don’t make your autosuggestions based on what you want other people to be or how they think you should be. Make the autosuggestion what you want to be

, Autosuggestions are more effective when paired with positive thinking. Using positive statements also keep you motivated to accomplish your goals.


Avoid negativity. Avoid using negative phrases such as “I cannot,” “I will not,” or “I do not want.” For example use “I am brave,” instead of “I am not afraid.” , This can cause stress, which will interfere with your meditations and goals.

, Use meditation, sleep, or writing to practice autosuggestion. The more your practice your autosuggestion, the faster it will work.

Give the myth a miss.,
Understand the difference between ""passionate love"" and ""companionate love"".Passionate love is the forest fire; companionate love the cool, cool river that saved the two dears


Passionate love is a ""wildly emotional state in which tender and sexual feelings, elation and pain, anxiety and relief, altruism and jealousy, all exist in a confusion of feelings"".,
Say no to drugs.,
Understand the life cycle of passionate love.,
Understand the life cycle of compassionate love.,
Understand your Attachment Styles.,
Understand Effective Communication.",How to Use Modern Psychology to Understand Romantic Love," The modern myth of true love, upon which most Western-educated youth are raised, involves these beliefs: true love is passionate love that never fades; if you are in true love, you should marry that person; if love ends, you should leave that person because it was not true love; and if you find the right person, you will have true love forever.
If true love is defined as eternal passion, it is biologically impossible. To see this, and to save the dignity of love, you have to understand the difference between two kinds of love: passionate and compassionate.;
, Passionate love is the love you fall into. It is what happens when Cupid's Golden Arrow hits your heart, and, in an instant, the world around you is transformed. You crave union with your beloved. You want, somehow, to crawl into each other.
Companionate love is ""the affection we feel for those with whom our lives are deeply intertwined"". Companionate love grows slowly over the years, as lovers apply their attachment and caregiving systems to each other, and as they begin to rely upon, care for, and trust each other.

, Passionate love is a drug. Its symptoms overlap with those of heroin (euphoric well-being, sometimes described in sexual terms) and cocaine (euphoria combined with giddiness and energy).Passionate love alters the activity of several parts of the brain, including parts that are involved in the release of dopamine.Any experience that feels intensely good releases dopamine, and the dopamine link is crucial here because drugs that artificially raise dopamine levels, as do heroin and cocaine, put you at risk of addiction.Since passionate love is a drug, it must wear off eventually. The brain reacts to a chronic surplus of dopamine, develops neurochemical reactions that oppose it, and restores its own equilibrium. At that point, tolerance has set in, and when the drug is withdrawn, the brain is unbalanced in the opposite direction: pain, lethargy, and despair follow withdrawal from cocaine or from passionate love.

, Passionate love does not turn into compassionate love. Passionate love and compassionate love are two separate processes, and they have different time courses. Their diverging paths produce two danger points, two places where many people make grave mistakes.


Passionate love ignites, it burns, and it can reach its maximum temperature within days. During its weeks or months of madness, lovers can't help but think about marriage, and often they talk about it, too. Sometimes they even offer and commit to marriage. This is often a mistake. People are not allowed to sign contracts when they are drunk, and people should not be allowed to propose marriage when they are high on passionate love.
The other danger point is the day the drug weakens its grip. Passionate love doesn't end on that day, but the crazy and obsessional high period does. Breakups often happen at this point, and for many couples that's a good thing. But sometimes breaking up is premature, because if the lovers had stuck it out, if they had given compassionate love a chance to grow, they might have found true love.

, Companionate love looks weak in the six-month graph because it can never attain the intensity of passionate love. But if we change the scale from six months to 60 years, it is passionate love that seems trivial, a moment's flash, while companionate love can last a lifetime.
True love does exist, but it is not, and cannot be passion that lasts forever. True love - the love that undergoes strong marriages - is simply strong companionate love, with some added passion, between two people who are firmly committed to each other.

, Attachment theory designates three main ""attachment styles"", or manners in which people perceive and respond to intimacy in romantic relationships: Secure, Anxious, and Avoidant.People with each of these attachment styles differ in their view of intimacy and togetherness, the way they deal with conflict, their attitude toward sex, their ability to communicate their wishes and needs, and their expectations from their partner and the relationship. To choose the right mate, or to improve your relationship with the one you already have, it is important that you understand each other's attachment styles, and learn how to work through your differences.Secure people feel comfortable with intimacy, and are usually warm and loving. Just over 50% of people, both children and adults, are Secure.
Anxious people crave intimacy, are often preoccupied with their relationships, and tend to worry about their partner's ability to love them back. Around 20% of the population are Anxious.
Avoidant people equate intimacy with loss of independence, and constantly try to minimize closeness. Around 25% of people are Avoidant.
""Disorganized"" people, who are both anxious and avoidant, represent around 3 to 5% of the population.

, You can use effective communication (a) to choose the right partner - it's the quickest, most direct way to determine whether your prospective partner will be able to meet your needs; and (b) to ensure that your needs are met in the relationship, whether it is brand-new or long-standing.
Effective communication works on the principle that we all have very specific needs in relationships, many of which are determined by our attachment styles.
If you are Anxious, turn to effective communication when you feel you are starting to resort to protest behavior. When something your partner said or did (or did not say or do) has activated your attachment system such that you feel that you are on the verge of acting out (by not answering calls, threatening to leave, etc.) stop yourself. Then figure out what your real needs are, and use effective communication instead (but only after you have thoroughly calmed down, which may take a day or two).
If you are Avoidant, you will know for sure that you ought to use effective communication when you feel the need to bolt. Use it to explain to your partner that you need some space, and that you'd like to find a way of doing so that is mutually acceptable. Suggest a few alternatives, making sure to take care of your partner's needs. By doing so, you're more likely to get the breathing space that you need.
FIVE PRINCIPLES OF EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION


Wear your heart on your sleeve – be genuine and completely honest about your feelings.
Focus on your needs – get your needs across. Take your partner's well-being into consideration as well. Focus on what you are trying to accomplish, and not on your partner's shortcomings.
Be specific – state precisely what is bothering you.
Don't blame – never make your partner feel selfish, incompetent, or inadequate. Be thoroughly calm before you communicate.
Be assertive and unapologetic – although people with different attachment styles may not see your concerns as legitimate, they are essential to YOUR happiness, and expressing them authentically is crucial.

Never dodge questions.

,
Always answer question and queries with as much detail as possible.",How to Understand the Child's Mind," It is important to let children speak without being interrupted and to listen carefully to what they are saying. This is so important! Start when they are just learning to babble, as they are trying to communicate. Stop, look and try to understand what they are saying. If nothing else, your complete attention, eye contact and response helps them feel validation and love.


Although, at times, their stories do not make a lot of sense, they often relate to facts; to lived moments, to things that they have heard or seen.
Children have the capacity to embellish stories, add a few flying ponies or talking butterflies to them, but they do not all have the capacity to lie, be conniving, or create problems. However, at, approximately, age five, most kids learn how to lie, so they won't always be innocent. Therefore, if a child, for instance, mentions that his grandma doesn't like someone, you might want to question the validity of the statement. Don't worry, you probably won't like your daughter-in-law either, some day, circle of life.;
, Always look them in the eye, this is very important. Not only will you know what the child wants and feels, they will understand how you feel. They will be validated through your love of understanding.

, It is important to think like them in a conversation in order to better understand them, because if you just think like an adult you may lack understanding and find yourself with slightly less patience, if you talk very adult-like they will ask questions about word meanings and it will become a never ending conversation.

, Expose them to as much as you possibly can and see how they react to it. While strolling or walking, every little thing along that path such as sounds, smell, touch, etc. adds to their learning and imagination. They are sponges for the first five years and it is up to you to give them all the information they will need for the future. Take your time, slow down, and see how their minds work by how they interact with the world. A child's imagination is extraordinary.

, Their art work often represents their feelings. Do some children draw their dads smaller than anyone else? This behavior could be a sign that they are upset from something their dads did. Are their baby sisters missing from their pictures? This behavior could be a sign of jealousy (if you come across this, don't argue that the sister or whoever should be included, because they can't help how they feel, however it might be a good idea to ask questions such as "" where is your sister in the picture?""). Adults should take the time to analyze what kids say, In order to comprehend children, parents don't have to be psychologists. But they should know their kids better than anyone else.

, Enter their world of imagination and make yourself at home, abandoned adult feelings of embarrassment and shame as crawl like a baby, meow like a cat, and jump up and down like a monkey and then watch the sparkle in their eyes. When you become a part of their world, happiness overcomes them and makes them want to connect with you more and more. This is when adults can bond with their children on the deepest level, bond with them in their world. By engaging in activities that kids enjoy, parents can transfer to them some of their traditions, morals, and beliefs and strengthen their bond with their children. This will not only give you a better understanding of your childs mind, but also a healthy relationship that both you and the child will cherish.

, Let children give you roles sometimes. They might want to be the mommy or daddy for a change. Now if this is the case, you might be in for a treat because they might reenact your behavior ( or how they see you any how); reenact the way they do things too, the way they talk and even discipline. This is how children might see them. Are parents being rough, yelling too much, and nagging? Take notes, because children do. What they see in you will partially form the parents they will be or not want to be later on in life.

, Visual connections make conversations with kids more personal. Don't talk too fast or they'll stop listening, and don't use big words. Adults should use simple sentences when they speak to children, should show them love through uncomplicated speech. For instance, a parent might say, "" Eat your food, my love, so you can grow big and strong"" or ""Sit far from the T.V to protect your beautiful eyes"". They will then see parental messages in a loving way rather then in a nagging way.

,, Never lie, and even if you feel like they're to young, just simplify it without the sugar coating! ( or in the future it could cause an argument).

Do some research.,
Find out where they were educated and where they grew up.

,
Try to understand the serial killer's actions and thoughts in your own head.,
Find out about their home life when they were a child.,
Try to find a common trait (race, occupation, age, gender, hometown)that each of the victims share.,
Do some research about common psychological disorders that many serial killers have.,
Research what books the serial killer has read and what religious background s/he comes from.,
Look at autopsy reports of the victims.",How to Understand a Serial Killer's Intentions," Search for biographies or other information about the particular killer you are trying to find out more about. Any information you can find on the serial killer in question is helpful to understand him or her as a person. If you don't know who the killer is yet, look at other serial killers who used the same killing techniques. Looking at similar serial killers is also a good idea if you do know the identity of the serial killer.;
,, You might attempt to understand their role and precisely why they may have done what they did. Few serial killers will kill for absolutely no reason; there is often a motive, even if it is not necessarily sound. Understanding their psychology and background helps here. They might have some kind of mental illness.

, In many cases, the serial killer had a dysfunctional home life, which played a big role in why they committed the crimes that they did.

, This might play a role in figuring out the killer's motives.

, Some disorders to look up include:


Antisocial Personality Disorder
Narcissistic Personality Disorder
Munchausen Syndrome
Bi-polar Mood Disorder

, Use the information you find to speculate about what conclusions the serial killer may have drawn from the books as well as his own past experiences. Could those have affected the way the serial killer viewed the world?

, Were they killed slowly or quickly? were they drugged? Were they mutilated by the killer? This could help figure out the psychological state of the killer.

Stop thinking of coworkers as friends.,
Speak up.,
Analyze situations objectively.,
Don’t be afraid of STEM.,
Acknowledge your limits and abilities.",How to Think Like a Man1," Men value the feelings and thoughts of those close to them, but tend to worry less about coworkers and acquaintances. Women, however, expect openness, equality, and honesty from anyone they spend significant time with, including coworkers.In the standard hierarchical workplace, this will lead to disappointment and confusion for women.;
, Whether you’re at a departmental meeting or briefing a small team, express yourself to the group. Men tend to speak more often in large groups to preserve social standing and demonstrate verbal ability. Tell a story, a joke, or present a report to demonstrate your oratory skill and command of the facts.While women are typically thought of as great communicators, they communicate in a way that facilitates friendship. In a competitive workplace, this can be detrimental. When speaking, men take fewer pausesand are less concerned with how their listeners feel.

, Men find it easy to set feelings aside in order to make practical decisions based on facts alone. Women, by contrast, tend to make decisions based on how people will feel and their own intuition.Use charts, graphs, and hard data when making a business decision.

, From an early age, people are taught that math, science, and technology are masculine while the arts are feminine. Challenge the notion that your gender is an impediment to your STEM abilities. Read up on science news, catch an episode of Cosmos, and try out new geeky gadgets, games, and apps.If you're a student, enroll in a science or math class.

, Whether it’s a project you don’t feel comfortable taking on or a small favor a coworker asks you to do, say no if you can’t do it – or just don’t want to.Men have think nothing of turning down excessive assignments. On the other hand, if you are interested in a raise, a new position at your company, or greater responsibility, tell your supervisor explicitly that you're interested.Don’t be afraid of being seen as demanding or pushy.


Women often have a hard time saying no to additional responsibilities because they don’t want to be thought of as lazy and are genuinely more inclined to help others than men are.To think like a man, overcome these tendencies and realize that saying no is a sign of strength and self-respect, not laziness.
Men believe they deserve the salaries and raises they seek.Be assertive and believe in yourself when thinking about whether to pursue a raise or negotiate your salary. Act with a sense of entitlement.

A good thing is to consult with you teacher and your course companion. One of the commonly replicated studies is the Stroop effect.

, Once you choose your topic, you should find the original study you will replicate and at least two supporting studies. Remember where you got them from since you'll have to reference them.

Watch for contradictions in speech.,
Double-check what is said.,
Take note of scapegoating.,
Watch for quick changes in conversation.",How to Spot a Pro Social Psychopath1," A psychopath may end a conversation with a statement that opposes what they said at the beginning. Dishonesty and pathological lying is a sign of psychopathy.The person may talk about how disrespectful it is that your coworker always shows up late and does things they are not supposed to, and then moments later the person will break the rules without apology.The contradictions may not occur within the same conversation, so keep track of what is said over time. Log in a journal important information that you think might later be contradicted.;
, Psychopaths talk excessively about the people in their lives because they view them as extensions of themselves. A psychopath will lie about the people in their life; they will even lie about their children. Psychopaths are prone to giving out half-truths or disinformation. They have no problem keeping important information away from you.
If the person has told you stories of betrayal or tragedy to explain their damaged family, friend, or romantic relationships, see if you can verify these stories independently.

, A psychopath refuses to take responsibility for their own actions and will blame others for things they have done.If there is irrefutable evidence that they are at fault, they may then admit it, but will show no remorse.A psychopath will also try very hard to control the narrative by professing an altered version of events, which may be very different from what you experienced. This can cause you to question yourself and is known as ""gaslighting.""
On the other hand, because the psychopath displays a grandiose sense of self-worth, they may brag about or inflate their achievements, or even take credit for the work of others., Notice if they quickly and smoothly change topics when you broach a subject that might reveal their anti-sociality. They may rapidly dismiss discussions of their odd behavior by accusing you of causing too much drama, or by insisting that you are mentally ill and need professional help."
"
Communicate openly and honestly.,
Exercise your spatial skills.,
Don’t worry, be happy.,
Prove your independence.,
Keep your emotions in check.,
Get physical in your romantic relationships.,
Let go of the details.,
Focus less on your appearance.",How to Think Like a Man2," Women often dance around a topic or express themselves in more subtle ways than men. Men, by comparison, are more likely to state their thoughts directly and promptly. Share whatever is on your mind in an unambiguous way. Don’t drop hints about a problem or issue. Be direct and say exactly what you’re thinking and feeling.Be honest with yourself as well as your partner. If you are interested in taking your relationship to the next level, let your partner know. Alternately, if you want to keep things casual, make sure you and your partner are on the same page.
Men tend to speak less in private than in public. Try to build rapport with others by doing things rather than talking about things.

, Men are better than women at envisioning and remembering objects or new spaces. This is because male brains have a thinner parietal region (the area of the brain that processes visual information).Crafting a model, building a Lego kit, or playing a sport like soccer will help you think more spatially.You could also try drawing a map of a place you are familiar with.

, Men and women both worry, but women are more likely to continue worrying long after men have stopped. To think like a man, let go of small relationship issues, family matters, or troubles at the work place that you cannot solve.To worry less, set aside a designated time for your worries. Cut back on your internet surfing and try to get more exercise. You might also to find something that requires active engagement to distract you, like reading a book or painting a picture., While people like to feel desired, it's also good for them to know that their partner can care for themselves. Men are reared to act and think independently.Demonstrating that you can take care of yourself at work and in your social life will boost your self-confidence and let others know you are a capable, independent person.


Financial security can go a long way to feeling independent and living an independent life. Women are often expected to provide only a supplementary income and focus on children while their male partner acts as primary breadwinner.Create a solid financial foundation for yourself to build an independent life.

, If your first instinct is to yell, weep, or storm out in a huff – don’t. Count patiently to ten and try to come at the conversation or problem a different way. Women have more brain circuitry devoted to expressing and remembering emotions, so tamping down on the emotional instinct is an important step to thinking like a man., Touch can express feelings in ways words often can’t. Compared with women, men have more twice as much brain space allotted to sexual thoughts.Physical affection is a good way to make your intentions clear and show you love your partner.

, Women tend to fixate on and recall small moments that men do not. Things like fights, offhand comments, or potential slights go unnoticed or quickly forgotten by men. Try not to obsess over negative experiences, and be willing to let things go., Women are surrounded with pervasive messages that they need to look perfect. Men are not bombarded with the same kind of pressure to conform to a superficial standard of beauty, and tend to have better body image as a result.To think more like a man, learn to accept your appearance or body. Don’t fret over your imperfections.


Stand in front of the mirror with your feet apart and declare to yourself ""I’m awesome.” Do this every day until you believe it.

Assess reactions to emotionally troublesome events.,
Watch for signs of self-victimization.,
Assess how often you are questioned.,
Analyze desire to move quickly into a close relationship.,
Look for drastic changes in attention given to you.",How to Spot a Pro Social Psychopath2," Because they lack empathy, psychopaths may respond to hearing of emotionally troubling events in a bland or robotic way, or in a way that seems forced and artificial.For example, a psychopath may repeatedly express their disappointment with words only, but in a way that lacks emotion. Psychopaths, upon hearing troubling news, may make no real effort to resolve the issue, no matter how much they talk about it.
However, they may also have a very strong reaction when you least expect it. This could be due to fear of being caught, taking offense to something minor due to their poor self-esteem, or misreading a situation and thinking they should ""fake"" a response.

, A psychopath may attempt to toy with your emotions by making you feel sorry for them. Watch for signs such as tones of voice and deflecting of blame to gain your sympathy. This is another way for them to deny responsibility of their own actions.Watch for this manipulative behavior especially when the person needs an excuse as to why they made a faux pas or blunder (e.g., ""forgot"" your birthday).
Another red flag is if they make everything about them and how hard they have it, without ever apologizing or taking responsibility.

, If you want to spot a prosocial psychopath, keep track of each time they bug you with questions about how you would act in certain emotion-inducing situations. This may indicate that, because they lack empathy and a conscience, they don't naturally feel what is normal or appropriate in some situations and have to get the data elsewhere.


For example, they may ask: ""What would you do if you came out of your apartment and saw me hiding in the bushes?"" This is something a normal person would not need to ask.

, If you are thinking of getting into a relationship with someone but you are worried they might be a psychopath, try to get a sense of how fast they want to move. There are several signs that might indicate psychopathy:


Do they, after no time at all, call you endearing terms?
Do they insist that you should freely bring them into your circle of trust?
Do they want you to share living quarters or share a business venture very soon after meeting?

, A psychopath may set up a dynamic in which they lavish you with attention, then inexplicably give you the cold shoulder. When you return to their good graces, you experience maximum elation and feel high from the boost of dopamine (the ""love"" chemical) and endorphins.They manipulate you into pretty much being addicted to them, so you repeatedly forgive whatever transgressions they perpetrated against you.

Learn about the memory-information processing stages.,

Study explicit and implicit processes.,
Study encoding.",How to Study Memory (Psychology)," These are:


Encoding – The information enters the memory system.
Storage – The retention of encoded information over time
Retrieval – The process of getting information out of memory.;
,


Neural language is sensory information.
Working Memory (STM): Activated memory that hold a few items briefly.
Long Term Memory: Relatively permanent and limitless storehouse of the system of memory.

,


Researchers have identified a visual ""sensory memory"", called iconic memory and identified an auditory sensory memory, called echoic memory.
LTM (Long Term Memory) actually refers to number of different memory systems.They are episodic, semantic memory (memories of factual kind), procedural memory (which is knowledge how to do things(wikiHow knowledge)).

,


Explicit processes are accompanied by conscious activity such as searching, or asking what had happened last night, we consciously search for the answer.
Implicit process are not accompanied by awareness.

, It can be effort or automatic.


There is a serial position effect. One can remember the first (primacy effect) and the last items best.
Chunking is a way to make easier to remember.
STM has limited capacity with 7+/-2
LTM relatively unlimited. K. Lashley concluded that memories are distributed across cortex and he was right.

Continue training and developing new skills.,
Polish your professional image.",How to Start a Private Practice in Psychology," Depending on which kind of psychology you’d like to practice, you’ll need to obtain the required schooling, degrees, and certification.


If you’re interested in being a social worker or counselor, then you’ll need to get your master’s degree in one of these fields.
If you’re interested in being a psychologist and practicing psychotherapy or other modalities, you’ll need a Ph.D. degree (Doctor of Philosophy) or a doctor in Psy.D. (Doctor of Psychology Degree). The Psy.D.is similar to the Ph.D. except that it is tailored more towards training psychologists to be clinicians in a wide range of clinical settings rather than focusing on research.If you’re most interested in being a psychiatrist and writing prescriptions for psychotropic drug therapies, then you’ll need a medical (M.D.) degree and complete a three or more year residency training program.;
, If your degree offers them, take a couple of business courses to help you get a handle on some of the basics. These will be invaluable aids when you’re faced with running your practice’s payroll, appointment booking, and other office tasks.

, It might be beneficial to start working with another practice that is already established before you go off on your own. Not only will this give you a guaranteed paycheck, but also a chance to network with patients, gain practical experience, and see how to run a business., After you complete your schooling and earn your degree, you’ll likely need to get a license before you can enter private practice.


Check your local state regulations to see what kind of license you need for your type of practice.
Typically, social workers need two years of supervised clinical experience before they can apply for a license or enter private practice.
Psychologists usually need to complete an internship and have a couple of years of work experience before they can be licensed for private practice.
Psychiatrists typically have to graduate from an accredited medical school, complete a residency, and then pass a licensing exam before they can begin their own private practice.

, In addition to needing a vocational license, you’ll also need a business license before you can hang your shingle.


There will be specific procedures for registering your business depending on where you live and what your local ordinances are. Check with your local town/city clerk’s office or your municipal zoning board for more specific information.
In addition to following your local procedures, you can also consider registering your business as a LLC (Limited Liability Company) or a PLLC (Professional Limited Liability Company). While individual states have different laws regarding these types of companies, registering your new practice as a LLC or a PLLC can help protect yourself and your personal assets from liability and lawsuits leveled against your professional practice.This does not take the place of other types of insurance, though, and will not completely protect you from potential patient lawsuits.

, It’s essential that you meet with an attorney or malpractice insurance agent to discuss what kind of liability coverage you need. It’s also a good idea to discuss income tax issues.

, Identifying what kind of practice you’d like to have is the next vital step.Narrow down what kind of patients you’d like to see and what kinds of conditions you would like to treat based on your field of speciality, degree type, and/or certification. This will also help you narrow down things like location and office features: if you’re planning on treating children, for example, you’ll be making different office décor choices!
See what other psychologists in your area offer, and find an area to focus on that does not have much competition. This can help you carve out your own, unique niche within the market., Depending on what type of clients you’d like to treat, you can get a sense of where your office would be most conveniently located and what kind of space will best suit their needs.Ideally, your office will be located near a major freeway or bus routes and be easily accessible.
If you’re thinking about a family practice or working with children, you might want to focus on suburban rather than inner-city locations.
Look for a office space that has a reception area, a good sized treatment room, and a smaller room for your office.
If you’re planning on seeing families, be sure to look for an office space that has meeting rooms large enough to accommodate several people at once.
Consider sharing space with other professionals in a business suite, or sub-leasing space from another professional. This is a great option for keeping down other overhead expenses (like utilities, office equipment, or furniture).
If you live in a large home that has a separate entrance you can always consider converting a room into a treatment space.

, It might be helpful to get advice from a fellow practitioner, especially one who started a private practice. If you have any old professors, advisors, or classmates from your degree work who have gone on to start their own practice, drop them a line and ask if they would be willing to share advice, recommendations, and to mentor you as you start your business.

, If you’d like to accept insurance at your practice, make arrangements with several popular insurance companies to cover their clients. It’s best to contact these companies directly to set up a billing protocol with them.

, If you're not planning to handle all of the administrative duties, like appointment booking, patient record keeping, billing, and payroll, consider hiring some administrative assistants to give you a hand.

, A strong web presence will help you catch the eye of new clients searching for help.


Your website should include a mission statement and a detailed description of your specialties.
Include some information about yourself and your background, too, so that clients can get to know you and see if you would be a good fit for them.
You should also included some details about what a typical therapy session with you looks like, what insurances you cover, and what are your typical session rates. Don’t be shy about listing your rates, and remember that your hourly rate should also include business costs and overhead.

, You’ll have to sell your practice and your services to potential new clients in order to grow your business, and there’re several ways to get your name out there.


If you are a member of a professional association, such as the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy, you can list your practice in their online directory.
You can also take out ads in your local Yellow Pages or newspaper.

, Rather than waiting for new clients to find you, continue to build your client base and your practice by actively seeking them out.


Give free talks in venues such as schools or community centers; introduce yourself and your practice to those who might benefit from your specialized services.
Introduce yourself to other companies or professionals, such as physicians, educators, or religious leaders, who can refer clients to you. Ask them if you can leave some business cards for them to pass along to interested people.
Network with fellow psychologists who run successful practices but are in a different field of speciality than your own. Forge a relationship with them and ask if they would refer clients to your practice for specialized treatment.

, Even after your business is up and running, both you and your practice will benefit from continuing to train, develop new skills, and expand your horizons.


Look for advanced programs that offer specialty certifications in areas. Not only will this help you to continue to acquire new skills, but you'll also be able to network. 
Keep an eye on professional trends. Be aware of how the profession is changing as well as public opinion and needs. If, for example, one type of therapy seems to be falling out of favor, consider shifting your practice away from this and towards what seems to be the new, in-demand and sought after type of treatment.Diversify your practice by adding new specialists and joining forces with another psychological practitioner, or by branching out into other types of services like running workshops for companies or by serving as their consultant., A growing trend in business practice, including psychological private practice, is to craft an impacting, easily identifiable ""brand image"" for yourself and your services.Put some thought into your practice's logo; ideally, it will be visually appealing, say something about you and your services, and be easy to remember.
Get opinions from friends and professional contacts about your print materials (business cards and letterhead) and website. You want to be sure that you’re business materials are making a good impression and showing your success.
Spend some time refining your office décor. Your office should feel comfortable and reflect some of your personal style. Consider making small updates every couple of years to stay fresh and current.
Keep your website up to date, and consider including recent patient testimonies (with their identities concealed, of course).
Consider increasing your web-presence and youthful, ""hip"" appearance by incorporating elements of social media. Tread carefully though, you don't want to look too youthful and non-professional by ""tweeting"" all the time.

Acknowledge the hurt, pain or dissatisfaction.,
Speak to the offender.,
Release expectations of people and processes.,
Remove yourself from unjust situations.,
Focus on forgiving the person or organization.,
Choose peaceful and productive thoughts.,
Hold a letting go ceremony.,
Practice daily gratitude.",How to Stop Holding Grudges," Letting go of grudges is not about denying that a problem exists or repressing the underlying emotions. Name the emotions you are feeling.


Write in a journal. Express your feelings in a journal by writing down the details of the incident and the aspects of the event that led to your anger or hurt.
Share your feelings with a trusted friend. Talking with an empathetic person, whether a close friend or a counselor, will help you gain greater peace and perspective.;
, If appropriate, speak to the person or company who has mistreated you. In some situations this may not be possible, for example, if the person is deceased or purposely unavailable.


Explain your feelings about the offensive act or incident. For example, speaking to a restaurant manager about being overcharged or mistreated may lead to receiving an apology or an improvement in how future customers are treated.

, Human beings and organizations are imperfect. Letting go of attachments to how things should be or how others should behave will lower your stress level. It also allows you to focus on pursuing other avenues for getting what you want, such as exploring healthier relationships and service providers.

, If possible, refrain from interacting with people or organizations that are perpetually unfair or unjust.


Distinguish between the bearable and unjust. For example, practice tolerance with a spouse who forgets to take out the trash. Consider leaving a spouse who is physically and emotionally abusive. In all cases, the act of forgiving, and not necessarily condoning, other people's wrongdoings will benefit your own well-being.

, Regardless of whether they have apologized or met your needs, make a conscious decision to forgive and to stop holding grudges.

, Each time your anger returns or negative thoughts persist, acknowledge that you are angry or hurt, but consciously shift your attention to something constructive.


Give more energy to the trustworthy. Spend more time with the people in your life who are trustworthy, caring and worthy of your attention.
Focus on the positive qualities of the offender. For example, when in a relationship with someone who has betrayed your trust, reduce the emotional charge of the grudge by shifting your attention to the person's praiseworthy qualities.

, One way to move on in life is to let go in a tangible way. Write down your feelings, your resentment, the name or names of the person(s) troubling you and take that piece of paper as tangible proof that you are going to move on. You can do a lot with that piece of paper – burn it, throw it away, toss it into the wind, place it on a paper boat and send it down a river, bury it, and so forth – anything that makes you take a physical step to change things and move away from what happened to bring on the grudge.

, Start looking for the good in your days and stop seeking the bad. Every single day start looking for one thing to be grateful for. Build it up until you can instantly find five things every day to be grateful for. Use your gratitude to clobber your grudges.

If you cannot use the internet, then give them a call and ask them questions about the hotel's location, noise level, walking distance to restaurants, etc.;
, Sometimes the unexpected happens, so make sure you are okay with the hotel's cancellation policy, and keep track of what it costs.


Some hotels and hostels are really bare bones, and you might have to bring things like drinkable water and your own linens, so be prepared.

, Print a map of your hotel's location so that you can find your way in an unfamiliar place.


It's a good idea to bring both a zoomed in map and a zoomed out map with your arrival location marked.
Decide ahead of time if you will take a taxi, rent a car, or use public transportation from your arrival location to your hotel.
If you are driving a car, make sure to locate accessible parking ahead of time for your vehicle, and note the cost and location in your planning. Also, bring a map.
If you are taking a taxi, particularly as a tourist abroad, make sure you know approximately how much the journey from your arrival location to your destination should be, so you won't get swindled.

, Confirming your reservation a few days ahead of time is always a great idea,


Remind the front desk of what, if any, special requests you have made, (i.e. conjoining rooms, (non)-smoking rooms, quiet rooms, a crib, etc.).
Confirming your reservation ahead of time prevents day-of-arrival mistakes on the hotel's part, and covers you if they do mess something up. Then you can negotiate an upgrade with a clear conscience!

, Nearly all hotels, and especially smaller hotels, have a specific check-in time.


If you have a large gap of time between your arrival and the hotel's check-in time, call ahead and ask very politely if you can check-in early, or at least drop your bags. Then, you can go explore and check out the area!

A print out of your reservation confirmation can be useful, particularly if you secured a special rate or promotion.
If you do not have a reservation, be prepared to be turned away if the hotel has no vacancies. Ask the concierge for suggestions for alternate hotels.
Most hotels will place a hold of the full amount of your stay plus a percentage as incidentals per day, so it's best to not give them your debit card.

, Make sure to note the location and time of breakfast, internet access and passwords, office work areas, lounges, bars, restaurants, gym and spa facilities and the like, to make your stay more comfortable.

, Reception and/or the concierge can provide you with a map and with recommendations about where to go and what to do nearby.

Know the law.",How to Live with Dissociative Identity Disorder," You are a single, whole individual with different identities. Each separate identity (or “alter”) is your own, even if you feel that you have no control over them. Recognizing this basic fact will give you a sense of personal identity and help you learn how to manage your condition.;
, DID is most common in women, and it is almost always connected to childhood trauma, often in the form of brutal and sustained abuse. As painful and difficult as the process might be, understanding the cause of your dissociation may help you heal.

, Others may tell you that your alters don’t exist, that you created them yourself. To a certain extent, this is true – they are aspects of your own personality, not independent people. However, if you are living with DID, these alters feel very real. For the time being, it may be best to acknowledge their apparent reality and learn to cope with their existence.

, If you have DID, you may have two kinds of amnesia. First, you may have forgotten or blocked out painful or traumatic life experiences; recall that many people with Dissociative Identity Disorder had such experiences as children. Second, you may develop amnesia and a sense of “lost time” whenever one of your alters takes over your consciousness.

, Because one of your alters may take over at any given time, you may find yourself away from home, unsure of where you are or how you got there. This is called a “dissociative fugue.”

, If you have Dissociative Identity Disorder, you may also experience symptoms of depression: disturbed sleep and appetite, persistent sadness, and, in some cases, suicidal thoughts.

, If you have Dissociative Identity Disorder, you may also experience symptoms of anxiety. You may notice that you feel very worried or panicked, sometimes without understanding why.

, In addition to amnesia, fugue states, depression, and anxiety, you may notice other psychological symptoms: mood swings, for example, and a sense of numbness or detachment from reality.

, People with DID sometimes hear voices, which may cry, comment, criticize, or threaten. You may or may not understand, at first, that these voices are coming from inside your head.

, You need a therapist who can succeed in eliciting the right information from you and your alters, and you need someone who will listen patiently and tackle your long-term treatment. In addition to talk therapy, treatment for DID may include hypnotherapy, psychotherapy, art therapy, and movement therapy. Look for a professional with experience treating DID in one or more of these ways.

, On average, it takes about seven years just to get a diagnosis of Dissociative Identity Disorder. This is both because many clinicians do not fully understand DID and because the dissociative symptoms are not always immediately obvious, while the more common symptoms – depression, anxiety, and the like – mask the root problem. Once you get a diagnosis, you will also have to be persistent about pursuing treatment. If your therapist does not seem to understand or listen to you, find a new one. If one treatment does not seem to work, try something else.

, The more you adhere to your therapy, the easier it will be for you to manage your alters and lead a better, more normal life. Remember that therapy works slowly, but it can bring significant, lasting changes. Over time, a good therapist can help you understand your condition, resolve conflicts, and, ultimately, integrate your multiple identities into a single one.

, In addition to therapy, you may need to treat some of your symptoms – depression, anxiety, mood swings, and sleep problems, for example – with medication. These drugs will not cure your DID, but they are sometimes used as “shock absorbers” to help manage painful and debilitating symptoms so that long-term therapy for the dissociation can progress.

, Remember that your alters may take over at any time. Depending on the specific circumstances of your case, one or more of these alters may be children or may be otherwise unaware of where they should go. Be prepared. Keep a paper with your name, address, and telephone number, along with the contact information for your therapist and at least one good friend, at your home, at your workplace, and in your car. Keep important records in a single place at home, and tell loved ones where that place is.


In addition, it may help you to place cue cards in your card and room with important information, including your daily schedule.

, One or more of your alters may prove untrustworthy. This personality may, for example, spend too much money, going on shopping sprees and purchasing items you will not use. In this case, refrain from carrying credit cards or large amounts of cash. If one of your alters does something else untrustworthy, take similar steps to minimize the potential damage.

, If a support group for people with dissociative conditions exists in your area, consider joining. Such groups can provide valuable perspective and offer you a number of coping mechanisms and survival skills.

, Aside from your therapist and your support group, it may help to have some close friends and family members who understand your situation and are willing to help when necessary. They can help keep track of your medications and treatments and provide much-needed emotional support. Unconditional love and support will boost your self-esteem and strengthen your resolve to stay committed to treatment.

, It can be inspiring to read books about people who have successfully managed DID and worked to lead normal, fully functional lives. Your therapist may have recommendations for you.

, When painful memories arise or you find yourself feeling very upset, it can help to have a safe, calming space. This can be a very small space, but it should feel safe and inviting. Some ideas include:


making an album or collection of good memories, which you can see and review often.
decorating with calming and peaceful images.
including positive messages, like “I feel safe here,” and “I can do this.”

, Stress seems to be the single biggest factor in personality switches. You try to seek refuge by unconsciously suppressing and switching to avoid stressful situations. Minimize this problem by avoiding arguments, leaving places where conflicts are likely to arise, keeping the company of people who understand and support you, and busying yourself with calming activities like reading, gardening, or watching television.

, Over time and with treatment, you may learn to recognize situations and symptoms that are likely to trigger one of your alters taking over. Pay attention and try to resolve these situations before that happens. In addition, write them down whenever possible, so that you can be proactive about resolving them in the future. Some common triggers for people with DID include:

engaging in a conflict






having flashbacks of bad memories






insomnia and somatic complaints






urges to harm yourself






mood swings






feelings of numbness, detachment, or “losing your mind”






auditory hallucinations, perhaps with the voices commenting or arguing







, Take pleasure in doing small yet satisfying tasks for yourself, and try to help others when you are able. Practice your faith, if you have one, and try meditation and yoga. These steps will help you release stress and gain a sense of inner strength.

, Consumption of any drugs aside from those prescribed for your condition may make your symptoms worse.

, Every individual is different, but if you have DID, your condition will certainly affect your ability to work. What kind of job is right for you? It depends on how cooperative and collaborative your alters are. Talk to your therapist about which kinds of work might be best in your circumstances, but remember that it’s very important to avoid significant stress. Try not to take on a job that will have you constantly tense and worried.


Consider, especially, what your responsibilities will be. You don’t want a child alter to emerge during a serious discussion or important meeting, and you don’t want to surprise clients or customers with inexplicably changing ideas, perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors.

, You can try to control and set rules for your alters, but they may not cooperate. They may make mistakes, confuse your coworkers, leave your workplace, or even quit your job. Expecting to manage all of these possibilities will only add to your stress level, so accept the fact that you may not be able to keep a particular job.

, It is your decision whether or not to share your diagnosis with coworkers. If your DID is managed well and does not typically interfere in your work life, you may not have to. If, however, your boss or coworkers become confused, annoyed, or dissatisfied with your performance for reasons related to your condition, it may be helpful to explain. Otherwise, these people may struggle to know the “real you” and find it perplexing that your thoughts and ideas seem to shift for no reason.

, Even a relatively low-pressure job will sometimes cause you stress. Take care not to let this stress get too intense. Just as you do in your life outside the workplace, try to avoid conflicts, walk away from arguments, and practice relaxation techniques.

, Federal law safeguards the employment interests of people who are disabled, and this includes people with Dissociative Identity Disorder. If you can reasonably perform the tasks required of your job, then the law is on your side.

Visit Vegas at the right time.,
Choose the right hotel.,
Book directly with the hotel.,
Book a more expensive room.,
Pay with the right credit card.",How to Get a Free Room Upgrade in Las Vegas1," The dates of your visit to Vegas may increase your chances of receiving a free room upgrade. Travel experts, however, have conflicting opinions on the “right time” to visit Vegas.


Visit during a period of low occupancy. According to some travel experts, if you want a free upgrade, reserve a room during a period of low-occupancy. For example, if the hotel is known to host businessmen and women during the week, book a stay on a weekend when there will be more suites available.Visit during a conference or event. Other travel experts insist that you are more likely to receive a free upgrade when all of the basic rooms are booked. This typically occurs during a conference or an event. Hotels may offer you a free upgrade to prevent you from switching hotels and to open up a less expensive room for a conference or event goer.;
, Some Vegas hotels and casinos are more likely to offer free upgrades than others. Before booking a hotel, conduct a quick search to determine which Vegas hotels and casinos are most likely to upgrade your room. You may wish to quickly survey friends, family, and contacts on social media.


New hotels may be more likely to upgrade your room because they want a positive review. , Hotel clerks are aware when you have reserved a room through a third party website. While booking through these sites may guarantee a better rate, it may also result in you being placed in a sub-par room with little chance of receiving a complimentary upgrade. Clerks are more willing to reward customers that book directly with the hotel.If you see a lower rate on a third party site, call the hotel and ask if they will match it., In order to receive a free room upgrade, consider spending a little more money on the initial reservation. When a guest books a mid-range room over a basic room, the hotel makes more money. The customer staying in the more expensive room automatically becomes more valuable than a customer staying in a basic room. As a result, hotel clerks are more receptive to the needs and requests of a customer that has booked a more expensive room., When you book with certain credit cards, such as American Express, you may be automatically eligible to receive a free upgrade. This perk is typically only available to centurion or platinum cardholders. If you belong to a lower card holding class, however, it never hurts to ask if you qualify for a free room upgrade.If you are unsure of the perks offered by your credit card company, call a representative for clarification, conduct a quick internet search, or read through your welcome packet information."

Check the Internet to see if there are any historic hotels in the city/town you wish to visit.,
If they have one, visit the website to see pictures of the rooms as well as rates.

,
Before booking a room, check for reviews on travel sites.,
Even if they offer online booking, for small, older hotels, calling the front desk to book the reservation is the best bet.

,
Before calling to book the reservation, be sure you know what you want to ask: Is the room I'm requesting on the ground floor or an upper room?,
Before booking, ask what the flat total with tax?,
Double check the cancellation policy.",How to Book a Room at a Historic Hotel,";
,, *See warnings below.

,, Do you have an elevator? Are there coffee makers, blow dryers, irons, etc. in the room?

, Ask if there are any other charges that may be accrued.

, Most historic establishments have more stringent cancellation policies than modern establishments do because of fewer rooms. Cancellation policies can range anywhere from seven to thirty days advance notice prior to arrival or else you credit card will be charged.

Check-in at a later time.,
Prepare your tip.,
Observe the front desk attendants.,
Ask for what you want.,
Thank the clerk.",How to Get a Free Room Upgrade in Las Vegas2," Throughout the day, hotels gain a better understanding of their occupancy levels and available rooms for that evening and the days immediately following. You are more likely to benefit from this information, if you check-in at a later time. Arrive at the hotel in the late afternoon to evening., Prior to approaching the front desk, discretely prepare your tip. Fold your bill in half neatly. Insert the bill between your credit card and ID.


The amount you tip is entirely your choice. Most people will slip clerks at least a twenty dollar bill., Once you arrive (preferably late), take a moment to observe the hotel clerks. Identify a clerk that looks confident, competent, and not in charge. Once you have selected the clerk you want to assist you, approach him or her at the desk.


If the clerk you have selected is not immediately available, allow a guest to go in front of you.Do not ask while other guests are around., When requesting a free upgrade, specificity and the word “complimentary” are key. If you do not ask for what you want, you may just end up with a room on a higher floor; if you leave out the word “complimentary,” the clerk may assume that you are willing to pay for the upgrade.


After providing the clerk with your name, smile and slide your cards and tip across the desk.
Tell the clerk that you are really interested in checking out a specific suite.
Ask “if there are any available complimentary upgrades?”, No matter the outcome, always treat the clerk politely. If the clerk upgrades your room, smile and thank them profusely. If the clerk does not upgrade your room, don’t berate them. Instead, smile and thank them for their time and effort.


If the clerk can upgrade your room, they will do so.
If the clerk cannot upgrade your room, they should return your tip. You may choose to take back the bill or leave it with the clerk.Hotels are more inclined to help and reward guests that are nice, generous, and polite. From the moment you make your reservation, treat every member of the staff with respect. Any staff member, from the bellboy to the manager, could make your complimentary room upgrade possible. "
"
Ask for a complimentary upgrade.,
Take advantage of a special occasion.,
Be loyal to the hotel chain.",How to Get a Free Room Upgrade in Las Vegas3," When you simply ask for an upgrade, instead of discretely slipping the clerk a tip, you are taking a minimal risk that could result in major rewards. While checking in, nicely ask the clerk if there are any complimentary upgrades available. If there are, the clerk may be inclined to grant your request. If they can’t offer you an official upgrade, they may transfer you to a room of a same rate that has a better view or is in a better location.If there are no free upgrades, ask how much it would cost to improve your room. The clerk may provide you with a discounted rate if they know you are willing to pay.Do not ask while other guests are around., When hotels learn that a guest has chosen to celebrate a special event at their establishment, they are honored. Special occasions provide them with a chance to show off. They will strive to make your stay special and memorable.


When booking the room, mention that while you are there you will celebrate a special occasion, such as an anniversary, birthday, or honeymoon.
While checking in, subtly mention that you are there for a special occasion.
The clerk may then choose to upgrade your room or at the very least provide you with a surprise, such as champagne and chocolates., Loyal hotel guests receive special treatment. Joining the hotel’s loyalty program may help you distinguish yourself as a loyal guest. You will also rack up reward points that could lead to a free upgrade or even a free stay."

Understand where many coffee makers fall short.,
Run water first through the coffee maker before brewing with actual coffee.,
Add a pinch of salt.,
Jump the gun.,
Drink immediately.",How to Make Good Hotel Room Coffee,"


Some coffee makers do not allocate enough wattage to the heating element, and fail to reach the ideal coffee brewing temperature range of 195-205 degrees Fahrenheit, or 90.5-96 degrees Celsius.
Another problem is that when coffee makers take too long to brew the coffee, it can result in bitter and harsh flavors. Ideally, the process should only take 6 minutes.;
, This will allow the coffee maker to heat up, which will help the water get closer to that ideal brewing temperature. Once it's done, pour that hot water right back into the coffee maker and immediately run it through again, this time with coffee.

, Actually, only a few grains are needed. Throwing in a little bit of salt with the coffee grounds will tone down the bitterness and may bring out more of the coffee's better flavors. Some people add it after the cup has been brewed.If you're skeptical, or worried about ending up with a salty cup of coffee, follow all of the other steps, and only add salt if the coffee leaves something to be missed; sprinkle a little bit, taste, and add more salt as needed. It may take a little experimentation to find out how much salt is needed to ""fix"" a cup of coffee, and it may vary by brand and coffee maker.

, Set a timer. When around 6 minutes have passed, pull the pot (or glass carafe) off the burner and serve whatever coffee is already made. Put a mug in the pot's place so that the remainder of the coffee being made (which will probably be pretty harsh, and worthy of being dumped) doesn't drip everywhere. This cuts off the brewing process before the coffee gets bitter. Even though you won't have as much coffee, at least it'll be good coffee, and you can always start a new batch.


Another option is to use only half of the amount of water to brew (which shortens brewing time), then add hot water to the coffee afterwards to dilute it. Depending on how you obtain the hot water, this might result in lukewarm coffee.

, Don't leave brewed coffee in the pot or glass carafe on the burner. Pour it out into a mug or cup as soon as it's finished, and start sipping before the coffee starts to taste like hot ashes!

Decide on your hotel.,
Search for hotel deals.,
Contact the hotel.",How to Book a Hotel in Sri Lanka," Do your homework. Researching hotels in Sri Lanka is profusely time consuming but it is even more rewarding. When you travel to the island from afar, you would have no idea what to expect here. The internet provides plenty of details of nearly every hotel in the island. While browsing pages, a few favorites will certainly stick. Jot down these names and look up the hotels a little deeper. There maybe a few brand names that may catch your eye such as Jetwing, Aitken Spense, Amaya and of late the Secret Hotels. Researching will not only help you identify a couple of favorite hotel names but will also you give you a gist of the culture and ambiance of Sri Lanka as a whole.;
, Once you have short listed a few potential candidates you would roughly have an idea of the price range of such hotels. Depending on your travel budget you will be inclined to a particular category of hotels. Sri Lanka has a world of options to choose from. You get luxury at its epitome and authentic budget hotels. But as a general rule prices in Sri Lanka are not as over the top as some other destinations around the globe. In fact hotels offer plenty of jackpot deals during the off season making it an excellent period to enjoy the same perks and rewards if you are a bit low on the budget. Work around the figures and come up with the exact range you can allocate for lodging.

, Pick your favorite from your shortlisted choices. You may have many that caught your eye or you may have a few, but at this juncture it is pivotal to have an intense research on all the chosen candidates. At this point you may even have a fair idea about the attractions you want to see in Sri Lanka. Research a bit on the locations of the hotels; it may work as an advantage if hotels are in close proximity to these attractions. Read reviews. Reviews give you a guest's opinion on the hotel. Web sites and travel agents blindly market and sometimes even exaggerate only the pros of the hotel but if you want a realistic idea of the place reviews is your best bet.

Read the fine print.,
Negotiate a waiver.,
Sign up for a loyalty program.",How to Avoid Hotel Add‐On Charges1," Hotel add-on charges can include things like Wi-Fi fees, parking fees, activity or resort fees, additional person fees, early check-in fees, or additional gratuity. The best way to avoid these unnecessary fees is to do some homework ahead of time, ask about fees when you check in, and review your bill when you leave. If you do all of these, no hidden fees will slip by unnoticed.Read the hotel’s website.
Call ahead and ask about fees.
Read the final confirmation of your booking in detail. (Most fees should appear here).
Ask about any fees at check-in.
Review your bill carefully before you leave.;
, Some hotels are willing to waive fees if you explain at check-in that you will not be using a service. This can include things like gym fees, parking fees, and Wi-Fi fees. This can also include “resort fees” for specific activities. Make it clear from the beginning that these are services or activities you won’t need.Do your best to uncover any potential fees before you arrive.
Also, be sure to ask ""What kind of additional fees will be charged to my room for this stay?""
Then say, ""Will it be possible to waive the fees for the gym, parking, and Wi-Fi? I won't be needing these services.""

, Many hotel chains offer loyalty programs that come with a variety of benefits.

Beware of “additional person” fees.,
Don’t touch anything in the mini-bar.,
Watch out for “complementary” water or snacks.,
Inquire about gratuity.",How to Avoid Hotel Add‐On Charges2," Most hotel prices are set for two people to a room (with small children staying for free). If a third adult will be staying the night, you’ll likely be slapped with an “additional person fee.” Look around for a hotel that doesn’t charge such fees (not all of them do) before booking., Anyone who is trying to save money knows they should avoid the mini-bar. What you may not realize is that simply by touching items in the mini-bar (in some hotels) you may trigger a sensor that adds charges to your room. (This prevents guests from trying to replace mini-bar items). You can avoid this fee by steering clear of the mini-bar completely.If you should ever be charged for an item you touched (but did not consume), speak to the front desk about removing this charge.

, If there are baskets of bottled water or snacks sitting out in your room, they may seem complementary. Unfortunately, they may not be! Refrain from consuming any food or drink provided in your room unless you have inquired about the price., It is customary to leave a tip for housekeeping, as well as for spa services (like a massage). However, at some hotels, gratuity for these services will be charged to your room. Inquire about gratuity charges ahead of time to avoid tipping twice."
"
Store your bags instead of checking in early.,
Use your own phone.,
Look for free parking.,
Use a different internet connection.",How to Avoid Hotel Add‐On Charges3," Many hotels will charge an “early check-in fee,” if you should arrive early. Instead of checking in early, ask your hotel to store your bags (which most will do for free) so that you can begin exploring the location. Then return in a few hours and check into your room on time.Always ask whether or not there will be a fee for storing baggage before doing so!

, You should never use the phone in your hotel room to do anything but call the front desk. Not only do hotels charge for long-distance calls, but they usually charge for short local calls as well. Use your own cell phone to avoid these charges., Although some hotels offer free parking, many others will charge a fee. Spend some time walking around your hotel. You might locate free street parking or an inexpensive parking garage. You may also consider staying slightly outside of a city (like in the suburbs) where parking is easy and cheap., You should never have to pay for Wi-Fi. If your hotel levies a fee for such a service, try to find an internet connection elsewhere. If you use a smart phone, you can create your own personal hot spot. Alternatively, there is likely a coffee shop nearby where you can catch a signal. If all else fails, consider unplugging for the length of your trip. It might do you some good, while saving you money."

,How to Cook Food in a Hotel Room1,
"
Wash the pot and filter thoroughly.,
Make oatmeal.,
Prepare soft-boiled eggs.,
Prepare ramen noodles in the coffee maker.,
Use the coffee maker as a vegetable steamer.,
Make instant rice.,
Mix the hot water with sauce packets or instant mashed potatoes.,
Poach meat cautiously.,
Use the heating element as a hot plate.",How to Cook Food in a Hotel Room2," Wash with hot, soapy water to remove as much coffee taste as possible. If the bathroom sink is too small, ask the front desk for a communal sink, or ask to have the coffee pot cleaned.


For most of these recipes, you can remove the filter basket entirely, and let the water drain through directly.
Do not use coffee pots with a dark, reddish-orange stain, or a chemical smell. This may have been used to brew methamphetamine, and the resulting coffee could be hazardous to your health.

, Put two packets of instant oatmeal into the carafe. Add an individual packet of honey, an individual packet of fruit jam, and a pinch of salt. Pour eight to ten ounces of water into the coffee maker, turn on the machine, and the oatmeal will be ready in about five minutes.For extra flavor, put a fruit-flavored herbal tea bag into the filter basket.
Even old-fashioned (non-instant) oatmeal can be cooked this way, but it may take longer.
No honey? Try cut-up fresh or dried fruit.

, Place the eggs carefully into the carafe and let the hot water drip over them. Let the eggs sit in the water for a few minutes. Repeat if necessary.

There are a few tests you can do to tell whether the egg is cooked. Try spinning the egg, then stopping it with a quick touch of your finger. If it wobbles after you remove your finger, it is still raw.The yolk will still be somewhat runny. It is very difficult to make hard-boiled eggs this way.
Do not eat the egg if the white is not fully cooked.

, Put the noodles in the carafe. Add enough water to submerge the noodles and turn the coffee maker on. After the water runs through the coffee maker, let the noodles soak in it for about three minutes, or however long it takes for the noodles to soften. Then drain carefully and add the seasoning.

, Place carrots, broccoli, or other vegetables in the filter basket of the coffee maker. Run water through the coffee maker several times to achieve desired tenderness.


Do not use aromatic vegetables such as onions or peppers. Generations of travelers after you will curse your name as they drink spicy coffee.
You can cook more vegetables at once in the carafe, but the water may make them soggy. Empty the water frequently if you choose this approach.

, Put the rice in the coffee pot. Add the recommended amount of water to the coffee maker, as described on the rice package. Leave the burner on until the rice has thoroughly cooked and absorbed most of the water.

, Run water through the coffee maker and adding the heated water to a sauce mix or instant potato flakes. You should not run anything other than water through the coffee maker. These machines are made to heat water only, and the water comes into direct contact with the heating element. Sauces will burn onto the heating element, ruining the coffee maker.

, The old ""coffee maker meat"" recipe isn't even on the radar of food safety organizations, but it's easy to guess they'd have a problem with it. A good coffee maker heats water to 200ºF (93ºC).This is close to boiling, and hot enough to poach thinly sliced, boneless chicken breast in roughly 15 minutes, flipping once halfway through.However, many coffee makers, especially old or cheap ones that you might find in a hotel room, reach much lower temperatures, which cannot cook meat to a safe temperature. Try this at your own risk.


When poaching, the water level should be about halfway up the side of the meat. Pour out the excess water whenever necessary.
After the meat is cooked all the way through, add a little milk, butter, and pepper. Let sit one more minute, then remove from heat.

, Remove the coffee pot to reveal a weak hot plate beneath it. You can grill food over this on a small, heat-safe plate, or a tray made from heavy-duty aluminum foil. See the clothes iron recipes below for a few ideas.


Grilling will take much longer than it would on a stovetop.You may not be able to reach temperatures required to cook poultry or thick cuts of meat.

Prepare the iron.,
Remove from heat if the food starts smoking.,
Make a grilled cheese sandwich or quesadilla.,
Cook bacon with the iron.,
Prop the iron upside down to use as a skillet.,
Make a foil tray.,
Cook food in the foil tray.,
Remove the tray with clothes pins.",How to Cook Food in a Hotel Room3," Most hotels keep a clothes iron in the closet, or have them available upon request. Turn off the steam and set the iron to the cotton or linen setting before you begin cooking.Make sure the water reservoir is empty, or you may have trouble reaching high temperatures.

, Most hotel rooms have a smoke detector that cannot be turned off. If you notice any smoke, remove the food from the heat and turn off the iron for a couple minutes before you get back to cooking.

, Place the sandwich or quesadilla between two layers of foil. Crimp the foil edges together to seal it into a packet. Press the iron over the entire packet for about 30 seconds. Turn over the packet carefully, without tearing the foil, and cook another 30 seconds on the other side.Repeat if necessary.


You can make any kind of grilled sandwich this way, as long as all ingredients are already cooked or can be eaten raw. Try a dessert sandwich with peanut butter and chocolate chips.

, Cut bacon strips in half and place them between two sheets of foil, crimping the edges together. Press the iron firmly over the entire foil packet. Open the packet carefully with a fork every few minutes to check to see if the bacon is done and to let out the steam. It'll take about 15 minutes to get crisp bacon.


You may need to pour out the grease occasionally to prevent the bacon becoming soggy. Pour out grease into a trash can or over other food (such as cooked rice), never into a plumbing drain.
Cooking raw meat with a clothes iron takes some bravery. For the lowest chance of bacterial contamination, wait until the bacon is fully crisp., Prop up the iron using a pair of rolled-up towels or other small objects. Make sure it is firmly wedged to create a flat, stable surface.


Keep the iron on the ironing board to minimize risk of burning.

, Always place heavy-duty aluminum foil between the iron and the food. Fold the edges of the foil upward to catch liquids.This will protect your food from contamination, and the iron from damage.


Use two sheets of foil if it is not labeled ""heavy-duty.""

, It's best to stick with foods that are safe to eat raw, or that have clear visible indicators that they are fully cooked. Here are a few options:


Grease the tray with butter and crack 1–2 eggs into it. Cook 7–10 minutes or until the eggs hold together, then flip them over and cook on the other side.
Wrap vegetables in greased foil and cook until desired temperature is reached.
Wrap scallops in the foil tray and cook until firm and milky white or opaque.Cook shrimp until it turns red and opaque., Use two wooden clothes pins to pick up the foil once the food is cooked, transferring it on to a plate.The foil will be quite hot, so don't touch it with your bare hands.


Never use plastic clothes pins, which could melt.

This method has the lowest risk of an explosion, which could be devastating to the microwave and your hotel bill:Separate the whites and yolk. Put them in two separate cups. Pierce the yolk, and cover each cup with plastic wrap or a paper towel. Microwave the white for 30–60 seconds, then microwave the yolk for 20–30 seconds. Leave them to finish cooking for 2 minutes before eating.

, Cover a small handful of pasta with water. Microwave for 3–4 minutes longer than the suggested cooking time. Check every few minutes, stirring and rotating the bowl.

, Wash the potato in the bathroom sink, then pierce the skin with a fork on all four sides. Cook for 5 minutes, then turn it over and cook another 3–5 minutes. Check occasionally by poking it with a fork; the potato is done when the center is soft. Let stand five minutes to finish cooking, then cut it open and eat with butter and salt.

Understand you will be a guest in someone’s home.,
Read contracts carefully before signing.,
Beware of paying in advance.,
Make safety a priority.,
Trust your instincts.",How to Book a Travel Homestay3," Booking a travel homestay means you will be sleeping in the home or on the property of someone who lives in your travel destination.

You might even be expected to help with cooking and cleaning tasks, depending on your arrangement., Before you book your travel homestay, you will need to make sure you read the fine print.

Research the Government, social structure and laws:

This was certainly the main era where the parliament gained much power and frequently rivaled the power of the crown, which dependent on them to release finance to pay the debts of the crown, which included many aspects like military, foreign affairs and infrastructure that today would be covered by civilian government.,
Learn about the Cuisine: The main meal structure was still service a la Francaise, with sweet and savoury dishes served at once, although placed symmetrically and attractively, however like the Tudors, they kept the Banquet course, which was exclusively a dessert and after-dinner meal.,
Learn about the clothing of the Stuarts.,
Learn about the daily life of the people of this era.,
Explore more facets of 17th century England.",How to Learn About the English Stuart Period (17th Century)," This was a frequent source of conflict.
During the reign of James I & Charles I, rights for women did decrease although during the commonwealth era, freedoms for women, particularly in education increased. However the trade off was theatre, Christmas (which has its roots in Pagan Roman celebrations) and many frivolities were banned by the Puritans so this conflicted era limited the freedom of all genders to enjoy themselves.
James I however, was firm in his fear and belief in witchcraft and it is largely from his irrational fear that the many witch trials occurred, some of the tortures personally supervised by the King. Later though, he became more skeptical of the idea of witch-craft, but the culture had permeated through the people into a fear that remained for some time, particularly in the American colonies.
During the Stuart era, particularly during James I and Anne, many new peerages were created often sold off to fund the crown or to reward financial and political gains. The new aristocracy and wealth would become a major source growth to Great Britain as well as its expanding empire.
An important development during the middle Stuart era was the rising power of a society known as “The Levellers” or “Agitators”, who believed in universal suffrage between men, electoral reform, elections to be held every two years, religious freedoms, the cessation of tithes and the end of imprisonment for debts, as well as acknowledgement of “natural” human rights, all of which targeted the power of existing political and religious institutions. As slavery was an important facet in the American colonies and elsewhere, these enlightened views first appeared in this period, but would take many centuries before they would become mainstream.
Religion played an incredibly important role during this time. The Catholic population who had long been suppressed under the Tudors rebelled early in James I reign, the Gunpowder plot and Guy Fawkes Day being observed even today. Religion also led to the civil war and became a frequent conflict throughout the century.

, Breakfast was typically open as to when consumed until 11am, but after that was the main meal of the day – Dinner, which was served at lunch time. In England, like the Tudors before them, they tended to eat well during the day, but very lightly after that if eating anything for an evening meal except on special occasions.

This era introduced the fork, which was introduced to the court by Charles II during the restoration. Before then, meals were consumed with a spoon and knife.
The fashion for spices so beloved of the Tudors began to wane in this period, as the more plain food of the Scottish court became fashionable, as well as influence from French cuisine which was developing away from the medieval cuisine.
Like the Tudors, meats of all kinds were very common, and vegetables were distrusted for being dirty and peasant-food, people of this era engaged in what’s called nose to tail eating, which involved organs such as tongue, tripe, lungs, heart, liver, kidneys, brains, marrow and essentially that was edible was consumed. Cockscombs were popular as well, yet fish was suddenly hugely more expensive than in the Tudor period and became a luxury, the most expensive was usually venison and whole salmon.
Water was almost never consumed. Bacterial infections and other contaminants were rife so ale, beer, wine and mixed drinks were consumed instead. Milk in this era was seldom consumed as it was frequently a cause of illness due to unsanitary conditions.
Cheese was a major ingredient, as milk went out of fashion so dairies started producing more cheese instead.
The diet of this era was hugely unhealthy - high in protein, low in vegetables and high in alcohol. This demineralized the bones of the wealthy, so the liver started to accrue more calcium which led to large and very painful kidney stones. Eventually the sufferer had them extracted, the method of which was so painful the patient often fainted from the pain (or even fainted before the operation). As there was no such thing as surgical hygiene in this age, many wounds never healed and the tools were often still damp with the blood and urine from the last patient.
Coffee was introduced in the later Stuart period and was hugely popular, with coffee houses serving as local salons for intellectuals where local news and political pamphlets, new arts such as poetry and other intellectual discoveries were discussed. Tea and sugar also started to be more common later in the period. As in the past, both men and women relied on low alcohol beer as water was contaminated, coffee and tea became a very welcome alternative.
At this time, like the Tudors, pies were a very popular meal for all classes, usually cooked in a thick pastry layer (as much as 2 inches thick) which was referred to as a coffin. This coffin was sometimes eaten, but often a decorative and inedible) pastry was used as a lid and / or container of the pie and was used and reused many times. Pies were often made containing a wide range of meats including chicken heads, and would generally supply meals for a week as fuel was expensive and so it was cooked once a week.
Other popular new ingredients were the pineapple, which was so expensive and exclusive that special glasshouses were produced to grow them (glass was highly expensive in those days). It would become a major symbol in English architecture for centuries afterwards. Ice cream and plum pudding was also created and one of the most expensive ingredients was parmesan, so fashionable it was spelt as “parmesan” and had duty import taxes in dozens of cities en route to the UK. Samuel Pepys, a wealthy diarist buried his parmesan to protect it during the great fire of London.
Later in the era, vegetables became more popular. While in the restoration period eating vegetables was seen as a food that give little energy and a propaganda book was later made - claiming to be written by the deposed Cromwell household - blaming the failure of the commonwealth due to their excessive use of “indigestible” vegetables and their frugal cuisine. Later, after a scholar named John Evelyn lost his wife due to the very unhealthy food, it became more frequent after he published a new cookbook featuring vegetables and fruit as a health food.
The poor, lived mostly on bread, stews, gruel and low alcohol beer, however in the country outside of the city, the access to farm produce was higher and the aristocracy typically retired away from the city during epidemics and other problems in the cities and generally ate more healthily. Dried peas were commonly cooked in a pot for a long period, which gave us the verse “peas pottage hot, peas pottage cold, peas pottage in the pot, 9 days old” as it would be cooked and served as a main staple.

, Fashions changed dramatically and quickly in this era and it was often very important to represent your standing at court as to how up to date your clothing was.


In this age, the leggings for men faded away from hose and stockings into breeches with high boots, frequently with the top collar of the boot turned down to be around knee height. The stiff old ruff collars evolved into linen and lace collars, often just as large and ornamental as the old ruffs, but more comfortable and elegant.
The older Tudor fashion of designing slits in clothes to reveal layers underneath, developed less in the bodice and more into the sleeves and doublets, which had full slits or panels of fabric sewn into them to be more decorative.
The French style became very popular during the reign of Charles I, who was married to a French Queen. The early period of James I was heavy in dark colours, often reflecting a melancholic and weary persona and occasionally with a heavy cloak or gown, which soon fell out of fashion. This followed the death of Elizabeth I as well as possibly the weariness of the many wars of her reign.
Wealthy men often wore elaborate hats, generally tall hats or ones with wide, flaring brims. Moustaches and beards in the Van-Dyke fashion were hugely popular although it fell out of fashion later. For women, hats also became an important status symbol, favouring tall hats for outside use and linen caps inside.
For women and men, the waistlines rose quite highly and became a pronounced feature. Both genders also often wore corsets and the hairline started to drop, becoming at first popular with curly hair at shoulder height, then dropping lower, although the Puritan era this was a taboo so the hair was kept straight. As lice were common in this age, it became more common to shave and wear wigs, particularly by the Charles II & his brother James II – today you still find Judges and Lawyers wearing wigs whose origins came from this era.
For women, the neckline dropped quite deeply, lighter and brighter satins and silks became very popular for women, often worn over a linen chemise.
During the Puritan era of Oliver Cromwell, colours reverted to more plain clothing although it was not exclusively black; tawny and other browns, maroons, and plain greens were more common, as black dye was very expensive. Fashions and ornate frivolities were generally limited and more modest, aiming for a more simple and humble fashion. After the restoration of Charles II, this style was quickly abandoned.
The non aristocratic demographic mostly relied on wool, hemp, linen although access to bright colours had opened up far more than the Tudors allowed. However, it was during this period that the poorer people were either engaged far more in industrial or agricultural areas or were employed in the military and navy so practical clothing or uniforms were often favoured. The breeches and jerkins of the wealthier classes (which were more practical than the Tudor fashions) were adopted.

, War and political conflicts were common throughout the entire period. Firstly the period was recovering from the Spanish Armada some decades earlier, but also with the civil wars and later wars with France as well as the invasion which enacted William and Mary's reign.

A lot of music and other arts were introduced during this era, and while society was more modest and constrained during the early phases, came more debauched in the restoration era as adultery was fairly common – the King himself had numerous mistresses, taking his lead from the French court to which he was related.
The Stuarts loved entertainments, such as music, poetry, dancing, plays and theatre and this baroque era contributed much to classic music, art, furnishings, clothing and other fashions. Gold and gilt became more popular in this age than any other time in history before then. There came a big change across Europe towards the Italian fashions from Florence and Venice – large cultural centres even today.
Diseases were very common. Smallpox, syphilis and many other diseases were rife amongst all classes. Many of the diseases, including the feared plagues which decimated the population of London during this era and particularly the 1660's came from sea ships, carrying rats and diseased crew.
The fire of London in 1666 destroyed much of the old city, so for many years rebuilding it was a major occupation. Famous architects such as Christopher Wren had collaborated to redesign London entirely, but the complex land ownership forced them to keep within the narrow designs of the past. However this age created a boon in quality of Baroque architecture such as the work of Inigo Jones and improvements to city infrastructure and services.
Many inventions and technologies were designed or reinvented during this age after being lost to classical antiquity. Such examples were the seed drill, a professional fire brigade (although the early models meant you had to be a paid member or a neighbour to a paid member or they would not rescue your house), steam engines, microscopes, colour fast dyes, gymnasiums, public transport and pendulum clocks, as well as the fountain pen being more available, the fork (before then a knife and spoon were used), experimental science including scientists such as Boyle and Newton.
Pets were more popular, although in the earlier periods cats were something of a taboo being associated as a witches “familiar”. Dogs however were more popular, such as the iconic Cavalier King Charles spaniel.

Form a basic understanding of historical theory.,
Understand that interpretation varies from historian to historian.,
Familiarize yourself with major scholars on Roman history.,
Know the major questions or problems that historians focus on in their studies of Ancient Rome.",How to Learn About Ancient Rome2," In order to truly learn about and understand the history of Ancient Rome, you also need a basic understanding of historical theory. Knowing historical theory will enable you to put everything you learn into the proper perspective and have framework to understand it.


The history of Rome taught today is an approximation of what occurred in the past.
History is not just events, names, and dates, but also ideas and concepts that help people understand “facts.”
There are no laws that explain everything in history. Historical events are driven by complex causation and by the actions of individual actors. For instance, Rome did not fall because it completed the cycle from democracy, to republic, to dictatorship. It fell due to a variety of reasons including but not limited to environmental degradation, and changing population and economic trends., Before you delve into learning about Roman history, you should understand that interpretations will vary from historian to historian. This is important to realize, as most historians acknowledge that there is no way to truly know the past the way it was lived by the people during the time.


Historical interpretations change over time.
Different historians will frame the same events and people in different ways.

, After you understand that interpretation varies from historian to historian, you should familiarize yourself with some of the best known scholars of Ancient Rome. Ultimately, by familiarizing yourself with the work of many historians, you’ll have a much more complete view of the history of Rome. Consider:Reading the work of Livy and Tacitus, Roman historians who wrote during the first century C.E. These historians focused on questions of political power and growth of empire. In many ways, their work reflects the power of Rome during the time in which they lived.
Reading the work of Edward Gibbon. Gibbon’s work reflected late eighteenth century British interest in empire and imperialism.
Reading the work of Géza Alföldy. Alföldy’s work reflects late-20th century interest in social history, which was a departure from the focus on politics and power., An important part in learning about Ancient Rome is knowing and understanding the central questions that historians have focused on in their studies. Knowing these questions will give you an analytical framework and a point of departure as you educate yourself about Rome.

Inform yourself about the festivals of Ancient Rome.",How to Learn About Ancient Rome3," One of the first steps you should take is to learn about the timeline of Ancient Rome. Learning about Rome’s timeline will help you understand the many events, figures, and periods that are essential in understanding Ancient Rome. Consider a few major events:


According to legend, Rome was founded in 753 B.C.E. by Romulus and Remus. In this era, the Kingdom of Rome grew large and powerful.
Rome transitioned to a republic in 509 B.C.E. The people of Rome had decided that their survival was consistently threatened by Roman rulers trying to exercise absolute power. This era introduced a constitution, magistrate and senate. This system was designed to balance the power of government.
In the centuries after this, Rome won a very costly and lengthy series of wars against invading Gaul and Carthage.
After the assassination of Julius Caesar in 44 B.C.E. and a civil war between his heirs Octavian and Mark Antony, Octavian proclaimed himself Emperor and the Republic became an Empire. A period of 200 years of peace and stability, known as the “Pax Romana,” followed.
Rome slowly began to decline.
In the 2nd and 3rd centuries C.E., the empire split into east and west. The west which included Rome itself, further divided and collapsed. The eventual sacking of Rome by invaders in 476 C.E. signaled the start of the Middle Ages in Europe.
The Eastern empire continued much longer, ruled from Constantinople, until it was eventually annexed by the Ottoman Empire., Before Christianity took hold in the third century C.E., Roman religion was dominated by a pantheon of gods and complex mythologies. Understanding the religion, philosophy, and mythology of Rome is central in learning about Roman history.


Gods and goddesses took various roles from health, wealth and fortune, to obscure spirits who looked after door thresholds.
In Ancient Rome, there was a deity or mythology to account for almost every experience a person could encounter.
Roman temples varied from grand structures such as the Pantheon, down to small household shrines known as Larariums., The empire was symbolically ruled by the emperor. The emperor controlled the army, looked after foreign affairs, and served as an arbitrator between the ruling families of Rome. Learning about this system will give you a much better understanding of Rome as a whole.


Like many other ancient cultures, there was a rigid social structure from slaves up to the ruling class.
Women, children, slaves and the common man or laborer, known as a plebeian, could not vote and had little recognition in Roman law.
The father of the family held control not only of his entire household and estate, but also his sons' land. A landowner could not exercise complete management while his own father lived.
Voting was often used and abused by the powerful elite. Voters who were eligible were divided up into classes and the order of voting was cast from wealthiest to poorest, so the poorer families who could vote were lumped into one class and seldom had a chance to vote at all.
Most legislation was drafted and passed by a popular assembly known as the ""Comitia Tributa,"" while the Senate acted as a powerful advisory council which often made it very difficult to pass new laws and reforms.
During the time of the republic, the ruler essentially held a role as first citizen. When Rome was an empire, the rulers held absolute power., Knowing about Roman commerce and the economy is very important in understanding the complexity of ancient Rome. This is especially important as Rome’s global reach was very much economic in character.


Rome had its own units of measurement, including the pes or foot. The foot was divided into 12 unicae or inches, much like the imperial method still used today.
Part of what made Rome more powerful and easier to trade with was their unified coinage system. This allowed coins to be legally produced at mints around the empire.
What complicated the economy was Rome's lack of accountable budget or reserve institutions. The territories earned funds for the empire in farm and other taxes, as well as tribute - but these often flowed through provincial governors before it made its way to Rome. These funds were often embezzled by officials or stolen by bandits.
Roman trade depended on sea ships and as Rome grew, so did its control of the Mediterranean Sea and the coastal lands that bordered it. Rome also had an extensive road network that connected the entire empire., Generally, much can be learned about Roman history by looking at notable Romans and how they lived and influenced Rome. Not only are the histories of Roman people interesting, but they’re a look into larger Roman life and society.


Think about rulers, such as Julius Caesar, Augustus, and Mark Antony.
Consider philosophers and scientists, such as Cicero, Epictetus and Seneca.
Look into learning about average Roman citizens. For more information, read: A Day in the Life of Ancient Rome: Daily Life, Mysteries, and Curiosities by Alberto Angela., Roman diet and food is also very important in understanding Roman history. Knowing about the foods of Ancient Rome will give you keen insight into how Romans lived.


Meat was an expensive luxury and their diet would occasionally feature meat which would be the main event of the meal. Common meat included pigeon, rabbit, pork, and game birds. Geese, chicken and fish, however, were very expensive and consumed by the wealthy households.
Breakfast was often called a ""jentaculum"" which was often served at dawn and included bread dipped in wine. Romans also ate fruit, honey, egg dishes and cheese, with meat being a staple in the wealthy households. The main meal of the day known as ""cena,"" would often start in the early afternoon until late at night if guests were invited.
Wealthy Romans often ate reclining as well as eating off a table known as a ""mensa."" These banquets developed into the three main courses popular today - ""gustatio"" which was a first course, the ""primae mensae"" which was the main event, and the ""secundae mensae"" which was the dessert.
Roman breads were a luxury and bakers were famous for the loaves, rolls and fruit tarts. Bread for the poor, however, was tough stuff. It was heavy and usually made from spelt and other grains. It usually needed soaking in wine or water to be palatable as it quickly went stale.
The Romans also loved using spices and a salty sauce known as “garum.” Garum was made from fermented fish and fish guts that were slowly fermented over a few months. The Romans also used olive oil and wine vinegar as dressings., The Romans were great party-goers and their calendars show several dozen important festivals. Sacred days on the Roman Calendar typically outnumbered secular days, so there was always an opportunity to celebrate. Understanding important Roman festivals will give you great insight into Roman life.


One of the biggest celebrations ""Saturnalia"" is said to be a precursor to the Christmas celebrations celebrated today.
When learning about the different festivals of Ancient Rome, consider their context, origins, and the perspective of the person writing about them. This is important as it will tell you a lot about how they are framing their interpretation of those festivals."

It is not clear when Egyptian history truly started although by 5500 BC communities were settling around the Nile and developing agriculture. This era is typically known as the Pre-dynastic period. The climate was far less arid then than it is now, with much of the land covered with Savannah and grasslands.
The Early Dynastic period started around 3050BCE is typically formed by the uniting of two Kingdoms, Upper Egypt, which paradoxically is in the south of Egypt and Lower Egypt which is in the northern Nile Delta regions. This period developed the powerful institution of the Pharaohs, which were critical to its stability, regional influence and survival. In 2868 BC the period known as the Old Kingdom started, it was within this age that greater developments started, such as a justice system, taxation system and other levels of governance as well as more advanced crop management. The practice of creating Pyramids started in this era, creating what would become many ""cities of the dead"" which are known as necropolis. In this age were the building of the pyramids of Giza and the Sphinx among many others.
In 2181 BC, power struggles as well as over a century of famine conditions weakened the structure of Egypt and created what is known as the First Intermediate Period. This period lasted a relatively short time as Egypt had re-split into Upper and Lower Egypt and the period ended when the two rival dynasties went to war, with the winners being Upper Egypt who ruled from Thebes.
In 2134 BC The Pharaohs of the Upper Kingdom had reunited Egypt and set to restore the countries prosperity. This era is known as the Middle Kingdom and an age when Egypt controlled great wealth from agriculture, precious metals and led to a great revival of arts, literature and architecture. This kingdom collapsed yet again due to famine and restive migrants.
1674 BC was the start of the Second Intermediate Period. In this age the Pharaohs power was heavily reduced and was expected to pay tribute to what were seen as foreign rulers that are known as 'Hyksos'. However they did absorb Egyptian culture as a way to hold power and introduced many new inventions. The Pharaoh's court was forced to remain at the old capital, where it was kept busy by an old enemy Nubia (Sudan & Ethiopia) to the south and the Hyksos to the North.
By 1549BCE, The Pharaohs had gradually built the military and defeated both Nubia and the Hyksos, which lead to the New Kingdom. In this age the Egyptian Empire was at its largest and saw a great period of arts, monument building and literature. This age built vast wealth, however as its religious institutions become too powerful, the nation fractured once again.
The Third Intermediate Period lasted for quite some time, starting from 1069 BC and was ruled by many dynasties, including many Libyan princes. While the empire regained power, wealth and prestige, it also was a period with many wars that led to an eventual decline.
By 672BCE, the two kingdoms were reunited and this is known as the Late period. In this age Egypt was threatened by many different Kingdoms and was eventually conquered the the Greeks in 332BCE, by Alexander the Great.
The Ptolemaic period was 3 centuries ruled by Greek dynasties, however the Hellenistic culture did not overthrow the ancient culture and the Greek rulers absorbed the local culture and religion to hold power. 30 BCE is marked by the famous story of Cleopatra, arguably the last true independent Pharaoh of Egypt, but does not count as the last Egyptian Pharaoh which was before the invasion by Greece. The stories say that Cleopatra having failed to fend off a Roman invasion during a Roman civil war with her Roman lover Mark Antony and committed suicide after which Egypt swiftly fell to the Romans.;
, Egypt had an enormous variety of different creation myths, legends as well as Gods and Goddesses. This lasted until 391 when the Christian emperors eroded and banned any traditional institutions. Eventually, Christianity gave way to Islam which is the majority religion today.


In ancient Egypt, the location of the Nile was important. The living lived on the east of the Nile, where the sun rose, and in a rite of passage the deceased were taken to the west of the Nile, which were the lands of the dead. The tradition of placing pennies in the coffin or on the corpse to pay for the ferryman comes from ancient Egypt.
Deities were not always seen as benevolent and the faithful prayed to them for protection against their wrath. This pattern also created many of the animal Gods such as the hippopotamus - a most dangerous creature - as well as other predators.
The overall system was complex, and the priests typically made little effort to unify the religion and resolve conflicting myths. This in many ways did not seem to pose a major problem as it would today.
Egypt was also the place where the worlds first recorded monotheistic religion started long before the current religions of today. This was a short lived period ruled by Akhenaten, who worshiped a sun God known as Aten. After this king died, his successor, Tutankhaten, revived the old ways and changed his name to Tutankhamun, cementing his power by invoking the old Sun God Amun.
The later transfer from the old religions to Christianity was not a smooth transition, with the mathematician and philosopher Hypatia later murdered outside a large Church during a time of political rivalry as a scapegoat. This event is sometimes marked as the end of the classical civilization.
The Pharaohs and the nobles were mummified as a way to ensure their pathway to eternal paradise was safe. To help preserve the body, parts were extracted (including the brain through the nose) and stored in canopic jars. They often took furniture, gold, food and slaves (in early days slaves were entombed alive with the Pharaoh, but later sculptural images were made to represent them), as things to enjoy in the next world.
Egyptian temples were slightly different to Greek and Roman temples. The God occupied a small sanctum or chamber and the priests dealt directly with the God - the common person usually didn't even get close but used the priest as an intermediary. On very special occasions the image of the god was taken out into the public space for worship.
Gods served as an important role not only in life, but in death. A person who traveled to the underworld had their heart weighed on a pair of scales against the feather of truth, while they were interrogated by the Gods about their life. Should their heart be heavy (also if they lie), their heart would be fed to a demon monster and that person would then be damned.

, Egypt was quite advanced in its time in medicine. The stone ground flour was gritty and wore down Egyptians teeth, the close proximity to the Nile bought parasites, malaria and other diseases and a lot of work related injuries. Many mummies reveal the wealthy were often overweight from a rich diet. Adult life expectancy for Egyptians was around 35 and with infant mortality high with 1/3 of infants dying, the Egyptians lived fast and died young, and death was a central facet of their philosophy.


Egyptian doctors were highly specialized so that there were doctors for specific ailments. Egyptians at quite an early age used bandages, set bones, stitched wounds, performed dentistry, amputated limbs, had an understanding of anatomy and even created prosthetic.
In medicine, they used honey as an antiseptic, herbal medicines and opium for pain management (many of these are still used today in processed forms), but not all medicines actually worked, some of them have been shown to have no curative properties, relied on sorcery and some even contained animal dung!
Egyptians were early and very skilled in glass making, creating their own type of glass known as Faience. They made many household and decorative objects as well as tiles out of glass.
They were also expert shipbuilders, mastering the art as early as 3000 BC, as their location on the Nile river as well as access to the Mediterranean sea made ships a highly useful tool to trade and transport wares.
The ancient Egyptians were expert mathematicians and engineers, which was an important skill not only around the nation but for building the great monuments Egypt is famous for. While it is still open to debate how the Egyptians created vast palaces, temples, pillars, obelisks, pyramids and other structures, it is certain the Egyptians were skilled at the architectural sciences.
Other important early development are paper from papyrus, art and painting, precision tools, mining, irrigation, astronomy, metal smelting, ceramics, pigment making and masonry.

, Egypt had as principal the pharaoh who enacted most laws. While Egypt does not seem to have had a fixed legal code like the modern world (or one that has survived), most cases were resolved by arbitration between local elders in a common sense methodology, preferring mediation or an agreement between the two.


Severe crimes tended to be referred to the Pharaoh & the vizier to judge. The system was complex for these cases as the Judge was also the prosecutor and the plaintiff and defendant in the case had to defend their own cases. Punishments were often severe and extended to the family of the criminal.
Egyptian society was very class conscious and unlike the Greeks had little fluidity between the hierarchical classes. After the Pharaoh came the scribes, officials and then the priests, doctors, engineers and other scholars, below them came the craftsmen and workers, below them were the farm workers and at the bottom of the ladder were the slave populations.
However, ancient Egypt like Greece did have an equal system for men and women where they were equal under the law and all classes except the slaves could petition to have their case heard and resolved. Egyptian women were more free than their descendants in the modern religions. Both men and women could also marry, own property, sell and trade, inherit and make contracts equally, which was unlike many of Egypt’s neighbors The downside is that they tended to have less access to education if their family did not persist in it, did not always occupy high positions in administration and that while many women ruled as Pharaoh; they often wore a symbolic and prosthetic beard to represent masculine strength.
The military defended the nation and was typically recruited from the populace but in later years, which caused much strife, relied on mercenaries and foreign troops.
Egypt however had a very centralized and well managed economy, in which the temples played in a key role as many granaries and good pasture was in the temple property. All products bought and wages paid were on a fixed rate, so inflation was heavily controlled. Workers were paid in a fixed rate of grain of which they could barter with and administrators were paid in grain and silver or copper.
Enforced recruitment was known during times of pyramid and monument building (which seeing the short life expectancy was quite often), as well as times of civil war which was also fairly common.

, Egypt was a world spice center and an important part of the world as the fertile valley around the Nile had regular flood and dry periods which allowed new silt rich to improve the soil. This gave Egypt regular crop surpluses in good years, but like today, the Nile is still the life source of Egypt.
Like many other cultures, the ancient Egyptians relied a lot of beer as a beverage as the Nile water was unsafe to drink. This beer was often thick, cloudy and nutritious almost to being a watery porridge or gruel. Wine was imported or made locally, but beer was the beverage for the common people.
Vegetables could be grown almost year round and included a lot of onions and garlic, lettuce, pulses and beans - especially lentils and chickpeas, as well as varieties of cucumber, gourd and water plant tubers.
Fruits included melons, dates, nuts, figs, grapes and pomegranates. Coconuts were imported from the tropics at great expense and by the Roman period, they had a range of stone fruits such as apple, pear, plums and quince as well as almonds, walnuts and pistachios.
The ancient Egyptian diet was low in sugar, but the Egyptians did like their sweet dishes which were frequently made of honey, sweet carob pods, dates and figs.
In the early dynasties when the Nile valley was lush and green, meat was a common staple, which included antelope, birds such as duck, geese and quail, as well as ostrich, crocodile and even hippo and porcupine! They also farmed cows, goats, sheep and pigs for consumption and fished often, but fish was more a commoner’s diet, where further north in Rome & Greece, fish was incredibly expensive.
Other staples include breads, cheese and eggs, but for the poorer people bread, beer and legumes or pulses tended to be the main foundations.

, The Egyptian home varied according to the wealth of the inhabitant, basic homes were typically mud brick houses, often with white painted walls, reed mat carpets, decorative fabric wall hangings and a semi detached kitchen, which was usually made without a roof to be able to let the heat and smoke of the fires out of the house.


The Egyptian bed was usually a solid wooden frame bed, with a reed mat if any for padding, the beds often doubled up as seating during the day. There was no pillow, but a headrest made from wood or metal as the only additional comfort.
The Egyptians enjoyed theater although as the climate is excessively hot, it was never as big as the Greeks and Romans who built vast amphitheater and circus arenas. However the Abydos Passion play is still likely to be the world’s oldest existent play.
Clothing in ancient Egypt was very egalitarian, both men and women wore a large folded piece of bleached white linen, while children wore no clothes until they were 12 after which they were given clothing and had their heads shaved.
Popular past-times includes board games such as Senet, Mehen (unfortunately the rules have long been lost so it is unknown how to play this game) and Hounds and Jackals. For the youth, ball games, wrestling and games such as marbles made from old knuckle bones were popular. Egyptian games didn't have dice, so used a series or color coded sticks or bones to create values.
The wealthy classes often enjoyed hunting and fishing, but the poorer classes were typically tied to their farms and so had little time for leisure during the day.
Hygiene was very important, which in a hot climate is an important consideration as well as for religion. Men and women bathed often if not daily and used a soap made from oils and sand or fat and crushed chalk. Men often shaved their entire bodies and both genders used scented ointments as a perfume. Women often used a mirror made of polished bronze and both genders used Kohl, which is an eye makeup with medicinal as well as sun protective qualities.
The Egyptians loved music and parties, although they were expensive. Common instruments included a wide range such as drums, cymbals, bells, flutes, trumpets, pipe instruments, lyres and harps.
Egyptian palaces were much grander affairs, often featuring great painted murals, polished stone and fine furnishings - often expensive wood such as cedar imported from elsewhere, to be able to express the great wealth of Egypt.

Locate your nearest local group as listed by your Kingdom.,
Contact the local groups Chatelaine.,
Think about your ""persona"".,
Embrace the T-Tunic.,
Participate.,
Purchase an SCA membership, if you choose.,
Continue to research your persona, build skills, develop friendships, and more.,
Have fun!",How to Join the SCA," You can locate this on www.sca.org, if you are unsure. The Known World is divided up into several Kingdoms, and within each Kingdom are groups with a geographic area. Generally you will want to get in touch with the group nearest to you.


Having a friend get you in contact with your local group is an even better way.
You may want to get involved with the group closest to where you spend your time, rather than your permanent home address. For instance, if you are a college student, it is more likely you will have more contact with a group based in or around your college, rather than necessarily your permanent home address.;
, The Chatelaine is the designated person to help orient and guide new people.


Some larger and particularly well-organized groups have Newcomer's meetings and sessions to prepare to participate in events. If there is, attend! Very often these meetings also help you do things like sew easy clothing to wear to SCA events, learn who is who in your group, and put you in touch with people with common interests.
If not, find out when the next event is. SCA events occur year-round and vary from small day feasts or demonstrations to some of the largest historical re-enactment events in the world. For a first event, the best choice is generally to choose a smaller event close to home.
Every SCA group is different. There are things that are fairly common throughout the SCA, but each local group has its own history, personalities, politics, and concentration of interests. Your friend's experience with his or her group may not be yours in another.
At most events, there will be a Gold Key, which is a service to offer loaner clothing for beginners.
However, it is best if your local Chatelaine or any SCA friends know to bring loaner gear to have it available and be in your size, gender, and so on.
At camping events, it is acceptable to have modern-style camping gear. Experienced SCAdians generally aim to have Middle Ages style tents, but this is not required or expected right away.

, The idea of one's ""persona"" in the SCA is very important. In the SCA, you will take on an identity based on a ""possible historical identity."" You will also take on a name reflecting your choice. You will not need this all done at your first event, and it is advisable to think carefully about your choice; although nothing is irreversible, what you choose will be how people know you!


Your persona cannot be fantasy-based. You cannot be an elf, vampire, fairy, or werewolf for instance. You cannot be Sir Lancelot, Beowulf, or Morgan le Fay.
Your persona must be based in the Middle Ages era. (Roughly speaking, the Fall of Rome to 1800).
You cannot take the persona of a famous historical person. You cannot be Queen Elizabeth. You could, however, be one of Queen Elizabeth's archers or lace-makers.
The SCA is focused on the Middle Ages of Europe. However, ""Contact Cultures"" (meaning cultures that were in contact with Europe) are welcome. This includes Middle Eastern, African, and Asian.
Samurai are popular. The strength of Japanese contact with Middle Ages Europe is admittedly minimal. However, the culture of Middle Ages Europe parallels Feudal Age Japan. And frankly, it somehow works.
You cannot be a ""generic"" anything. Very early in the SCA's history, one could be simply ""a barbarian"", ""a minstrel"", ""an archer"" or ""a pirate"". However, the focus has shifted so that you have to think more fully about the history and flesh out your persona a bit more. Better personas: ""A 5th century Germanic Saxon"", ""A 12th century troubadour from Lyons"", ""13th century Mongolian horse archer"", ""17th century Spanish privateer"".
You cannot give yourself any titles. For example, you cannot be a Knight, Baroness, or King because in the SCA that are ranks that are earned.
You do not have the be the same race, ethnicity, or gender of your persona. A woman may wear male clothing, or a man wear his Elizabethan gown in a clothing contest. You may see a person of African descent wearing Japanese armor or a kilt. A red-headed woman may choose to be an 15th century Irishwoman, Egyptian dancing performer, a Viking chieftain, a Chinese silk embroiderer, and more!
These possibilities and restrictions may seem daunting at first. But generally something sparks an interest. Maybe it is a gown that somehow...just seems right. Or you learn something about your Romanian ancestry that makes a connection. Maybe you discover you have a talent for the rapier, and so choosing a Renaissance era persona becomes natural.

, Before you have settled fully on a persona, you will still need clothing that works for SCA events. Even if you know what your persona will be, you may not yet have the money,skills, or research to create clothing appropriate to for you. The T-Tunic is usually what newbies start with.


The T-tunic is a simplified version of the common tunic, which was used in one form or another throughout the Middle Ages in Europe and beyond. It is essentially a long T-shirt, often belted at the waist.
T-Tunics are typically cut so that it reaches ankle-length on women, and just under the knees for men--although men also sometimes wear ankle-length tunics.
Men often wear pants under the tunic. Plain sweatpants can work for a newbie, if the weather is cool. Pants of lightweight fabric using a simple ""pajama bottom"" patterns yield a nice, loose pair of pants that give a good result.
Tunics can be plain or ornate, unisex or definitely gender-specific. The same basic pattern can create a plain brown tunic suitable for a humble monk, or a highly embellished dress for a wealthy woman in old Constantinople.
Select fabrics that are natural fibers, like cotton or even better, linen. Polyester is hot in warm weather and is dangerous around fire.
Avoid very bright or ""neon"" colors. These were generally unavailable during the Middle Ages. People did wear a wide range of colors--not just drab colors--but shocking pink or electric purple is just wrong for garb.

, The SCA is a vast organization, with something for everyone. But it is something you cannot just watch; you have to get involved. Here is a list of some activities and areas of interest--by no means exhausted, but to give a small taste:


Heavy List Fighting: Fully armored, full contact fighting.
Archery / Crossbow
Feast preparation
Homebrewing
Coursing hounds
Equestrian activities (but NOT jousting)
Dance
Leatherwork
Fencing
Music
Calligraphy
Blacksmithing
Service / Volunteering: We are all volunteers in the SCA, but for many, helping ""make things happen"" is an interest in itself.

, This is optional. It saves you money on the site fees and saves time at the event site. Paid members also get the local kingdom newsletter, which tells where and when events are, and ""Tournaments Illustrated"", a publication on SCA matters, scholarly articles, and other matters of interest. You may be required to have a paid membership if you are doing certain activities. For instance, if your local group is polling on certain matters, you will only have a vote if you are a paid member.

, In time, with participation, curiosity, and a little learning, you will grow within the SCA. This is a process--the most honored among us never stop this process. Even if you do not consider yourself someone who is focused on history, research, and hands-on activities, just being immersed in such a culture will ""rub off on you"". For example:


Select garb based on your decided persona. Your first garb does not need to be based on a particular persona; the T-tunic is recommended for newbies for this reason. When you do settle on a persona, you will want to research what a person in your time and place would wear and create such an outfit.
Train to be a knight in the Society for Creative Anachronism. If you are interested in the ""Heavy List Combat"" which is one of the highest-profile SCA activities, pursuing a knighthood is one way to reach your fullest fighting potential.
Become an expert in a field of interest. For example, creating a toolbox and tools appropriate to a carpenter working on Notre Dame cathedral, and demonstrating how they were used.

, As is said in the SCA, ""If you are not having fun, you aren't doing it right!"".

",How to Learn About the Mayan Civilisation," The Mayan civilisation is far older than the Aztecs, although the Aztecs absorbed many of the customs and cultures of their hosts who were influenced by the Maya, and whom they later came to dominate. However it is not entirely clear when Mayan civilisation truly began. The Mayan long count calendar suggests 3114BC, however it is not clear whether this is a historical date inherited from the Olmecs or a legendary creation date.

The Pre-Classical Period started around 1800 to 2000BC (although it is suggested to have started even earlier around 2600BC in Belize) and extended through to around 250AD, from there it became known as the Classical period which extended to 900AD. After this is typically called the Post Classic period, which extended up to the arrival of the Spaniards & Conquistadors, although the Mayan civilisation still exists today in a syncretized form.
The Pre-Classical Period peoples grew rich by extracting jade, obsidian and seashells. These semi precious stones were used in jewellery, ritual offerings, and expensive crafted wares and for utilitarian use with the obsidian producing reliably sharp edges. They also came rich through the cultivation of cacao (from which Chocolate is produced), the pods and nibs of which traditionally was traded as currency as well as other forms of trade. This culture may have had influence and interactions with the even older Olmec civilisation with whom they traded, but the roots of the Mayan civilisation are still yet to be understood. Around 100AD, the first of two major social collapses started, the cause is still open to debate.
In 250AD, things started to improve for the Mayans and they started to build their mega cities and temple complexes. During the classical period, the Mayan population was in the millions, so for the time was a very large civilisation. Trade, political and social contacts were broad and were quite ingrained to the culture, becoming an important networking system, including trade much further north and in the Caribbean. During this period has several centuries of abundant rainfall, which helped agriculture and the civilisation to flourish, but whenever the climate changed, it led to problems with the harvest, food supplies and consequent warfare, which was both political and for religious purposes.
By 900AD, the civilisation began its second great collapse, with cities once again being abandoned. The sequence of events is still unknown, however scholars and archaeology suggest it was largely the effect of drought and reduction of rainfall, partly contributed by clearing large areas of forest for agriculture. Dependent on access to clean water supplies and rain for the crops that became increasingly scarce, by 1100AD, the peak of the Mayan civilisation was over.
After this period is typically called the Post-Classic and Colonial Periods. Several larger cities managed to survive, perhaps as a result of careful management or that the droughts had not affected them so severely, but also came under increasing external cultural influences. This culture persisted for another few hundred years until they had become reduced to rival city states, which were far more susceptible to the conquering Spaniards. However, it made things more difficult for the conquistadors; unlike the Aztecs and Inca societies, which were run from a central government, the Mayans had no overreaching central structure and so fought independently, often fiercely until one by one they were conquered. Often the conquered communities rebelled which slowed their progress. The conquistadors also had bigger fish to fry as the Mayan territory were not as rich in precious metals as the Aztec and Peruvian nations as the Spanish had hoped, so it took as long as 170 years to completely conquer the Mayan civilisation.;
, Central to many of the Mayan communities was the local ruler and his family, who ran a hereditary throne as well as possibly had near absolute power with the associated belief in divine rule (ie, the King was chosen to rule by the Gods). These rulers would often lead the community in social, political and religious roles.


The visiting Spaniards (after the larger collapse of the Maya) often observed the later cities as little more than a neighbourhood surrounding a temple and palace complex. For this non-centralist politic of the Mayans meant few if any were large cities made the size of the far larger Aztec cities such as Tenochtitlan.
Scribes were a highly respected social class within the Mayan communities, often being priests or of the nobility themselves. The higher caste of priest was more involved in teaching the mathematics and sciences, writing books, appointing new priests acted as advisors and being involved in the higher level rituals. The priests in charge of the sacrifices tended to have a lower status, where the higher status was reserved for the oracle priests and high priests.
Most people (who didn't specialise as warriors) were involved in a service or manufacturing trade, as the civilisation depended on trade to be able to sustain its larger communities and cities. Most produced things such as jewellery, textiles, fine ceramics, paper and book making, and other wares that were often very labour intensive, as the absence of hard metals and many hard stones limited the development of tools and mass production.
There was long distance as well as regional trade so travel between cities was a common occupation for some people. Salt often was dehydrated along the coastlines and traded along with fish and shells to the interior. Lower lands tended to grow Chocolate (Theobroma Cacao) which was traded up to higher mountain areas and other long distance traded goods included honey, precious and hard stones as well as precious metals, decorative feathers and decorative wares, books, ceramics and textiles.
Building the monuments and cities, as well as agriculture would have played an important role. Unfortunately, warfare was also a common threat, if not part of the social structure so local dynasties would often be at threat. The Mayan civilisation was far from a utopia in this regard.
An important social group were those who specialised in herbal medicines, the Mayan climate and landscape being ideal for the growth of pathogens as well as injuries and industrial accidents.
The royalty, referred to as the k'uhul ajaw or holy lords were often viewed almost as demigods, being related to the Gods themselves. This helped them to cement their hereditary dynasties, but also placed them at the forefront of a very religious society, acting as an intermediary to the Gods. Bloodletting as a ritualized method was common amongst the nobility.
It was a fairly popular practice to deform the shape of the head from a very young age. Desirable traits were a flat forehead, often created by tying a wooden board to the infants head to give the backward sloping effect. Also desirable was developing a cross-eyed feature, by dangling a small object in front of them until their eyes developed. Some communities preferred shaping their noses, which were sometimes broken to achieve.

, Like the Aztecs, many of the ancient works were destroyed, so fragments and secreted volumes are all that are left for scholars.

The Popol Vuh, a later work written in colonial times suggests in the Mayan creation myth that the world started as nothing but the sea and the sky (presumably locked in an eternal night), devoid of life. The gods gave light, created the lands and then life. Animals were created first and humans much later although the primary animals created were later turned into stones. The creation of man seemed to have been a trial and error exercise of the Gods, who created man first out of mud and wood, yet finding them mind-less, destroyed them and created man as humans, after a short while, the Gods created the feminine gender.
Like other Meso-American cultures, the Mayans believed in the world composed of three realms, the world, the underworld and the Heavens with gods ruling each of these. The Mayans often performed ritual offerings, as well as sacrifices in scale from symbolic to human sacrifices for a range of reasons such as to appeal to the Gods; to send the victim to Xibalba (the spirit world) with a message or request; to make the sun rise and the growing seasons to come; as a blood debt or acknowledgment to the creators; or to create relations with a particular deity.
Unique among many cultures around the world in its time, the Mayan had a complex number system which included a zero, which allowed them to compute larger mathematical systems. The Mayans were also adept in astronomy in relation to time and the seasons. It is possible that the Mayan were one of the earliest cultures with both a developed writing system and mathematics in Meso America. While there are older cultures that also had this system in a basic form, it seems they flourished and developed under the Maya.
Like many other Meso American cultures, the Mayan had a developed and complex calendar system. The Calendar did have a 365 day and 52 subsection denominations, but the calendar operated more distinct from the solar system, often focusing on lunar movements and the movement of Venus, which was often associated with war.

, The Mayans were specialised in surviving in the rainforest climate, as while it was drier further north and south, civilizations sprouted around lakes and river systems which were ideal for agriculture as well as shipping their wares for trade, but also needed a centralized system to manage the resource. However in the lowlands where the Maya lived, there were few river systems, so the Maya depended on rainfall for their agriculture.


One of the common pastimes was the ballgame which was often played in large, grand courts. While the rules and even the purpose of the game is not fully known, its reckoned that the game was played as a hobby, as well as professionally played in the grand ball courts in the cities. The Meso-American ballgame is possibly the first sport to use a rubber ball and a similar ballgame known as Ulama is still played in central America.
The cities generally held the most people, with population ranging from 5000 up to 50,000 people. It was likely to have been a busy place, with the large plazas thronging with traders and civilians. Apart from grand palace and temple complexes, the cities also held schools, libraries and hospitals. But by the time to Spanish arrived, most of these cities were abandoned and lost to the jungle with the remaining people living in small villages.
The cities were often the sites of visits by religious pilgrims, as well as entertainments such as festivals and ball games. Outside of the cities were often many smallholder farms to grow food for the inhabitants. Those that weren't involved in trade or a skilled labour were typically involved in agriculture.
The young children in Maya communities were trained for a very early age to have a strong work ethic and to support their elders and community. Children started their training as young as 5, typically by their mothers but after this age, boys were raised more by their fathers in a trade or agriculture. By 15, or when they reached puberty they typically had reached a key stage in life and a ritualised celebration was held for them. After this they were expected to be independent as adults, marriage was possible at this age.
The cities primarily were built to make a grand statement of open space with the plazas and causeways being impressively defined with large buildings and pyramids. Later in the history, the cities became more security conscious and open space became a lesser priority as much as fortifications.

, Mayan cuisine was quite varied, although still similar to many of the other local cultures and civilisations in Meso America.

Typical foods were beans, maize varieties, squash and cucurbits, and chilli peppers. Other valued crops were avocados, tomatoes, papaya, pineapple, edible flowers, agave, sweet potatoes and herbs or spices such as vanilla, allspice, native oregano and native aniseed.
The Mayans grew large scale as well as small scale agriculture in forest gardens known as pet kot, which were typically a small garden within a loose stone wall enclosure.
The Maya civilisation was possibly the first to create and value chocolate, creating a drink known as cacahuatl, which influenced the Aztecs from whom we get the word Xocolatl - the base word for chocolate.
Maize was a central staple, being ground into a paste or meal, which would then be made into tortilla or tamales, cooked into beverages such as atole and gruel and cooked in many other ways. It was often processed, being mixed with an alkali such as lye and this process would make many of its nutrients more accessible.
Protein was more common to the Mayan and included turkey, dog meat, deer, monkey, wildfowl, iguana as well as seafood such as fish, shellfish, and turtle.







, Mayan textiles were a highly artistic occupation and the textiles created were often used as gifts and tributes to both the royalty and the Gods.

Clothing was a very labour intensive job, mostly performed by the women. The fibres needed to be gathered and processed from scratch to make the thread and yarn, which could then be weaved or made into a brocade and tapestry. Cotton was the common fabric of choice, but it needed to be washed and picked free of seeds (which was very labour intensive). Other fibres tended to come from native species such as maguey which gave a robust fibre for ropes, hammocks and other tough fabrics.
The method used almost always was with a backstrap, which meant one end of the woven fabric was attached to a wall or a fixture and the other end was attached to a strap to which wrapped around the seated weaver, which would hold it straight and taut.
Fabrics were often coloured vibrantly with dye, as well as tie dyed methods for impact to create a valued gift.
Men typically wore a breechcloth (a style of loincloth) as well as a sleeveless shirt, which was white or coloured. Men of higher ranks would often wear jewellery and ceremonial headwear and neckwear, often made of jade or precious textiles.
Women wore a dress known as a huitl, which was often white and decorated simply, or coloured and highly decorated for special occasions. The huitl is similar to a large loose tunic, which was made to make a dress that went from the shoulders to varying lengths according to local custom, sometimes to the ankles.
Both men and women typically wore sandals, although deer hide moccasins were known. As the weather was tropical for much of the year, in the cooler dry period, both sexes wore a large rectangular piece of cloth that served as a wrap, a blanket at night as well as re-used as a curtain or tapestry depending on how well decorated they were and how wealthy the household was.

In knowing where people in the past went wrong, we can strive to avoid those mistakes and come up with solutions that will help humanity move forward.;
, Many beliefs are based in the historical events of the times. Sometimes the beliefs don't move on even though the times do. It can be helpful to understand that the beliefs are based in the context of what affected people during their lives, such as famine, drought, civil disobedience, poverty, war, etc., so that you can make a judgment call on the value of continuing the interpretation of the beliefs at that time into your time. Often you will be very surprised at the banality of the reasoning that later becomes cloaked in mysticism and finality.

, We're not new in thinking about our purpose on earth. Human beings have always striven to understand our role in the world, the value of being human, the need for us to fulfill a good purpose. If we don't respect what people thought in the past, we lose a great deal of opportunities for informing our own thinking and we fail to see the importance of the many minds doing this hard work before us.

, Although a hackneyed cliché, this is such an apt term that it just makes sense. Many people have no reference point for their ideas because they don't know their history; hence, they tend to assume that their idea is original, novel, new, never-before-thought-of. For the most part, a knowledge of history will inform you that it has been thought of before. Whether or not it has been acted upon and thought through in the way that you are doing now is another story but it is important to know that your idea is neither original nor unusual so that you don't reinvent it. Rather, knowledge of history enables you to leap-frog the mistakes, the wrong alleys, the poor outcomes, and improve upon the idea with your fresh take on things.

, In reading it, we are soon transported away to another world and time that doesn't reflect what we know and see around us now. That is exciting, mind-opening, and enjoyable. We can imagine ourselves in the position of people in the past and wonder how we would have coped; that instills a sense of awe and wonder in us, as well as possibly prompting a think-through of our own resourcefulness.

, Great writers often dip into history for ideas to write about, museums thrive on history, tour groups lap up historical facts as if they were being enlightened for the first time, and sports fans generally tend to know an incredible amount of history about their team, something that sports merchandisers rely on heavily. There are so many ways that history can serve you in your career plans - you just need to open your mind to the possibilities.

",How to Learn About the Aztec Empire," The Aztecs arguably was a very short lived civilisation, although its roots are far older.  The Aztecs principally were the Mexican peoples who spoke Nahuatl as a principle language, but the term Aztec is also expanded to include the Acolhua and Tepanec communities. Based in Tenochtitlan, the ruins of which modern Mexico City is built on, they expanded through trade and alliance as well as conquering and absorbing other communities. The word itself means a person from Aztlan, a part legendary ancestral home of the peoples, which may or may not be California. However, the Aztecs took much influence from their neighbours as well as former civilisations.


When the Mexican tribe arrived in what is now known as the Mexican valley between 1200-1300, they found it to be already occupied and so lived on the outskirts of Culhuacan state on Texcoco lake where they absorbed many of the customs from their hosts. However, after sacrificing the Culhuacan Kings daughter, they were expelled and forced to flee. The settled on a small island which was prophesied as being known when an eagle would be seen on a cactus with a snake in its claws. This image is still a national symbol of Mexico and found on its national flag today. There they enlarged the island and built their capital Tenochtitlan. There the Aztecs made wealth and power hiring themselves out as mercenaries in the frequent wars between city states. This eventually weakened the other states, making the Mexico more powerful.
The Aztec empire first formed in 1427, as an alliance between three city states - Tenochtitlan, Texcoco, and Tlacopan was the start of the eventual dominance of the entire valley and expand its influence across Mexico from the Gulf to the Pacific shores. It was this alliance that formed the main development of Aztec culture, social structure and empire
In 1519 the Spanish Conquistadors under Hernan Cortes arrived. The ancient exiled God of the region was in legend said to return with pale skin and a beard, which the Spaniards coincidentally had. They welcomed the Spaniards in initially, however over the next 3 years the Spaniards allied themselves with neighbouring states who disliked the Aztecs and their ways, although it took until 1521 until the Aztecs were fully dominated. This was seen as a positive boost to many local cultures who had lived under an Aztec control and had wished for their independence. The Aztec empire fell slowly - it took the Spanish 170 years to conquer the entire peninsula, although with numerous epidemics laying siege to the populous, which also wiped out many Meso-American communities and cultures, the Aztec empire was over.;
, Aztec religion is still not fully understood, as when the conquistadors arrived, much of the source books, known as codex, were destroyed.


Philosophy however seemed to have been an important aspect. The natural world in which the Aztecs lived were often at threat from flood, drought and other problems. Their philosophy often focused on attaining balance in this impermanent and unpredictable world.
Like many philosophies, Aztecs believed in a mysterious, indivisible unity known as Teotl that underlies the entire universe, but also a structured, dualistic reality which is the expression of this unity. The practical application was to develop a stoic nature in the people to be able to endure.
The Aztec religion was pantheistic, believing in many Gods that are still ultimately an expression of Teotl. Human sacrifice played a significant part in the ritual, although the contexts and extents of sacrifice are still argued upon today. One theory among several is that sacrifices appeased the Gods and ensured that the sun will rise and for the world to continue; that the sacrificial victim was to carry a message or plea to the Gods; that the sacrifices were a votive offering in expectation for something, or that the sacrifices were played out in relation to their creation myth with a deities self sacrifice for the world to be suitable for humans to live.
Sacrifices also were symbolic, being composed of food, flowers, effigies often made from dough up to blood-letting, animals and humans.
Death and rebirth played a central figure in Aztec religion. The Day of the Dead is still followed in Mexico today. The world was structured into a range of layers, with the underworld, earth world and upper world in the sky. These separate worlds were also divided into many upper and lower levels to which a person may expect to go after death.

, The Aztecs were great agricultural engineers. Creating crop terraces as well as vast systems known as Chinampas, they usually created a surplus of food. Chinampas are shallow swamps and lakes that would be slowly modified into cropland by dredging mud and silt and placing into large mounds in layers with plant vegetation. These would be secured with wattle banks and trees but still within the lake to form regular little islands. This highly fertile soil could create 4 to 7 crops a year and the canals of the area became highly useful to ship the produce to the cities. Many of the people worked in the chinampas to provide food and these are still used today.


One of the common pastimes was the ballgame. While the rules and even the purpose of the game is not fully known, its reckoned that the game was played as a hobby, as well as professionally played in the grand ball courts in the cities. The Meso-American ballgame is possibly the first sport to use a rubber ball. Today a similar ballgame known as Ulama is still played in central America.
Aztec society was unique in its time for having mandatory education for both genders after the age of 15 and before then they were typically home schooled. Typically these schools would teach Aztec philosophy and religion, as well as crafts and trades or military training. An important aspect of education was a training in huehuetlatolli which was a collection of sayings from the past and the elders. These often would teach important social etiquette and ethics.
Most people during the day were occupied in some form of trade or production, be it food production, textiles, metal working and engineering. Crafts and trades were a highly valued skill at all levels of society as it was on these skills that the empire depended.
The Aztec Calendar divided the year into 19 sections, and within these sections were often listed as the duties to perform, such as crop sowing, harvesting, making weapons and mats, as well as seasonal changes, but also ritual and social events such as sacrifices and feast celebrations.
The Aztecs also had sumptuous laws, which forbade the commoners from wearing certain fabrics and fashions to be able to identify and strengthen then nobility. Commoners were not allowed to wear cotton cloaks as well as some gold adornments.
Feast days and fasting was common, without exception to age, gender or health but did take a variety of guises, with priests living off one small tortilla per day, with a break every 20 days, where the ordinary peoples would cut out seasonings or reduce whatever few luxuries they had. The wealthy likewise were expected to fast, although their fasts were still extravagant meals, if not reduced in scale.

, Much of modern Mexican cuisine has its roots in the Aztec cuisine. The Aztecs were largely vegetarian, although this was more due to the scarcity of meat.


Typical foods were tomatoes, beans, maize varieties, squash and cucurbits, edible amaranths and chilli peppers. Other valued crops were avocados, edible flowers, agave, sweet potatoes and chia seeds. Crops imported from other districts included fruits, which did not grow well in chinampas. Food gathering such as herbs and wild mushrooms was also common as a way to supplement diet. Food was often seasoned with salt and chilli.
The Aztec elite admired the highly prized Cacao (Theobroma Cacao) which was made into a beverage including vanilla, chilli and other flavourings known as xocolatl (from which we get both chocolate and the word chocolate). This bitter drink would often be sweetened with honey and whipped to form a foam (as the beans had a high fat content called cocoa butter), which was highly prized and a sign of the cacaos quality. Cacao beans were highly prized also as a currency and were often forged being empty shells filled with mud.
Maize was a central staple, being ground into a paste or meal, which would then be made into tortilla or tamales, cooked into beverages such as atole and gruel and cooked in many other ways. It was often processed, being mixed with an alkali such as lye and this process would make many of its nutrients more accessible.
Protein overall was scarce, but included turkey, iguana, insects such as grasshoppers, agave worms and caterpillars, turtle eggs, spirulina algae and a variety of crayfish that was native in some lakes. While the extent is still open to debate, it has been suggested that cannibalism did exist in various levels of society.
Aztec people usually ate slowly and with solemnity, moderation and frugality. While feasts were common, food was still served in a complex ritualised manner and little went to waste. Maize being so prized that even if it fell to the floor, it would still be picked up and consumed.

Make sure to take a handful of your history classes with the same professors so that they will get to know you well and be able to write strong recommendation letters for you. On that note, it is also best to start taking history courses early in your undergraduate career. Don’t wait until junior year, if possible.
Many Ph.D, programs also admit M.A. graduates as well.
Whether at the undergraduate or M.A. level, try to publish prior to applying for a Ph.D. program. It may be difficult to find an publication venue, so encyclopedias are often a good option. Ask your professors for publication advice and assistance.;
, You need to have a general idea of what areas of history intrigue you upon entering a Ph.D. program. Prior to applying reflect on what you enjoy learning about the most. Consider what types of historical questions intrigue you and which ones bore you. You also need to be very clear that history in general is the graduate subject for you.Don’t go overboard on specifics. While some people come in to graduate programs with a dissertation topic in hand, that is not necessary. You will spend a good deal of your first year exploring various topics in consultation with your advising professors.

, Take a moment to look online and you will discover that the job market for Ph.D.s in history is extraordinarily competitive. There are many Ph.D.s graduating and not many of them will land full-time tenure track positions. Be realistic about whether you would be okay taking an adjunct or part-time teaching position for a period of time. Start to think about other career options as well.With a history Ph.D. a wide variety of jobs beyond academia are available to you. Some use their writing skills in the private sector as editors. Others work in historic preservation. Some find places in museums or in other educational outreach organizations.

, All of your professors attended graduate school at one time or another and, odds are, they’ve stayed in touch with their universities and programs. Make an appointment with your history professors to solicit their advice on applying and on your program choices. Come to this meeting prepared with your curriculum vitae or resume, your test scores, and a potential writing sample.


If one of your undergraduate professors offers to reach out to a graduate professor or program for you, let them do it. Nothing beats having a professional connection built in advance of your application.
Remember, however, that your professor’s opinions are just opinions. If you are set on a particular school, be sure to check it out before dismissing it outright.

, Start by going online to find programs that are strong in your particular area of historical interest. Certain programs specialize in particular types or categories of history. Then, narrow it down depending on location, financial aid packages available, size of the program, etc.


Spend a good amount of time on each department’s website. They usually give a program profile that will tell you how many students are currently enrolled, how many are accepted each year, and how many faculty are involved. They usually also contain previews or complete lists of courses offered.Given the competitiveness of the current job market, pay particular attention to any information regarding the placement of graduates. Many programs will post placements rates and/or provide lists of recent graduates and their positions.Two examples of departmental specialization are Rutgers University, which has a very strong women’s and gender history element, and University of New Mexico, which emphasizes the study of the American West. The points of emphasis can and do change so make sure to look for recent information as you research., Most departmental websites will list faculty names and contact information, usually alongside their specialties, publications, courses taught, etc. Once you’ve narrowed down your list to around 15 schools, reach out to these professors via email. This is best to do before you submit your application so that you can develop a potential ally on the admissions committee.Make sure to reach out, in particular, to the faculty member who you are considering working with. Graduate school, unlike undergraduate studies, is very focused on the mentor relationship. You are essentially applying to the university, the program, and the faculty members in your area of interest.You might introduce yourself in the emailing by stating, “Dear Professor Stevens, I’m Michael Smith, a junior currently enrolled at the University of Alabama, and I plan to apply to your doctoral program for the fall of 2017.” Go on to tell them what interests you about their work in particular and the program in general.
Don’t be surprised if they put you in contact with a few current graduate students. These are great contacts to ask about housing, the culture on campus, etc., At least two weeks prior to the deadline mail or e-submit all of your completed application materials. Most programs require that you send in the application fee, a letter of intent, a writing sample, three letters of reference, and GRE or other test scores. Some schools require more or less documentation, especially if you are applying for assistantships.Be aware that students entering a doctoral program with a M.A. in hand may need to submit additional documents. They may also be able to move into an accelerated graduation path, perhaps ‘skipping’ a few hours of coursework., You will start to receive acceptance or rejection letters mid-spring and then you will need to make your final admission decision. Some schools will invite you to come visit their campus. If they pay for it or you can afford to do so, this is always a good idea. Talk to the faculty or graduate students again if that might help as well.This is also the time to carefully consider your financial situation. Your admission offer may come with funding in the form of an assistantship or fellowship. Look over the details and be realistic about what you want and need. Be aware that while some programs offer full funding it is often still well below real standard living costs (i.e. $18,000/year in an urban environment)."

Before 800BCE is a period often referred to as the Greek Dark Ages and the subsequent era is often called the archaic era. This was where the great cities, philosophies and sciences, theatre, classical art, law and the Greek language being written down were starting to set seed. This era had many rulers known as tyrants - a word we still use today - whose gradual overthrow paved the way towards Greek Democracy and the Athenian model of government. This era artistically had influences from Egypt and what we call today as the Middle East and is often called the orientalization of Greece.
After the last tyrant overthrow in 510 BCE, this heralded the start of the Classical period that is perhaps the most famous. Its bedrock moment arrived because of the Athenians successfully defending Greece from a Persian invasion and this period continues to the Hellenistic civilisation starting in 323BCE. This era is where the empire becomes dominant with Alexander the Great rising to power and expanding the empire through to India where he eventually turned back. This era ends with his death in 323BCE, which leads to the Hellenistic era.
The Hellenistic era focuses more on maintaining the empire but ends in 146BCE when the divided Greek empire falls under Roman conquest and becomes part of the Roman empire.;
, Ancient Greece had a clear social structure but was more flexible in some areas.


Greece in many ways was more democratic than its ancient neighbour Rome as social status did not give additional rights. Democracy itself is a Greek word.
There was four main social classes in Athens, yet if one earned more money and chattels they themselves could climb the social ladder.
Education was an important factor for climbing the social ladder as most rights were awarded once the education was completed, but education was an expensive and private engagement with the family employing a tutor. Only Sparta seems to have had publicly funded and obligatory education.
Slavery was common in Greece; however there were differences between Greece and Rome. The Greeks generally treated slaves far better than the Romans with beating and killing them as forbidden and many slaves were offered their freedom as an agreement to work better. The population of slaves however varies by accounts of being the majority of the populace, but it is still clear they were a significant part of the population and many held roles in public service. Unlike the Romans, slaves were not accorded the rights of citizen after freedom and they were part of their own social group known as a 'metic'. In Sparta however, things were far harsher for slaves and a group of slaves from conquered armies were often killed in a rite of passage for Spartans.
Serving in the army was often compulsory for men, as it was not only a way to maintain and defend the empire, but also to give skills in engineering and management.

, Before Christianity became mainstream in 529 AD, Greek religion was pantheistic and included worship of heroes as an important factor.


One of the central dynamics of the religion focused on the epic conflict between the Gods on Mt Olympus and the Titans. The Gods & Titans feature within the same creation myth but were divided between them and frequently at war. The Gods and Goddesses are biographical and personalised than Roman Gods and these deities and legends had a complex relationship between themselves and humans.
The cult-like worship of heroes such as Heracles (also known as Hercules), Perseus, Achilles and their stories was important to Greek society as they served as role models and sources of national pride. The ""anti-hero"" was also important, which is not the villain of the story, but are bland or non-heroic characters that are least likely to be heroes but become or act heroically.
Indian and other religions were also known to the Ancient Greeks, with one King who is commonly referred to Menander I Soter (or Melinda in the Indo-Greek world), who had embraced Buddhism and reigned around 150BCE ruling a significant eastern part of the empire. This region had influenced Greek architecture, which in turn strongly influenced the Roman models, yet heading the other way, the influence spread as far as Japan.
The Greeks also set great store in Oracles and prophecies, such as the famous Oracle of Delphi. Oracles would often fall into a trance and priests for those who had paid for the prophecy translated their expressions.
After the Roman conquest, many of the Greek gods with synthesized were Roman equivalents within Rome, this functioned in a way so a Roman citizen could worship in Greece but the synthesis also boosted the power of the Roman gods. Most of the planets, excepting Earth, Mars, and Venus were named after Greek Gods & Goddesses,

, These two fields were often part of the same school, where today philosophy is a separate field and occasionally not seen as a science at all.


Learn about some of the famous Greek philosophers and scientists such as Thales, Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Epicures, Pythagoras, Zeno, Euclid, Archimedes and more.
Early philosophers were more interested in science rather than wisdom, but in the classical period, wisdom, ethics, good governance and other virtues became equally important. Greece was often at war with various nations within Greece (such as Athens and Sparta), but also outside of Greece with the Persian world and other nations so philosophy was an important science.
The Greek language has contributed much to our modern language as many of our modern names for sciences come from Ancient Greece. Some examples are physics, philosophy, astronomy, geography, mathematics, and cartography.
Other interesting technologies and inventions include - cranes for lifting, road building, the antikythera - reckoned to be a complex astronomical calendar, calipers, astrolabes, lighthouses, showers, waterwheels and many more including steam and water powered machinery.

, The Greeks loved music, dance, poetry and theatre with tragic and comedic plays as well as the epics such as the Odyssey and the Illiad, as well as stories of the battles between Athens, Troy, Sparta and other nations which are classics still told today.


Theatre really came into its own during the classical period, after much of Athens was destroyed by Persian invasions. This revival and rebuilding led a great re-invention and revival of Greek literature and the word Thespian has its origins in Greece. The Greeks attended plays in vast audiences, as it was a major source of entertainment.
Masks were a key costume part of Greek theatre and some even had brass instruments fitted to act as a megaphone to amplify actors voices. The famous duo of the two masks of comedy and tragedy as a symbol of the theatre has their roots in Greek theatre.
Some of the most famous plays and playwrights were Sophocles, who counted among his works the story of Oedipus, Aristophanes who had many comedies but who also wrote ""The Clouds"" a fictional spoof based on Socrates, which was later used to falsely implicate the philosopher as being immoral and consequently executed by drinking hemlock poison.
Music in Classic Greece traditionally was an expression of philosophy, as a metaphor of the harmonics of the universe with everything vibrating in harmony. It was also an expression of ethos, with certain pieces played at certain times according to their inherent qualities. Later music became more of an entertainment.
Ancient Greek music was arguably more varied than modern music as while we have tones and half tones, Greek tones went to quarter and even finer subtleties to be able to make perfect balance.
Greek instruments include string, wind and percussion instruments, including pan pipes (named after the Greek God Pan), lyres and harps as well as a complex zither like instrument known as a kithara, drums, trumpets, conch shells and a hydraulic organ known as a hydraulis, these instruments later became absorbed into Ancient Roman music.

, Greece had essentially a Mediterranean diet, but it was not entirely as varied or rich as the modern cuisine of Greece.
Ancient Greek cuisine was frugal and austere, a major influence was the city of Sparta, which even today gives us the word Spartan.
The ancient Greeks loved their wine and a frequent way for men to pass the time was in a symposium, which was basically an evening of a few men (apart from female courtesans and entertainers, women were typically forbidden from the event). The meal as it was would feature snacks such as nuts, grains and pulses as well as honey cakes to be able to prolong drinking. Like the Romans, great feasts were reserved more for religious grounds and the wealthy, but they were still more austere than later Roman Empire extravagances.
Bread was a staple ingredient, mostly made from wheat or barley that was ground into a paste or dried to a flour. Leavened bread from yeast and other raising agents were used but later reserved for feast days only and bakery produced bread was expensive, so most food was produced from scratch in homes.
Vegetables typically featured vegetables such as cabbage, onions, garlic, pulses such as peas, chickpeas / garbanzo beans, and broad beans, as well as lentils. The poor often had their meals were including acorns, bitter vetch and wild herbs.
Fruits included figs, pomegranates, raisins and if available fresh grapes.
Olives were an important ingredient as the plant would survive the hot, dry climate and the infertile, alkali soils of the region. This provided olive oil as well as olives for pickling.
Beverages typically included water, which the Greeks valued as a nutritious, life giving drink and like a wine expert today can characterise and even judge its source, so too could the water experts of the time. Wine was a common beverage, typically cut with water as it was thought unmixed could be fatal or induce madness. Milk was not commonly drunk, although it likely was due to the poor keeping qualities in the climate, as milk was reserved for cheese.
Meat was very important to the Greek diet, as fresh produce was often hard to grow and did not travel well, if the poor had access to land, they would typically raise geese and chickens, but also hunted for game such as hare and game birds. Sausages were consumed across the classes, but the cost of a piglet in the cities from a butcher was about the cost of 3 days wages. Cooked and salted meats were more common as fresh meat often required a religious ceremony where the fat and bones were cremated to honour the Gods.

, Greek clothing was typically home made and while in movies is often portrayed as an all-white wardrobe, Greek fabrics were often vibrantly coloured and patterned. No complete traditional costume has ever survived to modern times so much of what we know comes from artworks and mentions in ancient literature.


Clothing was typically made of wool and linen, often imported from Egypt and other countries in the Greek empire.
Both men and women wore a costume known as a chiton, which was a large rectangular piece of fabric often from the shoulder height to the floor of the wearer. Men often wore them to their knee height while women wore them to ankle length. Excess fabric resembled as a loose tunic. It was pulled and secured with a belt or clasp, below the breast or waist of the wearer. The fabric was occasionally pleated to be more decorative.
Men and soldiers often owned and used a cloak made from wool that was about the size of a blanket and often served as bedding at the same time. It was usually hemmed with a border to protect it from fraying as well as adding a decorative edge.
The himation was a winter garment worn both genders over their chitons although sometimes it was worn instead of a chiton. It was similar to in appearance, but not as large as a Roman toga.
Women often wore veils and shawls, both because modesty was an important virtue, but also to protect them during travel and public events from the harsh sun and climate.

Graduate with your Ph.D. Years after you’ve entered the program, you will graduate with your Ph.D. in hand.",How to Get a Doctorate in History2," You will usually take 9 hours of classes a semester for 2-3 years in order to complete your coursework requirements. These courses are generally divided between colloquiums (emphasizing reading and analysis) and seminars (emphasizing the creation of a full-length research product).Your progress through coursework will be evaluated on a semester or yearly basis by the Director of Graduate Studies along with your advisor and other faculty members. This is standard practice.Be aware that a “A” or “A-“ are generally the only acceptable grades in doctoral history programs. A “B+” in a class is generally a warning sign.Some schools work as consortiums, meaning that you may be able to take classes at other universities and count them toward your doctoral coursework. This often allows for a wider range of topics and more flexible scheduling., Drop by their office frequently or make formal appointments. Attend any events that they are involved in. Respond to all email or phone requests promptly and professionally. Put some serious effort into forming this relationship as it will become enormously important to you both professionally and personally.


Your advisor’s research interests will often match your own, so they can guide you through the field. They will also oversee your qualifying exams, your dissertation research, and your defense. They are generally a full-time faculty member who has the time to devote to mentoring students.You can come into your program with a mentor in mind. However, you usually wait a few months into coursework before formally approaching the professor and asking them to serve in this capacity.

, These are also called your qualifying exams. They take place following the conclusion of your coursework and are meant to test your knowledge of your primary and secondary fields of history. They are usually a combination of written and oral exams with the writing portion usually coming first. You must pass these exams to move on to your dissertation research.This is also usually the point where you have to pass a foreign language test as well. This is especially important if your subject area requires a language outside of your primary one.
From when you conclude your exams you usually have six years in which to complete the program and graduate with your Ph.D.

, As soon as you finish your comps, you can begin devoting the majority of your time to researching. Start by creating a dissertation proposal that contains a basic outline of your research plan. Once your proposal is approved you are released to work on your project with less direct faculty oversight, in most cases.


Now you are called “ABD” or “All But Dissertation.” You’ve completed all requirements except for the dissertation.
This is the period where you will travel, if necessary, and visit archives. You will possibly spend some time away from the department while still registering for research hours.

, Once your research is finished, or during the process itself, you’ll begin the writing stage. Your advisor may request your drafts as you finish them or may just want to see the final project in rough form. You will also want to share your writing progress with your now-established dissertation committee., When you’ve finished the final draft you will meet with your committee in a public event setting to discuss and defend your project. Your defense can last hours depending on the whims of the committee members. This is a daunting time, but also an opportunity to share your enthusiasm and pride for your work.


You will generally either be approved, approved pending revisions, approved with a delay, or rejected. Each program comes up with versions of this ranking. If revisions are required, you make them and then submit the properly formatted copy to the university system as directed. If your dissertation is rejected, this is generally a final decision and will result in your removal from the program.

, Getting a Ph.D. in history isn’t just about passing the classes and writing the book. You also need to be a solid, reliable departmental citizen. If your department or university puts on a lecture, go to it. If they meet for a volunteer activity, join in and participate.Aside from contributing to your overall well-being, from a pragmatic standpoint attending these events puts you in an even better position to receive positive reference letters during the pending job search., Be prepared to turn in tons of paperwork during you time as a graduate student. It is part of the professional journey. Pay attention to all departmental calendars and timelines. Ask your department secretary, advisor, or other faculty members for assistance if you need it.

, This is quite an accomplishment and should be celebrated with fanfare. You are now considered an expert in the study of history.

Publish or perish.,
Search out funding.,
Broaden your professional horizons.",How to Get a Doctorate in History3," While you are in school, stay in touch by dropping by their offices frequently, asking questions via email, and always attending class. Even after you graduate, make sure to stay in touch with your professors. Send an email every now and then updating them about what you are doing.

, Historians attend conferences, small and large, as a way to share their work with others in a direct, more personal setting (as opposed to publishing in a journal). Go to as many of these events as you can and try to identify the ones that apply to you in particular. For example, if you are a southern historian the Southern Historical Association Annual Meeting is the place to be each fall.Don’t be shy about presenting your work as a graduate student. It is expected and very much encouraged. Your department will likely provide some sort of funding to assist you if your paper is accepted.

, This phrase, luckily, isn’t quite as accurate now as it used to be. However, publishing is still one clear way that you can differentiate yourself from the pack of Ph.D.s graduating every year. Seek out journals or edited collections looking for new content. Contact journal editors for book review opportunities. Ask your advisor for assistance in locating opportunities.


Be patient when publishing. You should expect to do numerous revisions and will most likely need to wait for months before actually seeing your work in print., Aggressively pursue funding for your research and graduate activities. Leave no rock unturned. Look for grants or fellowships in your department, university, local archives, or even non-profit or corporate groups. In some cases your program may even match your monies up to a certain number., A Ph.D. develops a variety of marketable skills as a result of their education and training. They can convey a message coherently and accurately in both written and oral forms. They possess the endurance to complete lengthy and complex projects. They can analyze and organize mass amounts of information. Spend a considerable amount of time considering your unique skills that can set you apart when applying for a position.


Make sure to consider jobs outside of academia. They can be quite competitive to land, but they can provide a great deal of professional satisfaction as well. For example, you can work in a museum spreading knowledge to people of all ages. Or, you can find a position in human resources juggling both information and people. Keep your mind open to the possibilities and don't undersell yourself or your abilities.

Think of history as a story.,
Imagine historical figures as real people.,
Step into the past.,
Connect it to your hobbies.,
Build a community around it.,
Participate in your class.,
Meet with a tutor.",How to Enjoy Learning History2," If learning history seems like just simple memorization, try to understand it as a narrative. Much like any good story, historical events and subjects all have a beginning, middle and end. In it, there are often climatic events and surprise twists that make it interesting. Instead of simply memorizing names and dates, think of the story that goes with them. This will be more fun to learn and make it much easier to remember things.


For example, instead of just memorizing the names and dates of the Revolutionary War, think of the story of the colonists battling Great Britain for independence. Understanding the general narrative of the war will help you better comprehend and recall important people, places, and events.

, If you are studying certain historical figures, try to understand them as people just like you. They had their own ambitions and dreams, as well as faults and imperfections. If you try to understand people in the past as real people, you may find that you have something in common with them, which will make learning about them much more fun.


If you find that you enjoy learning about historical figures, try reading biographies about them written by historians. These tend to full of juicy and humanizing details.
Some good examples of historical biography include Ron Chernow’s Alexander Hamilton or Erik Larson’s The Devil in the White City: Murder, Magic, and Madness at the Fair That Changed America.

, If you find history a little tedious, try mentally placing yourself in the past. Imagine what it would be like for you and your family to live in a certain time period. Think about how different that time and place would be from the present day. Consider how you might act in a certain historical scenario or situation. In the process of placing yourself in the past, you will also learn something about it.


What are the difficulties you might face? How would people in that place and time react to you?
Are there any special skills that you have that would be particularly advantageous to another time and place?

, If you are having a difficult time enjoying a particular historical subject, try connecting it to something that you enjoy doing. If you learn it while doing a hobby, you will eventually start to enjoy it. Even if you still find the subject dull, you will at least be learning while doing something fun.


For example, if music is one of your hobbies, try writing a song that ties in the historical subject. You can also look into the music of a certain time and place.
If you are working on an assignment you find boring, finding a way to connect it to your hobbies will make it a little less painful.

, Find people who are enthusiastic about history and do some activities with them. These can be historians, reenactors, or historical RPG players. These people will be extremely enthusiastic about history, which might be infectious and rub off on you.


If you are interested in historical RPG, Reacting to the Past has historical scenarios that you can play out with others., If you are a student and struggling to find history interesting, try participating more in class. Answer questions and ask for help with your assignments. You might find that, as you engage more with class activities, the subject will become more alive and interesting.


If you really want to go all in, try joining your school’s history club.

, If you are having a difficult time in your history class, you might want to consider finding someone to help you out. One option is asking a friend for help. You can also sign up for a history tutor at your school. If your school does not have tutors, you may be able to find them in your community. However, if you are looking for tutors outside of your school, be sure to ask your parents for help and guidance.

Watch historical movies and TV programs.,
Read historical fiction.,
Listen to historical podcasts.,
Play games based on historical subjects.,
Grab a history-themed graphic novel or comic book.",How to Enjoy Learning History3," In order to make history more enjoyable, try watching a movie or TV show based on a historical subject. You can watch a fictionalized account of a historical event or a documentary about it. Although the information may not be the best, this may be more enjoyable than reading a book or listening to a lecture.


Compare the Hollywood version of events to what really happened. Picking out the differences and similarities can be a fun exercise.
Films like Braveheart and Saving Private Ryan are perfect for people who enjoy action films.
If you like romance, try Shakespeare in Love or Titanic.
Ken Burns’ The Civil War is a great documentary for those interested in military history.

, If reading history books is not your thing, you might enjoy reading fictionalized accounts of those same events. Historical fiction is an author’s interpretation of how events may have unfolded, injected with dialogue and climactic events that did not occur in real life. Although it may not be entirely accurate, historical fiction can be informative and entertaining.The Color Purple, Cold Mountain, and Gone with the Wind are just a few examples of popular historical fiction. They also happen to be films.

, In the last decade, podcasting has become a field in which historical subjects are often discussed. There are numerous shows that tackle subjects in a series or single episode. Podcasts are great if you want to learn more about history but do not have the time to sit down and read a book. They are perfect for listening to while you commute or cook dinner.


Stuff You Missed in History Class and The History Chicks are very entertaining podcasts hosted by historians.Overanalyze is a podcast about the intersection of history and geek culture., Historical settings and subjects are very common in the gaming world. There are numerous history based video and board games that create an immersive environment in which to explore the past. Playing historical games is not only fun, but it will help you learn a little about history as well.


Some historical video games include Sid Meier’s Civilization, Ryse: Son of Rome, the God of War series, and Call of Duty.

, For those looking for a unique way to learn a little history, graphic novels might be a good choice. These illustrated histories are both artwork and literature, taking the reader back in time with description and visualization. For those who do not want to commit to a book, a graphic novel is a quicker way to learn about history while enjoying eye-catching illustrations.The Harlem Hellfighters, Showa, and Trinity are all great examples of graphic novels about history.

They merely influence others to like them so that they are more pliable to manipulation later.Psychopaths exude an air of confidence that naturally draws others to them. They probably have a stable job with relative success. They may even have a relationship or a spouse and kids. They are quite good at playing the role of “model citizen.”;
, Psychopaths will often believe they are smarter or more powerful than they actually are. They like to cozy up to successful and powerful people because it raises their own status. They believe they are owed special treatment over others.Their inflated sense of self-importance often leads to one crack in their mask of normalcy. They will step on your toes if you don’t have any value or status to offer them.

, Both of those characteristics are evidence of psychopathy. They tend to see nothing at all wrong with their way of being in the world. Psychopaths are infamous for their refusal to acknowledge responsibility for the decisions they make, or the outcomes of their decisions. In fact, a refusal to see the results of one’s bad behavior as having anything to do with oneself—“consistent irresponsibility""“ I don’t want to go to work” or “I think I’ll blow off this meeting and get a drink instead” are common impulsive ideas that a psychopath might act on. They are the opposite of reliable and dependable.They are self-centered, acting on a whim based on their own emotional state. They do whatever they want, whenever they want to. This may result in them cheating, lying, and stealing—just because. They may be sexually promiscuous with a string of relationships or infidelities. They may even quit jobs out of the blue (because it was beneath them, of course).

, If your acquaintance tends to follow rules by the letter, it’s unlikely they have psychopathic traits. Psychopaths loathe authority and typically view themselves as above rules. Perhaps this is why an estimated 25% of male criminals behind bars qualify as psychopaths.Still, others are able to avoid prison while still stepping over laws and not having any hang-ups about doing so.

, Experts find common threads in the childhoods of adults who go on to meet the criteria for psychopathy. Psychopaths often exhibit delinquent behaviors in their youth, including aggressive behaviors towards others. In addition, they may not react to distress or punishment as other youth would.Check to see if the person you suspect of psychopathy had a troubled youth. This could possibly indicate the presence of psychopathic tendencies in adulthood.

, If the person in question appears to have a conscience, they’re probably not a psychopath. In general, psychopaths lack any sort of moral compass. They will do whatever they need to advance, and they really don’t care who they hurt in the process.For example, a psychopath is unlikely to live by a ""code"" like others do. They may see no problem going after a friend's date or competing with a close pal for a job promotion, and gloating about it.

, Psychopaths have shallow emotional responses and do not react normally to deaths, injuries, or other events that would cause a deep negative response in others.


The difference between psychopathic and typical autistic responses is that while autistic people may seem initially numb, they may melt down in distress later or throw themselves into research and ways to help.With psychopaths, there are no deep emotions hiding underneath.

, Individuals with psychopathy have a general absence of any guilt or remorse. Callousness is one of the primary characteristics used to describe them. A psychopath may feign guilt over bad behavior in order to manipulate a person into not becoming angry.


For example, they pretend to go into a guilt spiral over hurting their victim, so the victim ends up consoling them instead.
Interestingly, while psychopathy precludes genuine empathy, people who have this condition are able to fake empathy very well. They cannot spontaneously empathize, but can do so at will (to charm others for example)., A psychopath will never genuinely admit to being wrong or owning up to mistakes and errors in judgment. When pressed, they may admit to making a mistake, but manipulate others so as to avoid any consequences., Psychopaths are experts at manipulating your emotions and insecurities into causing you to view them as the victim. This helps lower your guard and makes you vulnerable for future exploitation. If the psychological resource of the victim mentality is continually combined with unacceptable and evil actions, you should be warned about this person's real nature., Psychopaths love to create chaos and drama. Because they tend to bore easily, it’s important that things stay interesting. They may provoke arguments and then come off as the victim. They wreak havoc on others’ lives and sit back and watch innocently.If someone in your life is a psychopath, you probably leave interactions with them questioning your own sanity. Let’s say you’re at work and the psychopath alerts you that one coworker has been insulting you behind your back. They coax you to confront the person. In the aftermath of an ugly confrontation, you eventually realize that the other person was goaded just like you.

, Everyone is driven by an objective of getting what they want. But psychopaths are identified as extremely cunning in this area. They are able to get you to do things you might not normally do. They may use guises, guilt-tripping, coercion and other methods to get victims to do their bidding.For example, you are a high-ranking executive in your company. The psychopath “befriends” you and teases out your weaknesses. One day you arrive at work to hear that news of a scandal is affecting the workplace. It seems sensitive information you told the psychopath was leaked to the media. You are fired. Guess who’s in line to take your position?

, Some psychopaths have many short-term marriages. They will blame marital problems on their ex-spouses, and never suggest that they played a role in the marriage's failure.


The relationship starts off with them idealizing their partners. Over time, they devalue and ultimately discard that partner for a newer, more interesting one. They never truly bond with partners; therefore, walking away from a marriage or relationship is quite effortless., A psychopath will tell all sorts of lies—little lies to trip you up or whopping made-up stories intended to mislead. Even when telling the truth would be painless, they still default to lying. Surprisingly enough, this doesn’t cause shame. They take pride in their lies. And if you think you’ve caught them up, they simply switch around the facts to appear truthful.Plus, they’ll never appear flabbergasted about a lie. They are calm, relaxed and able to talk their way out of anything. They never seem to get rattled about anything.

, If a psychopath is backed into a corner and expected to show remorse, they may put on a show to meet the demand. However, because their emotional affect is so blunted, they are unable to deliver a convincing apology.You might witness inconsistencies like them saying “Seriously, I never meant to hurt you” with a slight smirk on their face and their tone lacking authenticity.
If you seem to have trouble getting over it, they may turn on their wrath. They may even say “You’re so sensitive” or “I thought we were going to move on from this!”

, Buildings that are more often than not older than others can be discovered by the way they are built. Some styles are certain fads, but others could be a certain way simply because other methods are unknown or impractical.

, Large scale events such as wars can affect virtually everything, including availability of materials or trends in future settlement. For instance, typical suburbs in the United States took off apparently to spread out population in the event of nuclear attack, but also because of typical families wanting to have many children in a nice neighborhood after the nasty Depression and World War II. Trends such as this can rattle society to the core.

, The Industrial Revolution was the blossoming point of machine-made products, creating more standard and simply more products. For dating ranches, the invention of typical barbed wire in Illinois by Joseph F. Glidden in 1873 is one to remember. Another one to remember is the public sale of Model T Fords, starting in late 1908. In the American public eye this was basically the first affordable motorcar, and cars obviously affect the way roads are built. Pull tabs weren't around until about 1965.

If you want to overcome your neuroticism, learn to acknowledge and feel your emotions.For example, if you’re feeling sad, acknowledge that you feel sad. Notice what sadness feels like in your body and how it affects your thoughts and behaviors.;
, Express your emotions when you feel them. Some people find talking about the way they feel helpful. Others enjoy writing, listening to or playing music, dancing, or biking helpful. You might turn to meditation or yoga as a way to deal with your emotions and express them healthfully. The important thing is to let your feelings out, not bottle them up, as bottled emotions can hurt relationships and hurt you.If talking about your feelings helps, confide in a good friend or see a therapist.

, If you tend to think about negative events, situations, or characteristics, change your self-talk. The way you talk to yourself can influence how you see the world and the problem is, you often perceive your self-talk as true. If you find yourself caught in negative thinking, ask yourself some questions:Am I jumping to negative conclusions?
Are these thoughts true?
Are there other ways to look at the situation?
How would a positive person approach this situation?
What’s the best that could happen?

, Neuroticism can show up in your habits, emotions, relationships, beliefs, and defenses. It can show up as being suppressed (like stuffing your feelings or avoiding things) or overly expressed (like lashing out or over-reacting). You will likely respond in a neurotic way when you feel threatened or insecure. Start to notice when you experience these feelings and how you respond to them.For example, you might become overly anxious if someone is running late and start calling them incessantly or wonder if they’re blowing you off.

, You may be unaware of the ways you are neurotic, yet those around you may not be. If you’re curious, ask a partner, sibling, or close friend about your behavior. They may provide some insight you may not have. However, recognize that you may not like the answer!Say, “I’m improving myself and would like to know the ways you notice my neuroticism. What do you notice?”

, Instead of wallowing in sadness, insecurity, discomfort, or anxiety, get proactive in solving your problems. Acknowledge how you feel, then get moving on finding a solution. For example, if you have many things to accomplish, you might want to put them off or focus on your anxiety. Instead, write a to-do list and cross off a few items each day so they don’t feel so overwhelming.It’s okay to feel overwhelmed, anxious, stressed, or depressed. Just don’t dwell on these feelings.
Find ways to face your fears and create less resistance to things. If you tend to avoid certain tasks, set a deadline. For example, if you put off paying bills because money makes you anxious, set one day out of every month to pay bills and get it over with.

, If you tend to expect the worst or anticipate problems in many situations, start coming up with positive things to anticipate. The same goes for memories: if you tend to look back on events and pick out the worst things about them, start coming up with positive counters.If you’re stressed about a test, the positive will be when it’s over and it won’t stress you any more.
If you focus on a negative event, create a positive experience around it, too. For example, if your plane was late and you missed your connection, the positive can be that you were able to find a different flight without any fees.

, Neuroticism can affect relationships deeply. For example, if you have rigid expectations for your partner or family members, they might feel like they cannot please you or that they have to earn your love. If you have a hard time getting along with others, learn to be flexible and not hold others such very high standards. If someone lets you down, don’t hold it against them forever. Recognize that everyone makes mistakes and be forgiving.Don’t let things like chores ruin your family relationships. If you like chores to be done a certain way, make your expectations known clearly.

, Make time for activities that are fun and engaging. These activities should feel leisurely and fun, not stressful or time-consuming. You may choose to sip a cup of tea each morning or before bed, write in a journal, play with a pet, take a bath, do some woodworking, or go hiking.Even if you can’t do a leisure activity every day, try to do something fun and relaxing regularly, like 2-3 times each week.

, Being grateful can help you experience more happiness and can help reduce stress and anxiety. And it’s simple enough to do: start a daily gratitude practice or keep a gratitude journal. Wake up in the morning and think of three things you are grateful for before getting out of bed. When you go to sleep at night, think of three other things you are grateful for before falling asleep.Get in a daily habit of giving thanks. You can use a bracelet and think of something that you’re grateful for each time you glance at it.

, Find some healthy outlets for stress, such as relaxation. Start a practice and do something every day for 30 minutes to keep your stress levels low. Create a stress toolkit of things you can do to relieve stress: write in a journal, listen to music, draw or color, or take a walk.Try daily yoga, qi gong, tai chi, or meditation.

, If you’re having problems overcoming your neuroticism on your own, a therapist can help you. Start cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) to help you confront your negative thoughts and replace them with more positive thoughts. Your therapist can help you create coping strategies to help deal with stress and increase your overall happiness.CBT can help you see how your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors influence each other and how making changes can influence all three as well.

Maintain your counseling license by complying with local requirements.",How to Get a Counseling License," Counseling is actually a large umbrella of services, and most professionals choose a specific area of expertise in which to specialize.Examples of different counseling specializations include: academic counseling, mental health counseling, substance abuse counseling, domestic or child abuse counseling, career counseling, grief counseling, marriage counseling, etc., Counselors work in substance abuse clinics, hospitals, private practices, social work facilities, schools, and universities. Deciding where you want to work can also help you determine the type of counseling you want to study.

, As an undergraduate counseling or psychology student, you can expect to study introductory courses, as well as courses heavy of statistical data and research methods. From there, you will additionally choose from upper-division courses that give you overviews of social, developmental, abnormal, and comparative psychology, which will help you in choosing a specific focus for graduate school if you haven’t already decided on one.The better you do in your courses, the more options you’re likely to have for graduate school.


Your school may offer either a BA or a BS in psychology. Graduate schools do not weigh more heavily toward one or the other when reviewing applications., Research projects, internships, and teaching assistant programs will all help you distinguish yourself when applying to graduate schools. Your department advisor can help you find available opportunities.


Your campus may also have clubs related to psychology. Look into them and become an active member.
Since psychology and counseling graduate programs are competitive, get as much experience under your belt as you can.

, Different institutions factor GRE scores into their applicant screening process in different ways. However, all graduate school applications for counseling programs will require that you take the GRE.

, You will have to apply to psychology or counseling psychology graduate programs to earn either an MA or MS in counseling. Apply specifically to programs with a focus on the type of counseling you wish to perform as a professional. You should also apply to as many graduate schools as you can due to the highly competitive nature of the programs.


MA programs often offer a more general approach to counseling whereas MS programs typically offer increased levels of specialization if you’re already certain of the area in which you want to specialize.Note that an advanced degree in social work is not the same as an advanced degree in counseling. Though the two professions have some instances of crossover, the boards that govern licensing for social workers are not the same as the boards that govern counseling licenses.Ensure that every program to which you apply is accredited by the Council for the Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs (CACREP), the Council on Rehabilitation Education (CORE), or one of the other accrediting bodies recognized by the licensing board in your state., Counseling programs will provide substantial clinical or hands-on experience and coursework in human behavior and development, ethics, counseling strategies, etiology of mental illness, substance abuse disorders, and other areas.Doing well in your program is going to leave you more prepared for licensing requirements.


You may also choose to go on to receive a doctoral degree in counseling. However, this isn’t necessary to get a counseling license., Once you finish school, most states require you to have a certain number of hours of experience counseling in a supervised, professional environment. Look into internships and residency programs to help you start accumulating the necessary hours of experience.

, Each locality has a different set of requirements and an application process that you must follow closely.


You can find a link to each state’s guidelines to become a Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC) here.Study the requirements. A New York State license for mental health counselors, for example, requires good moral character, a minimum age of 21, master's degree completion, a licensing exam, and 3,000 documented hours of post-graduate, supervised counseling experience.In addition, licensing applicants must have completed training that covers how to identify and report child abuse.

, These professionals usually can guide you to the right licensing information and resources.

, Not every state uses the same national licensing exam. However, the two most common exams are the National Counselor Examination for Licensure and Certification (NCE) and the National Clinical Mental Health Counseling Examination (NCMHCE).The National Board for Certified Counselors has an easy map to determine the right exam for your counseling field based on your state here.The NCE is the appropriate examination for the National Certified Counselor (NCC) certification.Both exams are used to determine eligibility for military health systems such as TRICARE and the Army Substance Abuse Program.You can find study guides as well as test prep programs for each test as well., Most counseling license requirements include a minimum number of supervised practice hours. The actual hours and nature of the practicum varies by the type of counseling and locality.


To become licensed as a drug and alcohol counselor in New Jersey, for example, licensing applicants must have delivered 300 hours of counseling in functions ranging from client screening and orientation to treatment planning, counseling, and crisis intervention. Many other states require as many as 3,000 hours of supervised experience via an internship or residency., Once you’ve met your state’s supervised practice requirements, you are ready to take the appropriate exam. The length and scoring of exams varies, but the NCE, for instance, is 200 multiple choice questions. It will cover various areas, including:Human growth and development
Social and cultural diversity
Helping relationships
Group work
Career development
Assessment
Research and program evaluation
Professional orientation and ethical practice
Fundamental counseling issues
Counseling process
Diagnostic and assessment services
Professional practice
Professional development, supervision, and consultation

, Once you’ve completed all the necessary pieces of your state’s specific licensing requirements, you will need to show proof to the responsible state board. Applications generally ask for documentation of academic credentials, test scores, and practice hours. In most cases, a processing fee is required.


You can find a complete list of each state’s licensing board here.Some states may also require you to schedule a time to appear before the board for an interview as well.

, You may be required to enroll in workshops and seminars or take additional academic courses to maintain your license."

How do you know who is good and bad?",How to Find the Right Psychotherapist," Don't worry about getting this ""correct""--it isn't a school assignment or a test. It's even okay to come back to this question and revise your answer. The nature of your problem affects the type of therapist you seek out.


Do you have a specific problem with your behavior? Perhaps you need a cognitive-behavioral therapist, someone trained in Gestalt techniques, or a solutions-oriented therapist.
If your problem has to do with your personality, you may want a psychoanalyst or humanist.
Your paragraph should answer these questions: How long do you want to be in therapy? How long should your therapist work with their clients?;
, If the therapist doesn't have these qualities, you should keep looking. Remember that you are the employer and they are the employee. You are not obligated to keep seeing a therapist because you made an appointment with them. You are allowed to stop at any point and keep looking until you find the right therapist.


You should not stop seeing a therapist for frivolous reasons.
Some good qualities you may want to specify can be: gender, sexual orientation, location in the city, religious beliefs, socioeconomic level, racial or ethnic identity, military service, political beliefs, or whether they take insurance.
Don't overlook your financial and practical concerns.

, Many people are not assertive enough with their therapist, and don't talk about these things with them. This is a huge error. They may continue seeing a therapist while feeling they are not being helped.

, Most therapists provide service to everyone in their communities, regardless of financial situation, and don't practice therapy solely for personal gain.

, Some of them are highly skilled people who just have terrible luck trying to pass exams. Others are con artists who will do anything they can to strip as much money from your bank account as possible.


There are respectable people offering therapy (like pastors) who have little training. It's called spiritual guidance or pastoral counseling.
You can go online and locate the agency in your state that licenses therapists. You can then find out if the therapist you interviewed is licensed or not, and even if they have been disciplined for ethics violations in some states. The office that licenses therapists is usually under Consumer Affairs.
Decide whether it matters if your therapist is licensed. Until you are experienced as a client, it's best to be with someone who has the formal training.

, Do you feel like your therapist listens to you and understands what you have to say? Do they make suggestions or offer interpretations that seem helpful--without giving you advice or trying to control your life? Do you feel like they have a deep understanding of what is going on in your life? Do you feel like they can help your future be less painful? If you feel this way about your therapist, their work is effective.

, They might offer you things that violate laws and professional boundaries. This type of behavior can be reported to the licensing board.


A therapist should never tell you what to do with a difficult situation. They should never say ""divorce him"" or ""stay with her, she needs you.""
A therapist should never become socially involved with the people in your life. In fact, if you accidentally encounter your therapist outside therapy, they are expected to quietly leave. Therapy needs to be kept separate from all other relationships.
Your therapist should never engage in any business enterprise with you or other clients. This also includes loaning or borrowing money.
Your therapist should never ask you to pay your your therapy with anything other than money.
Most importantly, a therapist should never flirt with you, touch you inappropriately, or engage in any type of sexual or romantic behavior with you.

, They won't be able to help you anymore, even if it feels like they can, once that trust is broken. A therapist should have the professional boundary as counselor set in place from beginning to end.

, Sort it out as best you can. Use your mind, use your gut, and allow your intuition a voice as well as your brain. If you see any signs of the lines being crossed, leave immediately. Don't allow yourself to be hurt or demeaned by a therapist. You deserve to heal correctly. When you find the right therapist, you will heal and become a better person.

Instead, think of ""control"" as convincing other people to agree with your perspective. With the right methods, you can shift people's attitudes without losing their respect.;
, Make sure that the person you're influencing can actually achieve your aims. Setting yourself an impossible task can create a high-pressure situation, hurting everyone involved. Instead, aim to start a friendship, improve your work or chore routine, or solve an interpersonal problem.


Never attempt to force another person to love you, to snap out of an addiction or mental illness, or to make significant life changes against their will. The ""success"" of serious emotional manipulation is tense, fragile, and extremely damaging to yourself and the other people involved. If these are your goals, find a healthier approach instead.

, Right now, you're dissatisfied with how certain other people behave. But before you can begin to persuade them towards something different, you have to understand what’s motivating them to choose their current course of action. What makes them think that what they’re doing is a good idea? Once you know their current set of motivations, you can influence these motivations to persuade them towards something different.


Usually, the easiest way to find out their motivations is to simply ask: “Why do you think this is a good idea?” You can also try and figure it out by listening to what they say and watching what they do.
For example, your project partner is not contributing as much work as you'd like. He might be motivated by a sense of fairness (he already thinks he's doing enough), laziness (he wants to avoid the work), or low self-esteem (he doesn't think he can do the work as well as you).

, Now that you know what their current set of motivations are, try to understand the motivator that’s most important to them. Influencing this motivator will be the easiest way to get the most impact. Think about what they value most in making a decision, by thinking about decisions that you’ve seen them make in the past or arguments that you’ve had with them. If you know what’s most important to them, then you can introduce that motivator to get the result you want.


For example, you want your mom to vote a certain way in an election. She’s voting for the incumbent candidate because she knows her political stance better, and agrees with her social values. You know she values educational spending more than the social values platform, since she used to be a teacher. You can use facts about your candidate’s relationship with children, families, and education policy to motivate her to change her mind.

, Now that you understand what kind of things make an argument look good to them, you’ll want to take a look at the factors that hold them back from your argument. What about what you’re trying to do makes them think it’s a bad idea? When you know what they perceive as the risks with what you’re asking, you can figure out how to make those risks seem smaller.There’s no reason to be coy about finding out why someone doesn’t like an idea. Frequently, once someone says why they don’t like an idea out-loud, they’ll think that it sounds stupid or realize that they can’t explain themselves well, which can give you the perfect opening to talk them over to your side.

, One of the best ways to convince somebody to do something is to help them see themselves as the hero of the story.Humans look for their lives to have some kind of continuity. It’s what makes them feel like they can expect a happy ending. Shape other people's perception of their personal stories, showing them how much better they are when they’re part of your story. If you achieve this, you will be able to talk them into almost anything.


For example, let’s say that you want an investor to support your start-up company. Talk to them about how by supporting your company, they’re paving the way for innovation. They will be the hero that brings positive change to your community. They get to be the next Andrew Carnegie, leaving ripples of good work through history.

, Another way to make your ideas look more appealing is to get the person you’re trying to convince to feel like a part of the community, or to make them feel like they play a very specific role in the community. People have an incredibly strong need to belongand when you make them feel like they belong, they’ll be much more willing to go along with what you’re wanting them to do.


For example, let’s say that you want your sister to switch chores with you. Help her to see that by cleaning the kitchen, she'll be contributing to the house in a way that everyone will notice. Explain that you'd rather weed the garden for your own enjoyment, but that no one ever thanks people for those tasks.

, When you’re helpful to people and do things for them, they end up feeling indebted to you, making them more likely to think that they should do what you ask. Provide significant help (like helping them move, finding them a job and getting them hired, or setting them up on a good date) and they’ll be ready to help you in return when you ask.


An important part of this technique, though, is not letting them see an ulterior motive. They need to believe that you sincerely want to help them because you like them. It's up to you how true this needs to be; for your own comfort, you may want to avoid exploitative situations.

, Another way to make them feel like your path is the right path is to seem like you’re in control of the situation. If they think that you’ve got your hands on the steering wheel of life, then they don’t need to worry about surprise outcomes. This makes your way look like the safe way.


Seem in control by first of all being knowledgeable. Do your research. Know what it is you’re talking about. After that, project confidence as you discuss a solid plan that you have. Be ready for questions and have lots of counter arguments prepared.

, There’s that old saying that you catch more flies with honey than you do with vinegar. While it’s not always true for flies, being kind to people and projecting positive feelings usually makes them more willing to listen to you, take you seriously, and agree with what you say. When you talk to people, don’t be judgmental, demeaning, rude, critical, or confrontational. Be firm and confident, but don’t be a jerk.


For example, avoid calling their views or choices “stupid” or explaining your views to them like they’re a child or mentally deficient.
Instead, build them up, be positive in your interactions, and do nice things for them. When they see you as a nice person who goes out of your way to help others, they’ll want you to succeed, they’ll want you to get your way, because it reinforces the idea that fate rewards good people. Their need for the world to be “fair” will necessitate that they do what you want.

, Some people are very emotionally prone. They experience strong emotions and then tend to think with how things make them feel. These are the kind of people that share lots of returning-soldier-reunited-with-dog videos on your Facebook wall. For these kinds of people, when you talk to them use language and arguments that play to their emotions in order to convince them. In the study of argumentation, this is called appealing to ""pathos.""


For example, make them feel sorry for you. If you’re trying to convince your mom to let you go to summer camp, say something like, “I just don't want to stay home all summer while my friends are away. I get so sad when there's no one around.""
People whose emotions are easily swayed tend to be vulnerable. Think carefully about the effect you'll have if you succeed. Are you comfortable causing regret or panic to get what you want, or will that spoil your victory?

, There are other people (and sometimes these two groups overlap), that like arguments that hold up to logic. They want evidence and good reasons to line up before they’ll be convinced. These are usually the people that post news stories refuting the latest Supreme Court decision with evidence of its negative effects. When talking to people like this, use logic in order to appeal to them. In the study of argumentation, this is called appealing to the “logos.”


For example, convince a boss to give you a sabbatical by listing the job-related skills you'll learn, and showing studies that breaks make employees more productive.

, With just about anyone, use language that makes them feel capable, confident, smart, knowledgeable, important, and kind. Using subtle, flattering language will make them like you more but it will also distract them. If they’re too busy thinking about how good they feel to get a compliment that they really like and weren’t expecting, then they won’t think about how your argument doesn’t make 100% sense to them.


For example, say something like “You know, I’d like to be the speaker for our presentation but I feel like I would just say everything wrong. Probably freeze up too. You’re just so much better at talking to people and making a convincing argument than I am. You’d probably have the whole group eating out of your hand.”

, Women have been saying for centuries that the best way to get a man to do something is to make him think it was his idea. However, this is basically true of anyone. If they think that not only is the idea probably good but that it was also their idea, then they’ll be much less resistant to doing that thing.


For example, say something like “My poor friend Dale is such a good guy. It’s a shame he never seems to catch a break. He’s got so much going for him too: he works so hard and he’s really smart. He’s even charming, really charming, once you get to know him.” if you want to try and get them to realize that they should hire/date/whatever Dale. They’ll hear this fantastic description and think, “You know, he doesn’t sound half bad. Maybe I should...”

, This shouldn’t be your first stop, but planting concern in someone's mind can be a very effective technique. Use language that plays to their worries, or that suggests the decision is time-sensitive.


For example, say something like, “You know, I heard they’re not going to be making these any more. If you want one, it’s probably better to buy it now, before you have to spend three times as much on eBay in order to get one.”
This kind of language and persuasion should be your last resort, because you usually only get to do this once. People quickly figure out that you’re just fear-mongering in order to get what you want, and then they won’t trust anything you say. This kind of reputation can spread as well, so be careful.

, It’s important for you to understand that feeling the need to control another person is not usually a healthy feeling. Just like you wouldn’t want someone to control you, it’s reasonable for other people not to want to be controlled too. Your need to control, however, is usually a symptom of a larger problem. Usually, it is because you don’t have control over another situation in your life. Since other aspects of your life feel out of control, you want to control another person so that you feel more secure. You need to understand that controlling another person won’t make your situation better and that finding another way to actually fix the problem will have a much better impact on your life.


For example, you might want to make some random girl you met fall in love with you. However, what you’re really worried about is that you feel like you’ll never meet someone who’s right for you, so you’re clinging to this girl who under normal circumstances you wouldn’t even like (or whom you at least have nothing in common with). A better way to deal with the situation would be to start looking in the right places, so that you find someone who really is your match. Even if you don’t end up finding someone right to date right off the bat, you’ll at least know that they’re out there.

, If you’re going to have a satisfying experience with life and feel good about most of the things that happen to you, you need to understand that many things in life will not go your way. As a wise man once wrote, “The world is not a wish granting factory.”If you know going in that you might not get your way, then you’ll be better prepared to deal with disappointment when it does happen. If you do get your way, though, it will be a pleasant surprise...meaning it’s a win either way.

, We can't control everything in our lives and we especially can't control other people. When you feel the need to control everything, it creates a lot of stress and negative feelings for you. It may even make you feel worse, in the long term, than if you had just let events play out in a natural way. Releasing your need to control will help you let go and enjoy life more.


Ask yourself: why do I need to control this situation? What happens if I'm not in control? You probably feel like things will go wrong if you don't control the situation. However, who's to say that what happens is what's wrong? Even a bad outcome may actually be a good outcome in disguise.
For example, maybe you want to control girl you like to make her go out with you. However, if you could make her go out with you, you may find out that she's actually mean, manipulative, or bad for you in some other way. Now you're stuck with her and the bad experiences that come from dating her! You don't want that.

, It's much healthier to let your life take the course it's going to take, rather than try to control every aspect of it. When you realize that things don't always need to go according to plan, you'll be much happier and feel more relaxed.


Start to embrace this concept by letting go of small things, like letting your waiter suggest something for you to eat when you go out to a restaurant.
You can also develop your ability to accept your situation by exposing yourself to more situations which are outside of your control, such as by traveling to an unfamiliar place.

, A lot of the time, we try to control other people because we feel like we don't have enough control in our own lives. Before you try to control other people, try to find areas in your own life where you can change how you act in order to gain more control over what happens to you. This is much healthier than the negative interactions that can often come from trying to control other people.


For example, maybe make yourself a schedule and work to stick to it, in order to create more time for you to get things done at work and do them well. This will work much better than trying to control your coworkers to make them do your tasks for you.

Taking coursework related to this field can give you a better idea of what your career would hold, and can help prepare you for the collegiate and graduate-level work ahead.


Take any psychology classes your school offers.
You may also benefit from taking statistics classes, as these will be required in college and/or graduate school. Statistics will also help prepare you for a career of research and data analysis.;
, You'll need an advanced degree to pursue a career in any field of psychology, but first you'll need to earn a bachelors degree. It's best to apply to schools that have been accredited, either at the state or regional level, to ensure that your education meets the recognized standard levels of quality.Some colleges offer a bachelors degree in sports psychology, but many do not.Many sports psychologists major in psychology, and take coursework to specialize in sports psychology.You can find psychology and sports psychology programs by searching online, or by using a specialized search engine like Psychology Career Center., After four years of hard work, you'll walk away with a bachelors degree in either psychology or sports psychology. It's important to do well and study your hardest in your undergraduate studies, as you'll need good grades to get into graduate school. If you're serious about pursuing a career in any field of psychology, you'll need a firm commitment to your studies, beginning in your undergraduate program.


Try getting involved in relevant extracurricular groups while you're working towards your bachelors degree. This can help boost your grad school application, teach you new skills, and build a network of professional connections.
Take any relevant internships you can while you're in school. Having experience will go a long way when you graduate and are seeking a job., Any field of psychology will require a minimum of a master's degree. As you search for and apply to grad programs, it's once again important to narrow your search to accredited programs to ensure a higher standard of educational quality.


Some graduate programs specialize in sports psychology. If you cannot find such a program, you'll need to choose a grad program in psychology and take relevant clinical/sports psychology coursework.You can find programs by searching online for grad schools in your area, or by using a specialized database that indexes psychology programs.

, Once you've earned your master's degree in psychology (or in sports psychology), you'll have to make a decision. You can try to enter the workforce with the degree you've earned, or go on to pursue a doctorate degree.


If you have a master's degree, you may be able to find relevant work. However, most positions working as a clinical, counseling, or research psychologist will require you to earn a doctoral degree., If you're interested in doing clinical work as a sports psychologist, you'll probably need a doctorate degree (though you may be able to find a position with a master's degree). You can search the American Psychological Association (APA) website for a list of APA-accredited doctoral programs.There are two main types of doctoral programs in psychology: the Doctorate of Philosophy (PhD) and the Doctor of Psychology (Psy.D.) degree.
The PhD degree is generally useful if you want to pursue a career in research or academia.
The Psy.D. degree is a clinical degree that will allow you to treat patients as a licensed doctor., In order to qualify for the Examination for Professional Practice in Psychology (EPPP) and gain certification, you will need to accrue two years of supervised experience working as a psychologist. One year is to be gained during your doctoral program (usually through an internship), and the second year is to be gained after you've graduated from your doctoral program.Depending on which state/province/territory you live in, there may be additional requirements for you to qualify for the EPPP. These may include a jurisprudence exam on the rules that govern psychological practice, or an oral examination.
See what your state/province/territory's requirements are in the Association of State and Provincial Psychology Boards (ASPPB) Handbook of Licensing and Certification Requirements for Psychologists in the U.S. and Canada., The Examination for Professional Practice in Psychology is administered by the ASPPB. Where and when you take the examination will vary, depending on where you live. You can register by calling 1-800-513-6910 any time Monday through Friday between 8:00 am and 8:00 pm EST.Once your local licensing board confirms that you met the required degree and work experience requirements, they will upload your information to the ASPPB.
You will receive an automated email from eppp@asppb.org to notify you when you can register online through the ASPPB website.

, It's important that you closely study the material you will be tested on in the EPPP. The exam is designed to test your knowledge of a practicing psychologist's responsibilities and areas of knowledge.Once you've been authorized by the ASPPB to take the exam, you will be able to take the practice exam online.
You will need to log into your ASPPB account to take the practice exam. It can be taken multiple times, either at home (online) or in a testing center.
The practice exam costs $55 to take online, or $155 to take at a Pearson Professional Center.The ASPPB only has one practice exam, which will remain the same no matter where you take it or how many times you attempt it.

, You will need to arrive at your local test center at least 30 minutes before your scheduled exam time. You'll be required to show two valid forms of ID issued by the country in which you are taking the exam. If you do not have a qualifying ID, you may show a passport from your country of origin and a secondary form of ID.You can find your local test center by searching through the Pearson Education website at https://www9.pearsonvue.com/testtaker/registration/SelectTestCenterProximity/ASPPB/1253960.
The EPPP application fee will cost you $600, plus an $87.50 appointment fee paid toward Pearson., After you've studied and taken the practice exam, you'll be ready to take the actual exam. The EPPP consists of 225 total questions: 50 ungraded pretest questions and 175 scored questions. Each question is in a multiple choice format, with four possible answers of which one is correct.Your score will range between 200 and 800, with 500 being the minimum score for independent practice and 450 being the minimum score for supervised practice. The test covers the following subject areas:


Biological Bases of Behavior (worth 12%)
Cognitive-Affective Bases of Behavior (worth 13%)
Social and Cultural Bases of Behavior (worth 12%)
Growth and Lifespan Development (worth 12%)
Assessment and Diagnosis (worth 14%)
Treatment, Intervention, Prevention, and Supervision (worth 14%)
Research Methods and Statistics (worth 8%)
Ethical/Legal/Professional Issues (worth 15%)

, You will receive an unofficial score at the test center upon completing the EPPP. Your actual score (which typically does not vary from the unofficial score, except in rare cases such as suspected cheating) will be reported to your local licensing board within 10 days of the exam completion, and the board will determine whether your score meets the minimum criterion for your local jurisdiction.


Your scores will be received by your jurisdictional licensing board on a Wednesday, covering test dates from the previous week (Sunday through Saturday).

, There are three primary career fields for sports psychologists. Which field you'd like to concentrate in will determine the focus of your studies and the scope of your internship/work experience. The three fields are:


academic jobs - teaching sports psychology coursework and conducting research at a university
applied psychology jobs - training athletes and working with entire sports teams to enhance team performance, motivation, and enduranceclinical psychology jobs - working one-on-one with athletes and coaches to teach coping skills, work through stress and performance anxiety, and address any underlying psychological issues, Some degree programs require an internship as a mandatory part of your education, and for good reason. Internships are an excellent way to gain experience in your field, add credentials to your resume, and make network connections that could last a lifetime.Try getting involved in sports, or at least following a team and learning the basics of the game. You'll ideally be working with athletes, so it's best to understand what athletes go through on a daily basis.Your college/graduate/doctoral program may offer specialized internships through some type of partnership.
You can find internships by reaching out to a practice you'd like to work with, or by searching the APA website for internships in your area., Professional organizations are not a requirement for work in sports psychology, but they can help you build professional contacts and may open new career doors to you down the line. Some of the most common professional associations for sports psychologists include:


Advancement of Applied Sport Psychology (AASP)
American Psychological Association (APA), Division 47
International Society of Sport Psychology (ISSP)
North American Society for Psychology of Sport and Physical Activity (NASPSPA), Your resume is the first impression an employer will have of you before you ever walk through their doors. It's important to compose a strong, professional resume that highlights your education and work experience, as well as any other relevant accomplishments.


Use a standard, simple font like Calibri, Arial, or Tahoma. Keep your font size between 10 and 12 points, and be consistent with both font and font size.Include your name and contact information in the letterhead at the top of your resume.
List your educational history, including the dates you earned your degrees and any honors you were awarded, in reverse-chronological order (highest/most recent degree listed first).
Next, list your job experience in reverse-chronological order.
List any clubs/activities you were involved in during your studies.
Detail any scholarships or awards you were given.
Name any professional organizations/associations you've been a part of that are relevant to your career.

, There are many ways to find psychology jobs. You might start by looking at professional association websites, like the APA or AASP. You can also reach out to any professional contacts you've made over the years to see if your network knows of any job openings in your field.

, During the interview, it's important that you not only answer the questions asked of you, but also provide as much relevant information about your experience and credentials as possible. You can craft your responses to the interviewer's questions to address your strong points and highlight your resume.Be confident, but not arrogant.
Know in advance what is expected of you for the position, and address those expectations in everything you say during the interview.
Learn as much as possible about the team, institution, or clinic you are interviewing with.
When you're permitted to ask your own questions, ask something relevant to the employer to show you've done your research.
Don't be afraid to admit that you don't have an answer to a question. You can say something like, ""I'm not sure about that off the top of my head. But I'd be happy to check into that and follow up with you at a later date.""
Send any follow-up information that was requested as soon as possible.
Send a thank you letter or email to the interviewer to show your gratitude for the time and opportunity you were given.

, Depending on your internships, coursework, and prior work experience, you may need to take an entry-level position. Do not be discouraged, as any work experience helps further build your resume. There are also many options available to you, once you are working in your field. Common related careers for sports psychologists include:

Obtain a bachelor of science degree.,
Get your Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO) or Doctor of Medicine (MD) medical degree.",How to Become a Psychiatrist1," The road from high school graduate to licensed psychiatrist is a long one, and it starts with a bachelor's degree. Many people who are interested in psychiatry choose to major in psychology, chemistry, biology, or engineering in order to start learning about the way the mind works. The important thing is to obtain a degree from a 4-year university that will prepare you to apply to medical school.


You must have 1 year of inorganic chemistry, 1 year of organic chemistry, 1 year of biology, 1 year of mathematics including calculus, and 1 year of physics in order to apply for medical school.
Grades must be outstanding in order to secure admission. For every one person admitted to medical school, 7 will be rejected. Some universities offer pre-med programs that are designed to fulfill all of the prerequisites for applying to medical school.
Going to the best school you can get into is a good idea when your end goal is becoming a psychiatrist. Medical schools are very competitive, so make sure you attend a top school and get the best grades you can get.
While you're in college, get experience in the psychiatric field by taking an internship at a hospital or doing volunteer work. Make sure psychiatry is definitely for you before you spend the time and money it takes to become licensed.;
, Psychiatrists must go through the same medical training program that all doctors go through. In addition to learning about the mind, you'll be learning about how the body works and how to treat all types of illnesses. Medical school will give you the fundamental knowledge you need to be a responsible and excellent doctor. You will have to pass internal medicine, surgery, neurology, obstetrics, emergency medicine, family practice, and pediatrics.


Do well on the MCAT and apply to the best school you can get into. You'll have a greater range of career choices if you go to a great medical school.
During the first four years of medical school you take classes, do lab work, and learn about medical ethics. You may not have the opportunity to do hands-on psychiatry work at this stage, but earning your medical degree is a requirement in the path to becoming a psychiatrist, so stick with it.

Decide which sub-specialty you want to go into.You could focus on psychiatric research, a certain therapeutic approach, or a specific set of illnesses.,
Complete your residency.",How to Become a Psychiatrist2," Do research on the different sub-specialties and figure out what you want to pursue during your residency. Consider the following options:


Addiction psychiatry, which involves treating patients who are dealing with addiction (such as substance abuse, gambling, food, and sex addictions).
Child and adolescent psychiatry.
Geriatric psychiatry.
Emergency psychiatry, which involves dealing with emergency situations that may endanger a person's life (for example, suicide attempts, violent changes in behavior, self-harm, psychosis).
Forensic psychiatry, which is psychiatry within the field of criminology, often dealing with the use of the insanity defense in a trial.
Neuropsychiatry, which is psychiatry connected to diseases of the nervous system.

, After you have your DO or MD, you'll spend the next four years getting hands-on experience with patients under the supervision of licensed doctors. The first year of residency will include several months in internal medicine and neurology. You'll put into practice all that you learned in the classroom while you pursued your medical degree. Your residency will be set up through your school and completed at a hospital or clinic.Your residency will include general medicine rotations, neurology, psychiatry and electives geared toward the specialized fields of psychiatry that interests you. You'll work in both outpatient and inpatient psychology.
Many students of psychiatry complete their residency working in the psychiatric ward of a hospital. You will work with patients to treat problems like clinical depression, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, psychosis, schizophrenia, anxiety disorders, dementia, post-traumatic stress disorder, dissociative identity disorder, and sleep disorders.

Get licensed by the state where you will practice.,
Become certified by the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology (ABPN) or the American Osteopathic Board of Neurology and Psychiatry (AOBNP).,
Work as a psychiatrist.",How to Become a Psychiatrist3," The American Psychiatric Association (APA) requires that psychiatrists pass state exams in order to become licensed. Fulfill your state's licensing requirements by passing the United States Medical Licensing Examination and/or Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensing Examination. Each state has slightly different examination requirements having to do with specific state laws.


If you move states, you may have to sit for another examination to practice psychiatry there.In order to prescribe medication, you must also get a federal narcotics license and register with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)., This is not a requirement, but it improves your chances of getting a job as a psychiatrist. The ABPN offers certificates in general psychiatry and specialized fields like teenage psychiatry. Earn the certificates that apply to the field of psychiatry you wish to pursue.

, After you've been licensed, you have several choices when it comes to employment. You may apply for a job at a hospital, work at a psychiatric clinic, or open your own private practice. Figure out which work situation is the best fit for you, then fill out applications or take steps toward opening an office and receiving patients.


Working an a hospital or clinic setting provides stability and structure, but the hours can be long, just as they are for any doctor.
Opening a private practice is lucrative, but it may be tough to get patients when you're first starting out."

Inspire employees to work.,
Set an example.,
Provide a clear path to success.,
Support collaboration.,
Meet with your management team.,
Gather feedback for their efforts.,
Focus on correcting flaws in leaders' behavior.,
Consider hiring a business coach.,
Keep the team accountable.,
Reflect on your decision-making style.,
Adjust behavioral leadership practices for your specific situation.,
Support process- and people-oriented leaders.",How to Encourage Behavioral Leadership," Behavioral leadership claims that successful leadership can be achieved through learnable behavior. This behavior is based in what leaders do and, specifically, how they interact with employees. This means that any manager can be taught to be an effective leader. Incorporate behavioral leadership practices in your business to improve the effectiveness of your managers., Effective leaders usually motivate and inspire their employees to work, rather than simply ordering them to do so. This can bring out additional effort from employees and drive the team towards project success. Leaders typically inspire employees through passion, enthusiasm, and a strong vision for progress in the organization or for the product.Work on instilling this sort of passion in your managers and training them to express it convincingly.

, Leaders can also inspire employees to action by providing an example. A leader should project any sort of qualities they hope to see in their employees and follow through on their commitments. Act with responsibility, integrity, and honesty. Doing otherwise will cause resentment among employees and distance the leader from them. The goal should be to create a sense that the leader and their team are ""in it together"" and should follow the same rules and meet the same expectations.You can also set an example by supporting your employees in their work. For example, you might support your employees by helping out your front desk manager if you are short staffed.

, A leader should provide a clear path to objective, project, and organizational success. Make sure to give a sense of perspective to employees and allow them to see how everyday tasks are linked to overall success. This helps employees see that their work is making a difference.This also includes clearly explaining how roles and responsibilities are divided., Leaders should not be distanced from other employees. Fostering a sense of collaboration and focusing on the relationship between leadership and subordinates is important both for communicating project details and for keeping morale high. Build this type of collaboration by listening to team members' concerns and balance that with achieving your objectives. Employees should not feel as though the company's concerns are more important than theirs.Ask your employees about their thoughts, opinions, and ideas as well. This will help to promote an open dialogue.

, You'll need to meet with your management team to explain to them the concepts of behavioral leadership. In many cases, they will already be doing some of the things suggested by this approach. However, remind them that there is always room for improvement and that another hallmark of a good leader is challenging one's self to improve.Lay out the concepts of behavioral leadership and suggest ways that it could be incorporated into their leadership styles.
Let them know what you will be monitoring their use of these strategies.

, Observe your managers as they attempt to implement behavioral leadership strategies. Look for success and areas that still need some work. You can also gain feedback about them from their team members or others employees. You might wish to use an anonymous comment box for this purpose to protect the commenter's privacy. Remember to reinforce that positive commentary is also encouraged and explain to your managers what they are doing well., If leaders are particularly bad at any of the aforementioned aspects of behavioral leadership, their effectiveness will suffer. Use the feedback gained from meeting with each manager to assess where their individual weaknesses lie. You can then have them focus their efforts on improving their performance in that area. Have them research methods for doing so and instruct them on any such methods you have found to be effective., A business coach helps improve manager performance through a variety of tactics. If your managers are not improving significantly under your direction, it may be time to hire a coach to help them. The coach can watch each manager closely, keeping on eye on their communication, behaviors, qualities, and overall effectiveness. They can then coach them through ways to improve., Recruit employees to help you keep the managers accountable for implementing the new behaviors. Have them report improvement, or lack thereof, to you so that you can remind the manager of their commitment to change. Have employees also how effective the new behavior was in its intended effect. For example, do they feel more inspired to work as a result of the leader's behavior?, Leaders may use a variety of decision-making strategies as part of a behavioral leadership approach. The two primary types are authoritarian and democratic decision-making. In the former, the leader does not involve employees in the decision-making process. However, in the democratic style, decisions are made with the input of employees. Both styles have been proven to be effective in different circumstances.


The right choice for your organization will depend on your employees' preferences and the conditions of the work environment.
In most cases, employees just need to feel as though their voice is heard in the organization and that they are participating in the process, rather than having an actual say in decision-making., Behavioral leadership studies have attempted to establish leadership behavior that is effective under all conditions and in all situations. However, there are little or no such behaviors. The effectiveness of any leadership strategy will depend on the leader, the employees, and the organization of the workplace. This is the primary weakness of behavioral leadership.


However, you can figure out which behaviors are most successful in your organization through trial and error and by studying strategies used in similar organizations., Behavioral leadership strategies can be used to support the two main types of leaders: those who are process-focused and those who are people-focused. Process-focused leaders give more attention to the workplace's organization, the procedures used, and having control over the project. They primarily organize, gather information, and motivate their employees.


People-focused leaders, however, motivate their employees through focusing on them, rather than directly on the process. They spend more time encouraging, coaching, and communicating with employees to make sure their needs are met.
Both methods can be effective for different leaders and organizational structures. Any behavioral leadership strategies used should be used in tandem with these overarching leadership styles."

Most ergonomics degrees are earned at the masters and doctoral levels, allowing a wide variety of choices for an undergraduate major. Common undergraduate degree choices are psychology and systems engineering. Other undergraduate degree options might include: aviation, biology, computer science, kinesiology, mechanical engineering, occupational therapy, physical therapy, physiology, software engineering and sports medicine. As an undergraduate become very involved in research at your college or university. Try to attend at least one meeting of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society (HFES)or one of its local chapters as an undergraduate if you live in the USA. If you live in a country outside of the USA check out the International Ergonomics Association (IEA) website to find the contact information for the ergonomics organization in your country.;
, A listing of the graduate schools offering programs in ergonomics is available on the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society (HFES)web site.

, While in graduate school be sure to complete one or two internships and become involved in meaningful research.

, While certification is not mandatory in the field, may practitioners have chosen to complete examinations and have their work reviewed by colleagues to earn certification. One of the leading certification organizations in the US is the Board of Certification in Professional Ergonomics (BCPE). If you plan to work on becoming certified be sure that you complete the requisite coursework in graduate school.

, You may chose to work in academics, business, consulting, government, or industry. Throughout your time in school network with ergonomists by attending professional meetings, participating in internet discussions and completing internships. This network, in addition to reading formal job postings will help you to secure a great position. Ultimately, you may decide to open your own consulting business, but normally this would only be done after having years of experience.

Research and speak about a civil rights leader in your area or state.",How to Celebrate African American History," Many teachers make lesson plans for their classes, and communities and individuals create events to help remember important people and events. As with the study of any historical topics, if you choose your celebration based on the age of your participants, it is more likely that you will find subjects that they can understand and find interesting.;
, For a classroom, these background lessons are essential to identifying the major struggles and victories of African Americans. Lead your celebration by researching a few of the following subjects:


Discuss the economic factors that led to slavery. Other countries to study include Great Britain, Portugal, Spain, and colonies in the West Indies and Africa. Establish the rise, height and fall of the triangle trade and the factors that led Africa to be chosen as a main depot for the slave trade.
Discuss education and segregation in African American history. Study the Brown vs. Board of Education ruling that ended segregation in America's schools. Ask what challenges there were and still are in removing segregation in schools.
Discuss political issues and laws in African American history. Your research can include the Civil War, Jim Crow laws, Plessy vs. Ferguson, the Supreme Court's Dred Scott case, the Civil Rights Bill and the Emancipation Proclamation. Also, include efforts by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People throughout the 20th and 21st century.
Discuss civil unrest from the underground railroad to 20th century civil rights protests. There is a rich history of protest that includes sit-down protests in the south, non-violent protests, riots, Rosa Parks, the Million Man March and today's efforts by the NAACP.
Other possible topics include Barack Obama being elected as the first African American president, African American cultural topics like food, family and song, violence against African Americans, African Americans in sports, modern challenges, and much more.

, For earlier lessons, such as the transatlantic slave trade, American plantations and Jim Crow laws, you can find illustrations and videos at the HistoryChannel.com or Smithsonian.com. For later studies, you can order videos of Dr. Martin Luther King's speeches, Civil Rights protests, and more.


Visual representations of historical imagery can help people to bring important moments to life. Some people are visual learners who will take more from videos and photographs than from reading texts.

, Ask everyone to choose a poem, essay, speech or story by an African American artist of the past or future. Schedule a date, time and location that everyone can attend.


Possible reading choices include Langston Hughes, W.E.B. DuBois, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Frederick Douglas, Abraham Lincoln, Maya Angelou, Alice Walker, Phillis Wheatley and Malcolm X. The oldest known piece of African American literature is ""Bars Fight,"" by Lucy Terry.

, You can rent films that include famous actors like Bert Williams, Lena Horne, Hattie McDaniel, Dorothy Dandridge and Sidney Poitier. You can also include modern films by Spike Lee or modern critical successes starring actors like Halle Berry, Denzel Washington, Will Smith and Morgan Freeman.

, Start with songs of slavery, sung during long days working plantations. Move toward the rise of jazz, rhythm and blues and hip hop.


Encourage people to sing along to the music. Invite local jazz bands to perform famous pieces from African Americans' long list of contributions to modern music.

, These celebrations often include meetings, educational speeches, films, television specials and more.


Not all African American leaders are in favor of setting aside an African American history month. Discuss with children, friends or family why this celebration might be seen as an impediment to social progress.

, Schools, speaking clubs, political groups and more often ask historians, civil rights activists and writers to give an in-depth look at a little-known aspect of African American history or culture.


Encourage a discussion of the topic after the lecture. This will lead to critical thinking about African American history.

, Print off recipes and arrange a potluck. Ask everyone to explain the historical journey that each dish took. Rice, okra, turnips and other foods were traditionally used in West African cuisine, whereas cornmeal, pig, greens and some spices were from the Americas and were incorporated early on in slave and southern plantation cuisine.

, For older kids, ask them to complete quizzes for prizes. For younger students, use coloring books, matching games, songs and memory games to learn about history in a fun, festive way.

, Putting together a presentation that explains your state's role in African American history can make an impact on the local community.

If family appears more or less stable, then the person may be more toward being a sociopath, however, similar family traits may indicate a stronger link with being a psychopath.;
, Psychopaths tend to be more manipulative than sociopaths. Others may see them as charming and endearing. Psychopaths can appear to live normal lives and may minimize their illegal or criminal activities.Sweet or prosocial behaviors can be seen as a means to an end.


For example, they may not answer questions directly, point the blame at others, or make up elaborate stories for their behavior of why it’s not their fault.

, Even if a psychopath is charming, it’s unlikely that he or she feels empathy toward others. A psychopath may be unable to form attachments and real relationships with other people. While a psychopath may be in a romantic relationship or have a family, it’s unlikely that he or she expresses true emotions and has learned to mimic emotions.A psychopath may be completely disconnected from the emotional experience. He or she may not understand why people are upset or that others experience a range of emotion.

, Psychopaths often hold steady jobs and have a good education. They may have families and relationships without anyone suspecting their psychopathic tendencies.In people living “normal” lives, the symptoms associated with psychopathy may be more subtle and only be most evident in interpersonal relationships or around family.


Co-workers or acquaintances may not suspect that the person is a psychopath, or just may think that something is a bit “different” about the person.

, When a psychopath commits a crime, all details of that crime are often meticulously planned out ahead of time. The psychopath may perform the crime in a cool and calm manner. Any crimes committed are often highly organized. For this reason, psychopaths make great con artists due to their calmness, meticulousness, and charismatic charm.For example, a psychopath may plan elaborate schemes to steal cars, money, or other valuable objects in a smooth, calculated, and seamless manner.

, While psychopaths tend to have a strong genetic link, sociopaths appear to have a more environment-based development. For example, a sociopath may have grown up in an abusive, neglectful, or violent home or community.The sociopath may develop traits as a defense mechanism or response to harsh conditions.


Experiencing a traumatic childhood and adapting to the harshness is much more likely for a sociopath than a psychopath.

, While the psychopath may be gregarious, charming, and calculated, the sociopath may be more aggressive, rageful, and reckless.Sociopaths may be more violent than psychopaths and experience more emotional outbursts., Sociopaths are much more likely to behave in reckless behavior without regarding potential outcomes or consequences. While psychopaths tend to be meticulous and detail-oriented, sociopaths may be more careless and erratic.A sociopath may not think of potential outcomes or how to anticipate them. Sociopaths tend to have more difficulty holding down a job, are generally found on the fringes of society, and tend to be uneducated. They may move frequently or cycle through jobs quickly.A sociopath may decide to rob a bank one day and go do it without much planning. The psychopath, however, would spend weeks or months planning “the perfect crime.”

, Sociopaths tend to experience more empathy and more guilt than psychopaths. A sociopath may be capable of creating social bonds with people or romantic relationships. A sociopath may have no problem hurting a stranger, but may feel remorseful for hurting someone close to him or her., ASPD clinically characterizes both sociopaths and psychopaths. A diagnosis of ASPD is warranted if a psychologist or therapist determines 3 or more of the following traits:Regularly breaking the law
Constantly lying or deceiving others
Being violent or aggressive
Does not regard the safety or well-being of others
Is irresponsible with money, job, or lifestyle
Lacks remorse or guilt for destructive or hurtful behavior

, ASPD is more common in males than females. There’s a higher prevalence of people with ASPD in forensic settings like prisons. It’s likely that people with ASPD will also show signs of substance abuse or alcohol problems., Some people with ASPD shows signs of disturbance during childhood. Some childhood signs include being aggressive to people and animals, lying constantly, destroying property, and getting into legal trouble.A childhood diagnosis of these traits is called conduct disorder.


A child with conduct disorder may break rules at home and at school, and generally be difficult to manage.

, Original locations were used and even some of the original revolutionaries played themselves. Although the role of Trotsky was heavily biased and censored on Stalin's orders. Battleship Potemkin was also by Sergei Eisenstein and was about the 1905 revolution. It is considered the most influential propaganda film of all-time and is sometimes described as the greatest film of all-time.

, The causes included popular dissatisfaction with the autocratic Tsarist regime, the perceived influence of Rasputin on the Tsar, the unpopularity of World War I and brutal suppression of popular demonstrations. Lenin wrote the classic pamphlet/manifesto What is to be Done in 1901 and wrote extensively throughout the uprisings in 1905 and 1917. The effect of the successful revolution was the rapid industrialization of a feudal society and the formation of the Soviet Union until its dissolution in 1991.

, Such as the American Revolution (1776), the French Revolution (1789) (both of which overthrew colonial monarchies), the Hungarian Revolution (1956), the Cuban Revolution (1959), the Carnation Revolution (1974), the Velvet Revolution (1989), the Rose Revolution (2003), the Orange Revolution (2004) and the Tulip Revolution (2005).

Determine type of document it is.,
Identify the author.,
Determine when the document was created.,
Identify the audience.",How to Analyze a Historical Document1," It’s important to know what you’re looking at, since that can help you figure out how to place the document in context. You could be looking at a newspaper article, a music score, a piece of poetry, a letter, or something else. Knowing what you're looking at helps you develop an approach for handling the information the document contains.For example, if you know you’re looking at an obituary, you’ll also know you’ll want to find out where it originally appeared (like a newspaper), whether it was written by the publication's staff or someone related to the deceased, and whether there were other newspapers in the same time and place that might cover the same person differently.;
, There might be an author’s name listed somewhere on the document, or you might have to figure it out from context clues in the document itself. Think about the race, gender, ethnicity, or sexual orientation of the author and how that might affect what they write and how they write it.For example, if you’re looking at a letter, the author’s name might be signed at the bottom. Or, you might be able to figure out who the author is if you know who it is addressed to. For example, if you know the letter is addressed to John Adams, and the author calls him “my husband,” you’d know the author is Abigail Adams.

, Some documents will have dates, others will not. Once you have the date, think about what was happening at that time. That context can help give you clues as to why the document was created or what it might be addressing.For example, if you’re reading a speech transcript, there might not be an obvious date written on it. You can still date the transcript by looking for context clues. Maybe the author wrote “when World War II ended ten years ago,” somewhere in the text. Since you know that World War II ended in 1945, you’d know that this document was written ten years later – in 1955.
If you have a newspaper article written about equal rights in 1963, you can assume that the Civil Rights Movement, and the increasing popularity of Martin Luther King, Jr., probably motivated the writer to write about equal rights.

, Maybe the author is addressing a specific group of people. Or maybe there was an intended audience of one, or they were simply jotting down some thoughts for themselves. Knowing the audience – and whether the document was meant to be private or public – can help you figure out what the author’s intent was for the document. A private document is sometimes more likely to be honest, since the author did not expect anyone to see it. A public document is more likely to be trying to convince someone of something.For example, the audience for a letter from a husband to his wife during World War II probably only has an intended audience of one – the wife. The husband might be more likely to be honest about how he feels about the war. Alternatively, he might keep certain things from his wife to stop her from worrying.

"
Figure out if the document is prescriptive or descriptive.,
Determine the author’s argument.,
Pay attention to what isn’t said.,
List the limitations of the source.,
Determine the document’s credibility.",How to Analyze a Historical Document2," If the document is prescriptive, it’s trying to tell people what to do. If it’s descriptive, it’s trying to describe events that took place or people that were there. Knowing whether it’s prescriptive or descriptive can help you determine what the purpose of the document was.For example, an early twentieth-century book of manners - which tells women how to behave in public - is an example of a prescriptive document.
A newspaper article that covers the events of the Boston Tea Party is an example of a descriptive document.

, What is the point the author is trying to get across? Their argument can help you understand where the author is coming from, the purpose of the document, and whether they might have a vested interest in people accepting their argument as true.Keep in mind that the author's argument might be obvious or it might be subtle. For example, the author of a publicity flyer that asks the public to come to a pro-union meeting might say, ""Joining the UAW will make your family more financially secure!"" That author's argument is pretty obvious - that the United Auto Workers union will help working families.
By contrast, the author of a newspaper article about civil rights protests might say ""The protesters were met with violence when police officers turned water hoses on them. Many protesters were injured, while the police seemed unconcerned."" This sounds like a description of what happened. However, the author's description of injured protesters and unconcerned police suggests that the author's subtle argument is that the protesters were right and the police were wrong.

, In historical documents, silence often says as much as actual words. Figuring out what gets left out is often called “reading between the lines,” and it’s something historians do to determine an author’s real motivation.For example, if the source is an obituary of Benedict Arnold, what do you know about him that gets left out of the obituary? Does it mention the fact that Americans consider him a traitor? Does it only focus on Americans’ perception of him? The things that get left out can tell you a lot about who wrote the document and why.

, Historians spend a lot of time looking at a lot of different sources to craft their arguments about the past. No one document is going to tell you everything you need to know about the time period or topic that you’re studying. Consider what the document can’t tell you.For example, let’s say you’re writing a paper on second wave feminism in the United States. A letter from Gloria Steinem to one of her friends will tell you about the personal life of one of the movement’s leaders. It won’t tell you a lot about how she interacted with the government.

, Once you’ve analyzed a historical document, you need to decide if the document is credible or not. You can do this by comparing it to other research you’ve done, or what you already know about the period. Are there other sources that corroborate what you’ve read in this document? Or do most other sources contradict what the document says. You should only use credible documents in historical research.For example, maybe the author of an article in Southern newspaper argues that black and white members of the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) are coming down south to kidnap young girls. You know from other research and reading that this isn’t true, so it’s not a credible source for describing the activities of SNCC. However, it does tell you something about how southerners might have reacted to the changes that resulted from the Civil Rights Movement.

Note the caption.,
Read the test question.,

Read and annotate.,

Use “PAPER,” alternately.,
Review the source’s usefulness.,
Be comprehensive.,
Be direct.,

Make good use of time.",How to Answer a Source Question in History," One big mistake that people make with tests is to ignore the instructions given before a question, usually in a caption. Make sure that you read this carefully. It will tell you what you need to do and how to answer the question.


The caption will give helpful information. It may advise you on how long your answer should be. For example, is the question a short-answer or a longer source evaluation? This will affect how much you need to write.
Pay attention to any information about may how long your answer should be, as well. You may need to give a few sentences or several paragraphs, i.e. a short essay.
The instructions might also suggest how you use your time. For example, they may suggest you spend 5 to 10 minutes reading the sources and planning, and another 20 to 30 minutes answering the question.
Be aware of how many questions the test contains and of any time limits.;
, Once you are sure how to answer, take your first look at the question. Read it through. This sounds simple, but you need to understand exactly what it is asking to give a solid response.


What is your task? The question might want you to identify a source or put it in historical context. Or, it might ask you to answer one or more questions on the basis of the source.
Think of the question as a second set of instructions. It is telling you what kind of info to look for when you read the source.
Read it a second or even third time – it can’t hurt! Make sure that you understand the question.

, Keep the question in mind. If it helps, jot down brief notes or underline parts of the question before you turn to the source. The question should guide you and may even contain hints.


For instance, a question that asks, “Read and identify the following passage,” wants you to use your background knowledge to link the source to a certain time period, place, and maybe author.
One that asks, “Evaluate source A as evidence for the rise of Communism,” is asking about usefulness and reliability. Here you will have to identify context and any biases in the source, as well as its limits as historical evidence.
A question that asks, “What does this source tell us about the effect of the American Civil War on the abolition movement?” is asking something else. You’ll need to evaluate the source, but also understand how it fits into arguments about the abolition of slavery during the Civil War.

, Take a first stab at the source, reading it through carefully, slowly, and thoroughly. What are your impressions? Look for any clues based on the question.


Consider annotating the source while you read. Make sure to note any points that can help you. Does the source mention events? People? Dates? Places? These are important.
Your first impressions can turn out to be right. Even if something seems obvious, or minor, write it down anyway.

, The next step is the meat of your task and should help to generate your answer for the test. Read the source again, this time asking yourself five specific “W”-questions: who, what, when, where, and why?Ask: who wrote the source? This is important because it can tell you about the author’s place in society, her concerns, and possible biases. Race, class, age, and sex are all important. If not obvious, you may have to guess this from clues in the text.
What is the source? It might be a diary entry, a letter, a newspaper column, or a government memo. Try to figure this out – it can tell you what message the author was trying to get across and who the intended audience was.You may or may not have an idea of the “when.” Dates can help you. Otherwise, what sort of events or ideas does the source mention? Can you identify a time period with this context?
Like “when,” “where” may or may not be obvious. Pay attention to any events, arguments, or ideas that the source mentions. Does the language sound current or older? This may help, too.
Why was the source written? This question may be the hardest to unpack and is just as important as factual information. A source might have a clear message. It might not. However, every author has her own point of view. Does she have an “axe to grind” or a stake in the issue?, Other than asking “W-questions,” you can also try the “PAPER” method. PAPER is an acronym that will guide your evaluation of the sources, and covers much of the same ground as before.“P” stands for purpose: what is the purpose of the author in creating the source? Who was she and what was her place in society? Does she make a claim? What is at stake for her?
“A” stands for argument. What is the author’s argument, or the strategy that she uses to reach her purpose? Who is her intended audience? Is she reliable?
“P” stands for presuppositions and values. What are the values in the source? Are they different or similar to our own? Is there anything that we might not agree with, but that the source’s audience would have accepted?
“E” stands for “epistemology.” This word means a way of knowing something. Try to evaluate the source’s “truth content.” What information does the author reveal? Does she make a claim that is her own interpretation? How does she support her arguments?
“R” stands for relate. Lastly, relate the source to what you know about the bigger context. How does it fit into what you know about the period and its history?

, All sources have uses and, apart from facts, can tell us about the perspectives of a person or group of people. That said, they also have blind-spots, agendas, and limitations. The final thing you’ll want to do is assess the source for its uses and limitations.


You’ve identified the author, her context, her motive, and her message. Now you have to bring these to bear on a bigger question: “So what?” What is the greater significance of the source?
Ask yourself what the source says about its context. Does it confirm or contradict what you know about the period? Does it engage with an important political debate, for example? Does it show the perspective of a certain group of people?Say, for example, the source is a newspaper article about slavery. What does it illustrate about abolition and debates over slavery at the time of the Civil War?
Or, say the source is an government memo from the 1960s. Does it help us understand what was going on then, maybe about the Vietnam or Cold Wars?

, A good short-answer or essay, including a historical source evaluation, means more than just facts. Your teacher wants to see that you can show your grasp of the facts but at the same time put them into a larger picture.


Think of it this way. Who, what, where, when, and why are important. But the most important thing is to address the “So, what?” Explain why and how the facts matter. Show how the source in question matters.
For example, how does the source highlight major historical debates or events? Does it add to our knowledge of these developments? Does it change them? How?

, Another key to writing a good test answer is to be direct. Don’t waste time on words that are off-topic. Start with a point that gets to the heart of the question (one mark gained, well done!).Begin with a sentence that addresses the prompt. If you are supposed to identify the source, you might start by writing “This source was produced by…”
If prompted to evaluate a source’s usefulness, you might start with something like “This source shows us that…” or “This source is useful because it demonstrates that…”
Keep the answer focused! Adding as much material as you can will not always get you a better mark. In fact, unrelated or off-topic facts may earn you less points.

, Try to plan your answer in order of importance – that is, start with the most important material. This is usually your main point or thesis statement, which is the thrust of your answer to the question. Lesser, supporting points follow after that.


A good structure for simple IDs is to state (in two or three sentences) who, what, when, where, and why. End your answer with source’s bigger significance, i.e. “It is important because it shows us that…”
You will need to aim bigger for essays, perhaps a few paragraphs. A good structure for this is to start with a thesis, and then add a paragraph for each supporting point. Make sure to follow the initial instructions for length.

, Always be ready to support your points with proof from the source, either a direct quotation, a fact or description, or part of the image if the source is visual.


Why do you have to document? Because your teacher is not just looking for a correct answer but also to see that you understand the answer. This is what documentation shows.
To substantiate a point, you might say, “To show this, the source depicts…” or “This is clear because the source says that…”
Be as specific as you can when offering documentation. Point to specific facts, arguments, and ideas.
After offering one or two examples, you can move on to your next point, i.e. “This source also suggests that…”

, Keep in mind that you may only have a limited period to take the test. You will need to watch the clock. Try not to spend too much effort on a single source question, or even a single part of a question.


You might decide on a time limit for yourself for each question. Stick to it. Otherwise, you might be unable to finish other questions or the test itself.
Don’t write more than you need to or be afraid to move on. Again, manage your time and effort so that you can finish the rest of the exam.
Try not to worry too much about style. Teachers usually don’t hold grammar and style against you during a test. Don’t labor over your word choice and only rewrite passages if you have left-over time."

Create your own sentences with hieroglyphs.",How to Read Egyptian Hieroglyphics1," Because hieroglyphics are images and not letters, like we use in modern English, it’s quite difficult to describe how to read them if you can't visually see them. Start your learning process by obtaining a visual alphabet chart from the internet. Print the chart out and keep it with you while you learn.The following list of URLs all offer visual charts of the Egyptian hieroglyphs translated into the English alphabet:

http://www.egyptianhieroglyphs.net/egyptian-hieroglyphs/lesson-1/
http://www.ancientscripts.com/egyptian.html
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Egyptian_hieroglyphs_by_alphabetization


The glyphs found in these alphabet charts are also referred to as ‘unilateral’ because most have only one symbol.;
, Even though some glyphs can be translated into a letter from the English alphabet, they don’t all sound exactly the same as the English letter. The URL where you obtained the glyph alphabet should also contain a chart that shows what each glyph’s pronunciation sounds like. Print this chart off as well and keep it with you as reference.For example, the bird-like hieroglyph translates to what looks like a three, ‘3,’ but is pronounced as ‘ah.’
Technically speaking, the pronunciations are a guess from Egyptologists. Since the Egyptian hieroglyphs are a dead language, there is no one around to demonstrate how the sounds are pronounced. Instead, Egyptologists had to make educated guesses based on a later form of the Egyptian language called Coptic.

, Egyptian hieroglyphics have two main types: ideograms and phonograms. Ideograms were drawings that directly represented the object being written about. Phonograms were drawings that represented sounds. Since the Ancient Egyptians didn’t write vowels, phonograms mostly represent consonant sounds.Phonograms can represent one sound or multiple sounds. Refer to the glyph alphabet you downloaded for specific examples.
Ideograms, in addition to having a literal translation (e.g. a glyph that’s a pair of legs might mean movement or walking), may also have a not-so-literal translation (e.g. the same leg glyph combined with other glyphs might actually refer to giving directions).
Egyptian hieroglyphs were normally created with phonograms at the start of a word and ideograms at the end of a word. In this case, the hieroglyph is also referred to as a determinative.

, Hieroglyphs represent sounds, not letters. As such, there are no glyphs that are silent like there are letters in the English language that are silent. In order to spell a word using hieroglyphs, you need to be sure each sound in the word is represented by a glyph.For example, the word ‘freight’ is spelled using seven letters, but only contains four sounds. The sounds are ‘f,’ ‘r,’ ‘long a,’ and ’t.’ Therefore, in order to spell the word freight using hieroglyphs, you need to use the glyphs for each of the four sounds. In this case it would be the horned viper plus a lion laying down plus an arm plus a bread loaf.
Not all sounds that are found in the English language have an associated sound (and therefore glyph) in ancient Egyptian.
Because a lot of vowels are silent in the English language, they aren’t used when spelling a word in ancient Egyptian. This means it can be hard to decipher what word is being spelled because there could be more than one possible translation. This is where determinatives come in. Use a determinative glyph after spelling a word in hieroglyphics in order to help describe the word properly.

Determine in which direction hieroglyphs should be read.,
Deciphering ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic nouns.,
Learn ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic suffix pronouns.,
Grasp the idea of ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic prepositions.,
Understand ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic adjectives.",How to Read Egyptian Hieroglyphics2," Hieroglyphs can actually be read in almost any direction: left to right, right to left, and top to bottom. To determine how to read a specific set of glyphs, start by locating a glyph with a head. If the head is facing to the left, start reading from the left and work you way towards the head. If the head is facing the right, start reading from the right and work you way towards the head.If the glyphs appear in vertical columns, always start at the top and work your way down. However, you still need to determine if you read right to left or left to right.
Note that some glyphs may be grouped together to save space. Tall glyphs are usually drawn on their own while short glyphs may be stacked on top of one another. This means one line of hieroglyphs may require you to read both horizontally and vertically.

, Hieroglyphs have two types of nouns, gender nouns (masculine vs. feminine) and quantity nouns (singular, plural, or dual).In most, but not all cases, when a noun is followed by the bread loaf glyph it indicates that the word is feminine. If the noun doesn’t have a bread loaf glyph, it is likely masculine.
A noun that is plural may be represented by either the quail chick glyph or the rope curl glyph. For example, the glyph containing water and a man means ‘brother' (singular). The same glyph with a quail chick included means ‘brothers.'
A noun that is dual may be represented by two backwards slashes. For example, the glyph containing water, a rope curl, two backwards slashes, and two men means ‘the two brothers.'
Sometimes dual and plural nouns do not contain these extra glyphs, instead vertical lines or multiple glyphs of the same type will indicate how many of those items are being referred to.

, A pronoun is a substitute for a noun and is normally used after the noun (also known as the antecedent) is first used. For example, in the sentence “Bob tripped as he climbed the stairs,” ‘Bob’ is the noun and ‘he’ is the pronoun. In ancient Egyptian pronouns also exist, but may not always follow an antecedent.Suffix pronouns must be attached to nouns, verbs, or prepositions, they are not individual words. They are the most common pronouns in ancient Egyptian.
My, me, and I is represented by either a person glyph or a reed leaf glyph.
You and your is represented by basket with handle glyph when it is referring to a masculine singular noun. And is represented by a bread loaf glyph or tethering rope glyph when it is referring to a singular feminine noun.
He, his, it, and its is represented by a horned viper glyph when it is referring to a masculine singular noun. And is is represented by a folded cloth glyph when it is referring to a singular feminine noun.
Our, us, and we are represented by the water glyph on top of three vertical lines.
Your and you (the plural versions) are represented by either the bread loaf glyph or the tethering rope glyph on top of the water glyph and three vertical lines.
Their, them, and they are represented by a folded cloth glyph or a door bolt glyph plus the water glyph and three vertical lines.

, Prepositions are words like under, beside, on top, near, between, until, etc. that make other words in a sentence make sense in terms of time and space. For example, in the sentence “the cat was under the table,” the word ‘under’ is the preposition.The owl glyph is one of the most versatile prepositions in ancient Egyptian. Most of the time it translates to ‘in’ but can also mean ‘for, during, from, with, and through.'
The mouth glyph is another versatile preposition that can mean ‘against, concerning, and in order to,’ depending on the context of the sentence where its contained.
Prepositions can also be combined with nouns to make a compound preposition.

, Adjectives are words that describe nouns. For example, in the sentence “the pink umbrella,” the word ‘pink’ is the adjective as it is describing the noun ‘umbrella.’ In ancient Egyptian, adjectives can be used as both modifiers of nouns and as nouns themselves.Adjectives that are used as modifiers will always follow the noun, pronoun, or noun phrase they modify. These types of adjectives will also have the same gender and plurality as the noun.
Adjectives that are used as nouns have the same rules as nouns in terms of feminine versus masculine and singular versus plural versus dual.

Visit a Civil War battlefield.,
Go to a re-enactment.,
Collect Civil War artifacts.,
Listen to Civil War music.,
Collect miniatures and create dioramas.,
Join a club.",How to Become a Civil War Buff2," Being a Civil War buff isn't just about sitting at home and reading books. To make it a real hobby there are other activities you can partake in. One of the most popular is to visit Civil War battlefields.


Many of the important battlefields of the Civil War now feature prominent monuments, tours, and more. The Gettysburg battlefield is particularly rich in historical attractions.If you can, plan a trip to visit one of these fields.
While some battlefields have been well preserved, others have been destroyed by development. Many Civil War buffs take part in conservation efforts to help preserve important sites from the war., Civil War re-enactments give you an opportunity to see a re-creation of the historical events you've read about.These events usually include battles and encampments with living-history demonstrations by participants.

, Many Civil War buffs collect artifacts from the war, giving them a chance to own a piece of history.Civil War relics can be found online or in antique stores.


Collecting Civil War artifacts can get very expensive, but for the beginner, small items like bullets, uniform buttons, and Confederate money are sometimes available at a reasonable price.

, Some Civil War buffs are enthusiastic about music from the period. There are active musicians who perform Civil War music who you can see perform. If you are a musician yourself, you might decide to start playing some of these songs yourself.


The Library of Congress has a searchable database of sheet music from the Civil War that is free to download.The Smithsonian and other organizations make collections of recordings of Civil War music available for sale.The soundtrack to Ken Burns's documentary is also popular among Civil War buffs.

"
"
Find groups near you.,
Choose a side and join a unit.,
Purchase a uniform and equipment.,
Attend re-enactments events.",How to Become a Civil War Buff3," Many Civil War buffs become participants in re-enactment groups. If this interests you, search on the internet for re-enactment groups near you. There are dozens of re-enactment groups across the country.For more information about the hobby, check out the Camp Chase Gazette, the magazine of Civil War re-enactors.Look under ""Civil War Directory"" to find re-enactment groups in your state.
Note that if you want to join a cavalry group, it would be helpful to have some experience with horses. If you don't, consider the infantry instead.
Note that some people choose to play the role of a Civil War era civilian, rather than a soldier. If this is more interesting to you, it may also be an option., In most states, you'll find that there are re-enactors representing both Union and Confederate military units. Choose the side you want to represent and join a group. Don't feel like you can't choose a northern group just because you live in the south, or vice versa!


Some people choose based on their own family history. If you have ancestors who fought for one side or the other, you might choose that side and feel a greater personal connection.
Be sure to join a group before you buy your uniform and equipment. You want to be sure the equipment you have matches the rest of your unit. Historical accuracy is very important to re-enactors., Once you've joined a group, it's time to buy your clothes, equipment, and weapons. In most cases, your group will be able to direct you to a merchant that sells the right gear for you.There are also many companies that sell Civil War accoutrements on the internet. Most re-enactments also include vendors selling Civil War gear, so you could also buy your uniform at an event.
Note that everything you bring to re-enactment should be historically accurate. Re-enactors call an item that doesn't match the period ""farby."" Farby items are, to say the least, frowned upon at re-enactments., Once you're equipped and signed up, you can start attending groups and portraying a Civil War soldier for the public. Your group will typically participate in these events with numerous other units in the area.


Be aware that there is a lot more to these events than battle scenes. Typically, you'll be camping out with your unit, sleeping on a cot or bedroll in a drafty canvas tent, sometimes for several days.Be sure that's something you can commit to before joining a re-enactor group.

Set up your new practice or discuss staying at your post-doctoral supervisor's practice.",How to Become a Clinical Psychologist," To get into a good undergraduate psychology program, you'll need an impressive GPA in high school. Take any psychology classes offered at your school to get a feel for what clinical psychology is all about.


Ask the instructor of any psychology classes at your school about the differences in clinical social work, counseling psychology, psychiatry, and clinical psychology, so you can begin deciding which branch of the mental health profession is the right fit for you.
If your high school has a psychology club, this will also help with college applications as well as continuing to familiarize you with the discipline.
While you can still get into many colleges with a lower GPA, you’re likely to have more prestigious options, which in turn will help with graduate school programs.;
, Most programs offer general psychology degrees without any kind of specialty until you get to graduate school. Ace your psychology courses and maintain your high GPA.


As an undergraduate psychology student, you can expect to study introductory courses, as well as courses heavy of statistical data and research methods. From there, you will additionally choose from upper-division courses that give you overviews of social, developmental, abnormal, and comparative psychology, which will help you in choosing a specific focus for graduate school.If your university offers any type of honors courses track in the psychology department, consider taking those as they’ll help distinguish your graduate school applications.
Your school may offer either a BA or a BS in psychology for undergraduates. Neither is more advantageous than the other when it comes to graduate school.The important thing is simply to do well.

, Check with your advising office or the psychology department to find out what opportunities are available for you. Since clinical psychology graduate programs are competitive, get as much experience under your belt as you can.

, This can go on your resume, and programs for clinical psychologists usually require that a resume be submitted with your application.

, The master’s degree level is where you are likely to begin seeing specialization come into play. If you already know the area you want to specialize in, look for programs that offer a degree in that specialization. You may seek out a program in developmental, environmental, counseling, or forensic psychology, for instance.You may choose to stay at the same school or find another one with a program you like better. Check all the admissions requirements and make sure you will meet them once you graduate. You should start your search about a year before you graduate with your undergraduate psychology degree.
Don’t fret if you decide to pursue a graduate program in clinical psychology after nearly completing (or even fully completing) an undergraduate degree in another field. Though all programs require an undergraduate degree, many only require one or possibly two semesters of introductory, research, and statistical courses in psychology.Though, a degree in psychology obviously doesn’t hurt to prove you’re serious about the discipline.
Apply to any programs that appeal to you. Since the programs are so competitive, you should apply to several to help your odds of being accepted to one. Submit everything that the school asks for by the deadline. You may have to take the Graduate Record Exam (GRE) before you can submit your application.
Studies have shown that students applying to doctoral programs who have already completed master’s degrees are more likely to finish, so many doctoral programs will consider you a more qualified candidate if you complete a master’s degree before applying., Collaborate with your professors throughout this time and start preparing your thesis well before you graduate.


For those who may be considering the jobs outlook for a master’s degree in psychology alone, be aware that American Psychological Association (APA) policy and all state licensing laws reserve the classification of “psychologist” for those who have completed a doctoral program.There are niches for master’s graduates in psychology. For instance, a Master’s in Industrial/Organizational Psychology, but this niche mostly relates to HR departments for large companies rather than work as a clinical or research psychologist., By this time, you will absolutely have a specialization in mind, and you’ll need to seek a program that relates to that specialization. This will also require a choice between a traditional Ph.D. program or one of the newer Psy.D. programs. Traditional programs are easier to find at public institutions but are highly competitive. Make sure the program is accredited by the APA, since this is often a requirement for state licensure.You will additionally have to look into whether the program leans more heavily toward clinical/counseling or research/academic in its methodologies.You may, for instance, find a program in abnormal psychology, which is your specialization, but the program may be focused on finding new methods to treat disorders (research work) whereas you are focused on treating those with disorders (clinical work) as your career path.


Whereas a Ph.D. will place an equal emphasis on research work as well as clinical work, a Psy.D. will place an increased emphasis on clinical work and less on research.Due to this, you should mostly consider a Psy.D. if your intention is to go into clinical practice such as counseling, designing treatment programs for institutions, etc. where you will work hands on to treat patients. A Ph.D. is still better suited to someone who wants to pursue research and academic work in the field of clinical psychology.As a side note, those graduating with a Psy.D. tend to score lower on the national licensing test, the Examination for Professional Practice of Psychology, than do those with a Ph.D.Your doctoral program will consist of even more specialized training depending on your focus. Based on your interest and specialization, you may work exhaustively in learning to treat specific conditions ranging from phobias to schizophrenia. You may specialize in post-traumatic stress disorders. You may also focus on the best methods for treating specific populations whether it be youths, couples or families, ethnic minority groups, or members of the LGBTQ community.Some programs may not transfer master’s-level coursework from any institution other than their own, so keep this in mind when deciding where to apply since certain programs may require repeating similar courses., You can expect to spend anywhere from five-to-seven years completing your doctoral degree, though there may be overlapping courses that transfer from your master’s work to decrease this total time.Doctoral candidates in the field of clinical psychology must usually write and defend a dissertation before completing their studies; however, select institutions that offer a Psy.D. may require a full-scale project such as designing a treatment program.Your program will also likely require a one-year internship in your specialization. APA-accredited institutions are required to provide student-to-internship placement information, so keep this in mind as well., Before you can even apply to a state board for licensing, you must complete two years of supervised, professional experience.Use this time to learn from your supervisor and hone your techniques. You will need to know how to do counseling, give psychological tests, perform assessments for mental disorders and help people in crises.

, In addition to an application and associated fees, some states may also require a test to obtain your license.


A review board will go over your application at length before granting you a license. The specific requirements are determined on a state-by-state basis, and you can find more information regarding your specific state here: Association of State and Provincial Psychology Boards


, If you're already working at a practice or research institution you're invested in and passionate about, then you can discuss a permanent position there. However, if you're interested in beginning your own private practice, then you can consult How to Start a Private Practice in Psychology for more information. Regardless, you are now a licensed clinical psychologist. Congratulations!

You can study for the PRAXIS II online, by reading study guides and purchasing a practice test.Sign up for the PRAXIS II by making an account.

, Check job boards, the National Association of School Psychologists (NASP) job career center, and the employment section of schools in your area. Email courteous requests for recommendations from your professors and those you worked for as an intern. Write a professional looking resume that includes your education, certifications, and work experience.

, Join one of the professional organizations dedicated to psychologists at schools or in the community. Two good choices are the National Association of School Psychologists or the American Psychological Association. Use these organizations to get to know other school psychologists in your area.


Visit the NASP website to make your NASP account, and the APA website to make your APA account.

, Read professional journals to stay up-to-date on issues and practices for school practice and psychological evaluations. Popular journals include The Journal of School Psychology, The School Psychology Review, and The School Psychology Quarterly. Depending on your state and school, you may be required to renew your certification, so staying current on issues in psychology is to your advantage.

Therefore, go beyond what you've learned in class, to find more facts about the concepts you are learning. Keep detailed notes, with the expectation that you will continue to refer back to these notes through the years. That means labeling them well, keeping them in one place, and highlighting or emphasizing the important points so that you can retrieve them with ease. A digital log will also be helpful for future retrieval of learned knowledge.;
, Writing down what you want to accomplish is great way to get motivated. Having a set of goals will give you an opportunity to reflect on your progress; this regular reflection lets you know what you need to improve on. It is only by facing the things you find most challenging that you'll gain more knowledge and improve your chances of academic success.


Get help from a range of sources, from your lecturers and tutors, to books, articles, the internet, and peers.

, A good way to approach your objective of academic excellence is through using the mastery-oriented achievement goal approach. This approach emphasizes the aim to learn the material because you want to. Ultimately, to go far enough to be a researcher and author in this field requires that you have a sincere passion for it.

, Study and learning will only occur through regular commitment to the tasks before you. Study for the test before you get on Netflix. Always do one, and then the other task, as multitasking does not work.

, You should already be more than aware from your psychology basics that we humans are social animals. By studying with others, you can share ideas, problem solve together and learn what it's like to interact with others, giving and taking in collaboration. This is a useful skill for the future. It's also a skill that will be helpful when tackling the occasional workplace situations where being able to convince others to open up and share their information can be a little trickier.


Learn to form an effective study group. Share new ideas and go over ideas that are not understood.

, You may have heard classmates say, ""I studied 10 hours for that test! All I got was a D!"". Well this is because there was poor metacognition on the student's part. Always make sure you know the material before you stop studying or reviewing. The rule of thumb here is if you can't teach the concepts to someone else, then you have not mastered the material and should keep studying.


Test yourself as you go. Do mini quizzes, online quizzes and book quizzes to see if you've understood the concepts, theories and facts well.

, Nobody can say that there will not be stress and five cups of coffee involved. Successful students learn how to deal with the stress so they can get back to work––remind yourself that stress management is a skill, one which you are excellently placed to learn all about. And when you're really pent up, exercise is the way to go.

, Join the local Psy-Chi club at your college or join an online organization with your particular field of study in psychology. Yes these do exist. This will help keep connected with people who you will be joining professionally and keep you updated with seminars occurring in your community.

, College is not forever––appreciate it while you can. This is the time to learn about yourself. Learn about psychology and join the exclusive club of people who had the honor to study psychology.

It may also give you more insight into the world of child psychology so you can determine if it's the right career path for you.


Look at the available degrees when searching for a university to attend. Some colleges offer more child psychology related majors.
Some of the best colleges to get your psychology degree include Stanford University, The University of Pennsylvania, Yale University, and The University of Michigan.;
, Once you obtain your bachelor's degree, you'll need to go for higher education to work as a child psychologist in the majority of circumstances.During your graduate or Ph.D. program, you'll have to concentrate on one of the four fields of child psychology which include clinical, developmental, school, and educational psychology. Determine which type of job you would want post-graduation and specialize in it.


Clinical child psychologists deal directly with the children and help assess, diagnose, and treat children with developmental or psychological disorders.
Developmental child psychologists work more towards a better understanding of child behavior in a research-based setting.
School psychologists deal with the mental health needs of children in a school or education setting. They determine child eligibility for government sponsored programs and help build curricula to suit the needs of children.
Education children psychologists work to improve the learning and teaching processes in schools. They suggest changes to classes and curriculum, so it can better suit the needs of children's psychological health., Your Master's degree in psychology or a related child psychology field will allow you to assist practicing child psychologists that have their Ph.D. Often, graduate level child psychologists will conduct research.Look for schools that have good programs for the type of child psychology you are looking to pursue. An undergraduate degree alone will not enable you to do advanced research or to treat and diagnose patients.Graduate courses include adolescent and young adult development, child development, and psychopathology in children.
Good graduate schools for child psychology include The University of Kansas and The University of Virginia Curry School of Education.Graduate school usually takes two to three years to complete.

, Getting your doctorate will take between four to six years on average and will enable you to start your own practice and directly diagnose and assess patients. You don't have to get your Masters degree before going for your Ph.D. If you know that you want to work directly with children, then it's recommended you get your doctorate. Some graduate level programs will combine your masters and Ph.D. program together.A Psy.D. is an applied clinical doctorate and is one of the highest levels of degrees for those in the psychology field., If you are getting your doctorate, undergoing a one-year internship while you study is typically required. This is usually followed by another year residency under supervision before you can attain your license to practice.During your practicum you may work for an in-house health department at your school or your local hospitals, clinics and research facilities., Different states differ on their requirements to become a licensed state child psychologist. For most states, you'll need to have your doctorate in child psychology and have hours of experience under supervision. Look up your state's website to find application forms and requirements.In Washington, you must have your doctoral degree and 750-hour residency and 300-hour practicum.In New York, you must have your doctorate from an accredited program as well as two years of full-time supervised experience., A Board certification from The American Board of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology will allow you to designate a specialization. It shows that you have the capability and competence to serve as a child psychologist.You can visit the official website for The American Board of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology and fill out the specialization and application forms to get started.


Being Board Certified will also make your skills more marketable., Once you have the proper licenses, certifications, and education to practice, you can start looking for jobs at different organizations. Some organizations that need child psychologists include, mental health clinics, legal organizations, hospitals, and research centers.Use online job boards to find jobs in your area.


Take your time and do research on each company to determine the best fit for you.

, Because you've already undergone your residency and internship or practicum period, there's a good chance you've already networked with people in the psychology or health fields. Reach out to old colleagues or bosses and let them know that you've completed your education and are ready to practice.


Often, if there's a position available, you will get precedence over someone who did not do their residency there.

, Once you've applied and gotten a callback, your potential employer will want you to come in for an interview. Make sure that you have a good demeanor, especially if you are going to be working in direct contact with children.


The hospital or organization you are working for will also be looking for additional skills and knowledge over the newest techniques in cognitive therapy and interpersonal psychotherapy., Typically you'll need years of practice in the industry before opening your own practice. In addition to being on the top of your field, you'll also need to understand the basic principles of business and marketing to make your practice stand out from the rest.Retain old patients and try to get new business through referrals and word-of-mouth.


Work with a business development consultant if you aren't business savvy or are not sure about the technical aspects of starting your own practice like billing and getting new customers.

Know about psychology's major perspectives.,
Realize that there are many specializations within the field of psychology.,
Learn more about a psychologist or area of psychology that interests you.",How to Attain a Basic Knowledge of Psychology," The word psychology is derived from the Greek words psyche, meaning ""mind"" and logos, meaning ""study"". Therefore, the word psychology itself literally means ""the study of the mind"". The actual definition of psychology is not too far off from that - psychology is commonly defined as ""the scientific study of behavior and mental processes"". This essentially means that psychology seeks to find out why people act and think the way we do.;
, The discipline of psychology is scientific because it relies on empirical testing - this means that psychologists rely on evidence, tests, and research in order to come to conclusions about our brains and behavior. Psychologists don't just rely on common sense or intuition when making claims about the ways people think and act - they observe behavior or come up with ways to scientifically test out their theories to see if they hold true. Even after research has been done, other psychologists will often replicate or re-create studies to ensure that the results of the initial study weren't just a fluke.

, Since psychology is a scientific discipline, it does not include any topics or methods that aren't supported by scientific evidence. Things that appear psychological but cannot be scientifically tested are referred to as pseudo-psychologies (meaning ""fake psychology""). Popular aspects of pseudo-psychology include palmistry, psychics and mediums, and astrology. Because there's no way to scientifically test whether or not these things exist, they cannot be included in the field of psychology.

, The roots of psychology go back to before 300 B.C. when philosophers like Aristotle and Plato discussed mental processes. However, psychology's major advances didn't begin until the 1800s, when Wilhelm Wundt opened the first psychology lab and some of the first schools of psychological thought began to be created. These schools of thought were called Structuralism, which focused on the contents (structures) of the mind, and Functionalism, which focused on how the mind works (its functions). Many current psychological perspectives are derived from these two initial schools of thought.

,

Although countless psychologists have made and continue to make contributions to the field, it's a good idea to start by reading about some of the most well-known psychologists, including:

Sigmund Freud: Founder of Psychoanalytic Theory, a controversial yet influential theory stating that people are motivated by their unconscious drives. Other prominent psychoanalysts include Carl Jung and Alfred Adler.
B.F. Skinner: Introduced the concept of operant conditioning, the notion that learning is related to consequences.
Ivan Pavlov: Known for his work on classical conditioning, a process of learning that involves pairing stimuli together to create a response.
Carl Rogers: Developed the person-centered approach, which led to the creation of client-centered therapy.
Abraham Maslow: Known for his hierarchy of needs, indicating the needs a person must satisfy in order to move on to the next level of needs and eventually reach self-actualization.
Jean Piaget: Known for his theory of cognitive development, which is about how children's minds develop.
Albert Bandura: Developed social learning theory, which is about how people learn by observing others.

, Currently, psychology is made up of seven major perspectives, which each emphasize a different aspect of learning about the brain and behavior. The seven perspectives are:


Psychodynamic perspective: derived from Freud's psychoanalytic perspective, and focuses on how traumatic childhood experiences and the unconscious drives affect one's development.
Behavioral perspective: Focuses on learned, observable behaviors. Skinner and Pavlov were behaviorists.
Cognitive perspective: focuses on mental processes such as language, perception, memory, and thinking. Piaget and Bandura were cognitive psychologists.
Humanistic perspective: focuses on human nature, including peoples' desire to grow and change in a positive way. Rogers and Maslow were humanists.
Biological perspective: focuses on biological aspects such as genetics, brain structure, and physiological processes.
Sociocultural perspective: focuses on the ways behavior differs across various cultures.
Evolutionary perspective: focuses on the ways natural selection, adaptation, and evolution have affected our behavior.

, When many people think of a psychologist, they picture someone taking notes while their client lies down on a couch and tells them about their problems. While this is what some psychologists do, it is important to note that psychology is a very diverse field with many specializations, including:


Biopsychology/Neuroscience: these psychologists examine the human brain and biological systems to learn about their influence on behavior.
Clinical psychology: these psychologists diagnose and help treat people with mental health issues or behavioral disorders.
Counseling psychology: these psychologists work with clients to help them use psychological techniques such as stress management and coping strategies to improve their everyday lives.
Developmental psychology: these psychologists study how humans develop over their lifespan, from birth through childhood and into adulthood.
Educational psychology: these psychologists study how people learn, and apply this knowledge to classroom and educational settings.
Forensic psychology: these psychologists work within the legal system to psychologically evaluate criminals and witnesses.
Health psychology: these psychologists study how human behaviour influences health, and what psychological strategies can be applied to improve health.
Industrial/Organizational psychology: these psychologists study office/workplace environments to figure out how to create a productive workplace and increase employee motivation and satisfaction.
Personality psychology: these psychologists study the personalities and individual differences between people, and how these influence their behaviour and thoughts.
Social psychology: these psychologists study the ways the in which environment or other people affect the way people think and behave.
Sport psychology: these psychologists work with athletes to figure out how to improve their athletic performance and recover from injury.

Understand the basics of establishing positive reinforcement.,
to getting yourself to eat more fruit.,
Recognize appetitive stimulus.,
Distinguish when appetitive stimulus is given.,
Recognize negative reinforcement.,
Understand the role of punishment.,
Recognize the advantages of positive reinforcement.,
Understand how to employ positive reinforcement.",How to Understand Positive Reinforcement," Similar to a reward (although more precise than a reward), a positive reinforcement is something a human or an animal will put in effort to receive. You can identify a positive reinforcement when three conditions have been met:A consequence is presented dependent on behavior.
The behavior becomes more likely to occur.
The behavior becomes more likely to occur because and only because the consequence is presented dependent on the behavior.;
,]]Be aware that positive reinforcement occurs in the daily life of humans and animals. Positive reinforcement isn't just for animal training––you train yourself and others every day in the methods of positive reinforcement, even without conscious input. For example, when you give a child a piece of candy for good behavior or scold your spouse for forgetting to buy milk at the grocery store, you're training (or attempting to train) a behavior. Positive reinforcement can be more pleasant and effective than other training methods.


If you're trying to improve your ability to play tennis, you can use positive reinforcement. Try giving yourself a pat on the back whenever you're playing well, and telling yourself ""Ah well, I'll try again"" when you don't.






If you're trying to make your daughter call more often, stop complaining about it and make the times that your daughter does call enjoyable. Talk about your daughter's interests, and plan something fun like shopping if you can.







, This is a positive outcome; for example, being thanked after giving a person a gift. The opposite of appetitive stimulus is aversive stimulus, which is a negative outcome; for example, a teenager being grounded after disobeying her parents. Skinner states that appetitive stimulus is more powerful than aversive stimulus; in other words, you're more likely to receive expensive gifts if you reward the giver for giving you presents, rather than reprimanding him for not buying you a more expensive one.

, This is positive reinforcement: when a dog is given a treat after performing a trick, the treat is an appetitive stimulus and the dog is being trained using positive reinforcement. You can define positive reinforcement as Pryor did, as ""anything which, occurring in conjunction with an act, tends to increase the probability that the act will occur again,"" or simply as a positive reaction to a behavior.

, Negative reinforcement is a complicated subject, but generally this aspect is recognized as aversive stimulus being given and then retracted once the desired behavior as occurred. A horse, for example, is trained to move forward using negative reinforcement: it is nudged, kicked, spurred, etc. until the horse moves forward, at which point the aversive stimulus immediately ceases. The horse moving forward is the behavior; negative reinforcement, in this scenario, has been used with success.

, There are two basic forms of punishment: positive punishment and negative punishment:



Positive punishment is adding an aversive stimulus to end or decrease a behavior. An example of this would be yelling at Karen Pryor because you don't like her book. The yelling is aversive stimulus, which you are using to end the behavior of selling her book: you are using positive punishment to attempt to train Pryor.







Negative punishment is the taking away of an appetitive stimulus to change, create, or end a behavior; for example, grounding a child. Spending time with friends out of school is an appetitive stimulus that the parent is removing via grounding the child - the parent is using negative punishment.







, Positive reinforcement training is based on a positive experience - receiving appetitive stimulus, or in other words, rewards. Whether you're trying to teach your dog to sit or yourself to start exercising, positive reinforcement is a powerful - and enjoyable - tool. Training using positive reinforcement is more fun, and often more effective, than training using a more traditional punishment-based system.


However, realize that punishment has its own advantages. Positive punishment is necessary in situations such as a child playing with a sharp object, or a dog growling at a passerby: the behavior must be stopped now, and positive punishment will be very effective. Negative punishment is also more appropriate in certain situations, as is negative reinforcement.







, As described above, positive reinforcement is very useful in achieving a variety of goals, but there are a few basic rules for using it:



Correct timing: Positive reinforcement is only effective when used exactly when the behavior occurs - a dog being trained to sit must be in the sit position when the treat is given. If the treat is given once the dog is standing up, he is being rewarded for standing up; if you tell your spouse (s)he looked gorgeous last night, the reward is equally late and ineffective. Rewarding too early is ineffective as well: for example, if you're crate training a dog, attempting to entice the dog in with a treat and letting him eat it before he enters the crate is bribing the dog, not training the dog.







Correct rewards: Rewards should be as small as possible: give a child an M&M, not an ice cream sundae. They should be unpredictable - lottery machines, for example, create addictions by using an unpredictable schedule of reinforcement: even if all they're winning is quarters, dimes, and ten-dollar bills, many people have been effectively trained by the lottery machine to continue playing for the thrill of a win. Giving a reward for nothing can also be effective in minimum amounts, as is giving a ""jackpot,"" or especially large, reward.







High enthusiasm: Positive reinforcement depends on the trainee remaining enthusiastic and happy. No matter if you're teaching a child to read or a dog to heel, remember to keep training sessions frequent and short, keep goals easily achievable so rewards are often given, stop and take a break if you're getting stressed or frustrated, and end on a high note.







Consistency: If you reward a dog for sitting, and then don't the next time it sits, you are not being consistent enough. However, if you give a Milk Bone once and a slice of a hot dog the next time, you are being consistent enough - to be consistent enough, you will simply have to choose your criteria and stick with it, until the behavior is good enough to up the ante. An example would be if you were training a parrot to step up:






Your original criteria would be to have the bird stay calm while your finger is in the cage. You reward the parrot with a treat every time it remains calm.
Now you up the ante by making your criteria to have the parrot stay calm while your finger is close to him. You reward the parrot with a treat every time it remains calm. You're making the criteria harder, but still staying consistent by rewarding the parrot; you continue training in this manner.

The death of Caesar Many is an important turning point in Western Civilization, bringing in an era of emperors and forever away from a Republic.
The Ides of March also marks the first day of the Roman new year and the first day of spring in the Roman calendar.
People have been studying the controversies, intrigue, and drama of this event for almost a thousand years. William Shakespeare wrote an entire play about this.;
, It is not an easy read, however, so often it helps to discuss in a literary group. Even better, visit a live stage production However, this work was never meant to be read, rather it is supposed to be performed. Think about what lessons can be learned from this play.

, They are The First Man in Rome, The Grass Crown, Fortune's Favourites, Caesar's Women, Caesar, The October Horse and Antony and Cleopatra.

, Assassin is a word with fascinating origins. First used in the 1520's , the word is believed to be derived from a secret society called the Hashshashin, a group that was said to have murdered others., There are actually many versions of ""assassination games"" and many feature made-up rules specific to the people or the organization (like a school). Most rules tend to center about how people can be ""safe"". (Such as not in class, or during an assembly). But it is a fun if somewhat paranoid way to play out how assassination attempts affects the way one interacts in the world., Romans wore a variety of clothing but the toga is perhaps the best known and the tunic is the easiest to make.Be aware that ""toga parties"" were originally revived by college party-goers in the mid-20th century and had a rather racy and sexual connotation to it. (Watch the movie ""Animal House"" and that is not too far off). Collegiate toga parties done off-campus are typically not students soberly talking about the finer points of the works of Ovid.
Wearing toga made out of bedsheets in your parochial school's Latin class with modest-protecting garments underneath is, of course, different.

, Serve with some apples, figs and grapes.


Try a selection of Italian food--but no pasta. Not everything at your grocery store may be absolutely authentic to 44 B.C., but olives, cheese, grapes, bread, asparagus, broccoli, pears, nuts, apples and various Italian-style deli meats is a delicious and healthy repast. Pasta did not come to Italy until well into the Middle Ages.
Serve French Toast. According to Apicius, one of the first known authors of a cookbook, Romans enjoyed what we call French Toast as a dessert...with honey.

, The Romans enjoyed their wine, so this is a good excuse for a glass or two on the Ides of March. But they (and Greeks too) usually didn't drink pure wine, but mingled it with water., If you've been thinking about visiting Rome and Italy, maybe the Ides of March is a perfect day to make that booking.

, Best to start with Caesar-related stuff like the famous ""Et tu, Brute"", ""Alea iacta est"" et cetera. Or maybe you'll even impress your friends by learning a piece of Caesars ""De bello Gallico"" by heart? (Gallia est omnis divisa in partes tres...)

, If you are good at telling stories, entertain people with anecdotes of Caesar's life.

If you want a good job (and to be good at your job), you need to work hard and go to a good university. In order to go to a good university, you need to get good grades in high school. See the logic?


If your school offers psychology courses, take them! That includes AP Psych, too. The earlier you feel out this topic, the better. Sociology and other like courses certainly won't hurt, either.;
, If you're in high school now, odds are your interests will shift as you age. However, if you feel like you have a good grasp on where you want to go in life, the best time to start is now. Wherever you see yourself working and whoever you see yourself working with, try to gain experience working with them.


This could be in the form of volunteering at your local hospital, women's shelter, or with a business that has a large team. Not only will this make applying to colleges easier, but the more people you know now, the more people you can ask for favours later!

, He can tell you about the different routes to the degree you want and the different possible work environments ahead of you. The counsellor can tell you what route leads to the job outcome you have in mind.


What's more, they'll be able to get you information on prospective study programs. They'll know which schools have the best programs for the type of psychology you're interested in. And they'll get you started on scholarships and financial aid when the time comes.

, There are many sub-specialties to consider. When people say ""I want to be psychologist,"" general they're thinking of clinical psychology -- where you sit down with one or two people and hack away at the subconscious. However, there are a bunch of different branches and all are worth exploring early on:


Organizational and industrial psychology: the study of human psychology in industrial work environments and large organizations.
Clinical psychology: the study of human psychology in clinical settings like hospitals and mental heath facilities, including psychotherapy.
Cognitive psychology: the study of internal thought processes such as problem-solving, memory, perception, and speech.
Neuropsychology: the study of the brain and larger nervous system and how they contribute to human psychology and behaviour.

, The easiest path is to find a college that has a decent program for obtaining a bachelor's in psychology. Check to see that they offer the branch you're interested in (if you've narrowed it down) and what kind of work they require toward the end -- some may offer programs that are more akin to grad programs (theses and what not) while others may be a little less intensive.


It is technically possible to jump into a Master's program, if your school offers it, too. However, this requires being super certain of what you're getting into. Getting a BA in psychology allows you to tackle education 4 years at a time -- a Master's is all that work and more, with a couple more years tacked on.

, Working as a psychologist requires an advanced degree, but first you need a bachelor's degree. You don't have to major in psychology, but it should be a degree that is at least associated with the field of psychology. Here are a few relevant alternatives:



Human development. This studies the path from infancy to adulthood.

Sociology. This field studies how the human subject behaves in social groups.

Anatomy/physiology. This is a good bachelor's degree to get if you are interested primarily in cognitive psychology and how the brain functions.

Chemistry. This kind of study is more appropriate for cognitive psychology than clinical psychology, as it focuses on the science behind human behaviour and not the behaviour itself.

, Many college psychology departments engage in their own psychological research. Students participate as research subjects and as assistant researchers. Research experience is vital for being accepted into a graduate program.


This step is more for your junior or senior year in college. In your courses, it won't be uncommon for your TA or professor to announce that so-and-so is looking for a research assistant. If you have a 3.5 or higher and blah blah blah, you can apply with Professor Zimbardo during her office hours at...you get it. When the time rolls around, jump on it. You'll need it later.

, If you started out your freshman year with your psych major, you may find that you have extra time to dedicate to your focus or even a second major. What's more, it makes good sense, too.


With a focus or minor you can start thinking about the rest of your career. A minor in gender studies could lead to a research project on women, solidifying your experiences and making the application process for grad school that much easier.
A double major is a great idea -- especially if it's a bit more...practical than psychology. The cruelties of the liberal arts world are many and you may find that having a second major in business or marketing will better serve your wallet in the future!

, Many undergrad degrees will let you get away with a BA in psychology without affiliating yourself with any research. If you can avoid this, do so. You by no means have to spit out tomes of experimental glory, but do try to rub noses with a professor or two that lets you churn the data or punch some numbers.


That's what summers are for, folks. When that three months of nothing to do rolls around, stay on campus. Talk to a couple of your TAs or professors, show them how eager you are, and see what they can come up with. Odds are they'll love seeing a new kid as thrilled about psychology as you.

, Here's something that school you're paying $30,000 a year to go to won't tell you: a BA in psychology is code for skimming the foam off picky latte drinkers' orders. While Starbucks does have a pretty good employee package, it's probably not exactly what you had in mind. To grad school you go!


Let's get even more real: to be a straight up, legit psychologist like the one you probably have in your head, that means a PhD. While a master's is all well and good and will open a few doors, a PhD will open the doors down the entire hallway. A master's may entitle you to use the adjective (""psychological assistant""), while a PhD lets you use the noun (""group psychologist"").

, A lot of people aren't crystal clear on the differences between a psychiatrist and a psychologist. A psychologist does not attend medical school and therefore cannot disburse medication. If you want to be a psychiatrist (someone who can prescribe), you'll need to train to be a physician.


If this is the path you want to take, instead of the GRE, you'll need to take the MCAT. Going to med school is a completely different path than going to grad school. Which speaks to you?

, To go to grad school, you'll need to take the GRE. It's best to take it in the fall before the application deadlines in the winter/spring. And the better you do, the more (and better) schools you'll be accepted into. Start studying months before you take the test!


Your GRE scores may help you determine between an MA and a PhD. If you don't get stellar GRE scores, try again. Most PhD programs are looking for a good score (master's programs may be less intense).
Your GRE scores are good for up to 5 years. If you're not sure what life will throw at you next year, you can still take it and apply to schools in the coming years.

, In general, you'll find four types of programs at the grad level: I/O, Clinical, Counselling, and Experimental. Knowing which type you want to focus on and pursue will determine what college you go to and the path you take.


I/O stands for Industrial/Organizational. This involves working with corporations or organizations; in the end, you'll work for a business and focus on morale and HR-like activities.
Clinical is what most people picture when they hear ""psychologist."" Your therapist/shrink studied clinical psychology.
Counselling is similar to clinical, but you'll probably end up working in a school or government setting (like prison!). This is not the way to go if you want to end up with a private practice.
Experimental psychology is more research based and focuses on -- you guessed it -- experiments. Though it can involve different branches, it concentrates on applying theories and methods, working out kinks and discovering new ideas.

, Psychology is a huge field -- even after you've chosen a branch (Clinical, for example), you need to zero in on a focus within that branch. Focusing on one sub-category will determine where and how you will work as a psychologist after graduation.


There are so many options (educational psychology, rehabilitation psychology, environmental psychology, psychology and the law, trauma psychology, forensic psychology, cross-cultural psychology, etc.) that if we listed them all, you'd be here all day. Hopefully your undergrad program exposed you to a bunch of them -- which one fascinated you most?

, A Master's takes much less time and money, but it may result in a smaller pay-check and fewer job possibilities. You may also find that it's difficult to jump schools from a Master's to a PhD if you decide to pursue further education in the future. Sit down for yourself for a minute and consider the following:


Master's programs take two-three years to complete, with the last year being an internship where you accumulate hours in the field. A Master's program generally will prepare you to work as a marriage and family counsellor, as an industrial psychologist or as a school psychologist.Doctoral programs take six to seven years (depending on how you do it, it could also take much longer), including a year-long intern-ship. A doctoral program prepares you for working as a psychologist in a hospital, clinic, or some other kind of institutional setting.

Realize that there are several different doctoral degrees, including the PsyD program (less common, less research-based; 5 years to complete). Also realize that many doctoral programs provide financial support to students, who, typically, do work for the university as teaching assistants and research assistants. Master's programs typically do not provide this kind of financial support.
Let your interests determine this. If you want to have a private practice, go the PhD route. If you want to be a school psychologist, get your Master's.



, It's pretty clear that there are a variety of options when it comes to your future as a psychologist. Because of this, every school varies and has its strengths and weaknesses. If you want to work as an Industrial psychologist with an emphasis on cross-cultural work environments and diversity, make sure your school has a good program on that specific aspect of psychology!


Most schools will have a focus themselves -- one will be a good clinical school while another will be a good experimental school. Make sure this matches with your aspirations!
It's also very important that your school matches your philosophical orientation. If you are a fierce proponent of Psychoanalysis, you may not be happy attending a school that's highly Humanistic. What school of thought do you fall into?

, Going to grad school for years on end will rack up a hefty fee when all is said and done. Before you find yourself staring at piles and piles of loans, look for grants and scholarships. The less you have to pay to make money, the better!


Hopefully your school will offer you some type of reduced tuition assistance either in the form of being a TA or working at an associated hospital or other organization. This will lessen your budgeting woes, but also makes it hard to keep down another job while studying. It's best to have all your financial ducks in a row before you get in too deep.

, While you're wiling away the hours studying, it'll be helpful to have sympathy nearby. The Psi Chi club will offer you a plethora of resources in addition to moral support. This may help you land a job after you have graduated, too.


Basically, the more people you know, the better you'll be off. Odds are the Psi Chi club is in good with a handful of professors and right now that's your bread and butter.

, Your school will probably help you out with this as it may be required for graduation (at least for the PhD candidates). Full-time, supervised training will be the best experience you get before you go on the job yourself!


Generally this will be the last year of your academic work. It's really a job -- you'll be doing it full-time and getting paid (or at least getting tuition free!). You're almost there!
For PsyD candidates, this is pretty much the end of the line!, If your program requires it, completing your dissertation is the last step to becoming a full-fledged psychiatrist (well, apart from licensure). This can be done before, during, or after your internship, depending on your program.


If you complete all the coursework but have yet to do your dissertation, you are what they call ABD -- ""all but dissertation."" Clearly if there's an acronym for it, it's a common thing.

, Believe it or not, there is still more to learn even after graduating with your PhD. A one-year post-doctoral appointment at a university can help you land a prestigious job. However, plenty of grads do not go this route. It's there if you want to become world renowned, though!


Some grads won't need a post-doc. However, if you do one, it can count as credit for your licensure.Just know your state requirements so you can structure it around them!

, In many states, you need a year or two of supervised practice to get your license (if you need it at all). You'll be doing work at a hospital or university under the guidance of a seasoned pro. Many states require hundreds or even thousands of hours of work to become licensed.


Luckily, the past few years have set you up for this moment. You should be familiar with an organization or two that has a role you can fill -- or utilize one of the many professors you've worked with to get your foot in the door somewhere!

, And you thought the paperwork was over after grad school! Nope! You'll need to take the EPPP (Examination for Professional Practice in Psychology), create a dossier of all your work, and nail down all your supervised work hours. The requirements vary by state, so do the research on yours. It can vary widely, too -- California only requires 3,000 hours while Michigan requires 6,000.You're probably looking at $1,000 or so in fees when it comes to getting licensed. You'll be buying study books, applying, and covering exam fees.
Some states have an oral test, too, while others only have a jurisprudence exam.Many countries have their own licensing protocols that you might not have learned about in graduate school. More information can be found on web sites like The American Psychological Association for more on how to acquire a license.



, Now that you have all the credentials behind you, it's time to work on your own! Congratulations. You can work unaided pretty much anywhere and for anyone. Your only limit is where you're willing to commute!


Many psychologists end up opening their own private practice, at least once they've established a niche in their chosen community. This means you'll become self-employed. If this is a dream of yours, start the networking now!

, You can then attend national and regional conferences and have access to all their online resources. That's way better than being a gold member at Starbucks.


The APA boasts over 15,000 early-career psychologists.They're all networking and learning with and through each other. If you need your next job, you know who to ask!

, Once you have your degree, the best way to get the job you want is to be willing to move to the area where the jobs are. Psychologists are needed everywhere, but in today's economy, the best job may not be where you are. Especially in your early years, it will be very beneficial if you're willing to move.


Make sure your license is good for the state you're moving to! Lord knows you don't want to take the EPPP again!
The amount psychologists get paid varies greatly by area. If you live in a small town full of blue collar workers you won't be able to charge as much as you would if you lived in an upper-class suburb. Though the living expense should also be taken into account, where you set yourself up may be a large factor in your overall income.

, Once you're a verified psychologist, you'll need to keep practicing and attend the occasional seminar to satisfy the powers that be and keep your license (in addition to reapplying every so often). Each state is different, so make sure you familiarize yourself with the laws in yours.


It's also important to stay on the cutting edge of the field. You don't want to be telling everyone and their brother about hypotheses that have been recently outdated. Keep reading, attending lectures, and educating yourself!

Focus on the individual.",How to Be a QMRP,"


For a more informative guideline on being a QMRP a person must study and review the section known as “Facility Practices” found under W159. Providers know W159 as “The Q Tag” and as you will see by the guidelines, it is definitely “The Q Tag”.
The first requirement under the guidelines is that the facility has a QMRP assigned to the individuals served. This is met at the basic level with W180 and W160. The QMRP must then function in the capacity that is further indicated by the standards.
The QMRP must observe individuals, review data and progress, and revise programs based on individual needs and performance. This indicates that the QMRP must “know” the residents that he or she serves. It is not enough to know names, ages, and statistics, rather the QMRP must know the person. For example, can the person cook, or does the person want to learn to cook can be very basic questions that the QMRP should have a basic knowledge about. Only through direct observations can the QMRP learn about the individual. During those observations, the QMRP must take time to talk with the individuals and develop a complete understanding pertaining to the individual’s hopes, dreams, desires, etc. Once the QMRP knows the individual, he or she can assist the individual in finding areas the individual desires to improve.
The overall improvement of the individual’s participation in society and life was the primary driving force behind the ICF/MR concept. The ICF’s were designed to remove people from institutional settings or environments where they learned very little about living in society, and place them in a home where they could learn to be a part of society. In the ICF, we are constantly seeking a way to help the individuals “move up” or “move on” into a less restrictive environment. The fundamental way this goal is accomplished is through reviewing data and progress and revising programs as needed. Programs are simply the IPP's of the individual served. These IPP’s must focus on four basic areas and other areas as identified by the individual served and his or her ID Team.
An IPP must focus on money management skills, adaptive equipment skills, independent living skills, and self-medication skills. These four areas are seen by federal guidelines as the basic areas needed to live in less restrictive environments. For example, without the ability to manage money, you can not pay your basic bills, buy food, or pay for shelter and transportation. Without the ability to take care of adaptive equipment, you can not care for glasses, dentures, wheelchairs, etc on your own. Independent living skills covers a range of areas such as cooking, cleaning, laundry, vocational, etc. Finally, a self-medication skill is simply the focus on the ability to administer your own medications. This could be something as simple as taking a Tylenol for a headache, to as advanced as taking a psychotropic medications four times per day. The basic IPP must ensure these areas re met.
The QMRP’s role with the IPP must be to review data collected by the staff. This review should indicate progress, lack of progress, or changes needed to assist in progress. As part of this review, the QMRP may find that progress is occurring and that the individual has mastered a particular area. It would be the QMRP’s duty at this point to move the person on to the next targeted objective area. For example, the person served may be able to brush his or her teeth with two verbal prompts. The next objective may indicated that one verbal prompt should be used, and the QMRP would issue new data with the one verbal prompt as indicated. On the same accord, the person may have no progress and the data may need to be modified to assist progress. In the case of two verbal prompts to brush teeth, the goal may have to be revised to allow three verbal prompts. The QMRP may move the person up to the next objective when the goal has been mastered without ID Team intervention. However, should there be a lack of progress, the person almost masters the goal, or changes are needed to assist in progress, then the QMRP must initiate an Interim Staffing. The Interim Staffing would then determine the next action with the IDTeam’s input. Generally, the QMRP writes the Interim Staffing with suggested changes or modifications, sends it to the IDTeam for review and signatures. Should the IDTeam disagree with the QMRP’s recommendations, then other recommendations may be submitted with the individual’s served approval.
The next guideline for the QMRP found in W159 is that the QMRP must ensure “consistency among external and internal programs and disciplines.” The QMRP must “coordinate” the program to ensure consistency. While day programs and evening programs are a part of this equation, there is also the factor of physician recommendations, dietician recommendations, social worker recommendations, etc. For example, a dietician may recommend a reduced fat diet for a person. The physician must sign off an order for that diet. Generally, the LVN would take the recommendation to the physician and obtain the order for the diet change. It is the QMRP’s responsibility to ensure this action is taken. A QMRP may simply review the dietician’s recommendation and compare it to the physician’s order, or the QMRP may direct each portion of the equation (i.e. inform the nurse to obtain the order, etc). As the progress in the consistency occurs, the QMRP is responsible for ensuring IDTeam members are aware of the changes. It is most important that the individual served is aware of the changes. The QMRP must also ensure the consistency among all programs. In the case of the diet change, the staff working with the person at the home should be trained, if the person attends an outside program (i.e. school, work center, etc) that program must be informed of the diet change, family members should be informed. Once again, the QMRP must then monitor and observe to ensure consistency occurs in the external and internal programs as designed.
The QMRP must next ensure that “service design and delivery” provides each individual with “an appropriate active treatment program.” The only way for the QMRP to do this is to know the individuals that he or she serves. Let’s say that Johnny X has been assigned to QMRP A. QMRP A gives Johnny X several goals in the annual staffing. One of these goals requires that Johnny X write out a check each week for his own personal spending money. QMRP A has the IDTeam’s approval to do this goal. The only problem is that the assessments show that Johnny X can not write, does not know his numbers, does not know the months and days of the year, and can not sign his own name (not even a mark for his name). QMRP A has started Johnny X on a goal that he can never master because he has not mastered the first requirement for this goal, being able to write. In this case, the design and delivery of the active treatment program is not appropriate for Johnny X. QMRP A would need to read all assessments, observe Johnny X and learn about him prior to suggesting or entertaining suggestions pertaining to Johnny X writing his weekly spending money check. If QMRP A knows Johnny X, then he will have an appropriate active treatment program. In this case, it may be more appropriate (depending on assessments and observations) for Johnny X to start out by learning to write his name.
The QMRP must also ensure “that any discrepancies or conflicts between programmatic, medical, dietary, and vocational aspects of the individual’s assessment and program are resolved.” This statement covers a wide variety of possible problems. A basic problem could be that the physician has written a physician’s order with the person’s disability being described as Mild MR, and the psychologist has suggested that the person has a disability of Moderate MR. The QMRP would need to ensure this discrepancy was resolved. As stated before, this statement covers a wide variety of various problems, but the QMRP is the chief person that must ensure they are resolved.
Another area noted in the “Facility Practices” section under W159 is that the QMRP “ensures a follow-up to recommendations for services, equipment or programs.” Basically, if recommendations are made, the QMRP must ensure there is a follow up to that recommendation. It may be that the IDTeam has an Interim Staffing and it is determined the person does not need or want the recommendation. On the other hand, the IDTeam may determine that the person does need or want the recommendation. Some basic examples of this might be recommendations for glasses, physical therapy exercises, speech therapy, wheelchairs, etc. The QMRP must ensure that any recommendations have appropriate follow-up.
The QMRP must also ensure “that adequate environmental supports and assistive devices are present to promote independence.” Environmental supports could be staff in the home to assist the individual in learning to iron, cook, clean, etc. It could also be the van for transportation, a fire alarm system for protection, etc. Assistive devices might be adaptive eating utensils, wheelchairs for mobility, glasses, hearing aides. The QMRP must ensure that these areas of supports are addressed and present as needed to assist in greater independence for the individual served.
There are several important suggestions under the “Guidelines” section of W159. In the first paragraph alone, the most important statement made is likely: “The paramount importance of having persons competent to judge and supervise active treatment issues cannot be overstated.” Simply put the QMRP must know the persons they serve and supervise the implementation of active treatment in that person’s life. This requires reading assessments, behavior reports, incident reports, physician and other reports, observing the person, talking with staff, and most importantly talking with the individual. The QMRP cannot be “competent to judge and supervise active treatment” unless he or she is familiar with the person served.
The ultimate role of the QMRP is to ensure adequate active treatment is provided to the person served in an ICF/MR setting. To provide adequate active treatment, the QMRP must know the person served as indicated above. Evergreen takes the word “adequate” out of the equation and requires that a QMRP provide “excellent” active treatment to the person served. Because of this requirement, it cannot be overstated that the QMRP must be knowledgeable about the person served. This, as stated, requires the QMRP to observe, review reports and assessments, listen to the individual his staff and others involved (i.e. family, physicians, nurses, social workers, dieticians, etc) and to make competent and informed recommendations to the IDTeam in the person’s served best interest.;
,, This will come from listening closely to people you meet, and reading essays by people with disabilities. Find out what types of services and treatments people with IDD want most.


Learn from people with disabilities themselves about how to be respectful towards them. It is crucial for professionals to treat them with dignity and listen closely to what they want.
Different IDD communities (notably the autistic community) have various presences online. They may talk in detail about their priorities.
Listening to a parent or therapist is not the same thing as listening to a disabled person. Sometimes you may even have to fight parents or therapist to protect the disabled person's wishes and best interests.

, Assume that the disabled person can hear what you say (even if they don't signal that they can understand), and that they want to do their best to adapt. Respecting them and believing in them sends a clear positive attitude that can help motivate them and those around them to do their best.


It is not appropriate to give a 15-year-old tasks that are designed for a 3-year-old.

, IDDs are lifelong, and pushing someone to suppress things usually does not end well. Reassure family members and therapists that the person can live happily while being disabled.


For example, instead of eliminating harmless stimming through ABA, time might be better spent on sensory integration therapy or assertiveness training.
Look for ways to accommodate and assist them, rather than trying to hide the disability.

, Every person with a disability is different, and deserves to be treated as an individual. What are their specific needs and goals? What support do they (and their family) want?

Leave the hook at the top of the wire intact, so you can use it to hang your wreath.While you can usually bend the wire easily with your hands, it helps to have a pair of pliers on hand in case you have trouble. In particular, you may want to use it to bend the hook into a circle for easier hanging.;
, To create a surface for the form, you’ll need 1 small piece of pipe insulation that’s approximately 3-feet (91-cm) long. Use a pair of scissors to cut the insulation in half so you have two pieces.Be sure to use insulation that comes with adhesive along the seams so you can seal it over the wire form.
If you use a larger piece of insulation, you may need to trim it further to fit each side of the wire heart.
If you have pipe insulation scraps around the house, you can fit together multiple smaller pieces for each side of the heart. Just use tape to secure the seams between the pieces.

, Take one piece of the insulation and open it along the seam to fit around the first side of the heart. Make sure that the seam is facing outward, and remove the adhesive strip to secure the insulation on the wire.If the insulation is too long to fit around the side of the heart, trim it with the scissors so it ends at the points at the top and bottom of the heart.
If the insulation doesn’t have adhesive on it already, you use a glue gun to close the seam.
Don’t worry if the ends of the insulation won’t fit perfectly yet. You’ll cut them later to fit securely.

, Take the other piece of pipe insulation, and wrap it around the other side of the wire heart with the seam facing outward. Secure the insulation around the heart by removing the adhesive strip just as you did on the other side.Just as with the other side, trim the insulation if it’s too long to fit around the one side.

, For the foam insulation to fit neatly around the heart, you’ll need to cut the ends of both pieces at the bottom and top points of the heart. Use a pair of scissors to cut the foam at 45 degree angle so the pieces on either side fit together., To ensure that the insulation stays on the wire heart at the top and bottom, you need to secure it. Use several pieces of duct tape to secure the two pieces of insulation together at the top and bottom.While you can use plain gray or black duct tape, it helps to use the same color as the fabric you’re using to cover the heart. That helps camouflage the tape in case any peeks through after you’ve decorated the wreath.

, To cover the heart wreath, you’ll need 1 yard (91-cm) of felt off the bolt in your choice of color that’s cut into small circles. The circles should be approximately 2- to 3-inches (5- to 8-cm) in diameter, so use a cup or glass as a to trace a circle on a piece of cardboard to serve as a template.You can also use a metal biscuit cutter to create your template.
Red felt offers the most traditional look for your heart wreath, but you can use any color that fits your decor or occasion.
You may prefer to use felt in two or more different colors and alternate the ruffles as you add them to the wreath. For example, if you want to make a heart wreath for Valentine’s Day, use red, white, and pink felt. For Christmas, use red and green.
For the best looking wreath, look for felt fabric that has a velvety texture.

, Using your template, cut the felt into circles with a pair of scissors. You should wind up with approximately 7 to 8 dozen fabric circles when you’re done, depending on how large you made them.You can also use a scrapbook paper cutting tool that makes circles to cut the fabric.

, After you’ve cut all of the felt into circles, fold them in half. Fold the circles in half a second time, and push a straight pin through the bottom of the circles to secure them.To disguise the pins when they’re in the wreath, it’s best to use straight pins with a head that’s the same color as the felt.

, When you’ve folded and secured all of the felt circles, start pushing the pins into the foam on the heart to arrange them on the heart. Continue working until the entire heart is covered and there are no gaps.If you plan on hanging the wreath flat against a wall or door, there’s no need to cover the back with the felt pieces. Just focus on the front and sides.

, When you’ve covered the entire heart with the felt pieces, use the hook at the top of the wreath to hang the wreath from a hook, nail, or pushpin. If you want to add an extra decorative look to the wreath, tie a piece of ribbon that coordinates with the felt you used in a bow around the hook.If you make a red or pink heart wreath, it’s an ideal Valentine’s Day decoration. However, you can use felt in a shade that matches your decor for a year-round decoration.

, To make a floral heart wreath, it’s best to use artificial flowers that will last indefinitely. Cut off the stems from the flowers so you’re only working with the blooms. Add a small amount of hot glue to the back of the flowers and apply them to the foam heart until you cover the entire wreath.The amount of silk flowers that you’ll need depends on how large the blooms are. In most cases, you’ll be able to cover the wreath with approximately 100 blooms.
You can use all the same type and color of faux flower or use a variety to create a more interesting wreath.
Consider creating a gradient effect for the wreath with the silk flowers. Gather blooms that are all variations of the same color, and arrange them on the wreath from lightest to darkest. For example, you might use all pink flowers, and place the baby pink blooms at the bottom, the rose colored blooms in the middle, and the hot pink flowers at the top.

, Decorative pom poms come in a variety of colors and sizes, so they make an ideal covering for a heart wreath. Apply a small dab of hot glue to the foam insulation and press a pom pom over it. Continue working until you cover the entire heart.The number of pom poms that you’ll need to cover the wreath depends on how large the pom poms you’re using are. In most cases, you’ll need approximately 10 to 12 bags of pom poms.
You can use pom poms in a single color and/or size, or alternate shades and sizes to give the wreath more visual interest.

, If you want your heart wreath to have added shine, cover it with sequin trim from the fabric store. The trim is usually stretchy, so you can easily fit it over the foam heart. Apply hot glue to the foam, and wrap the sequin trim around the heart, pulling tight so it rests neatly. Continue working until you cover the entire wreath.You’ll like need to cut the sequin trim to fit the wreath. Use two pieces that are long enough to cover each side so you can hide the edges at the points at the top and bottom of the heart.
Arrange the pieces of trim so the seams are on the underside of the wreath.
Sequin trim comes in a variety of colors, so you can create the wreath in any shade that you like.

These can include candy hearts, a box of chocolates, or a Valentine’s card. However, make sure that it is something that the recipient likes. Do not send them candy hearts if they do not like them.For example, if your recipient is a fan of chocolate, be sure to include some chocolate hearts or a heart-shaped box of chocolates.
Although real flowers will likely wilt in transit, you could send some fake flowers. This might be a clever and funny way to send a traditional Valentine’s Day gift.;
, One of the perks of personally sending a Valentine’s Day care package is that you get to include a personalized note. If the package is for a romantic partner, this gives you the opportunity to write a romantic letter. If it is for a friend or family member, send a note that expresses your love and appreciation for them.Be sure to include the note with the package. You can write it in a Valentine’s card or a separate piece of stationary.

, In addition to a letter, you include something that conveys some sentiment, such as pictures or items from other members of your family. For example, for a romantic partner, you might include a picture of yourself. If the package is for a loved one or family member, you might include handmade drawings from your children or pictures of your family., Few items convey affection like something that is homemade. When you are putting together your care package, consider including something that is handmade. You might include some homemade chocolate chip cookies or knit the recipient a cap. Play to your talents and send something that you think they would enjoy., Although it is a Valentine’s Day care package, do not feel limited to sending only Valentine’s-themed items. Send items that you know the recipient will appreciate regardless of the occasion. For example, if the recipient is a bibliophile, send them a book that you think they will enjoy., Instead of sending a drab brown box, put some Valentine’s Day decorations on the outside. Cut out some hearts from red construction paper and glue or tape them to the exterior. You might also wrap the package in red paper and glue Valentine’s cards to the outside.

Avoid high expectations.,
Try not to react at all until at least after dinner.,
Go about your day as normally as possible.,
Steer clear of jealousy.,
Give your gift.,
Remember any life events that may have made it difficult for your partner to shop.,
Think about your conversations from the last few weeks.,
Ask if your partner knows what today is.,
Consider your relationship status.,
Explain your feelings to your partner.",How to React when You Do Not Receive a Gift for Valentine's Day," You may love to hear about grand romantic gestures, but unless your partner is a millionaire it's a little silly to expect them. In fact, the average person spends only about $142 on Valentine's Day gifts. This may sound like a lot, but keep in mind how averages work. For every wealthy individual who buys a lover an expensive sports car, thousands of others may only go with a $10 box of chocolates or a cheap bottle of wine., Many people wait to surprise their significant others with a gift in the evening. This is especially important to remember if you and your partner don't live together. Don't jump to conclusions if you wake up and don't find a bouquet at your door.

, Moping around is the worst thing you can do. If you are seriously upset, try your best to pretend it's not Valentine's Day at all. Unlike most major holidays, Valentine's Day is relatively easy to ignore. Try not to listen to the radio or watch television; advertisements and talk show chatter will probably be Valentine's Day-oriented.

, If you work on Valentine's Day, you may see coworkers with flowers or chocolates. Don't be jealous of them. You have no idea what their relationships may really be like. Flashy displays of affection through monetary goods don't reflect how someone truly feels. Try your best to remember all the times where your partner has shown you love.

, Surprise your partner with a gift when you were originally planning to do so. Withholding a gift because you expect one yourself is petty. Your partner may have actually gotten something for you after all but was unsure of the right time to exchange gifts.

, Even in the age of Internet shopping and free shipping, sometimes things can get away from us. Don't expect too much if your significant other's parent passed away the week before.


For anxious perfectionists, shopping for the right gift can take a lot of time and effort. Your partner may have had to deal with an unexpected deadline at work and had to temporarily put everything else on hold. Just be sure to let them know how you feel if you're disappointed., At any point, did either of you mention anything about disliking Valentine's Day or not wanting a gift?


Some people feel obligated to say that they don't want a gift when they actually expect one to avoid seeming shallow or greedy. If you expressed this, your significant other may have taken your words at face value. Work on communicating your desires more honestly.
Your partner may have had a negative or traumatic experience associated with Valentine's Day and may feel uncomfortable celebrating it. If you consider your relationship close, ask about what happened and if there's anything you can do to help the healing process.

, If your partner doesn't realize it's Valentine's Day, there is absolutely no reason to get upset.


Some people are just very forgetful about dates. If your partner apologizes and offers to make it up to you soon, accept the offer gracefully.
Others may be new to dating and are unsure about the gift-giving etiquette that surrounds the holiday. If you are more experienced, explain the unwritten rules to your significant other. This may be a good opportunity for you each to define how serious you think the relationship may be.Your partner may be from another country and doesn't even know what Valentine's Day is. Many cultures celebrate Valentine's Day in very different ways, and some don't observe it at all. If that's the case, simply explain to your significant other the importance of this holiday to you. Suggest to celebrate and exchange gifts on a certain day at least a week or two away., If you just had your first date on February 12, don't expect your new partner to surprise you with a bouquet of roses. Conversely, if you've been together for years, it's not unusual to skip Valentine's Day. On average, married couples spend significantly less on their partners than couples who are dating.If you're upset about a missed Valentine's Day and your partner doesn't appear concerned or apologetic, this can be a bad sign. This is especially true if your significant other even goes so far as to tease or admonish you for caring about the holiday. While Valentine's Day may have become a marketing gimmick, you have every right to enjoy the holiday. When one partner invalidates another's feelings, their relationship may be unhealthy., Tell your partner that you enjoy celebrating Valentine's Day and were hoping for a gift. Suggest the possibility of an alternative ""Valentine's Day"" just for the two of you.


Be sure to use ""I-statements"" while discussing the subject. I-statements usually begin with ""I feel"" and go on to explain your emotions. In conflict resolution theory, I-statements allow you to express emotions caused by another's actions (or inactions) without blame. An example I-statement for this situation would be: ""I feel a little disappointed that I didn't receive a Valentine's Day gift from you this year.""
Remember to reaffirm that you care about your partner. Be clear that while you may be disappointed, your relationship isn't in jeopardy.Don't have this conversation while angry. If this experience has seriously upset you, calm yourself first by going for a walk or sleeping on it.Tell your partner what kind of gifts you like. There is nothing wrong with asking for what you want, and it's an important part of honest communication.Some people have very particular tastes or don't like receiving gifts. Don't force your significant other to read your mind.

Try buying something to add to a collection if your date has a running collection of any item, like postcards, stamps, etc. Add a romantic element by making the collectible item have something to do with a place you’ve shared a kiss, had a date, or created an inside joke.
Try personalizing any gift with your date’s initials, yours together, or anything else that is personal to your date or your relationship. You could personalize a picture frame, a bookmark in a book your date will love, etc.
Think about what your date has told you they love or miss about a certain time period or place, either from earlier in your relationship, their childhood, or another special time. Try to recreate a piece of that sentimental place or time period for him or her.

, Write in a card to let your date know how you feel, set a romantic mood, or just make your date laugh. If you buy a card, make sure you write a personal message inside it.


Try making a card with folded paper, markers or pens, and any other decorative elements you want to make it personal and unique to your date.
You can make several cards, to leave for your date to find at different places and times throughout the day for a sweet and romantic way to communicate even when you’re apart.

, Your Valentine’s Day gift doesn’t have to be an object. Make your gift an experience that you share together, whether you travel somewhere new, see a show, or go on an adventure.


Try giving your date the gift of a class in something they’ve always wanted to learn, like cooking, dancing, or woodworking. Your date can do the class on his or her own, or you can attend it together.Try ending your date on a beautiful overlook, a quaint park or garden, or someplace that is unique and special to your date or your relationship.
Try a “coupon book” of fun activities or sweet things that you will do for your date whenever he or she redeems each one.

, Try the typical trifecta of Valentine’s Day gifts, which are available almost anywhere before and on the holiday, if your date enjoys those things.


Try getting a type of chocolate that your date particularly enjoys, or another type of candy or treat they love. Personalize it with a sweet note or arrange candies into sweet words or hearts.
You don’t need to stick with an arrangement of flowers from the floral department. Try picking your date’s favorite wildflowers (from a permitted area), buying a different kind of plant they can enjoy planting outside or keeping indoors, or even making origami or paper flowers.Consider that many people enjoy a more personalized gift than what’s available at every store on Valentine’s Day, but others really do enjoy stuffed animals, flowers, and candy. It’s worth asking your date ahead of time before the holiday what they like instead of trying to guess.

Start with a broad goal to help define what you want and why you want it. Say to yourself, “I want a new career because I want to feel more fulfilled with my job.”
Try to focus your goals on one big picture theme. Too many could become overwhelming and make it easier to slip up. For example, focusing on getting healthier and going back to school at the same time could become overwhelming.;
, Once you have your overall transformation in mind, break it down into a set of goals. Think about what you want to be different when the transformation is complete.


If, for example, you want to improve your mind in the coming year, you may choose goals such as reading more books, learning a new language, and getting an educational or professional certificate.
Identify what you specifically want to change and use that as the basis for your goals.

, Look at each goal individually and decide what actions you want to take to accomplish it. Research resources, set dates, and schedule yourself in advance to make sure you have regular time dedicated to your goals.If your goals include learning a new language, your action plan may researching different language learning websites such as Duolingoor Busuu.
You may also make a plan for yourself to study from 6pm to 7pm every Monday and Thursday. Before you take action, make a plan to keep yourself on track.
If your goals will require some investment to make happen, now is also the time to set a budget.
If you need to work with someone else, do your homework first. Find out what qualifications, references, and feedback the person has in their field. Meet with them for an initial discussion. Whatever your goal, find someone who will offer you the support you need.

, Most any transformation will be an incremental process. Before you begin, research a realistic timeline for your goals. Remember that transformations can be ongoing, and may take longer than a year.


Avoid setting arbitrary timelines. Safe, healthy weight loss happens at a rate of 1-2 lbs a week.Proficiency in a new language can take months or even years.Use professional resources to help you set realistic timelines.
Be gentle on yourself. It is likely that over the course of the year, life events will come up that you cannot predict. Set your timeline with the understanding that you may get off schedule, but that is no reason to give up.

, Don’t overwhelm yourself by trying to change everything at once. Start with one of your goals and get into a steady routine before adding more into the mix.Try starting with a goal that requires consistency. Pick something that motivates you to stay on track, such as meeting with a professional or going to a class once a week.
If your goal is to reduce the stress in your life, for instance, you may want to consider something like a restorative yoga class that forces you to take time out a few days each week to calm yourself and reflect.
Look at adding in other goals once you feel comfortable in your current routine. Work your way up to the greatest challenges. Think about learning a language. You start with vocabulary before you try to read a novel.

, If you are looking to exercise more, make sure you chart a good running path. If you want to learn a programming language, equip your desk with an instructional book and a quality computer.


Make sure you have what you need before you get started. Consult books and online resources to find out what you need in order to successfully achieve your goal.

, During most transformations, there will be challenging moments. Look for someone to go through it with you. That way, there is always a motivating force and a sympathetic ear.


Look to people you trust. Friends or family who have shown support for you previously are good people to involve in your new goals.
Find a shared interest group. If you are learning a specific skill or working toward a more common goal, you can likely find local or online groups. These allow you to speak and practice with others who understand your ambitions and may be able to help find creative solutions.
Look for someone to challenge you. Find someone who will push you to be your best. If you want a running buddy, find someone who can make it just a block or two farther than you. If you want a study buddy for a new subject, ask a peer who has taken a related course before.

, Start your transformation by acting on what you laid out in your action plan. Take each goal, and develop a set of actions that will help you accomplish it.


If you found a course you want to try, sign up and go to class. If you found a professional with whom you want to work, make an appointment to see them.
You may find it helpful to break your goals down into several actions. For example, if you want to learn to dance, you may want one action to be going to class every week and the other action to be rehearsing at home twice a week.

, Find small rewards for those moments when you act on your goals. Try to find things that you truly enjoy, and use them to congratulate yourself on your hard work.Try something like playing your favorite song, taking a long bath, watching an episode of your favorite show, or something else that you enjoy to motivate yourself in the early stages of your goal.

, You are more likely to keep going when you can see how far you have come. Track your progress to see how far you made it with your goal over the course of the year.


Write down your progress in a journal, or use a visual tool such as a chart or drawing to show your progress.
If you are looking to get in shape, you can track how far you biked or run with fun charts and maps.
If you are learning a new skill, try tracking your progress by writing a sentence or two every day about what new things you’ve learned, and what comes easily to you now.
Consider using a goal-tracking app such as Achieveror Stickto track your progress easily and on-the-go.

, Generating some publicity for yourself is one way to stay on track. Talk to your those close to you about what have already accomplished, and what you still want to do.


You may also want to start a blog or website dedicated to your journey. This way, you can track your progress and let people know how far you have come at the same time., As you progress, your goals are likely to change. You may go from wanting to run a 5k to wanting to run a half marathon. You may have set out to learn Spanish, but find that you like Italian more. Re-evaluate your goals every few weeks and adjust them to fit your needs.


Designate specific times to check in on your goals. Set reminders on your calendar or in your planner.
Ask yourself, “How am I doing with this goal? Am I happy with my actions and their outcomes?”

Decorate the party!",How to Survive a New Year's Eve Party," Whether you're throwing or going to a party for New Year's, planning is always important. If you're throwing the party, make sure to have it under control and try to stay sober. You'll be in charge of organizing things and helping people have a fun and safe time. Sending out invites a while in advance is always good, and including the right information is good too. If you are not planning to let your friends chill at your house overnight, make sure they have a safe, sober ride home.


If you're the one going to a party, you have some planning to do as well. Plan out what you're going to wear, how you'll be going to the party, and from the party, who will be driving, how long your going to be there, and what your going to bring. It is polite to bring something for a party when you attend, such as special chocolates, a bottle of wine, or some music for the hosts and party. It is also important to know what other friends or family members are doing for New Year's Eve before you make any plans.;
, At the beginning of a party, it is a good idea (as a host or guest) to make sure everyone has a way of getting home if they are not staying at the host's home.

, Even if you're not where you want to be on New Year's Eve, make the best of it. Even if you're home by yourself, you can still have a great time. Stay on the phone with friends or, if possible, join close family or neighbor's parties (if you are close to them.) If you're at at a boring party or stuck at a party with someone you don't like, try to liven things up. Play the music, get some food, dance, set up games for children at the party, let the teenage children play video games, socialize with the others there. Play music for everyone.

, If you're hosting a 'bad' party, then try to liven things up (as stated before) or ask a close party guest for advise. It's always a good idea to have a few close friends help you out at a party. If things get really slow, do a ""Round the Room Resolutions"" game by having everyone share a little about their goals for the new year. It's a fun way to quickly pass the time, and a great conversation starter.

, Be prepared with sparklers, noisemakers, drinks, hats, poppers, or anything else festive for the countdown.

, If a host is serving food you're not fond of or cannot eat (like a vegetarian at a steak dinner), there are a few things you can do. You can eat before you come or bring in a food both you and the host like as a party gift. As a host make sure to have a large selection of food and drinks, and non-alcohol drinks as well. Snacks as well as small, light meals should be served and available throughout the night.

, If hosting a party, make sure you have a separate room or bathroom set aside for people that become to drunk or 'partied out.' If someone becomes too intoxicated, ask one of their friends to watch them in the separate room or bathroom while you look for a sober ride for them. Try not to attract too much attention to events like this.

, There is not much a guest can do about this, except bringing some décor or music as a party gift. The host should make sure their home is neat, clean, and properly decorated for a party. Music is always good to play at a party. Lighting should be bright enough for everyone to see yet not to bright to hurt people's eyes.

,,,,,,,, Obviously. It is a parade after all. There will always be people in the forefront so don't worry of not knowing where to go.

, Wave at the onlookers and march on the outside so you can give high fives to all the enthusiastic people in the crowds!

, Your pick will depend on your budget and the way you want to celebrate. If you want more of a frat kind of feel to drinking and being ""Irish"", go to the plethora of bars with cramped, jam-packed bodies and no room to breathe. If you want more of a classy way to celebrate, are hungry and have quite a bit more money, try going to a nice restaurant or steakhouse. I recommend: The Atlantic Grill, Smith & Wolensky's, and Rothman's. Any other restaurants you find you like, will do just fine. Just make sure to not go to an Italian or Chinese restaurant or anything with ethnic foods because, although those foods are extremely tasty as well, on this one day to celebrate Irish heritage, it would defeat the purpose. Go to a neutral place at best.

, Have at it! Don't forget to be responsible! ;)

Talk about your long-term goals.,
Project your future income at retirement.,
Estimate your retirement expenses.,
Calculate your income/savings gap.,
Consider your longevity.,
Project the required savings to fulfill retirement goals.,
Make clear who your beneficiaries are.",How to Plan for Retirement As a Couple1," As you and your partner begin planning for retirement, it is important that you clearly communicate what you want out of it. Many couples fail to talk about retirement with their partner, which can lead to incompatible plans and a failure to save properly.Talk with your partner about your retirement savings and ask yourselves what you want to do once you have retired. Answer these questions with your partner:


At what age do you want to retire
Where do you want to live after retirement?
What do you want to do after retirement
Do you want to leave an estate for others?
Do you intend to travel a lot? Will you buy a big-ticket item like an RV or mobile home?;
, Look at your shared income. Calculate how much money you and your partner will have from guaranteed sources that will not depreciate and that you will get every month. Adding up these sources of guaranteed income will give you and your partner a better idea of what your baseline income will be during retirement.Guaranteed sources of income include things like pensions, social security, and annuity payments.

, Once you and your partner have an idea of what you want your retirement to look like, you should try to estimate what your expenses will be in retirement. Create a budget that takes into account your current spending, as well as those things that you anticipate needing to pay for during retirement.Estimate your base expenses — food, shelter, transportation, health care, and other basic needs.
Once you have established your base expenses, consider discretionary needs such as travel, relocation, etc.
Keep in mind, too there may be unforeseen medical or home expenses that can eat at your savings. It is always a good idea to err on the side of caution when saving.

, Compare your estimated expenses with your guaranteed income. For most people, the guaranteed income will not be enough to cover all of the estimated expenses. Therefore, you will need to save some money to make up this gap.For example, if your annual guaranteed income is $30,000, but your estimated expenses are $60,000, you will need to save enough money to cover the $30,000 gap.

, Although we all hope to live long lives, outliving your savings can make things difficult for you and your family members. Ideally, you will want to save enough money to meet all of your expenses as you age and avoid running out of funds at a certain point. To avoid running out of savings, err on the side of caution and save as if you and your partner are going to live longer than average.In order to get a sense of how long you may live, look at you and your partner’s family history. If you both have parents or grandparents that lived well into old age, you should save money to support yourselves beyond the average life span.
In the United States, the typical 65-year-old male today will, on average, live to the age of about 84. The average 65-year-old woman will live to almost 87., Once you have determined your guaranteed income, savings gap, and considered your longevity, you can begin to calculate how much money you need for retirement. You will need to multiply the annual savings gap times your projected longevity, which will tell you how much money you need to save before you can retire. You can work with a retirement planner to help or use an online retirement income calculator.


Use a retirement income calculator to help you determine how much you need to save:

CNN Money: http://money.cnn.com/calculator/retirement/retirement-need/

AARP:http://www.aarp.org/work/retirement-planning/retirement_calculator.html

Bankrate: http://www.bankrate.com/calculators/retirement/retirement-plan-income-calculator.aspx



Remember to factor for inflation. If you and your partner plan your retirement far enough in advance, you will need to be considerate of inflation. Inflation can dramatically affect your return on investments, increasing or decreasing how much money you have during retirement. Although a good return would be welcome, you will want to make sure that you have enough money saved to cover a poor return on your investments., Because retirement savings are legally designed for individuals only, you will need to make it clear who will get your retirement benefits if you die. Ideally, you would name your partner since the two of you will have shared expenses. For things like pensions and 401(k)s you will want to make sure that your list your partner as your beneficiary.If your marital status changes, it is important that you update your information with your brokerage firm or the human resources department at your work.

Increase your annual savings rate.,
Take advantage of being married.,
Contribute to your 401(K).,
Use an IRA.,
Consider stock market investments.,
Consider income real estate for additional diversification.",How to Plan for Retirement As a Couple2," Start saving and investing as much as you can today. Increase saving as your income increases and as obligations — such as supporting children through school, etc. — decrease. Even increasing your savings by just 1% can make a huge difference.The earlier you start saving, and the more you put toward your savings, the less you'll have to worry about making a risky investment later in life to try and make up your savings gap. A low-risk, long-term investment can help you safely put away money for retirement.

, Married couples are eligible for a variety of benefits when it comes to retirement. If you and your partner are married, you should utilize these advantages to get the most out of your savings. Look at your finances or talk to a financial planner to determine the ways in which your marital status can work for you.For example, if you and your partner both have 401(k)s through your work, you can defer twice as much money as a single person. You can also make decisions about putting more money into the 401(k) that has better employer contributions.
Married couples also have higher income limits on IRAs than single people.

, One of the best options for retirement is a 401(k). This employer-sponsored savings plan allows employees to invest money from their paycheck before taxes are taken out. If you and your partner both have 401(k) plans, you can defer paying taxes on as much as $36,000 as a couple. However, if you cannot max out both plans, try to put money towards the plan that has the better employer contributions or the lower cost funds.If only one you has a 401(k), try to prioritize saving towards that plan since it has the most benefits.
Talk with your company’s HR department or a financial planner to make sure that you are taking full advantage of your 401(k)s.

, Traditional and Roth IRAs are great for couples who have maxed out their 401(k)s or are simply looking for a second savings option. Although they do not have the same tax benefits as a 401(k), they can help a married couple avoid paying taxes on their income. However, your income and other savings options determine your eligibility for an IRA.Talk with a financial planner about whether a traditional or a Roth IRA will work for you and your partner.

, If you make too much money for an IRA, you and your partner might want to consider investing some of your savings with a brokerage firm. These firms will help you build a portfolio of investments that should appreciate over time. However, it is important that you and your partner are on the same page concerning what investments are in your portfolio and how it is managed.You have many options when it comes to investing. Mutual funds, ETFs, and individual stocks and bonds are all possibilities.

, If you have the time and resources, you and your partner might consider investing in real estate. Depending on the market, you might see large returns on your initial investment; however, if property values go down or your property is damaged, you may lose a significant chunk of your investment. Rental properties in particular, require a lot of time and effort to maintain the value of your investment.The rent that you collect from a property may be a nice way to supplement your income during retirement.

Stagger your retirements.,
Be strategic about your social security claims.,
Apply for the saver’s credit.",How to Plan for Retirement As a Couple3," Although it might seem nice to retire at the same time, adjusting to your new routines concurrently may be difficult. Besides navigating your new routines, you may also have a significant and immediate diminishment in your dual income. To avoid this, it may be best to stagger your retirements so that you still have one solid income while the other person adjusts to retirement. This will help you and your partner put away some more money and make the transition to retirement much easier.Talk with your partner about your work conditions. If your partner hates their job and you like yours, let your partner retire first and stick with your career a little longer.

, When you and your partner are planning your retirement, you want to try to maximize your social security benefits. Depending on your income and the age of you and your partner, you can time your retirement in a way that gets the best returns. Because there are over 8,000 different claiming possibilities for married couples, you may want to talk to a financial planner to determine what will work best for you and your partner.Try to put off retirement for as long as you can after the age of 62. This is the age when you can start claiming social security, but there are substantial penalties for early payments. Consider delaying raking payments until age 70.

, If you and your partner make less than $61,500 annually and contribute to a retirement plan, you are eligible for the saver’s credit. When you put money into a savings plan, this credit rewards you for saving money by offsetting some tax on your income. You can save between 10 and 50 percent of the amount you save for retirement each month."

Try blush.,
Opt for a gold shade.,
Think about nude colors.,
Try an ice blue.",How to Choose a Colorful Wedding Dress1," A light pink or peach blush shade can be great to add a subtle splash of color to your wedding day. A blush tone is flattering on most skin tones and works great for a light color that does not stray too far from the traditional white.A blush tone gives off a somewhat dreamy look. It can go well with a romantic, fairy tale-like wedding theme.;
, A gold gown gives off a regal feel at a wedding. It is not too bright or gaudy, but is a nice subtle shade that adds something unique to your wedding gown. Many people find gold reminiscent of ancient goddesses, so gold can work great for a very archaic feel. You can go for a white gown with gold beads or a gown made from gold fabric.If you dislike the way gold looks on your skin tone, you can get a similar affect using another metal color. Try silver or copper instead if gold does not work for you.

, Nude colors are particularly subtle. They do not stray far from a traditional white. If you want a traditional wedding, but dislike the idea of a bright, white dress, think about going with a nude color. Something like beige or cream can be a great style for your wedding day.For a sensuous look, try pairing a beige gown with a smokey eye.

, If you want the traditional ""something blue"" for your wedding day, why not incorporate it into your gown? A subtle ice blue provides a soft color that is not overwhelming. An ice blue gown has a nice, played down effect.Ice blue is not your only option for a soft blue. You can also try baby blue or a pastel shade of blue.

Set the theme first.,
Decide which tables need tablecloths.,
Select the color of the tablecloths.,
Select the texture of the tablecloths.,
Use tablecloths to enhance your decoration, not overwhelm it.,
Consider whether you want to buy a matching overlay or table runner of similar or better fabric to your tablecloth to add a more finesse touch.,
Stick with a budget.",How to Buy Tablecloths for Your Wedding," Table adornments and accessories should be chosen after you know what theme the wedding reception will have. This includes color and texture––have a clear picture in your mind as to what you want reflected for both.;
, Not only does this determine the amount of tablecloths but it also impacts the size of the tablecloths. If you have varying sizes of tables, you'll need to take the measurements and bring those along when shopping.


Don't neglect any ceremony tables. If the place officiating your wedding isn't taking care of this for you, you may need a tablecloth for the signing table, at least.
The gift table is another table that is often improved by using tablecloths. It doesn't necessarily need to be the same as the tables but it should complement the color theme at least.

, This is determined by the wedding color theme. However, you will need to consider shades and complementary colors that might work too; just how much color do you want the table as a whole to invoke? The more color you want, the more likely it will be that you'll choose a strongly colored tablecloth like magenta, royal blue or dark green, while for a simpler, more natural wedding, you might prefer white, cream or beige tones.

, Color is important but so is texture.

Natural: Cotton, linen, lace, etc.






Glamorous: Satin, velvet, organza, tulle, etc.






Country: Gingham, rough textures, muslin, burlap, etc.






Layered: Pretty layered tablecloths can create a fairytale, glamor or sweet feel to the decorating






Metallic: Shiny tablecloths in silver, gold or metallic colors might work for some themes but be careful as they can be overwhelming.







, When choosing the color, texture and size, keep in mind that the tablecloth is a supporting act, not the star. Keep contrasts simple, so as to make decorating easier.

Avoid stark, strong or bold patterns. These rarely work well with the other decorative features and threaten to upstage even the bride.






Dramatic, vibrant colors may seem dazzling in the store but can be too dramatic or vibrant when placed on the wedding tables.

Start looking.,
Make a list of friends and family to send invitations to.,
Remember that it takes time to print the invitations (sometimes as little as two to three weeks, although it sometimes it takes as much as six) and it will take you an additional week or two to address the envelopes.,
Know how to spell your fiance's and parent's names.,
Proofread!,
Know these things in advance: Your parents’ preferred name-format (“Mr.& Mrs. John Smith"" vs. “John and Jane Smith""); the spellings of names; wedding date and time; wedding location (address, building name); reception time(s), place(s), and date(s).

,
Choose font style, color, and size.,
Don't include a registry card; this is considered a tacky and impolite gesture.,
Buy your thank you at the same time as your invitations.,
Consider RSVP cards, also called “response cards.,
Decide how far in advance to send your invitations, based on where you're from and where your guests live.,
Expect to purchase many, if not all, of these things from your stationer/printer: Announcements; Thank You Notes; Invitations & Envelopes; Ceremony Programs; Response Cards & Envelopes; Seating Cards; Save-the-Date Cards; Location Map; Napkins; Stationery

",How to Buy Wedding Invitations," Go to stores and look at invitations. Tiny pictures on the web will help you get an idea, but they're not enough to order from. Most online invitation vendors will send samples, sometimes for free or a small fee that will be placed towards your order.;
, Remember to count each couple or family as one invitation so that you don't over order. It's up to you whether to make wedding invitations or wedding announcements, or a combination of the two. If you're just announcing the wedding, expect to send 300-600 announcements. Brides who make invitations average under 100 invitations. Remember not to cut the number to save money--realize that (and your mom is too polite to say this aloud) every $1.00 invitation you send will bring back $50 in gifts. But remember to keep in mind the cost per-head at the reception if you expect them to come.

, The return address should be printed, unless you want to hand-write 500 of the same address, and take time to make sure the same person hand-writes the front and back of the envelope.

, That may sound funny, but many brides have to make multiple trips to see their stationer because the bride doesn't know something basic on the invitation, i.e. how to spell her parents' full-names, whether they want their full names, what the name of their chapel is, etc.

, Have at least two other people read the proofs from the designer or printer. Don't count on yourself to be the only proofreader, as you probably have memorized some of the information and may skip over a typo.

,, Remember, a simple font allows you to put more wording on your invitation. The “frilly"" fonts only look good in larger type-sizes. If you have your heart set on a particular “frilly"" font, consider using a combination of fonts, with your names in a larger, more elaborate font and the rest of the text in a simpler, smaller font. When choosing a font, be sure to look at the first initials of your names in the font you are considering. If you like your first initial in a font, you’re likely to like the invitation when it’s finished. Unless you have a degree in art, don't try to pick a font or layout an announcement yourself.

, Count on your parents and wedding party to spread the word. They will be asked! If you feel you must put a registry card in your invitation, do it right. Don't use the ones with the store's logo in bright-red. You can use a ""pew card"" for this purpose—a small blank card that matches your invitation. Web sites are better than multiple enclosures, and appease those who hate registry cards. You can print on a pew card and it will look a lot better than “Aimee and John are registered at Classy Joint We Really Hate. Web pages allow maps to the event-sites, additional pictures, registry links, stories about the couple, and are considered a thoughtful gesture.

, The reasons for this are simple—first, your parents will pay for them now. Second, most brides who don’t order them before the wedding never get around to it later. And no, you can’t go to a superstore and buy a 500-pack of blank thank yous, they don’t sell them in packs greater than 12. Only people who sell invitations can sell you thank yous in increments larger than that.

, If you are having any sit-down events, you will need them. Consider the math. If you’re paying $25 per plate for a dinner, being two guests more accurate will save you the average price of RSVP cards. You will definitely be at least two people more accurate.

, Send invitations 6-8 weeks in advance for most places. Easterners like 8 weeks, Californians like 6 weeks, and People who live in Utah, generally expect 2-3 weeks. If you’re tight on time, sort your invitations list by zip code, and then send them out in that order. Send out all invitations on the same day, and then keep an accurate list of responses. You will need an accurate guest count for both the ceremony and reception.

Add a dash of colorful embroidery or pattern.,
Go very bold with a black gown.,
Use floral print to add bold colors.",How to Choose a Colorful Wedding Dress2," You don't have to have your bold wedding day colors be completely solid. Many white or cream gowns come with decorative embroidery in bolder shades. Think about something like a white gown with bright red embroidery. This can be a great way to have a colorful gown that still honors tradition by incorporating some white.You can coordinate with your bridesmaids with your embroidery colors. For example, if your bridesmaids are wearing purple, go for a dress with purple embroidery.

, If you want to really defy tradition, go for a black gown. If you want a very non-traditional, somewhat eccentric wedding, a solid black gown can work great. However, if you prefer black but want a more subtle effect, black embroidery or black patterns can also work great.Black is a great choice if you want a slimming gown. Many people find black flatters most figures.
Remember, black is a very audacious choice that stands opposite to tradition. Only go for a black gown if you're prepared to make a big statement.

, Floral patterned gowns can be classy for a slightly non-traditional look. They can be used to add big, bold colors to a gown. As a floral pattern is read as very feminine, it can pair great with a ball gown style dress.You can have floral patterns with colors like pinks, purples, greens, and reds against a white background. However, you can also have a colored dress with a floral print. For example, try a floral pattern against a pink background.

Think about the setting.,
Choose a color based on season.,
Decide on the type of mood you want to convey.,
Create contrast.",How to Choose a Colorful Wedding Dress3," Where are you getting married? Certain colors may go better with certain settings than others. When selecting your wedding dress's color, look at the natural colors in your venue.For an outdoor wedding, look at the natural colors around you. If you're getting married near a body of water, for example, consider a blue dress.
If you're getting married in an indoor setting, look at the decorations. A church with a yellow color scheme may look great with a yellow wedding dress.

, If you're struggling to settle on a color gown, think about the season you're tying the knot. For a spring wedding, consider coral or pastel shades. For a summer wedding, think about rosier, brighter shades. For a fall wedding, incorporate fall colors like deep reds, violets, and oranges.However, you don't need to let the season entirely define your look. If you're in love with a particular color, you should wear it even if it's not in season.

, Color can set the mood of your wedding. Think about the general mood you want when choosing the color for your wedding gown. Do you want a deep, serious mood or a light, fun wedding?Darker tones work better for a more serious theme. Think about deep reds, emeralds, or other jewel tones.
Brighter, lighter colors can work great for a more laid back wedding. Think about light pinks, reds, or yellows.

, Part of the reason many brides opt for white gowns is that they stand out amongst the bridesmaids. If you're going for a color other than white, talk to your bridesmaids about how to make sure you stand out in photos.


If you're going for a light shade, like a played down blue, more vibrant bridesmaids dresses can help you stand out. For example, dark or bright blue bridesmaids dresses may pair well with a baby blue dress.
If you're going for a bolder color, like red, the bridesmaids could go for something lighter. For example, you could wear a bold red gown while bridesmaids wore a more pastel, light shade of red.

Find a part-time job.,
Switch to a less demanding position.,
Work off and on.,
Plan for the unexpected.,
Stay active.,
Slow down and enjoy life.",How to Semi‐Retire," If you haven’t already, get in the habit of setting aside a portion of your income on a regular basis to help you prepare for the future. That way, you’ll have a reserve to draw on once your downtime increases. The more money you’re able to accumulate, the smoother your transition into semi-retirement will be.Open a separate savings account and make it a point not to dip into it unless you absolutely need to.
Focus on paying off any outstanding debt you may have as soon as you decide to semi-retire. Otherwise, it can hinder your ability to build up a financial safety net.;
, Crunch some numbers and come up with a realistic figure that you think you can survive on while working less. Estimate high, just to be on the safe side. Your projected budget will be a useful guide during your first few months while you’re adjusting to your new spending habits.Cut out as many unnecessary expenses you can—limit the number of times per week you go out to eat, and downgrade your cable package or cell phone plan.If you have any questions about how to structure your budget, consult with a financial planner or the savings and loans expert at your bank.

, As much as possible, stick to the necessities, along with whatever resources you need for the occasional impulse buy or sightseeing trip. Depending on your new rate of income, this may mean selling a vehicle or even downsizing from a house to an apartment or condo. Being semi-retired is about learning to live with less.Unless you hit the jackpot or have an impressive amount of savings, you might not be able to indulge your expensive tastes the way you once did.

, Resist the urge to spend your money on frivolous toys and gadgets. The idea of owning a boat or a fancy new car may seem attractive since you’ll have more time for play, but in the end belongings like this will only eat into your savings and force to you to scrape together in other areas to get by.Think twice before committing to anything that requires long-term financing.

, Put some of the money you would otherwise use on an exotic getaway into your very own startup venture. This could be anything from developing an app to running a personal training business or handyman service. Since you’ll be able to pour all of your time and attention into your new enterprise, there’s never been a better time to give it a shot.If you need inspiration, start by making a list of your favorite ways to spend your time, drawing on your full range of passions and interests.
Identify a niche in your community that’s waiting to be filled, like an auto detailing or catering business., The biggest benefit of part-time employment is the flexibility it offers. You can work as much or as little as please and pick up extra shifts when things get tight. Look for jobs that meet your needs in terms of hours, pay structure, location and scheduling.If you’re coming from a skilled profession, you might even be able to negotiate a more competitive pay rate, which will be a big help when the first of the month rolls around.
Become an administrative or medical assistant, apply for a position with a nonprofit organization, drive for Uber or start your own blog., Even if you decide to step down from your current job, there might still be a place for you there. For instance, you could shift your duties from managing a team of employees to training new recruits. A lower level of responsibility will come with shorter hours and less overall pressure, but still allow you to be of service to the company.If you’ve spent your career in a leadership position with a company, you might continue working for the company in a consulting or advisory role.This may be a wise course for dedicated professionals who aren’t ready to give it all up just yet.

, Rather than working part-time hours week in and week out, consider finding a job that will allow you to work for a short interval, then take a few weeks or months off. Having big blocks of time off can break up the monotony of punching the clock and prevent boredom from setting in as a result of idleness.Periodic work might include seasonal or contractual employment, or specialty work like organizing tours and events.
Some types of jobs permit employees to take sabbatical, which essentially puts your career on pause for an indefinite period., Accidents and injuries are an unfortunately reality of life. Whether you get into a fender bender or come down with pneumonia, you’ll want to make sure that you have enough funds stashed away to cover the resulting costs without bankrupting yourself. If you’re not careful, a bit of bad luck could completely wipe you out.A good insurance policy is indispensable, especially as you get older and health issues become more common.Never deplete your savings to the point that you can’t afford to take care of yourself.

, Many retirees make the mistake of becoming sedentary when they suddenly find themselves with more time on their hands. Combat this by getting some type of regular exercise, even if it’s just a daily walk in the park. Socializing with friends and family will also help you remain engaged with the people around you and keep you mentally sharp.It’s never too late to take up a healthy hobby like tennis, cycling or tai chi.
Inactivity can have major negative impacts on your physical and mental health, including increased risk of heart disease, diabetes and depression., When you decide to take the semi-retirement leap, you’ll be reclaiming your precious time, so use it well. Study another language, go snorkeling in the Caribbean or teach yourself to play the trombone. After all, the whole point of retirement is to finally get around to doing the things you couldn’t do while you were too busy working.Now is a good opportunity to learn new skills, try new things and scratch a few items off your bucket list.
Sign up for painting lessons at your local art studio, join a community league sport or volunteer your time with a social welfare program in your city.Keep in mind that there are many fulfilling pursuits that don’t come with a price tag—going on a hike, writing your memoirs or spending time with your loved ones won’t cost you a penny."

Make it a team effort.,
Play games and sing songs in another language.

,
Read children's books in another language.

,
Have the child watch programs (especially educational ones) and movies in another language.

,
Get a nanny or babysitter who speaks another language.,
Set up play dates or put your child in playgroups with children who speak another language.,
Expect the child to actively use another language.,
Be persistent.",How to Raise Bilingual Children," Ideally, everyone in the household should be supportive of the child learning and using another language, even if not everyone speaks the language. Sometimes, one person in the household wants to teach the child another language, while others may object, or be indifferent or unsupportive. If this is the case, and assuming that you are the one who wants the child to be bilingual, discuss the benefitsof multilingualism with other members of the household. The important thing is that when the child uses another language, everyone rewards and encourages it, rather than ""correcting"" them with the primary language.


Example: A toddler sees a carrot, points to it and says ""zanahoria!"" (which is Spanish for carrot). A bad response would be to scowl or look confused and say ""No, carrot."" A good response would be to smile and say ""Yes! Zanahoria. Carrot. Good job!""
Other members of the family, especially the other parent, may be worried about feeling left out if you and the child have your own language. If this person isn't willing to learn the language, you can suggest that they take on an activity with the child that you are not interested in so that they have something that's their own as well.;
,,,, Ask them to use that language when speaking to the child, and to encourage the child to use it as well.

, Use peer pressure to your advantage! If you can't find an appropriate playgroup, consider starting one: How to Start a Local Playgroup. Or search for any other ""organization"" where you have an environment in which the secondary language is spoken, such as cultural associations., In a home where more than one language is used, a pattern might emerge where another language is spoken to the child, and the child understands it, but he or she doesn't know how to speak it because he or she responds in the primary language. Make it a rule that the child must respond in the language in which they are spoken to. In this regard the ""one parent - one language"" rule is quite helpful for raising bilingual children - define as a parent what language you use to speak with your child, and then stick to it (while the other parent does the same with the other language).Another option is to set aside a day or half day a week when only a particular language can be used. Another option is to use one language at home, and another one outside the home.

, There will probably come a time when the child doesn't want to speak the other language. It might become a big point of contention, especially as a child gets older. How you handle it will depend on your parenting style: Will you strictly enforce usage of another language? Will you continue speaking the language even if the child refuses to speak it back? Will you take your next family vacation to a neighborhood or country where the other language is commonly used?

Model independence.,
Teach your children that it is okay to be separate.,
Search for opportunities to show examples of your own individual small accomplishments.",How to Encourage Independence and Confidence in Children1," In teaching your children independence, first remember to be independent yourself. There is a healthy balance that is needed in all of your relationships that helps you to maintain your own independence and individuality. If you are able to withstand being separate, your children will learn this from you.


Problems will arise if you are an overly intense parent or guardian. For example, the so-called helicopter parent is one who cannot abide to be apart from the child but hovers over his or her every action, to ""be there"" and to ""ensure safety"". This is often borne of one's own anxiety or worries, and will often require personal soul searching to overcome. Children subjected to such parenting can grow up to be anxious and afraid of independence. Do your best to manage your own fears and not pass them on to your children.
Look at what you're modeling to your children in your chief relationship with your spouse or partner. Co-dependent, enmeshed or subservient behaviors with the other caregiver can send helpless signals to children, which can in turn teach them to be afraid of being separate too. For the sake of yourself and the children, such behaviors need to be overcome.;
, Help your children to see that it's both acceptable and occasionally desirable to sometimes be alone, to peacefully disagree with another’s opinion, or to want personal time.


Aim to model healthy conflict in front of your children. While yelling and blame have no part in child raising, arguing for something that matters in a calm and moderated manner is something every human being needs to learn as a useful skill. And there will be times when you slip up––rather than pretending it never happened, always apologize. If a child is old enough, also explain yourself.

, An example could be something as simple as struggling to open a jar, but not giving up, and striving to get it open without any help. Draw attention to the experience by saying such words as: “Look, mommy tried really hard, didn't give up and I did it!"" Your children will then see that you try to accomplish things alone––and very often succeed.


Some children have a tendency to give up quickly. It is even more important to model perseverance with such children, and to provide them with encouragement to keep trying. Do not criticize their efforts; instead encourage their growth through repeated attempts. Eventually success at a task will prevail, with repeated learning and your support.
When you do not succeed at something, model coping behavior––this is as important as the self-praise for success. Teach them through your actions that failure is not only survivable, but a spur to doing something else or giving it yet another go based on the lessons learned.
Remind your children that if they ever feel they cannot do things alone, you are there and will assist them. Remember though, this assistance can range from physical help to only offering verbal encouragement because you know that their particular task at hand is achievable and they will benefit greatly if they do it alone.

"
"
Observe your children at play and in everyday life.,
Request your child's input and advice on small tasks.,
Include your children in everyday household chores that involve their own stuff.",How to Encourage Independence and Confidence in Children2," Pay close attention to their likes and dislikes. Look for opportunities to talk with them about what they are doing or playing with. Spot the ways that they can improve their play by simple changes that they can make themselves. These changes can be as easy as adding a book for a toy car ramp or where to place their feet as they learn how to pedal their bikes.

, Your child will learn that his or her opinion is important to you. Following through with his or her suggestions helps the child's healthy internally nourished self-esteem to grow (rather than the ineffective externally imposed boosterism). It is then your job to encourage your child's suggestions and to make him or her a very valuable asset to the task at hand.


Say things like: “I’m so glad that you thought of putting the bread in this basket. This will make dinner so much easier.“

, It is much easier for children and for that matter, anyone to identify and want to help with things that they care about and are familiar with. Even if it sometimes means that you may have to go back and “really clean” the areas that you have asked them to be in charge of, passing on the expectations of responsibility for one's own things is worth the extra effort.


When they are finished with their meal, be sure to encourage them to put their dishes in an appropriate place––the sink or the dishwasher depending on your family.
If you want them to clean their rooms, begin with reachable goals, like asking them where the books go and then let them follow by putting them away. The goal is to show them that you entrust them with small independent decision making when it comes to their own belongings. This tip can extend into personal hygiene also.
Help in the house can begin from as young as 3. Small tasks at first, then increase the challenges as the child grows older.

"
"
Set up both structured and unstructured alone time.,
Help your children to see boredom as a healthy reaction, one which teaches them to reach within and find solutions.,
Extend the unstructured boundaries gradually.",How to Encourage Independence and Confidence in Children3," Let your children pick where they want to be within the already set boundaries and what they want to do. This could include a variety of structured and safe choices. This is a time when they don’t have to share anything, or talk with anyone but merely learn how to independently entertain themselves. If presented with enthusiasm on your behalf, this can be viewed as exciting to a young child.


An example could be: “It's me-time and you can sit on the couch or at the table and read a book, draw or play with puzzles.” Being alone tends to be seen as a negative thing because it is so often used as “time-out” or “go to your room by yourself”. Sadly, this simply confuses the growing child who equates solitude with badness. If you encourage alone time as good time, you can quickly buy yourself space when you really need a break, and it won't have negative repercussions.
This is an opportunity for you to present the idea of being alone as a positive aspect in learning self-reliance skills and in life generally and not as a punishment.

, It is not your priority to alleviate a child's boredom––your priority is to provide a safe home environment in which a child explores his or her imagination and unlocks ways to personally resolve boredom. If you constantly remove that chance, it can be harder for such a child to self-soothe and find internal outlets to relieve boredom, possibly leaving the door open to risky behaviors. Give yourself a break and allow time for boredom too.

, As your children grow older, expect more independence from them and give them more unstructured time. Your trust in your children will go a long way to helping them mature healthily, and they will view their independence as a privilege, not something to be afraid of.

,
Ask the child to add the ""1"" to the top number of the ""tens"" column; then add the bottom number to that sum.",How to Teach a Child to Carry Numbers1,", Draw a line between the ""units"" and the ""tens"" column to help align and use ""place values"" in columns. It is not important for your child to already know how to do two column addition.

, Do not have them put a ""1"" over the numbers, yet.

, Make certain the child places the digit(s) in the correct position (no digit should be in the units column.) If they are confused, cover up the units column. Have the child write the number(s) underneath the number already written in the ""tens"" column from the ""units"" column addition.

, Review what you have completed so far.


If you were using the example above, you might say, ""We're almost done. You did seven plus five equals twelve. Good. Four plus three equals seven. Correct. Notice that the four and the three are in the tens position, so you are really adding forty and thirty.""

, Have the child bring the amount in the units column down to the bottom. Point to the numbers in the ""tens"" column and ask the child to add them up.

, By now, the child should already be familiar with the commutative law of addition or (at least) know that the order of addition is unimportant.

,, Tell the child that this is a shortcut we call ""carrying"", and more commonly called ""regrouping"" in classrooms today.

Again, have the child place a zero(0) in the right hand column and answer the units x tens multiplication to the left of the zero.

,
Discuss multiplying the tens by the tens column.,
Have the child do the addition to finish the problem.Put it together with unit times two digit (1 by 2) multiplication

,
This time, instead of writing the tens digit (from the unit x unit product) under the line, write it ABOVE the tens digit column.,
Have the child do the units times tens multiplication; have the child add the carried number to the product and write the number to the left of the units digit already present.,
Place a tens digit in the lower factor and have the child cross out any carrying that has already taken place.

,
Have the child treat the tens digit like the other one times two digit work.,
Have the child finish by doing the addition.

",How to Teach a Child to Carry Numbers2,",


Simply put: Anytime you multiply by a number with zeros on the end (like 120 x 160), you add the number of zeros to the end of the product.
120 x 160 becomes:
12 * 16 = 192
Place the two zeros on the end (One from 120 and another from 160)
= 19,200Start with a one digit times two digit multiplication problem


,,,


Remind the child that the units column has already been multiplied. Tell the child that when you multiply the units column by the tens column it's like multiplying something with a zero on the end.

,,,


Do not continue until the child can manage any problem of this type (1 x 2)! Continue with a two digit times two digit (2 by 2) multiplication problem. Most children have no idea why their teacher skips a space on the second line of ""conventional"" long multiplication.

,,, Mark the two multiplications (which will look like a big X).

,, Show the child that this is like multiplying by 100. Have the child place zeros in the two right columns and place the product to the left.

,,


Have the child compare this to carrying in addition.

,


The child should become proficient at this before proceeding.Complete the process of (2 by 2) multiplication.


,, Remind the child of the zero in the right column.


This would be a good time to tell the child that the zero in the right hand column is not necessary, but it won't hurt if they leave it.

Look for children's books that feature disabled children, and read them together with your child.,
Use simple words.,
Speak in a casual tone of voice, and signal that the disability, while existing, is not a big deal.,
Teach your child not to have pity on disabled people.",How to Explain a Physical Disability to a Child," This will help your child understand that disabled people are really not that different!;
, When your child spots a disabled person in the street, you need to answer right there and then. Say something like:


""It's hard for that girl to walk, so she uses the chair to move around better.""
""He can't see very well, so he uses a cane to help him feel if he's going to bump into things.""
""Some people are born with only one arm, and sometimes people have an accident and lose their arm. I don't know why she has one arm, but that's okay, because it doesn't really matter.""

, This helps normalize the idea of disabilities, so your child feels comfortable around disabled people.


Do not send your child to talk to the disabled person or ask him/her questions. While it may seem like a teachable moment to you, it quickly becomes an annoyance to disabled people, who have to deal with both stigma and random questions from strangers. It is very rude to assume that ""she won't mind"" when, in fact, she may actually be walking to a meeting or absorbed in deep thought.
If your child is old enough, you could teach them about stigma, the disability rights movement, and invisible disabilities (such as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, autism, and schizophrenia).

, Yes, they may have a little more trouble to go out and about, but they manage just like everyone else!


The same goes for admiration, which is really ""pity in disguise.""

Purchase other safety gear like elbow pads and kneepads.",How to Measure a Toddler for a Bike," You’ll need measuring tape, a pencil, and a book or a ruler (or some other flat surface)., Their head should be facing straight ahead, and not tilted upwards or downwards, so you do not get a faulty measurement of their height.


Make sure their feet are side by side, with both feet firmly on the floor and their heels touching the wall.Allow your child to keep their shoes on, as they will be wearing them when they ride the bike.

, Place the ruler, book or other flat surface on your child’s head. The ruler should be positioned against the wall, parallel with the floor. Mark where the ruler touches the wall with a pencil., Once you have marked the point on the wall, have your child move aside so you can measure their height. Extend the measuring tape from the point you have marked to the floor and write down the measurement. This dimension is the height of your toddler.Keep in mind that kid’s bikes are measured by the size of the wheels, not the frame height. Bikes for toddlers usually range from 12 and 16 inches.
In general, 12-inch wheels are designed for children 36-40 inches tall, 16-inch wheels are for children 41-49 inches tall, and 20-inch wheels are for children 50-56 inches tall., Measuring their inseam is important because you need to be sure your child can place their entire foot on the ground while on the bike. If the bike is too big and your child cannot put their feet down, it will be hard for them to balance and they may get frustrated while trying to learn how to ride.


You can easily determine your child’s inseam measurement if they try the bike before you purchase it. But if you are buying a bike without your toddler, you will need to measure their inseam.

, Write down the measurement on a piece of paper and take it with you when you go bike shopping for your toddler.

, Place the string on the floor, between the child's feet, and stretch it to the child's crotch. Then, put your finger on the place on the string to indicate the height of their crotch. Move the string and cut with it with scissors at the place where your finger is. Measure the length of tape using a ruler.


Keep in mind that toddlers with an inseam up to 18 inches and a height up to 40 inches need a bicycle with 12-inch wheels. Toddlers who have an inseam up to 18 inches and are taller than 40 inches need 16-inch wheels., The diameter of the bike’s wheels should be clearly labelled on the bike’s packaging or the box. Ask the sales associate at the store if you are not sure where to find the diameter of the bike’s wheels.


If you are purchasing a used bike, use a yardstick or measuring tape to measure the diameter of the tire. Start on the outside of the tire and pull the measuring tape straight across until you get to the other side of the tire--the number on your measuring tape with be the tire’s diameter.
Use your child's height and inseam measurements to find the right diameter size for the wheels. You can also access a size chart onlineto determine the right wheel diameter for your child, based on their age.

, If you have a two or three year-old who is tall, it is better to provide him with a smaller bike that has 12-inch wheels because they will sit lower in the seat. It will also make it easier to for them to reach the bike’s handlebars.


If your child is older, but short for their age, choose a bicycle with 16-inch wheels. Older children have longer legs and arms, so a smaller bike will be awkward for them to use., Loosen the screw under the bike seat, located where the seat goes into the frame. When you loosen it, you will then be able to move the seat up on or down to suit your child.

, To ride the bike easily and comfortably, your child’s knee will be slightly bent when the pedal is in the down position, as this allows a stronger stroke on the pedal than when their leg is stretched out.


When the pedals are in the up position, your child’s thighs should be horizontal and not stick out.

, Correct handlebar placement is especially important when your child is first learning how to balance and steer a bike.


Your child should be able to sit upright and be close to the handlebars but their knees should not hit the handlebars when they pedal.Your child should also be able to comfortably place both hands on the grip pads and have enough movement to turn easily., Press them with your little finger, as children do not have the same pressure in their fingers as adults. If you can press the brake levers with your little finger without much effort, your toddler will be able to press them too., Most childrens’ bikes come with adjustable handlebars and seats because children grow quickly, so it shouldn’t be hard to find an adjustable bike.


Some bikes come with quick-release adjustments, so adjustments can be made without needing any tools, but this also makes it easier for bike parts to be removed and stolen.
Other bikes come with a traditional adjustment system, which can require basic tools or special parts that are often included with the bike.
Check to see what type of adjustment system is on your child’s bike and look for one that matches your adjustment preferences.

, Always bring your child with you to test a used bike before purchasing it, and make sure the brakes work and that all the other pieces are in order.


Don’t be afraid to ask the seller questions about how old the bike is and if it has been in any major crashes. Used bikes are best if they are on their newer side (only a few years old) and haven’t been in any major crashes.
If the bike doesn’t fit or isn’t in a safe condition, walk away and look for a better option. Used bikes are sometimes stolen merchandise being resold. If you are suspicious that the used bike might be stolen, look for the serial number, which is usually located underneath the main support post. Contact the police department or search the internet with the serial number and description of the bike to see if any stolen bike reports matching the number appear.

, Employees at specialty stores tend to receive better training so they can recommend the correct bike size and features for your child.

, When sitting on the seat with their hands on the handlebars, a child should be able to place the balls of both feet on the ground at the same time.Your child should be able to straddle the tallest bar on the bike while still having their feet flat on the ground on both sides of the bike, which helps them quickly stop the bike or get off if they start to fall.If your child can’t fulfill these requirements, try a smaller size bike or adjust the seat so it is on a lower setting.

, This bike style is a popular option and comes in very small sizes. This bike looks like a typical toddler bike, but does not have pedals, so your toddler can straddle the bike and walk with it. Balance bikes are a good starting point for young children because they give them the feel of a bike and will teach them to steer and control the bike without having to use pedals.


They can be used by children as young as 18 months old.

, Once they are ready for a real bike, you can add training wheels to this style.


Training wheels should be attached next to the rear wheel and should start flush with the ground. As your child gets more comfortable balancing on the bike, you can raise the training wheels, which will force them to balance on their own.Often, toddlers that start with balance bikes can skip the training wheel phase or go through it quickly.Keep an eye on your child to monitor their progress and comfort levels.

, This way, your child can pedal backwards to brake. Young children don’t have the hand strength or coordination to use hand brakes.In fact, children younger than six should only use coaster brakes.


Most bikes come with hand brakes when they are have 16 inch wheels and bigger, which the average child will fit into when they are 6-7 years old.Make sure the brakes can be activated quickly and have the power to stop the bike. Have your child test the brakes, and then test them yourself with a hand or foot to see how quickly they react.

, These styles aren’t ideal for children until they have a firm grasp on riding a bike.


Once your child becomes a more confident rider, you can experiment with bikes for different types of terrain.
All children should learn to ride a bike on a flat, even surface, like cement. If your child will be riding on dirt roads or cobblestone paths, look for a bike with larger shocks for a more comfortable ride.
For best results and personal recommendations, consult a biking professional at a sporting goods or biking store.

, In general, the less expensive bikes will be heavier because they are made of steel instead of the more expensive alloy metals.Steel bikes are still safe, but can be slightly more difficult to maneuver and are heavier if your child crashes and gets trapped under their bike.

, Helmets are required by law in most states when riding in public places, and they are always a good idea for young children learning to ride a bike. Helmets also reduce the risk of bicycle-related head injury by 88%.A helmet is only effective if it fits your child’s head properly. The right helmet will rest just above your child’s eyebrows and sit level around their entire head. It shouldn’t move around on their head when shaken, and the strap should be snug but still allow your child room to move their mouth and talk.
Helmets that are designed specifically for biking are best, but your child can also wear a helmet designed for another activity, like rollerblading or skateboarding, as long as it fits them properly.

, Though these are not required, it may be beneficial to protect your child from the typical falls and stumbles that may happen when they first learn how to ride.


Most pad sets are sold according to the height, age, and weight of a child. Use the same measurements you took for correct bike sizing to choose the correct pad size.
Have your child try the pads on to ensure they are comfortable. You also ask a store employee to help you with sizing and material recommendations for safety gear.

Answer their questions.,
Relay your own experiences and feelings.,
Use age-appropriate language and situations.,
Discuss how common mental illness is.",How to Talk to Kids About Mental Health Stigma1," Holding back information from your children about mental illness can make the situation more dire. They may create their own ideas about what is happening or about mental illness. Often, their assumptions are worse than what’s actually going on.

Try to answer as honest as you feel comfortable with. They may want to know why there is stigma and sugar coating your answer may cause them to fill in the blanks themselves. Instead, you can tell them that people often just don’t understand what mental illness is and react out of fear or confusion.Let's say your child asks, ""Why did the woman in the store seem frightened of Aunt Carla?"" You might say, ""Carla has a mental sickness that causes her to act out sometimes. Others don't always understand that she is sick."" Also, be sure to reassure them that their aunt—like most people with a mental illness—is not actually dangerous if they are concerned about this.
Explain to your child that there are many different types of mental illness and they can range from mild to severe, and some are only temporary.
Let your child know that some forms of mental illness can even be cured or controlled with things like therapy and medication.;
, Let your children know how you feel about mental illness. You can also discuss any backlash you’ve received because of stigma, if you’ve gone through it yourself. Your children will likely better understand the stigma if you talk about your feelings towards it and any that you’ve suffered.

For example, you could say, “People with mental illness are just like you and I. However, their brains operate a bit differently and cause them to feel certain ways. You don’t need to be scared or think badly about them.” Hearing it from you may make them feel more confident in the situation.

, Take your child’s age into consideration when talking about mental health and the stigma associated with it. Younger children will likely not understand what you’re saying if you use language that is too complex. They may also become scared. Instead, talk to them in ways they can comprehend.

For example, you can likely be completely honest and open about what is going on with a teenager. A younger person, however, would do better if you just say the person isn’t feeling well or has a difficult time with things because their brains work differently than theirs., Mental illness is extremely common nowadays. Lots of the stigma that is associated with it comes from a time when people didn’t understand mental health. However, letting your children know that mental illness is so common that someone they know likely suffers from it, can help to normalize it and help them feel more comfortable with it.

You might say, ""Although it may not seem like it, depression is very common. It's actually one of the leading reasons people over 15 are on disability.""Because it is so common, your child should feel comfortable discussing mental illness with you. Let them know you want to talk to them about it, if they feel they have an issue."
"
Set up an appropriate time and place to talk about mental illness.,
Explain the different types of mental illnesses.,
Let them know if you don’t have all of the answers.",How to Talk to Kids About Mental Health Stigma2," Discussing your own mental illness can prevent your children from having a stigma against it. They may feel like if someone they love has a mental illness, it can’t be that scary. Pick a setting in which your child will feel comfortable with you talking about your experience.

Talk to your child one-on-one in a place they feel good about, whether it’s home or on the playground. Allow them to ask you questions and use terms that won’t frighten them., Some parents never bring up mental illness with their children. As a result, they often become afraid of it whenever they encounter it. Bringing it up and talking openly about it may stop them from being afraid and developing their own stigma.

Speaking with your children daily, or as often as you feel comfortable with, about mental health may encourage them to come to you openly if they believe they are experiencing an issue themselves.You might simply say, ""Many people struggle with mental illness, which is a normal part of life sometimes. Some conditions may last only a few days or months, and other conditions may last longer. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Two of the most common conditions are anxiety and depression..."" Then, go on to paint a picture of what those two disorders may look like in terms of symptoms to help your child better understand.

, There’s a good chance you didn’t go to medical school. Therefore, you likely may not know everything your child wants to know about mental illness and its stigma. That’s OK. Be honest about your limitations and encourage them to continue to ask questions.

For example, you could say, “I’m not sure, but I can try to find out.” This lets them know you want to help them know as much as they want and you are open to discussing the situation even more.Direct your child to other resources, such as videos and Youtube channels that focus on mental health issues like depression."
"
Let your children know that people can’t prevent their mental illness.,
Talk about how mental illness isn’t a sign of weakness.,
Console them that people with mental illness aren’t necessarily violent.,
Reassure them that people with mental illness can get better.",How to Talk to Kids About Mental Health Stigma3," Your child may have heard that people have a choice about mental illness. Generally speaking, this isn’t true. Educate them on why mental illness is believed to affect certain people and not others.

Talk about how biologic factors, like chemical imbalances, can cause a person to have mental illness. You can discuss how certain environmental situations, like being exposed to war, can bring about other mental issues, like post-traumatic stress disorder. Let them know they can’t help it and don’t want to have it., Some believe that mental health issues only attack people who are weak. They think that if the person was stronger, they could fight the symptoms they experience.

Instead, tell your children that realizing there is a problem and then asking for help is a sign of strength. That it takes real courage to admit that you’re not perfect and need someone to help you., Parents are often afraid to expose their children to people with mental health problems because they fear they will harm them. Although this can be true in some cases, it’s not the truth in every situation.

Explain to them that people with mental issues are not always scary, especially when it is someone they love., Although a person may always struggle with mental health problems, they can get better. Medication and therapy often help improve a person’s life and allow them to become themselves again. Letting your child understand this can help them feel better if someone they love suffers.

You can explain how therapy and medication can help to restore the balance in a person’s brain and make them feel better. You can explain your situation and experience, as well, if you’re going through illness, yourself."

Keep your child’s sleeping needs in mind when creating your bedtime routine.,
Make sure your child is getting enough sleep.,
Keep track of your child’s sleeping patterns if you are not sure when you should be putting your child to bed.,
Make minor adjustments to the time when your child is supposed to be in bed.",How to Set a Bedtime for Toddlers1," Toddlers are busy and use a lot of energy during the day, so most of the time they crash at night. Children between the ages of one and three generally need 12 to 14 hours of sleep each night. They also generally will take one nap during the day when they are 18 months of age.


Children who are three to six generally need between 10 to 12 hours of sleep each day.;
, Consider how long your child typically naps during the day and do the math to make sure that your child is getting enough sleep each day and night.


For example, if your 2-year-old child typically takes a 2-hour nap, put them to bed with the idea that they will sleep for 10 to 12 hours at night. If they typically wake up around 7:30 am, that means they should go to bed between 7:30 and 8:30 pm. For most toddlers, the optimal awake time is between 4 and 4 ½ hours. So if a child wakes up from a nap around 3:00, they should be ready for bed between 7:00 and 7:30.

, If you are unsure about what your child’s ideal bedtime is, spend a week observing his sleep patterns. Write down every nap he takes and how long it lasts. Track the time your child goes to bed, when he actually falls asleep, and the time he wakes up. Use this schedule to look for any patterns, such as tantrums or meltdowns at a certain time of day every day, a hard time falling asleep or waking up in the morning, or if he is cranky the day after having a poor night’s sleep. With patterns recognized, you can target where to improve his sleep.


For example, if your child has a hard time falling asleep at night, consider moving his nap to earlier in the day. If he is groggy in the morning, put him to bed earlier.

, Once you understand your child’s sleep needs, it may be tempting to switch them to the correct bedtime right away. However, for most toddlers, this plan will backfire and create difficult nights for both you and your child.


Slowly make your way to the proper bedtime for your child. Put your child to bed 15 to 20 minutes closer to their regular time every few nights until you reach the ideal bedtime.

"
"
Sit the child/children down in a quiet place where you are likely to be undisturbed.

,
Tell them that they are going to have a new sibling.,
If the child/children get angry or upset, calm them down.,
Let the child/children pick a middle name.",How to Prepare Children for a New Sibling2,", Most children of this age will know and understand about sex, so won't ask about how the baby came about. If they do, explain about sex.

, As with younger children, explain that you won't love them less because they have a little brother/sister, and that you will need their support over the upcoming months and years.

, This way, the new baby will always have a little bit of their sibling/siblings in them. Make sure you like the name as well as the child/children.

Plan out your child’s bedtime routine.,
Keep your child’s environment relaxing.,
Stick to calm activities.,
Consider giving your child a snack before bed.,
Get your whole family involved in the bedtime routine.,
Give positive reinforcement when your child sleeps through the night.",How to Set a Bedtime for Toddlers2," No matter what time you put your child to bed, if they aren’t calm and ready, they may have a restless night and a hard time going to sleep. Establishing a bedtime routine helps children wind down after a busy day and helps them know what is coming next, so that being put in bed isn’t a surprise. Try to make sure that your child’s bedtime routine happens at the same time each night (once you have determined what time your child needs to go to sleep) to create a strong sleep pattern.


An example of a bedtime routine may consist of taking a bath, putting on pajamas, snuggling up to read a book, singing a song, and then getting in bed.

, Throughout the entire bedtime routine, keep the lights low, turn off electronics, and use a soft, calming voice to create a serene environment. Have your child participate in calming activities, as described in the next step.

, Some parents think that rough housing with their child before bedtime will help to tire the child out. However, riling your child up may actually keep your child up longer. Instead, promote calm activities like:


A warm bath. Warm baths can have a soothing and calming effect. Designate enough time for your child’s bath to make it as relaxing as possible so that you do not rush your child.
Cozy pajamas. Choose pajamas made of cotton or another soft material that will be both comfortable and breathable.
A great bedtime story. Choose a story that focuses on a tale about bedtime or nighttime.
Goodnights and good night kisses. Make sure to give your child a goodnight kiss. However, set a limit on the number of kisses she gets, or else saying goodnight could drag on.

, Giving your child a small snack with protein and carbs, such as a piece of cheese or slice of bread, will help make him sleepy and keep his blood sugar at a consistent level for a good night’s sleep.

, If you are co-parenting, work with your partner to create a stable routine that both of you can stick to. If you have older children, work with them to create their own bedtime routine that will also help to get your little one into bed.

, If your toddler falls asleep on time and sleeps through the night, she will most likely wake up when you have planned for her to wake up (about 12 hours later). When she wakes up after she has slept through the night, greet her with praises for sleeping through the night.


Her reward can be an extra kiss or hug, or an extra couple of minutes doing her favorite activity during the day. She could also get a treat at breakfast.

"
"
Consider changing the routine if necessary.,
Tell your child that you will not be far away.,
Do not cuddle if you do return to your child’s room.,
Resist the urge to cater to your toddler’s complaints and protests.,
Consider seeking professional help.",How to Set a Bedtime for Toddlers3," It can take a few weeks for a child to completely adjust to a new sleep schedule. If your child is still having difficulty adjusting, consider revamping the bedtime routine. Try changing the order of your routine, or trying a different bedtime.

, For toddlers who do not like being left alone in the room and use this excuse to delay sleeping, you can curb this behavior by firmly telling your toddler that after you kiss her goodnight, you will leave the room but that you will leave the door slightly open in case she needs you. Some toddlers do get upset and cry or yell for you when you leave the room. It is okay to return to your toddler’s room, but only stay for a brief while.


The purpose is to not let your toddler get used to your presence in order for her to sleep. What you are aiming at is for your toddler to set a bedtime routine for herself. Some parents may disagree but as they say, it gets worse before it gets better. When you consistently show your toddler the kind of bedtime routine she needs, she will eventually learn the routine and fall asleep on her own at the designated time.

, If your toddler continues to be upset or won’t stop crying, stay with her for a while but make it “boring”; don’t cuddle with your toddler and don’t start a conversation.


Sit quietly and, try to stay for as little a time as possible. Just continue to reassure your toddler that you will visit and check on her again after some time; and make sure that you do in fact check on her.

, If your toddler says that she is not sleepy, don’t argue and don’t validate his protest. Simply tell her that it’s bedtime and then continue through the process of the bedtime routine you have set up.


If your child gets out of bed and leaves her room, don’t get upset. Instead, calmly take her back to her room and tuck her in again. Remind her that it is bedtime. If you leave the room and she stays in bed, check in on her after a couple of minutes. If she is in bed but still awake, praise her for staying in bed, and then leave the room again.

, Within a few weeks, your child should be falling asleep fairly easily. If it continues to be an issue, talk to your child’s pediatrician for their recommendations and to see if other issues, such as apnea or restless leg syndrome, could be affecting your child’s sleep habits.

Paint over the blank canvas or piece of paper to give your child a base.,
Show your child how to use a paint brush.,
Suggest a theme or image.,
Explain how to mix basic colors.,
Provide creative painting materials like marbles, feathers, and yarn.",How to Paint With Children," If you are setting up a work space for painting in a main area of your home, you may want to move out any items that you do not want to see painted on. Children will often get lost in their creativity and this may mean trying to paint on every surface or item available, or getting messy with paint and not paying attention to where it lands. Rugs, couches, chairs, and anything made of fabric should be covered or moved, as it can be difficult to get paint out of these items.Good work areas for painting with children include garages, basements, and outdoor patios. These are often areas with lots of empty space for painting and getting messy.;
, Get the work space/painting area ready by putting down newspapers or other paper on surfaces where you know your child will be painting. You can also tape down garbage bags to tables and chairs if you really want to protect your furniture from any paint splashes.Some parents suggest setting up a small easel for your child to paint on. You can buy child sized easels at your local toy store or create your own using an easel stand and a piece of plywood. You can then attach a piece of paper to the easel or prop up canvas on the easel for your child to paint on.

, You should dress your child in paint friendly clothing, such as an old t-shirt and pants, and tie up her hair if necessary so it does not get in the paint. It’s a good idea for you to also change into paint friendly clothing so you can assist your child as she paints and not worry about ruining your clothing., If you are painting with a child under 12 years old, you should only be using paint that conforms to ASTM D-4236. This specification means the paints are not hazardous to children and safe for children to handle. Child friendly paint will have this specification printed on the label.Try to get at least four to five colors of paint to give your child some choices when it comes to mixing colors. Start with the primary colors (red, yellow, blue) as well as some secondary colors (green, orange, purple) so your child has options when she paints.


Depending on the art project, you may use water based paints or house paint. Just make sure the paint is ASTM D-4236 specified and it should be fine for your child to use.
Never use adult grade paints when painting with children as they contain hazards pigments like lead, cadmium, and formaldehyde. You should also avoid using acrylic paint unless your child is older and more confident mixing paints, as it can be very expensive and run out quickly.

, Depending on how much money you want to spend on the painting project, you may go for simple white art paper or a plain canvas. You can find art paper and small plain canvases at your local craft store.Many children enjoy the freedom of having big sheets of white art paper to paint on as they play around with color and texture. Canvas will be a more expensive option but can be good if you intend to hang your child’s painting once it’s done.

, Unless you are going to encourage your child to do finger painting, you will need to provide at least one to two paint brushes. You will also need to provide a plastic mixing palette so your child can mix her own colors, with your help. Empty egg cartons work well as do it yourself mixing palettes, as well as baby food jars, as you can put the lid on the jars to save any leftover paint.It can also help to put the paint in squeeze bottles so it is easy for your child to squeeze onto the mixing palette as she paints.
Popsicle sticks are ideal as mixing tools, as this will discourage your child from using her fingers to mix the paint.

, To prevent your child’s painting from having patches of bright white between colors, you can provide a base color on the canvas or piece of paper. This will then allow your child to paint over the base color and layer paint in a creative way.


If you do provide a base color, choose a light color like light orange, yellow, or blue. Your child may tell you what color she would like as her base color or that she would prefer not to have a base color. Be open to her suggestions; this is her paint project after all!

, If your child has never used a paint brush before, you may want to demonstrate how to dip the brush in paint and apply it to the paper or canvas. Start with a small amount of paint and show your child how to paint straight lines, circles, and how to cover a small area of the paper or canvas.


Allow your child to try to use the paint brush on her own after your demonstration. If she is familiar with numbers and letters, you may help her to paint the first letter of her name or her favorite number. This will help her get used to using the paint brush.

, Get your child’s creative juices flowing by suggesting she draw what she sees outside the window, such as trees, the sun, and grass. You can also suggest she paint the members of her family or use her favorite color to paint her best friend.


Often, children will come up with their own images and themes as they paint and play around with being creative. Encourage your child to express herself as she sees fit and avoid correcting her painting. She should feel free to explore different representations and images and have fun as she paints.

, Depending on how old your child is, it may be appropriate to show her how to mix basic colors so she does not end up with a mud painting, where every color is mixed together to form a brown shade.Start with the primary colors and show her how to mix the primary colors together to make different colors using a popsicle stick. For example, red with blue to make purple, yellow and blue to make green, yellow and red to make orange. Once your child seems confident with mixing colors together, you can introduce white so she can make lighter shades like pink or light blue.

, To up the creative ante, you can give your child different painting materials besides a paint brush. Marbles and feathers dipped in paint can be fun to use against paper or canvas to create some fun textures. Yarn can also be a good way to create shapes and images against a painted background. Be open to letting your child play around with different materials and textures.If you have a bigger paint area, you can lay down plastic table cloths or paint cloth and show your child how to do drip painting, where she holds the popsicle stick of paint over the paper or canvas and lets the paint drip onto the surface. She can then rotate and move the popsicle stick to make different drip patterns. This can be another fun way to paint without a paint brush.

Read books with the children.,
Involve them in dramatic play.,
Use flashcards.,
Have them draw how they're feeling.,
Create a feeling wheel together.",How to Teach Preschool Children About Emotions & Feelings," There are many, MANY books about feelings for preschool-aged children. Some of the ones I've used are The Way I Feel by Janan Cain, Today I Feel Silly by Jamie Lee Curtis, and my personal favorite Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day by Judith Viorst. Most kids love storytime, and it's a great opportunity to incorporate the theme.;
, Whether it's in the classroom, at a community center, or at home, dramatic play is an important part of understanding emotions and how to express them. Play theater games with them, such as Feelings Charades or Mirror (face each other and choose who the mirror is; the mirror copies the other person). Even just acting out a favorite story, such as the Three Little Pigs, can teach children about appropriate emotions (e.g. if they're the Wolf: ""Is he happy right now? Is he mad?"")

, Flashcards allow for a variety of activity. You can start with basic recognition exercises, and then change it up by playing a matching, memory, charades, or any other game you think up.

, Depending on the skill level of each child, this may be a self-portrait of how they feel or simply a representation. Allow this activity to be completely child-directed; joy can be expressed with swirls, frustration with dots, anger with scribbles. If they feel open to it, talk with them about why they drew their feelings that way.

, It's important that the children are involved in this process, or they may not understand the objective. Read about and discuss various emotions that they might feel each day. If you're a teacher, have your ""Star of the Day"" (or something similar) indicate how they feel that day and why. Try to have varying degrees of ""Happy"", ""Sad"", and ""Mad"", such as ""Silly"", ""Tired"", and ""Frustrated"" so that children are encouraged to pick a new emotion.

Schedule your cleaning.,
Set aside a morning for cleaning.,
Plan major tasks for your older child.,
Make lists or chore charts.,
Give clear directions.",How to Do Spring Cleaning with Kids1," Tell your child in advance about your cleaning schedule. Announce the day and which tasks you’ll be tackling. Give specific examples of what you’ll be doing and what the positive outcomes will be.For example, say to a child under 10: “Next Sunday we’ll be making more space for your summer toys in the garage. We’ll be taking out old stuff and reorganizing so you can find your toys and bikes more easily. Then we can take a bike ride!”
For a tween or teenager, emphasize responsibility: “We will clean the dining room this weekend. You’ll be in charge of polishing the furniture and the silver.”;
, For a small child, set aside one morning each week for a small spring cleaning project. Talk to your child about what you will do together to complete each project. Little kids have short attention spans, so break down the project into smaller tasks.For example, say: “We’ll be cleaning the playroom next week. First we will put your toys away, then we will vacuum the rug.”

, Engage older children in larger projects. For example, assign your teen landscaping projects, like weeding and seeding the garden, building rock walls and garden trellises, and spreading mulch. Let them help you schedule the order in which tasks should be completed and when they plan to do them.

, Write down specific tasks for your child to accomplish. Add a column for them to check off when they’ve completed each task. To make it more fun and engaging, ask your younger child to decorate their list or chart.


Upload a task list to your tween or teen’s cell phone.
Buy stickers to put in the check boxes when each task is complete. Allow your child to choose the sticker as a reward.
Draw pictures to represent the tasks for a toddler. You could also cut and paste pictures instead of drawing.

, Be very specific about your expectations instead of saying something general like “dust the living room.” Tell your child exactly what they are to do. Break the directions down into steps if possible.For example, say: “Take your duster and brush it over all of the shelves in the bookcase. Next, dust with your duster on top of and around the TV.”
For more complicated chores, write down step-by-step instructions, including the tools and cleaning products needed for the job.
For example, give your teen written instructions on how to clean the grout in the bathrooms, and list the scrub brushes and cleaners needed to get the job done.

"
"
Work as a team.,
Use a timer.,
Play music.,
Give your older child more autonomy.",How to Do Spring Cleaning with Kids2," Begin each task with your child. Show them what you want done and demonstrate cleaning techniques. Keep an upbeat attitude and emphasize the importance of teamwork.Use this time to model behavior about teamwork and about the importance of cleaning.
Divide tasks in each room. For example, you can clean the tops of mirrors and windows while your young child cleans the lower half with you.
You and your older child can work together to determine the tasks needed to clean each room and each choose the jobs you can do best.
Give a tween or teen the more exciting jobs, like using a power washer to clean your patio.

, Break tasks down into smaller chunks that can be accomplished quickly. For example, when cleaning bedrooms, start by making beds. Assign your child one short task at a time, then set a timer. Tell them that if they complete the task before the timer goes off, they can have a reward like extra play time or an extra sticker on their chore chart.


Find age appropriate rewards. For example, let a tween spend time on their phone or the computer if they finish before the timer goes off.

, Find upbeat music to play while you clean. Let your child help you choose the songs. Ask your tween or teen to create a playlist. Sing along and take dance breaks to motivate yourselves.Time them with music. Tell your child that if they finish a task before the song ends, they can take a dance break.

, Taking responsibility for a major cleaning job will motivate an older child. Assign your tween or teenager an important chore, like vacuuming all of the furniture, shampooing the carpets, or polishing the floors. Give them a few tips and the tools for the job, then tell them that you trust them to get the job done. Set a deadline and let them work at their own pace.


Praise them as they are working and when they’ve completed the job.
Reward them with a slightly later curfew, extra driving privileges, a book, or a trip to Starbucks.

Give your child a cleaning kit.,
Play games with a child under 10.,
Make dusting fun.,
Do detective work in the kitchen.,
Have a garage sale.",How to Do Spring Cleaning with Kids3," Put together a set of cleaning tools for your child. For children under 10, include child-safe cleaners, like spray bottles with water and vinegar. Try to find smaller feather dusters, child-sized aprons and cleaning gloves, and make rags from brightly colored old clothes. Put everything together in their own cleaning caddy.Let them decorate spray bottles and the caddy.
Include their own handheld vacuum and other grown-up tools for an older child.
If you’re making cleaning products from scratch, let your older child find, measure, and mix the ingredients.

, Try the color game, where children have to clean things that are a color you shout out. For example, they need to pick up all blue toys and books when you call out “blue.” Play follow the leader, where the leader walks through a room dusting and putting things away while the other player(s) follow along and do similar tasks. Change leaders for every room you will clean., Give your child old socks and have them skate around hardwood floors to collect dust bunnies. Let them pull books out of the bookshelves and dust the shelves and then reorganize the books on the shelves. Hide stickers or treats around places you’ve asked your child to dust and let them collect all of the stickers or treats as they dust.Hide a gift card or money for a tween or teen to find.
Give your tween or teen a ladder and ask them to dust ceiling fans and other high areas.

, Tell your child they are your kitchen detective. Have an older child search for expired foods in the pantry and refrigerator. Next, ask them to sort them into garbage, recycling, or trash and to dispose of the expired food accordingly. Ask a younger child sort and alphabetize cans in the pantry or spices in the spice rack.

, Collect all of the old things you’re ready to get rid of after your spring cleaning. Decide which you should donate and which you can sell. Have your child help you make colorful signs for your sale and post them in your neighborhood. Ask your teen to post a flier online through social media if they use it.Price items together with your tween or teen.
Ask your child to help you display the items and put price stickers on them.
An older child can help collect money and make change.
Older and younger children can help demonstrate items to potential customers.
Reward your child with some of the profits, either as cash or with a trip to a restaurant, ice cream parlor, arcade, or other fun destination.

Encourage them when they're struggling.",How to Teach Your Child Math," One of the most basic math lessons you can use in your everyday life is counting. Count how many plates are needed for the table, how many signs are on the road to school, how many toys are on the floor, and so on. If you naturally incorporate counting into your speech, your child will start picking up on it and doing it themselves., Your child can't communicate math on paper until they know what numbers look like when written. As you notice numbers in the world, point them out to your child. You can also use things like number puzzles or hopscotch to work on number recognition., Most of the time, you use math on a day-to-day basis. Try thinking out loud when you find yourself using math to show your kids where math is relevant. For instance, you can talk about comparing prices at the grocery store or measuring for a recipe.Just like reading, it's important to get kids doing math every day.

, Shapes are important for understanding geometry. You can ask your child to name shapes as you run errands, as well as to name the shapes they play with. You can also do things like bake cookies with basic shapes, which combines learning and fun., While direct questions are helpful in learning the basics of math, estimation questions require kids to think through a problem, not just spout out a basic answer. This tip works for both younger and older kids, but you may need to adjust the question.For instance, an estimation question could be, ""How much water do you think will fill up this pitcher?"" Let your child try their hand at estimating, and then you can do an experiment to see how close the guess was. For younger kids, you might need to first show them how much a cup is.
For older kids, you can try more complex questions, such as ""How long will it take to fill the bathtub with water?""

, If your child is recognizing numbers, it's not that much of a leap to work on writing numbers. You can have your child mimic how you write a number, for instance. You can also write out numbers and have your child trace them, then try writing the numbers on their own.You can try more tactile methods, such as drawing numbers in shaving foam or sand.

, The dot method involves your child drawing dots to help them solve addition and subtraction problems. For example, if the problem is three plus five, your child would draw three dots in one group and five in the next. Then the child would count all the dots to get the answer.Start with numbers less then ten at first. Once they have that down, you can introduce adding ten to a number.This method also works for multiplication and division. For instance, if the problem is 4 X 6, the child would draw 4 groups of 6 dots, then count to get the answer. You can challenge your child by asking questions like, ""What if it had been four groups of seven?""
For basic math, you can teach your kids to use their fingers to add, similar to the dot method.

, Another way to help your child understand the concepts of math is to use number bonds. That is, start by working on all the pairs that add together to make five (0+5, 1+4, 2+3, 3+2, and so one) by having them solve these pairs with the dot method. Then you can work on bonded pairs for ten., While working on understanding the concepts themselves will help your child learn math, pairing it with some memorization can be beneficial. Memorization can make math go quicker, so that they don't need to think through every problem.You can work on memorizing times tables, for instance, by using flash cards.
One exercise that combines understanding and memorization is having your child count by 3s, 4s, 5s, and so on. Your child will need to think through the problem, and they will eventually realize that multiplying is just a form of adding. At the same time, repeatedly counting by these numbers will aid with memorization.

, If the same activities over and over are getting boring, supplement what you're teaching with new ideas. Educational websites are great place to pick up new ideas that you and your child will love.You'll likely be able to find fun worksheets and games to help your kids learn more math.

, Toys like interlocking blocks and ones with pipes and joints are a great way to get your child engaged in spatial relationships. In addition, these toys help your kid move from pieces to more complex, larger ideas.Sit down and play blocks with your kid. When your kid sees you building a rocket ship or a castle, they'll want to build their own structures.

, Another great way to engage your kids in some tactile geometry is to teach them origami. Stick to very simple designs for younger kids, who will find more complex designs frustrating., Kids who learn music generally do better in math. For one, basic counting skills are needed to do well in music. Plus, the abstract thinking your child does in making music has strong ties to the thinking needed for math.Kids of any age, including tweens and teens, will benefit from learning music.

, Board games will often get kids doing math without them even realizing it. For instance, classic games like Chutes and Ladders or Hi-Ho! Cherry-O require counting. Monopoly is a great way to incorporate math for older kids.You don't have to stick with the classics. Plenty of new games focus on helping kids learn math, too. Plus, you can find more advanced games for older kids that require math. For instance, bluffing games such as the Sheriff of Nottingham require your kid to think about the probability of certain outcomes.

, Spatial games, like ""Mother, May I?"" can help your child learn spatial words and concepts. Try playing the game with your kids or encourage them to play with each other. Certain songs can help with these concepts, as well, such as the Hokey Pokey., When you're not actively teaching your child math, they can still be working on those skills with apps built for computers and kids' tablets. Apps like Kids Math, Counting Caterpillar, Math Training for Kids, and Marble Math Junior are all great apps to encourage math skills.You can also find educational math apps for teens and tweens.

, One math skill that is important is independent thinking. You may be tempted to swoop in to show your kid how to solve a problem when they're struggling. However, encouraging your kid to work it out for themselves will help them learn to think independently.That doesn't mean they can't look up help for similar problems online. Having them look up how to do a problem themselves still teaches independence.

, Some tweens and teens may not find math all that exciting by itself. However, you can incorporate it into other disciplines to make it more interesting. For instance, you can do science experiments where kids need to measure out ingredients. You could also incorporate math into history, such as figuring out what percentage of the population was wiped out by a plague., Most of the time, there's more than one way to solve a problem. Teaching your kid to try different approaches will help them solve more complex problems. If they come at it from one direction and find it doesn't work, they can switch to another approach to find a solution, which helps them work independently., Kids may have heard that they're either a ""math"" person or they're not. If they've come to the conclusion they're not a math person, it makes math that much harder. Tell them anyone can get math down, but they might just have to work a little harder at it.For instance, you could say, ""I know you find math hard, but that means you just have to work a little harder at it. Anyone can be a 'math' person. Plus, you'll feel so good when you work hard and finally figure it out!""

Check your baby’s feet to make sure she can flatten them.,
Consult with your pediatrician if your baby falls excessively, her legs seem very stiff, or she continually stumbles to one side.,
Let your baby explore as she gets more comfortable with walking.",How to Teach Your Baby to Walk," This will strengthen her leg muscles, especially if she is still crawling or just starting to pull herself up.You should also show her how to bend her knees and have her practice bending her knees so she develops the motor skills to stand up and sit down.;
, At around 5 to 6 months of age, provide your baby with a bouncy chair that will help her to start building her leg muscles.Avoid getting your baby a walker as The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) discourages the use of walkers for babies. Studies show they can actually slow motor development and cause back problems for babies. They are also a safety hazard, as walkers can tip over or roll down stairs.Walkers are banned for use in Canada and the AAP is recommending the U.S. take the same measure against walkers., Place a toy just out of reach of your baby, above them, or located in a spot she has to stand to get to., Most babies start to get up onto their feet on their own, before they know how to get back down, so don’t be alarmed if your baby cries for help while in the standing position.Rather than pick her up when she starts to fuss, help her learn to sit down by gently bending her knees and supporting her weight until she reaches the floor safely.

, Cruising is when your baby starts to use the furniture and other surfaces/objects as support as she begins to walk around. Move your furniture into a stable line, making sure it is all baby proofed of course, so your baby can easily cruise around on her own.In fact, once your baby starts to cruise, it’s a good idea to childproof your home again, as she can reach new heights, and possibly, new hazards.Help your baby let go of the furniture as she cruises by holding out your fingers and allowing her to grip you with both hands. Soon enough, she’ll be holding on to you with one hand or even letting go altogether., A push toy, like a small shopping cart, or a pint-sized lawn mower, will support your baby as she practices cruising. It will also give her control as she learns to walk, refines her balance, and boosts her confidence.If your baby is just starting to cruise on her own, start with a toy that does not have wheels. Once you are confident your baby is strong enough, introduce a push toy with wheels.Always check that the push toy is sturdy, and has a bar or handle that has a good grip, as well as big wheels, as this will make it harder for the toy to tip over., Allow your baby to grip your fingers and pull her up to a standing position, so she is basically supporting her own weight. Let her walk around as you support her under her arms.The most time your baby spends exercising her legs, the sooner she will begin to try to take steps on her own.
Holding your baby as she stands will also help her legs to straighten out and prevent them from bowing later. Bowed legs typically go away by the time your baby is 18 months old, but this issue can linger until she is 3 years old., Most babies seem born with an inherent desire to please mom and dad, and receive praise, claps, and shouts of encouragement. So let your baby know when they are doing a great job at standing or cruising by offering her visible encouragement and praise., There is no need to invest in a shoe collection for your little one, as the best shoes for your baby are no shoes at all.As long as the indoor surfaces are clean and safe for your baby to walk on, let her walk and explore barefoot (or, if you’d prefer, non-slip socks) as much as possible to help build muscle tone in her feet and ankles, help her arches develop, and help her learn balance and coordination.
If your baby is going to be walking outdoors, make sure her shoes are lightweight and flexible. Avoid tall booties or high top sneakers as too much ankle support can actually slow down your little one by constricting her movement.

, This can instill fear in your baby and delay her from standing or walking.Many babies will walk when they are ready, so don’t be alarmed if your baby doesn’t start walking until she is 18 months old, or possibly, older than 18 months., To encourage your baby to get used to balancing on her own two feet, try to make balancing a fun game, with lots of encouragement and praise.Sit on the floor with your baby and help her to stand up. Then, count out loud how long she can stay up before she tumbles down. Clap and praise her after each balancing attempt.

, Do this by placing her down in a standing position, as opposed to a sitting position on her butt., This might help your baby to be confident and motivated enough to take her first steps.

, The first steps are a big moment for your little one, so be sure to be as excited and encouraging as possible about your baby’s first steps.Cheering your baby as she walks indicates she is doing something right and will give her the confidence to keep walking.

, Don’t be too alarmed if your little walker goes back to crawling after a bad fall or an illness. Your child is also working on other developmental feats like sounding out names or tackling finger foods, so she may take a few weeks or even a month, break from walking.Some babies may be more comfortable at first with crawling so they may do the crawl/walk before they fully embrace walking., When your baby starts to walk, she may bob, weave, and even take a dive as she tries to refine her walking skills. As well, most babies don’t have good depth perception so they tend to bump into or fall into things rather than walk right up to them.As long as your home is childproofed for a walking baby and you watch her carefully at all times, don’t stress about her inevitable and numerous tumbles. She may cry when she falls but chances are she is more frustrated than injured.
Her diaper and little tush will work as built-in bumpers for any falls, and she will likely forgot her trips and tumbles before you do. Avoid making a big deal out of little falls as she learns how to walk on her own.

, Not all babies are the same, so don’t be alarmed if your baby isn’t walking at a certain age. The time it takes for a baby to reach a particular milestone, like walking, can vary due to different body weights or even different personalities. Keep in mind a walking timeline is an approximation and not set in stone or an absolute requirement for every baby.Some babies who are born prematurely may have more trouble reaching milestones at the same rate as other children born at full-term.As well, sometimes babies are just frightened of letting go of your fingers and taking their first steps. So it’s very important to encourage and support your baby as she learns to walk and not to put too much pressure or stress on her.

, In fact, it’s just baby fat plumping her feet up. By around age 2 to 3, that extra “fluff” on her feet should melt away and you should be able to see her natural arches.Her feet may also curve inward, appearing like half moons, which is another infant holdover. Over time, her feet should straighten out.

, Also commonly known as “toeing-in”, pigeon toed feet come from an internal tibial torsion, meaning your baby’s shinbones are turned inward.This will correct on its own within six months of your baby’s first steps.
If your baby still has pigeon-toed feet after six months, ask your pediatrician about stretching exercises to correct the problem.

, Some babies will have a natural desire to walk around on their tiptoes, which actually helps them develop their sense of balance. This is almost always a quirk that will go away on its own, but rarely, it can be an indication of a too-tight muscle in your baby’s heels or feet.If your baby cannot physically flatten her feet on her own, or if she is walking on her tiptoes past the age of 3, let her pediatrician know, as this could be a sign of a developmental issue.

, There may be signs of possible nerve, joint, or spinal issues., As she gains more confidence and becomes more comfortable with walking on flat, smooth surfaces, allow her to also try walking on an incline or on uneven surfaces. These new environments will help to develop your baby’s sense of balance."

Teach storytelling techniques.,
Give feedback to students.",How to Teach Storytelling," Teach others the art of telling stories by first becoming an engaging storyteller.


Take a storytelling class. Sign up for a storytelling workshop at a college or community center.
Practice telling stories. Strengthen your storytelling skills by taking the opportunity to tell relevant stories whenever possible to your colleagues, students, friends, relatives and neighbors.;
, Attentiveness, laughter, an emotional response and/or sustained eye contact are indications that you are achieving your storytelling goal. A listener's attempts to change the subject, fidgety mannerisms and general inattentiveness may indicate a need to adjust the pace, tone, details or other elements of your storytelling technique.

, If you are losing the attention of your listeners, make sure that your story is relevant to your audience and that it has a clear beginning, middle and an end. Identify your reason for telling the story and whether it will meet the needs of your listener.


Use props, sounds and visual tools. If teaching young children, a story about a cat with a strange meow will capture their attention more if accompanied by your enactment of the actual meow. To persuade adults to conform to your opinion or to sell a product, using pictures and presentation software may enhance the story and help you to achieve the storytelling goal.

, You will know that you have mastered storytelling when children ask that you retell a story or adults ask you to share the story with others. Other indications that you are a storytelling master are sustained engagement on the part of your listeners and/or positive changes in behavior as a result of telling a story.

, Your students may be young children in a school where you are already a teacher. Or they may be adults who report to you in a marketing firm where you are a manager.

,


Give explanations and structure to children. Young children need structured activities, continual guidance and verbal instructions.
Provide a syllabus, handout and reading materials to adults. Teens and adults are more self-directed and benefit from materials that they can read on their own, such as an explanation of storytelling techniques and upcoming assignments.

, Share the knowledge and skills that you gained in the process of becoming an effective storyteller.


Ask the class to think of an interesting story. Provide ideas related to the particular age group and goal of the class. A public speaking class intended to improve an adults social life will tell different types of stories than a group of salespeople trying to sell a product.

, Observe your own engagement while listening to students' stories, as well as classmates' reactions. Pay particular attention to the storytelling speed, tone, details, gestures, props and graphics tools.


Encourage students by providing positive feedback. Public speaking is a prevalent fear, so comment on things that students did well to generate a desire to continue perfecting their storytelling skills.
Provide constructive criticism. Instead of saying that a story was boring, draw the student's attention to areas of the story that can be enlivened by adding interesting details or voice inflections.

Make respect a requirement for getting the things the children like.,
Try your best to control your own negative emotions.,
Encourage activities that require sharing and cooperation.,
Show that it's OK to make mistakes.,
Be patient.",How to Teach Respect1," When it comes to teaching children respect, it all boils down to this. Children are very impressionable. In addition, they naturally look up to their caretakers and try to imitate these people. Live a kind, caring, respectful life and your children will learn that this is the way adults are expected to behave. On the other hand, act disrespectfully to your children or other people in your life and they may soon pick up your bad habits.


See our main article on how to be respectful for lots of tips on this topic.;
, In the ""real world,"" when people aren't respectful, they don't get what they want. Their date throws a drink in their face, they get asked to leave, and in extreme cases, they get tossed in jail. When they are respectful, though, they can get what they want. Teach this lesson to children by only giving them what they want when they are respectful. They'll quickly learn that it's almost always smarter to be kind than to throw a fit.


For example, if your children love their video games, let them play them only if they've been respectful to you in the past day. If they've been rude, insulting, or disobedient, take them away and do not give them back until they can go an entire day without any bad behavior.

, Children don't have the argumentative skills that adults do. Losing your temper can be a scary, confusing experience for them. Worse, it can teach them that it's OK to yell, mock, or threaten other people when they become frustrated. Always remember that you're setting an example for your children. Show them that difficult situations are best conquered with a cool head.


If you must, give yourself chances to ""let off steam"" when your kids aren't around. Have someone else watch the kids while you pummel a punching bag, for instance.

, One of the reasons respect is so important is that it's needed to form helpful friendships and relationships with others. Teach your children that respect allows them to build bridges by giving them fun opportunities to work with teammates and partners toward a mutual goal. If they get rude or possessive, warn them. If they keep it up, end the activity.


One great example is to play a board game (ideally with teams). For the game to ""work,"" the children will have to respect the other players and exercise patience.

, No one's perfect. Being respectful shouldn't mean ""never screwing up."" Children — especially young ones — will make lots of mistakes. If your child messes up in front of you and truly didn't know any better, don't get upset or punish the child. Use it as a teaching experience so that your child can eventually learn not to make this same mistake again.


You'll also want to acknowledge your own mistakes. If you do something like swearing in front of your children or yelling when you're angry, apologize. Your apology teaches children to self-correct should they make a similar mistake.

, Patience is a sign of respect. It may take some children longer to learn how to behave respectfully around others. Becoming impatient with children only teaches them to become impatient people, so instead take time to explain the problem to your children — even if they've made the same mistake a million times before.

Be strict, but fair.,
Meet disrespect with respect.,
Be consistent.,
Make your punishments fit the crime.",How to Teach Respect2," Sooner or later, all children will find themselves in a world where they need to obey the rules or suffer harsh consequences. By making your children obey the rules at home, you're actually doing them a favor in the long run. Don't ever punish your children unless they're disrespectful, but when they are, don't hesitate to show them that they've done something wrong.


Your rules should be reasonable, simple, and consistent. Be clear with your children about what the rules in your house early on. Don't get upset if your children break a rule that they weren't even aware of.

, When your child is disrespectful to you, you have two choices: you can lash out in the same way, or you can fight to stay calm. The former option teaches your child that it is acceptable to be rude when someone starts frustrating you. The latter, which is the better choice, teaches that it's important to stay respectful even in the face of people who won't do the same for you. If you can manage to stay respectful, your children will thank you when they eventually have to deal with an annoying boss or an unpleasant teacher.

, This is vital. Consistent enforcement of your rules shows your children that it's not possible to weasel out of their responsibilities. On the other hand, if you fail to teach your children respect when you're tired or when it's inconvenient, they'll quickly learn that they can get away with bad behavior sometimes. Children are smarter than they're often given credit for. If there's a way for them to get out of learning a valuable lesson, they'll often find it.


It's also important to make sure your partner is on the same page as you here. Having one caretaker who is ""hard"" and another who is ""soft"" will just teach your children to go to the soft one when they've misbehaved.

, Whenever you can, have the punishment for disrespect be the natural consequences of your child's actions. In other words, if their disrespect causes something bad to happen to them, let this happen (as long as it is not a serious, physical danger, obviously). The earlier children learn that being disrespectful only creates problems for themselves, the better.


For example, if your child is repeatedly rude to her friend when they are playing together, a good natural consequence might be to send the friend home, have your child hand-write an apology letter, and hand-deliver it.

The downside to using consignment stores, however, is that half of the money you make from selling the dress goes to them.If increasing the odds of selling the dress are more important to you than making money, consignment stores are the way to go.


Wedding dresses come and go out of fashion fairly quickly. To increase your chances even further, try to keep your dress in excellent condition and sell it within 2 1/2 years of when you first bought it.

, Instead of selling your wedding gown online, you could use local based advertising like Craigslist to sell it around town instead.There may not be anyone in your area who wants to buy your specific wedding gown, though, so this option is not as promising as using online wedding gown sites that will have larger audiences.

, The sheer number of used wedding dresses being sold online and in classified ads makes it difficult to sell your own. Your ad should grab a buyer’s attention, hold their interest, and make them want to buy it.Emphasize the excellent condition of your dress and how much you loved it on your day. If you purchased it from a well known designer, be sure to use their name in your ad.
Be fair when setting your price. No matter how appealing your ad is, no one will buy your dress if the price is too high. Browse the market to see how much similar dresses are selling for and set your price accordingly.

For a winter wedding, long sleeves are appropriate while being stunningly chic. When you make appointments at bridal shops, make sure to tell them that you are interested in gowns with sleeves, and they can pull those styles aside for you.Gowns with sleeves are certainly less common, and you’ll make a major statement by choosing to cover up. Embrace the unique opportunities that come with a winter wedding!;
, Airy, lightweight dresses are gorgeous, but a winter wedding calls for a more substantial dress. Luckily, many beautiful fabrics fall into this category. Not only will heavier dresses keep you warm while you’re outdoors, they’ll look much more seasonally appropriate than the thinner gowns.Satin and velvet are both beautiful, heavier fabrics for winter gowns. If you love a fabric like tulle, lace, or chiffon, it can always be layered a heavier fabric., Sometimes you fall in love with a gown and can’t imagine getting married in anything else. If you happen to adore a wedding dress that is lightweight and potentially not as warm, don’t fret! Ask the specialist at the bridal store or a bridal alterations specialist if they can add a satin lining to the dress you’ve picked. This will keep you warm and allow you to rock the dress you feel best in.Keep in mind that this is a more elaborate alteration, which naturally means a bit more time and money for the alterationist. The exact timeframe and cost will depend on the complexity and style of your gown, so leave some wiggle room in your dress budget and don't wait until the last minute.

, Big, full skirts were practically made for winter wonderland weddings. Not only do these dresses look dramatic and sophisticated, the full skirts will help keep your legs warm. You’ll look like a princess (or a queen) on your big day, and your ball gown will insulate you from the winter weather.Tell the bridal shop that you're looking for ballgown or a-line silhouettes.You can find these types of gowns in anything from chiffon to ruched satin.

, Winter is a sparkly season. From Christmas lights to the New Year’s Eve Ball to the icicles hanging from roofs, twinkly lights are everywhere. Why not include a bit of this sparkle on your dress? Look for gowns with crystal beading or other embellishments to embrace the winter wonderland vibe.You can opt for a gown that’s beaded from top to bottom, or one with just some extra bling around the bodice. Any sparkle is good sparkle!
If you don't have any bling on the dress, don't hesitate to add some to your look with jewelry!

, With a winter gown, you can take some bold risks that summer brides couldn’t pull off. Incorporating gold and silver into your gown is an eye-catching way to make a statement. Look for dresses with gold and silver threading and embroidery. The detailing will make your gown look glamorous, while bringing in the depth and richness of a winter wedding.If you really want to embrace this idea, call ahead to bridal shops and explain you're looking for a dress with these metallic details. They can pull out dresses with patterns and embroidery that fit the bill.
You can also add a metallic touch to a gown by adding a sash.

, When you hear the phrase “flower crown,” you probably picture the bright, colorful flower crowns worn by spring and summer brides. However, winter brides can wear their own version of the popular accessory. Instead of colorful flowers, look for (or craft) a rich evergreen crown. Then, you can add whatever flowers you are using for the rest of the festivities.You want your winter wedding flower crown to look more like a Christmas wreath than a spring bouquet.
Choose a crown with more greenery than flowers. The deeper the green, the better. More muted flowers work beautifully in the winter, as well as metallic detailing.

, Velvet is a cozy yet glamorous winter staple. Whether you’re wearing sky high heels or ballet flats, velvet footwear is a perfect accessory for a winter wedding. Add a fun pop of color by getting a pair of velvet kicks in your wedding color – after all, they’ll be hidden underneath your dress for most of the day.This might be a no-brainer, but make sure to break in your velvet shoes before the big day!

, You probably don’t want to pop your puffy winter coat over your beautiful wedding dress. For your winter wedding, it’s a great idea to invest in some appropriate outwear. A faux fur stole is a great option, as well as a cashmere shawl in your wedding color. This will look sophisticated and glamorous in pictures, and you’ll be warm. Win, win!You can shop for faux fur stoles online, or check out your local department stores. The bridal shop where you purchased your dress might be able to point you in the right direction.
Bring a swatch of your wedding colors to a department store if you're searching for a cashmere wrap or shawl. This will ensure your colors don't clash on the big day.

, You may not be planning to be outside much on your wedding day, but you’ll likely get at least a few photos outside. Keep your hands warm (and reduce the risk of blue hands ruining your photos) by investing in a nice pair of gloves. You can easily find these online, and you can order them to match your wedding dress or accessories. You can even find an ultra glamorous pair with beading or silk ribbons!, Winter weddings are unique, and winter brides should embrace that! Warm gloves and wraps are great, but why not just bundle up with your new spouse in a blanket?

Bring a spare pair of shoes.",How to Select Shoes to Wear With Your Wedding Dress," The era of traditional, high heeled, white, wedding shoes is over. Nowadays, you can get away with wearing any type of shoe to your wedding - be it dress shoes, sneakers, cowboy boots, or sandals. The most important thing is that whatever shoe you pick suits your personality. So you want to find one you’ll feel completely comfortable and happy in. For example, if you never wear heels, you probably don’t want to wear them on your wedding day. You’ll likely have trouble walking in them and will, in turn, feel awkward and uncomfortable.Or, if you commonly wear vintage items, buy a 40s or 50s inspired shoe from a site like Modcloth. In the same vein, if you’re the type of person always in workout gear, try a new pair of sneakers!;
, You can opt for the traditional and choose a color that matches your dress - which may mean having to bring a swatch along with you to ensure that your colors are identical - or you can go outside the box and pick a bright, standout color. The most popular colors for bridal shoes are white, neutral, yellow, violet, purple, gray, and black. However, picking a jewel tone like an emerald or a ruby is a great way to add some extra character to your gown and showcase your personality.Keep in mind if you can’t find the color you want, most shoes can be dyed.
There is also the option of picking a shade that diverts from your dress but matches your accessories, such as silver or gold.
You can also change up the color through embellishments, such as pearls, beads, sequins, and rhinestones.

, Raw silk, crepe, or satin shoes are common choices because these are often the fabrics of the dress. However, diverting from the norm and selecting a different fabric from the dress, like leather or metallic, can add a unique touch to the overall ensemble.


Keep in mind if you choose shoes that are vinyl or plastic, they are likely to pinch and rub awkwardly against your feet. They also don’t breathe well, which can cause your feet to swell more., Weddings are all day events and you don't want to kick your shoes off, at least until you have finished the formal dancing. The reality is that comfort is a very significant factor to consider when choosing a shoe, more-so than looks, and you don't want to find this out while you are cringing during the photo session. Heels should only be an option if you are used to wearing them, and if you are not, but you really want to wear them, then buy them well in advance to break them in and get used to them.


The shape of the shoe can also affect your comfort level. For example, a shoe with an open or rounded toe is likely to be more comfortable than a shoe with a pointed toe., Take into account the formality of the wedding, the style of your dress, and the season when selecting a wedding shoe. For example, a satin, open-toe, off-white slipper would work well with an off the shoulder, open back, satin gown during the summer. In contrast, a plain raw silk closed shoe would complement a traditional raw silk, full-skirted gown during the fall and winter months. Informal weddings allow for casual looks, such as ballet slippers or embellished sandals.

, Though it may seem like you can save the shoes for last, you ideally want to have them before you start your dress fittings. This is because the hemline of your dress, as well as the train if you have one, are dependent on the height of your shoes. For example, if you are wearing high heels you will want to have some extra room at the bottom of your dress to cover them.This will also help ensure you aren’t tripping over your dress if you don’t have enough of a heel.
If you don’t have shoes before your first fitting, try bringing a pair close to the ones you want - or think you’ll want. That way the seamstress has a good idea of how to alter your gown.

, Don’t just buy the first pair of shoes you find. Instead, if you see a style you like, shop around online for a similar pair for a better deal. Wedding shoes can cost anywhere between $20-$150 normally, and you want to make sure you aren’t overspending on shoes hardly anyone might see.Try online shoe stores like Zappos, RetailMeNot, or Walkin on Air.
You should also make sure whatever site you use offers refunds in case there is a problem.

, Regardless of the type of shoe you buy, you can always purchase extra items to help them reach an optimum level of comfort. For example, cushion insoles or non-slip sole stoppers will help make sure your shoes fit you correctly while helping prevent blisters.You can find these items at any drugstore like Walgreens or CVS. They are also relatively cheap, in case you want to purchase multiples.

, Since wedding planning is stressful enough, it’s always a good idea to bring along a support system. Not only will they be there to pep talk you when you get stressed, but they will also be able to offer their advice and opinions on your shoe choices. Just make sure whoever you bring along has a good idea of your personal style, if not, you may end up clashing over shoe styles.

, No matter how comfortable your wedding shoes are, it’s always smart to have an extra pair or back up. For example, you never know if you might break a heel or tear the fabric. For these reasons and comfort, most brides keep one pair for the wedding ceremony, pictures, and first dance at the reception, then change into a second pair for the rest of the evening. This second pair can be anything from flip-flops to sneakers, it’s up to you.


If you want something cheap and simple, try a pair of Fast Flats from Dr. Scholl’s. This is a small package you can keep in a purse or bag that only costs about $8."

Consider the wedding venue where the ceremony and festivities will be held, and what kind of weather you expect on your wedding day.,
Decide if you want to buy wedding shoes that you can wear to future events.,
Take a look at your wedding gown and decide what type of combination you want to create.,
Buy your wedding shoes.,
Wear them inside for a little while to get a feel of how comfortable they will be.",How to Buy Wedding Shoes,"


Consider the type of surface you'll be walking on and choose wedding shoes that offer enough stability. For example, you can wear most kinds of heels inside, but if you're getting married on a lawn or a beach, wedges, flats, and even elegant flip-flops are an excellent choice.
If you're getting married in a cold church during the winter, you'll need shoes that keep your feet warm but are still elegant. If you're getting married during a rainy season, the water can stain your shoes, especially if they're satin or suede. Make sure to apply a water-resistant coating to protect them.;
, If so, choose shoes that can be easily combined with other outfits and are durable enough to wear often.

,


Color is an important factor. Though most brides choose shoes in the same color as their dresses, some prefer a contrasting or bolder color such as bright red or light blue. If you choose wedding shoes in the same color as your gown, bring along a piece of the gown's fabric when buying wedding shoes to make sure you choose the exact same tint.
Determine how high you want the heels of your shoes to be, and how narrow the toes. Be very careful not to buy shoes for your wedding that are too uncomfortable to wear for a long period of time, as you'll need them during the ceremony, the reception, and the wedding dinner or party (unless you change outfits and/or shoes after the ceremony).
Decide what types of embellishments you want your wedding shoes to have. You can choose them to match the decorations on your dress or to contrast with your dress. For example, if your wedding dress has a lot of lace on it, you can choose lace shoes with the same pattern, or choose elegantly simple shoes with no embellishments. Or if your dress is very simple, with clear lines and few or no embellishments, you can choose wedding shoes with embellishments such as diamonds or flowers to match your wedding jewelry.
If your wedding dress is a mini-dress or another dress that leaves part of your legs bare, your shoes become more of a focal point, so be sure to coordinate them properly with the dress.
If you find shoes that are the right style but not the right color, formal wear shops can usually dye them to match your dress or another color of your choice.

, Make sure to keep the receipt so you can return them in case anything is unsatisfactory.

, You can return them if they're unsuitable.

It may also help to incorporate the concept of a ten frame at this point, including a ten frame with the appropriate number of units. For more on ten frames, see Part 2.;
, Children can usually learn to count to 20 fairly easily by rote memorization. Make it even easier by tackling the numbers just two at a time – first count to 12, then 14, and so on.


Note, however, that teaching children to count to 20 is not the same as teaching children to understand the number values. Counting needs to be accompanied by other lessons aimed at number awareness and comprehension.

, Once children know the individual numbers and can count to 20 in the correct order, have them practice writing the numbers themselves. For best results, have them pronounce the numbers out loud as they write them.

, Showing children a number line, marked at even intervals with the numbers from 0 to 20, may help them visualize the progression of numbers.

, Some children have more success learning these numbers when they use objects they can touch. Have children count out sticks, pencils, cubes, marbles, or other small items. Reinforce the fact that if they count objects one by one, the number they reach when they stop counting is equivalent to the number of objects they have accumulated.

, Have children count their steps (stairs are great for this, but it’s also fine just to walk from one side of a room to the other), or have them jump up and down 20 times, counting as they go.


Hopscotch games work well for this purpose. Draw 10 squares on the ground, and fill them with the numbers from 1 to 10. Have children count from 1 to 10 when they hop forward and from 11 to 20 when they hop backward.

, Take every opportunity to count to twenty and demonstrate number awareness. The more children practice, the better their results will be.

, Tell children that all the numbers from 11 to 19 are made up of one ten and a number of additional units. The number 20 is made of two whole tens.


Help children visualize this concept by writing the number 11 and, next to it, showing a ten and a single unit, separated by a circle.

, A ten frame has 10 empty fields, which are filled as you count. You can use coins or other small objects to demonstrate this, and you can also draw it on the board.


For a good activity, give each child two ten frames and 20 objects of some kind. Have them create the number 11: one full ten frame, and a second ten frame with just one unit in it. Have them create the other numbers. You can also reverse the process, starting with full ten frames and taking objects away.

, Show children that you can represent these numbers with dashes and dots: dashes for tens and dots for ones. Demonstrate that the number 15, for example, is made of one dash and five dots.

, Draw a T on a large piece of paper. The left column represents tens; the right represents ones. Fill the right column with the numbers 1 to 10, in sequence; leave the left column blank. Then:


Add representative numbers of objects, such as small cubes, to the ones column: a single cube next to number 1, two cubes next to number 2, and so on.
Explain that you could represent a ten with either ten of the small cubes or one larger stick.
Fill the tens column with sticks, one by one, and explain how these numbers would work together to create larger numbers.

, Use sets of cards labeled with numbers from 1 to 20 to play a memory matching game. Children turn the cards face down, then look for pairs.

, Have children fill containers with small items: 11 buttons, 12 grains of rice, 13 coins, and so on. Let them count the items and label containers with the appropriate numbers.

, There are many picture books available that deal with numbers 1 through 20. Read them together.

, Counting songs help reinforce children’s understanding of number sequence in a fun way.

, Ask a question – “who has number 15?” – and wait for the child with the appropriate card to rise.


You can make this game more challenging by asking harder questions – “who has the number that is two more than 13?” – or by having students break down their numbers into tens and units when they rise.

, Count out loud from 1 to 20, making random errors; let the children point out your mistakes. You can also do this with card sequences or number lines.

, Choose two children. Assign one the role of the “ten” – he or she should raise both full hands in the air to show ten fingers. The second child is the “units” – he or she should raise the appropriate number of fingers to create whichever number you ask for.

, Set up a station for each number from 11 to 20. For number 11, for example, label a desk with the written word “eleven,” the number “11,” and a picture of 11 items. In addition, set out 11 objects of some kind. Do this for every number, and have children circulate to identify the various stations.

Check the label.,

Check for embellishments.,
Talk to your dry cleaner.",How to Know Whether It's Safe to Dry Clean Your Wedding Dress," If your dress was bought off the rack, is there a label? What does it suggest? Alternatively, return to the store where you purchased the dress from and ask them for their specific advice about your dress. Most contemporary, modern wedding dresses are fine being dry cleaned and in fact, should be dry cleaned prior to storage.;
, If you've inherited a vintage or antique wedding dress, be aware that it is very unlikely to be suitable for dry cleaning. Fabric weakens with time and exposure to the elements, especially air and dampness. Moreover, older fabrics were not made to withstand tough chemical cleaning processes and tend to be delicate. Unless you know the quality of the fabric can withstand dry cleaning, err on the side of hand and spot cleaning instead.


If you have an antique gown, speak to a conservator about its care and cleaning.

, Embellishments on modern wedding dresses tend to be glued on unless the dress is very expensive or only contains a very small portion of embellishments. Glued-on items can easily loosen or pull away with the heat and chemicals of dry cleaning. Yet, even if the embellishments have been hand-sewn on, the nature of the decorations may not be able to handle the chemicals of dry cleaning solutions, which act as solvents.


Embellishments include beads, pearls, sequins, buttons, etc.

, Your dry cleaner may be able to suggest options for your dress that you're not aware of. On the whole, most wedding dresses can be dry cleaned but it's better to know than to ruin a beautiful dress.

Say the numbers one through ten during everyday activities.,
Sing rhyming number songs.,
Read number books together.,
Use your hands to indicate numbers visually.",How to Teach Numbers to Your Child1," The first step in learning numbers is hearing numbers and remembering their order. The numbers one through ten are important to learn first. In order to help facilitate this process, begin counting toys and pieces of food with your baby when they’re about a year old.For instance, count their blueberries out loud as they eat them. Simply say, “One blueberry, two blueberries, three blueberries, four…”
Similarly, count as you put away their toys together. For instance, “We put one block away, now two blocks, three blocks…”;
, There are all sorts of number songs you can find online and sing with your child. You can even make up your own counting songs. The more playful and memorable, the better.For instance, sing, “Five enormous dinosaurs, letting out a roar, one went away, and then there were four,” while playing with your child and their toys. Continue with, “Four enormous dinosaurs, crashing down a tree, one went away, and then there were three,” and so on.
Rhythm and rhyming helps children remember numbers and their order.
Be sure to go from 1 to 10 and from 10 to 1 in different songs.

, Another great way to expose your child to numbers is by reading them books that contain numbers. There are countless examples available for purchase online or from your local library.Examples of recommended counting books include Eric Carle's ""1, 2, 3 to the Zoo: A Counting Book"" and Jane Yolen's ""How Do Dinosaurs Count to Ten?""

, While saying or singing numbers or number songs, use items or your fingers to provide a visual indication of each number. This will help your child learn what each number represents and begin to help them recognize the concept that some numbers are more or less than other numbers."

Let the children tell you everything about their day in one long narration, while listening attentively. Telling a long story will set up the background for a summary to be created.;
, Ask children to focus on just one event in their day and retell it. To facilitate this retelling, tell the kids to focus on six basic concepts. These concepts will help the children take the most important parts of their story and summarize them.

Focus on the six basic questions of who, what, where, when, how, and why.






For example, have the children talk about a test they took, including who the teacher was, what subject it was on, where they were sitting in the room, when they took the test, how long it took them to finish, and why they think that they did well or didn’t do well on the test.






Of course, there are some events that occur in our lives where it is difficult to answer all six questions, especially ""why"". However, this is actually a good thing, because passages in literature do not always have enough information for children to answer all six questions.







, For an easy starting piece, choose some text that is not too long. Choosing a piece that is short and not too dense will allow you to teach the concept to children with minimal struggle.


Starting with a complex, long piece can discourage children if they haven't already mastered the basics of summarization.

, Instruct the children to read the whole piece silently or aloud. Some people find it easier to comprehend texts that they read out loud, whereas others find reading silently preferable.

Emphasize thorough reading, tell the children not to skim.






Tell the children to remember their goal of understanding the text thoroughly.







, Creating a summary will be easier for the children if they are given a few key parts to keep in mind. Having guidelines for content will allow them to mentally structure their summaries as they are reading and writing. There are a few key aspects to a summary:


The main idea: a primary theme or central focus of the text.
Important details: all parts of the text that explain the main idea of the text.
Beginning of the summary: refers to the beginning of the text and introduces the theme.
Rising action: an important detail that explains what happened or why something happened.
Climax: where the story reaches its most interesting point and its biggest twist.
End of text: where the text is concluded.
Important details of main characters: their names, characteristics, key roles.
Setting details: details of where and when the action takes place.

, Using the text you selected, show the children where the main idea is. When you show them this, explain where it is usually found and why it is important.


A good tip is that the main point of the text is usually near the beginning, within the first couple paragraphs.

, Make sure to run through the text with the children and give examples of the key details that should be included in the summary. Explain why these details are crucial to the main point, and ask them why they chose the details they did.


Ask them to share their thought process and explain why they thought certain things were more important than others.

, In one or two sentences, summarize the text that the children have been working on. Giving an example shows children how summarization works and what will be expected of them.


Show them how to connect the main idea and important details in a brief description.

, After children understand how to determine which facts are important using the six basic questions, it is time for them to practice summarizing a short passage from a book. It is important for the passage to be rather short, so that it is easier for the children to read and extract the important information.


This will ensure that children don't get discouraged by trying to sort out a long passage or chapter of a book.

, Every paragraph in literature has a main idea. It is often in the first sentence, but could be located anywhere in the paragraph. Once they find the main idea, the children will understand what the paragraph is about.

, The rest of each paragraph is there to support the main idea and provide detail. Not all of the details are vital information, so only some should be included in the summary.


You should ask the children to read the passage while looking for details that answer the six basic questions.

For example, if it is a passage about some historical event, the children should look for when it happened, where it happened, etc.



, If a child has trouble remembering the facts that they gather from the passage, they can write them down. Graphic organizers are very useful tools for this, and some even have the six basic questions along with blank areas for the child to fill in the information from the passage.

There are many web sites where graphic organizers can be found and printed for free.






If printing out the graphic organizers is not possible, you can use the online version as a guide and draw one by hand on a blank piece of paper.







, Once the child has all of the important details, you need to help them write the summary. This information should be put into a short, one paragraph summary that makes sense. Like other paragraphs, the summary paragraph should have a sentence that states the main idea, which in this case is the subject of the passage.


Returning to the previous example of the historical event summary, the sentence could state the name of the event and also give the year that it happened.

, Show the child how to include some of the important details or facts in additional sentences. These facts should be contained in the sentences following the intro sentence. Include the details that answer the rest of the six questions.

It is important that the sentences in the summary be as concise and precise as possible.






If the sentences are long, drawn-out, and very detailed, it is more of a re-write of the passage than a summary.







, When they finish writing the summary paragraph, the children should read it over to be sure that it flows well from beginning to end. They should also compare it to the original passage to be sure that it says the same general thing in a more compact way.


When a summary is turned in for a grade, it is important that it is written with grammatically correct sentences that have proper punctuation.
If the summary is only going to be used as a personal study guide, proper grammar and punctuation aren’t really necessary, but they do make it easier to read and understand when the summary is reviewed weeks later during a study session.

Help them choose the right instrument.,
Get them to make friends with their guitar.,
Help them tune it.,
Go for teaching them the simplest possible things first.,
Repeat, repeat, repeat.,
Work against the clock to improve chord changing speed.,
Simplify chords.,
Right at the start, try to discover whether a kid prefers playing single notes or chords.,
Beyond teaching open string names – don’t worry about theory.,
Encourage practice, but beware of making it too much of a chore.,
Encourage singing.,
Above all, have fun sharing your own enthusiasm for music!

",How to Teach Kids to Play Guitar," Guitars come in all shapes and sizes and it can be quite bewildering to someone buying their first guitar. Don’t encourage spending too much. It’s worth remembering that they are almost certainly going to want to upgrade after a year anyway, by which time, they will have a far better idea of exactly which instrument suits them best,but also, don’t go for cheap guitars that are impossible to tune and difficult to play. The single most important criteria are: Is the guitar comfortable to hold? Is it easy to play notes and chords on? Consider half and three-quarter size guitars and try both steel and nylon string guitars.;
, Rather than a reverential one-step-at-a-time-let’s-learn-to-play-correctly approach, try to invite experimentation and freedom of expression from day one. For example, get them to lightly tap a rhythm on the sound box of the guitar. Get them to accompany you on ‘percussion guitar’. The best way to do this is to lightly tie a sock round the neck of the guitar to mute the strings, then let them experiment with their right hand playing different natural strumming patterns. Encourage them to vary dynamics, tempo and complexity of rhythm.

, I don’t usually attempt to actually teach them to tune their guitars early on, but I make sure their guitar is well in tune for the lesson and also check to see if there is someone at home who can help them keep it in tune. Learning to tune a guitar is actually quite tricky for kids. Ultimately of course, it’s very beneficial for them to learn to tune by ear but, initially it is far more important to make tuning easy. So cheat and get them a tuning machine that is simple to operate, then patiently help them use it.

, I use Theme from James Bond in three parts. Also Single String Boogie. Then riffs from: Seven Nation Army (White Stripes), Sunshine of Your Love (Cream), Another One Bites the Dust (Queen), Smoke on the Water (Deep Purple)etc…. All instantly recognizable, simple and easy to play. (See resources below for links to tab and sound files for some of these ideas.)

, Repetition is a vital part of learning and fortunately, kids are quite often happy to play the same thing again and again. Encourage this and resist the (adult-conditioned) tendency to want to ""Always break new ground"". Note that when a kid says they like a particular tune, it almost always means ""I am confident I can play this"". Conversely when they say ""I don’t like …(a particular tune)..."" It should be interpreted as: ""I find this too difficult for me to play at the moment"".

, When it comes to improving chord changes a great trick is to teach a couple of new chord shapes (say A and D) and then say: ""Right – let’s see how many times we can change from one chord to the other in a minute"". Set a timer and go for it. Then pause to make a few suggestions about how to make the changes easier (always move fingers in the same order, feel where the strings and frets are rather than look...)- Then try again and see if they can break their record.

, If they want to learn a particular tune, but the chords or riffs are beyond their current ability level, try to figure out ways of simplifying them. Sometimes this means changing key, using a capo or just working out fingerings of chords on three strings rather than four, five or six. It does take some musical skill, but, that’ll just help you expand your own musical capabilities!

, Some take to melody and riffs first, others prefer strumming chords. Whatever they find easiest and most enjoyable – go with it! As they grow in confidence and physical size and strength, they’ll find it easy to pick up the other side of learning, so there’s no rush to broaden out.

, There is no sense in mystifying the subject by introducing theoretical concepts too early on. However, don't sell the kids short, either. Chances are that if they're in elementary school that they've already begun to learn the basics (e.g. note names, definitions of things like scales, keys) and you can remind them of these whenever it becomes appropriate to the lesson. Theory shouldn't be your main focus, though peppering a few lessons with it can be helpful.

, Initially, best results are obtained by several very short stints of practice, rather than one long one. Little and often is the key.

, Singing along to what they are playing comes naturally to kids and there are many benefits to encouraging this. Initially, this might appear like overload and mean that their strumming remains very basic, because most of their attention is on singing, but actually this will soon sort itself out if you show patience.

Place your feet shoulder width apart.

, Tell them to:

Keep their back straight.
Get a good grip.
Keep the object close to your body.

, This includes telling them:

Make recycle bins around the house.,
Ask your child what they think the item is made out of.,
Encourage your child to use both sides of a paper.,
Think of creative ways to reuse the recycled material.,
Deposit food scraps in an outdoor container.,
Teach kids the kinds of things that one does not recycle.,
Take them with you on a trip to the recycling center.",How to Teach Kids to Recycle," Think of the basic categories when you are first starting out with recycling, such as ""Paper"", ""Plastic"", and ""Cardboard"". Don't make the list of what each bin should contain for little kids complicated, or else they will become confused. If it looks like the item, that should be enough for now.


If you're making these for preschoolers and kindergarteners, you can make your own or print out images that represent the categories you want so that they can identify and match with the object they are disposing. For older kids and teens, have them decorate the bins.;
, Instead of tossing out a cereal box, ask them how it feels like (as they can enhance their sense of touch), for example, ""Is this paper or does it feel like cardboard?"" Allow them to drop it into the correct recycling bin.

, Excessive marker usage may result in ""bleeding"" on the other side and very typical with a kid. Have them use crayons and then turn the paper around for another new and ""clean"" sheet instead of them reaching for a separate one. Try purchasing paper specialty made for water-coloring, as the paints and water won't damage the other side. Art based stores and supermarkets that have a ""school supply"" aisle may have books with ""special pages"" meant for that purpose.

,


Have a family mouse? Place a toilet paper or cut a paper towel cardboard roll in their cage.
Cut off the sides of a cardboard box and reuse it as a portable drawer.
Save egg cartons for craft ideas, such as animal painting creations or as extra pockets to hold stuff in (for example, paper clips).
Thoroughly rinsed milk jugs and cartons can easily be converted into birdseed feeders for the spring.
Thoroughly rinsed meat Styrofoam trays are excellent items to hold paint in. You can also make a small concoction mixture with equal amounts of water and cornstarch for kids to play with.

, When they are finished with a banana or orange, have them place the peels in a tub outside to use as future compost in soil.

, Be prepared to answer the ""Why?"" question, but try to put your answer in simple terms. Always properly dispose items on your own with gloves and handle them with care, depending on the object.

, Many places give you cash back on cans and other recycling items. Allow them to keep the money for their effort on recycling, as this will create a positive reaction and motivation for them to continue recycling instead of throwing things away in the trash.

Bring attention to numbers when you see them.,
Facilitate activities that include numbers.,
Make a counting book together.",How to Teach Numbers to Your Child2," Whenever you see single-digit numbers, point them out. This is especially helpful when you have several numbered items together. For instance, if you go on a walk with your child and walk by a series of numbered mailboxes, point them out individually and say, “Look, here’s mailbox number one, and there’s mailbox number two.”, Use a dry erase board or sidewalk chalk to draw a series of dots in a recognizable shape, such as a circle. Then number each dot, and have your child connect the dots, starting from the dot labeled ""1."" Guide them towards and the ""2"" dot, and so on, saying the numbers out loud together.Similarly, paint or draw lines and dots together. Circle one of the shapes they draw and say “one,” then circle two of the shapes they draw, say “two,” and so on.
Many helpful number-learning worksheets are available for free online. These include color-by-number activities, fill-in-the-number worksheets, and more.

, Start the book yourself by getting a blank notebook and writing ""1"" on the first page, and so on through ""10"". Then direct your child to draw the corresponding number of whatever items they want on each page, and encourage them to pick something different to draw or to use a different color on each page."
"
Recognize that learning takes time.,
Note the difference between reciting numbers and counting.,
Don't worry about counting mistakes by young children.,
Hold off on teaching young children numbers higher than 10.",How to Teach Numbers to Your Child3," It takes years to learn what numbers are and how to begin using them, even for in simple math like addition. For young children, it's important that you remain supportive, patient, and positive.Note that your child will be at least three or four by the time they are able to understand that adding something of taking something away involves a numerical change.
Similarly, children are unlikely to recognize or identify written numerals, or to write them themselves, until they are four or five years old.

, Your child may have memorized how to “count” to ten by the time they’re a few years old. However, this does not indicate that they fully understand what numbers mean. At first, they will not be able to tell you the next number if you say a random number, and they probably won’t be able to say a number if you show them the written number. These concepts usually aren’t fully understood until your child studies them in school.In the meantime, keep on taking advantage of everyday opportunities to talk about numbers with your child.
Answer questions they ask, and keep building associations between certain amounts of items and the appropriate number.

, As your child begin to learn how to use numbers, it is inevitable that they will make basic mistakes. Keep in mind that the first step of the process is simply learning the correct names of numbers. For example, a young child may point to a group of objects and say a number that is not correct. This is actually a good sign, as it indicates that they are learning to label objects with numbers, which comes before the ability to count.Feel free to correct you child by saying the correct number, but try not to distract them. If they continue happily saying random numbers, let them do so - they're simply playing, and building an association between the concept of certain numbers and amounts of things.

, Your child needs to fully comprehend the numbers 1 through 10 before learning to count higher numbers. Usually, this will not occur until they are in school. In short, a child must be able to count up to 10 and back down again, count items, be able to recognize and state a number when shown the figure, and write the numbers 1 through 10 before learning higher numbers. To attempt teaching them high numbers too early can complicate the number learning process."

Teach your child about the parts of a zipper.,
Sing songs about zippers.,
Read books about zippers and getting dressed.,
Make your own zipper book.,
Teach your child to use a zipper with the help of toys.,
Be patient.",How to Teach Your Kid to Use a Zipper1," To begin, teach your child the parts of the zipper and what each piece does. Show your child how each piece works using a jacket that isn’t being worn. Have them handle the pieces and understand how they fit inside their hands. An understanding of the pieces will not only pique your child’s interesting in zippers, but also help him or her understand how it all fits together.


The zipper pull is the long piece that hangs down and is the piece you hold to zip and unzip the zipper.
The zipper tongue is the part that fits into the zipper pull.
Zipper teeth are the bumpy pieces that run the length of the zipper.;
, Help your child understand the zipper by singing a fun song about it. When repeated frequently, the song can stick with the child and help them remember the zipping process. This simple song can be sung with or without zippers to help children understand how they work. You can say this poem, or sing it, depending on your preference:


1-2-3 zip with me (hold the zipper up)
It's so easy as you can see
Zip it up (move it up)
And zip it down (move it down)
It's as easy as 1-2-3
Come on everybody and zip with me (hold it up)
You can zip your coat
You can zip your pants
It's as easy as the hula dance

, This will help your child to feel more comfortable about zippers and to teach them in a less stressful environment. Popular picture books about zippers include “All By Myself” and “Mrs. Toggle’s Zipper”.

, Busy books that feature zippers are also a great teaching resource. You can make a zipper book on your own by sewing plain zippers found at the fabric store onto large sheets of fabric or felt and then sewing them together into a book.


You can also find busy books with zippers at most toy and baby stores. Busy books not only keep children quiet and entertained, but also provide an opportunity to solidify the zipping process. As a bonus, many pre-made busy books feature zippers that are a little easier for children to zip, which can help your child learn the process of zipping and help translate the steps when they try to zip a more difficult jacket or pair of pants.

, If your child needs extra practice, consider investing in a toy that involves zippers. Toys like the Melissa and Doug Basic Skills Zipper Board or the Children’s Factory Learn to Dress Doll can help children master their zipping skills in a colorful and low-key environment with zippers that are meant for their little hands.


Once a child learns to zip and unzip on their toy, they should be able to transition to actual clothing fairly easily.

, Learning about zippers can be frustrating, especially for children whose small fingers make it even more difficult to zip. Most children need help zipping until they are at least 5 or 6 years old, so don’t expect them to become an expert overnight.


If you notice your child getting particularly frustrated and angry, take a break from zippers. The break can be as short as doing another activity before coming back to try again, or as long as wearing zipper free clothing for a few days to give your child a rest.

Make sure that your child is old enough.,
Find a knot that your child likes.,
Encourage your child.",How to Teach Your Kids to Tie Their Shoes1," Although it is best to teach your child as early as possible, your child should not be too young. Most children learn between the ages of three and five., There are many different kinds of knots. Some may be easier or more difficult for your child. The number of steps, the complexity of the knot and your child's dexterity all will contribute to this decision. If one doesn't work, try a new technique.The Standard shoelace knot uses one loop to lock a second loop in place.Make an 'X' with the two laces.
Pull the right lace through the middle of the 'X' and pull your laces tight.
Then, make a loop with one of the laces.
Wrap the second lace about the loop and pull the second lace through the space created until tight.


The Two Loops knot looks like the Standard when finished, but it uses two loops at the same time and ties them together.Make an 'X' with the two laces.
Pull the right lace through the middle of the 'X' and pull your laces tight.
Then, make two 'bunny ears' with the laces.
Tie the two bunny ears together.
For an extra tight knot, tie the bunny ears together another time


The Ian knot is very fast, but a little more difficult to do.With this knot, two loops are made and pulled through each other.

, Children are natural learners. Just make sure to let them know they're doing a good job. This will help ensure they do not get frustrated while learning and give up.


Offer help when they need it.
Be consistent.

"
"
Call them helpers when you ask for things.,
Praise them for being a helper.,
Point out instances of others being helpers.,
Encourage them to think like a helper.,
Give age-appropriate chores.,
Hold your children to their commitments.,
Train your children to speak politely to others.,
Praise only honest effort.,
Do not offer material rewards for being a helper.,
Let children help, but do not pressure them.",How to Raise Your Children to Be Helpers," Instead of asking for help, ask your child to ""be a helper."" All people, children included, are more motivated when their identity is in play.You can start doing this with your children as early as two years old.


You might say, ""Jayden, can you be a helper and clean your bedroom before Grandma comes over?"" or ""Please be a helper and stay quiet while your sister naps.""
Another great way to encourage helping behavior in your kids is to get them excited about helping. For example, you could ask your child to help pick up their toys by saying, “Can you please be a good helper and pick some of your toys up with mommy?” Then, after they help you say, “Yay! You are such a good helper!” when you see your child doing something you like. Or, you can make a game out of picking up toys and clap your hands or cheer every time your child picks one up.;
, Strengthen the positive impact of their ""helper"" identity by praising them when they are helpful. For instance, if your child brings their dish to the sink after a meal, you might say, ""Thank you for being a good helper by cleaning up your dish!""Saying ""helper"" will have a greater impact than praising them ""for helping"" or for ""being helpful.""

, When you see someone doing something generous or assisting another person in any way, point that person out to your child. For instance, if you see someone throw away trash in a park, you might say, ""See that person being a helper? They threw away some trash that wasn't even theirs.""Thank other adults for being helpers in front of your child. Say, ""I appreciate you bringing in the bags with me, dear. You are really being a helper.""
The presence of helpers can be comforting to children. If your kid sees something frightening in real life or on TV, encourage them to look for the helpers.
For instance, if you pass by an accident on the road, point out the people stopped to help and any EMT or other medical workers present. Say, ""See the helpers who are staying with the family?"" or ""I saw some helpers who were busy getting that person safely into an ambulance.""
Notice yourself being a helper, and point out some things you are doing to your child.

, Once your kids start to understand what activities are typical of helpers, ask them to point out instances to you. After school, you might ask, ""was anyone a good helper today?"" or ""were you a helper for any of your friends today?""


Give them helper challenges. For instance, you might pick a neighbor or friend who is having a rough time. Ask your kid to think of a kindness that might be useful to them. Give them ideas and guide them in their efforts.
For instance, if you have a neighbor who has been sick, ask your kid to brainstorm ways to be a helper. If they come up with something practical, like ""bringing over soup,"" put them in charge of age-appropriate tasks (finding out what kind of soup the neighbor eats, picking out vegetables, chopping, delivery…)

, Anyone can help to some degree. Small children can clean up their own toys, provide reminders, and take on small social responsibilities such as greeting guests. Older children can take charge of important tasks like taking out the trash and walking the dog.


Keep a chore chart. Let your kids check off their chores so they have the satisfaction of recording themselves being helpers. Make sure everyone uses the charts so that your kids see that everyone is doing their chores.

, Children need to understand that the commitments they make to others are essential. If your kid has a playdate, don't let them cancel just because they aren't feeling social. However, keep in mind that sometimes there are exceptions. If your child is emotionally or physically exhausted, then it is okay to let them cancel now and then.


If your kid joins a team, explain that they must stick with it for the season at least.However, be willing to listen to their reasons for wanting to quit and validate their concerns. If your child absolutely hates doing something, then forcing them to continue will not be doing them any good.
If your kid has a serious reason for quitting something, such as being badly bullied by the ""friend"" or teammates, then you should talk to the other adults in the situation. If no suitable protection can be devised, you should let your child back out.

, Teach your children that every day is a cooperative venture. When we are kind to others, we make the day better for them.Prompt them to say please, thank you, and excuse me.
Ask them what they are grateful for, and encourage them to express this gratitude.
Be a good role model, and let your children see you speaking respectfully to everyone you meet.
For instance, if you are irritated with bad service in a store, control your temper and speak politely to those at work. Remind yourself that you don't know why they are busy or distracted: they might have a good reason.

, When you praise your child for being a helper, make sure you mean it. Explain exactly what you consider worthy of the label ""helper."" Do not praise them constantly for every little thing or you will normalize the praise and it will not have as much meaning. Try to offer praise sparingly and it will have more significance for your child.


If you see your child working hard at basketball, for instance, you don't need to say, ""You were a real helper on the court today! Your teammates are so lucky to have you."" You may make your child feel like self-conscious of their spontaneous engagement.
However, if you see your child working hard with a homework partner even though the subject is difficult for them, you might praise them for being a good helper by saying, ""You don't always like doing your math, but today you worked through every problem with Sarah! I was pleased to see you both being such good helpers for each other.""
Praise effort, not ability. Praising ability makes kids over-cautious.
Older children may be suspicious of praise. Make sure you always mean your praise sincerely, or you will discourage children.

, Offering toys, food, or other material rewards will weaken the ""helper"" label. You will make your kid feel as if they are not supposed to be inherently helpful, but instead should be constantly monitoring their own gain., Give kids the choice to help others, and let them know their individual decision counts.However, do not pressure them to give up rewards or other things they covet: it will make them less generous in the future.


For instance, you might say, ""We are all donating clothing and toys we don't need any more to kids who are less fortunate. Here is a bag with your name on it: please put what you don't need in it.""
Don't say, ""You don't need so many dolls. I want you to put at least three of your dolls in the donation bag."" You will make your child feel like their ownership of their possessions is threatened, and they will be less inclined to give things freely.

Teach your child to brush their teeth.,
Encourage basic tidying up.,
Practice eating at the table.,
Practice basic organization.,
Practice tying shoes.,
Have your child bathe with minimal help.,
Practice getting dressed.",How to Teach Practical Life Skills to Your Children1," Purchase a toddler-sized toothbrush with soft bristles for gentle brushing. Initially, you can help your toddler brush their teeth, but you should still be responsible for the cleaning. A small child won't be thorough. Most children are capable of brushing alone between the ages of 6 and 8.


Encourage them to brush their teeth by making a game of the process. Try using timers, playing songs, and dancing in the bathroom.
Be a role model. Brush your teeth with them so they will want to join in, too. ;
, For example, you can have your child learn to clean up their toys. Buy or make a toy basket, box, or chest and encourage your child to clean up after they play with their toys. Show them how to do it, and describe your actions. You can say, ""Amy, can you see how I put your games away? You try it now with the Legos.""


Make it a game by seeing who can pick up the toys the fastest. You can toss the toys in like a basketball to make it a game.
Have children practice sweeping. If your child struggles to hold a large broom try to buy a mini broom at your local discount store or toy store.Since it may be difficult for your child to sweep the entire floor, work little by little. Duct tape one tile or area on a hardwood floor. Sprinkle sunflower seeds or bits of tissue paper beside it. Have them sweep it up and place it in the duct taped area. Once they get the hang of it you can remove the duct tape and have them try sweeping the dirt in a dust pan.
You can also make a homemade recycled broom using a bottle for your child.

, If the child usually eats in their highchair, it might be time to do a little switch-up. Once you feel that your child is ready, or if they indicate an interest, you can give the grown up table a try. Have your toddler sit at the dining room table with the whole family.


It could be hard for your child to reach the table. You can place a few cushions on the chair and have them sit on it. Push the chair in so they can reach easily. Show pride if child sits and behaves themselves. Once they tackle sitting and eating, you can start teaching them table manners. , One way to do this is to have your child organize the utensils. This is another great way to teach basic skills while involving kids in the process of being part of the meal and clean up.


Have your child practice putting the spoons, forks, and butter knifes back where they belong. It will take patience and time for your child to understand each place for the utensil but they will eventually get it.
Every time they put the utensil in the wrong area, guide them and place it in the right area. You can offer patient guidance by saying things like, ""Oh, that's not where the fork goes. Can you try again?"" or ""Let's work together and try to find where this butter knife goes, Joey.""

, Shoe lacing is one of the most fundamental skills you can teach your child. They will likely have already starting putting on and pulling of their shoes, so tying them is the logical next step. To start, demonstrate what you are doing and encourage them to give it a try. It can take time for the child to tie their own shoes but the more they practice, the sooner they will get it. Try to make it fun and easy to remember by pretending the loops are bunny ears.


Sit cross-legged on the floor with your child. That way, you will both have the same perspective. Have them practice on a shoe with soft laces.
Create a ""bunny ear"" (loop) with each lace. Show your child how to cross the ""ears"", one over the other so that it creates an ""x"" shape.
Loop the bottom ear under and through the top ear. Then pull the ears away from each other. You and your child will have tied the shoes with a simple (and fun) knot., Begin by encouraging your child to wash and rinse themselves. Give them their own sponge and washing rag. Show them how to clean between each body part, especially the areas that are hard to reach such as the ears and belly button.


Introduce them to the shower head so they can get used to not taking baths. Have them practice using the shower knobs, adjusting the water amount and heat. Leave out a bathrobe or towel for your child to dry off once they have finished their bath.
Once your child has gotten the hang of taking a bath, they can start bathing alone. Check on them every three minutes and anytime they call you for help.
It is not safe for children under 6 to be left alone while bathing., Show them the basics such as zipping their zipper, buttoning their jeans, putting on a shirt, and pulling up their underwear. Tell them what you are doing together (i.e ""We are putting our pants up, Daniel""). Once they know every step of changing, you can give them the clothes they'll wear in the morning or night and have them change alone.


Children often begin trying to dress and undress themselves at about 18 months. Help them learn simple things first. Start with t-shirts and socks and other articles that don't have zippers or buttons.Have kids place dirty clothes in the laundry basket. They can practice their tidying up skills after getting dressed or undressed.

Give the reward.",How to Make a Chore Chart With Incentives," Chores in chore charts are generally things that need to be accomplished in the house daily or weekly. Think about your home’s needs and which chores you prioritize more than others.


For example, you may suffer from allergies and need the house thoroughly dusted and vacuumed every week, but folding laundry isn’t a huge priority for you. Make sure your chore chart reflects your household’s necessities.
Be realistic in your expectations. Your house will not always be spotless, not all chores will get down every week, and understand that others may have a different definition of “clean” than you do.;
, Consider which chores you would like people to do every day, and other chores you want done weekly. You could decide to make a chore chart for daily chores only, one for weekly chores only, or a combination of both.


A few suggestions for daily chores include making the bed, taking out trash, putting away toys, or washing dishes.A few suggestions for weekly chores include dusting, vacuuming, mopping the floor, or cleaning the bathroom., Assign chores appropriate to the age and/or developmental level of the members of the household. You wouldn’t have a two-year-old iron, for example. But children of all ages can help with chores around the house. Here are some examples for different age groups:Ages 2 to 3: Put away toys, put clothes in hamper, wipe up spills, feed pets
Ages 4 to 5: Make bed, empty wastebaskets, wash plastic dishes at sink
Ages 6 to 7: Set the table, sweep floors, rake leaves
Ages 8 to 9: Put away groceries, make own snacks or breakfast, walk the dog
Ages 10 to 11: Fold laundry, clean bathroom, change bed sheets
Ages 12 and up: Watch younger siblings, mop floors, cook dinner, Using age-appropriate guidelines, assign chores to each member of your household. Try to assign a similar amount of chores, keeping in mind age and/or ability. Consider the amount of time it takes to complete each chore as well.


For example, cleaning the bathroom may take a longer amount of time than vacuuming the family room. Factor time commitments into your assignments.
Consider switching up chores from week-to-week to add variety to a routine. For example, more detested chores could alternate amongst group members.

, Be clear in your expectations about what it means to “clean your room” or “clean the dining room table.” For younger kids, you may need to break down the task step-by-step.For example, let everyone know that when it says “Clean the family room” on the chore chart, this means picking up and putting away toys, dusting, and vacuuming. You may wish to indicate on the chore chart what each task entails.

, Chore charts are usually organized by rows and columns. In your row and column headings, you can put your lists of chores, days of the week, or names of the people in your household. Look for examples of chore charts online, and decide what format will best fit your needs. There are many ideas out there!


Your chart could have a column with the name of each chore, a column that lists rewards pertaining to the chores, and a blank space so people can write their names or initials when they've done the chores. You may decide to add columns for any additional needs, like a “deadline” column (the day by which the chore needs to be completed).
Your chart could list the family member’s name in the first column. In subsequent columns, or underneath the name, you could list the chores the family member is responsible for. Next to the chore, you could put a box to check when the action is completed.
Consider drawing pictures of the chores for pre-literate children or others who struggle with reading.

, Chart organization will vary by your household’s needs and members. Typically, a chart will have columns with days of the week, rows with individual chores, and blank spaces where members of the household can indicate they have completed the task. Design your chart the way that best fits your needs, or look for examples online.


You may want to use a spreadsheet program to create a chart.
Consider creating your own chart on a whiteboard. This will allow you to use the same chart week-to-week.
Try typing “printable chore chart” into a search engine for online examples. You can use one of these templates to develop your own chart.

, Feel free to decorate it with markers, colored pencils, and stickers. If you have children, let your kids help decorate it. This will help generate interest and excitement in the new system.


If you have little kids, you might want to make the chart large to make it easier to read, as well as to give the kids more space to write on it.

, You may want to hang it on the refrigerator, or another central location where people are easily able to find it. Keep a pen (or a dry erase marker if you’re using a whiteboard) nearby so people can mark off the chores when they've done them.


For children, hang the chart low enough where they are able to read and mark it.

, When a member of the household has announced they have finished their chore, double-check to make sure it is done to your satisfaction. When somebody has completed a chore, have them write their name on the appropriate place in the chart.


Don’t hold younger kids to the same standard as you would an older child. For example, a four-year-old may have trouble cleaning their room as well as a ten-year-old.If you are working with a child or person unable to write their name, you could have them make an X or draw a picture in the space instead.

, Think about what would work best for your household. You may decide to assign rewards by task or by family member. It may also depend on the structure of your chart.


Keep in mind who these rewards are for, and what work they will be rewarding, and tailor them accordingly. Younger children might be content with a piece of candy, while older children may want to work toward video game/screen time.Rewards don't have to be anything big (nor should they be). They also shouldn’t always be food-based. Incentives could be things like getting to stay up later on the weekends, an extra story at bedtime, or playing a favorite game or doing a favorite activity together.

, You may have more enthusiasm for the chore chart if members of your household get to decide for themselves what they’d like to work for. You could also ask them if they would rather earn smaller rewards for each completed task, or work toward a bigger reward.


You could decide that rewarding each task is going to work better for your family. You could say, “If you make your bed every day this week, you will get a prize. What do you think would be a good prize? A new coloring book or a pack of gum?”
Set limits on the value of the reward. You may decide that you don’t want to spend more than $5 a week on chore chart incentives, for example. You may also decide to reward the completed tasks with free activities, like playing a game or baking together.
If you have decided to let others work toward a cumulative reward, set a monetary limit on the prize and let the person decide what they want to work toward.

, Let household members know what incentives they will receive for doing the chore. You may wish to write the incentive next to the task on the chore chart, or it may work better to have them listed separately. The latter may work better if you are using a cumulative rewards system, such as a points system.


If you are using a cumulative reward system, you could write something like, “Felipe is working to earn a new video game.”
If you are rewarding each completed task, you could indicate it on the chore chart. For example, next to “Wash and fold laundry,” it could say, “30 minutes of screen time.”

, Designate a certain amount of points per task. Add up each household member’s points at the end of the week. The points can be redeemed for a reward.


Designate levels of rewards. For example, you could decide that at 10 points, the participant could redeem their points for a movie night at home. For 20 points, they could redeem their points for a special lunch. The value of the reward would get higher as the accumulated points increase. This could help kids understand the idea of saving to achieve a goal.More disliked, difficult or time-consuming chores could have higher point values.

, Kids need to learn that household chores should not be tied to earning money. After all, no one is paying their parents to make dinner or do the laundry. Teach your children that everyone helps out to support a functioning household, and that working to make it better shouldn’t be achieved through self-serving means.You could give an allowance to your child independent of the chore chart. Let them learn the connection between earning money and work by doing additional jobs you consider to be beyond the scope of their day-to-day responsibilities., If you have decided to reward a member with an incentive upon completion of the chore, keep your end of the bargain. Deliver the reward promptly, or at a previously agreed-upon time.If it is a young child, remind them of what the reward is for when you give it to them. You could say, “We get to do this puzzle together because you picked up your toys!”
If you are using a points system to earn rewards, let the person know when they can redeem their reward. For example, “Since you earned enough points, we can get pizza for dinner on Tuesday!”

Build a safe work zone around the sink and/or dishwasher.,
Begin by scraping the plates.,
Prepare the necessary tools for washing the dishes.",How to Teach Your Child to Wash Dishes1," Start by providing a step stool or step ladder for your child, that way he or she can safely and securely reach the dishes in the sink. Also, all sharp and fragile objects should be removed to prevent any possible accidents. Finally, you may also want to line the sink and floor with towels to collect any spills that may happen. These steps will help ensure that your child is safe while washing the dishes.


A step stool or step ladder can be purchased online, in hardware stores, or in children's department stores. Once on the stool, your child's mid-section should be level with the sink. The stool should be safe and secure.
You might consider washing the knives and fragile dishes in front of your child, explaining how you are washing them and that soon it will be their turn to wash. Be sure to place them out of your child's reach once they are cleaned and dried.
Any towel will work to absorb spills, but be sure to have plenty on hand in case of accidents.;
, This will remove excess food to allow easier cleaning later. Explain to your child that larger pieces of food will block the drain of the sink or dishwasher, so this food must be discarded before you can begin cleaning with soap and a sponge. There are several ways you may want to discard left over food, including in the trash, the garbage disposal, and by compost. If you are putting left over food in the trash, use a fork or knife to push the food off the plate into the trash. Be sure to show your child what you are doing and allow him or her to scape his or her plate.
If you have a garbage disposal, show your child how to put leftover food in it safely. Instruct them as to what can and cannot be put into the garbage disposal, and that cold water should be running at all times when the garage disposal is running. If you compost, teach your child the food that can be used for composting and those that cannot. That which can be used should be saved, and that which cannot should be discarded. , You'll need warm water, dish soap, two sponges and two towels. For more difficult dishes, you can use plastic scrubbers or steal wool pads. You may also want to use rubber gloves. You may want to collect warm water in the sink and add soap to it. Alternatively you can place a rubber bin in the sink to collect warm water, and then add soap to it. Lastly, you can leave warm water running from the faucet and add soap to dishes individually.


All of these supplies can be picked up at a local supermarket.
For a fun activity, have your child add soap to the water. He or she will surely enjoy the bubbles!

Model zipper use.,
Have your child practice zipping with your help.,
Remove any unnecessary challenges.,
Give your child opportunities to practice zipping.,
Give positive reinforcement.,
Reward your child for a job well done.",How to Teach Your Kid to Use a Zipper2," A child can learn a lot just by watching you zip your jacket or clothes. When it is time to go outside, put a zip-up hoodie or jacket on yourself and your child so you can do the zipper together. Start with your child holding onto the zipper pull between their thumb and index finger. Help them insert the tongue into the pull and push it all the way down. Still holding the tongue, move the pull up with the other hand.


Show your child how you do this on your own jacket, and talk them through each step. Repeating this process each time you zip a zipper will model the behavior and internalize the instructions to your child.

, Hold your hands on top of theirs and go through the movements together, all while talking about each step out loud. Give them lots of help at the beginning, and then give them less help after they begin to get the hang out it.


To help a child’s small fingers grasp the zipper pull, add a key ring or a small toy to the end of the pull to give them something larger to grab.

, When it’s time for your child to attempt zipping a zipper on their own, make things as easy as possible for them. Smooth the front of their jacket and remove any lumps or bumps to help the zipper move more easily. Help them line up the slider and connect the slider and the zipper tongue.


Once the pieces are connected, it should be fairly easy for your child to pull the tab to the top of the zipper.

, Encourage your child to keep practicing on the zipper and give them lots of opportunities to zip clothes that they are wearing and clothes that are laying flat in front of them.

, Point out the progress your child is making. They may want to give up, but encourage them to keep practicing by praising their performance.

, Even after they learn how to use a zipper, many children find it easier to leave their jacket unzipped or that it is more fun to unzip a zipper than to zip it up. If this is the case, or if your child needs a little extra motivation to master the skills, consider giving them a reward.


The reward will be different for each child, but for some it could be a sticker or a piece of candy each time they zip their clothes themselves and keep their jacket zipped, or it could be working towards a larger prize if they keep their jacket zipped for a certain number of days in a row. Rewards can solidify the zipping skills you’ve taught and give children motivation to continue to zip their clothing.

Use the knot to tell a story.,
Perform the knot like it is a magic trick.,
Turn it into a challenge.",How to Teach Your Kids to Tie Their Shoes2," This makes it fun for the child because it is easy to remember. Stories are also easier for children to pay attention to. Re-imagine the shapes and movements of the string as other things.Both rhymes are intended to work with the standard shoelace knot.


Bunny ears, bunny ears, playing by a tree. He criss-crossed the tree, trying to catch me. Bunny ears, bunny ears, jumped down the hole. He popped out the other side beautiful and bold.Build a tee pee. Come inside. Close it tight, so we can hide. Over the mountain and around we go. Here is my arrow, and here is my bow., This can make tying knots seems fun and mysterious. By presenting it as a magic trick the child can learn, you entice them to try harder to tie their shoes. Success in this case may rely on how convincingly you pull off the trick.


Use very colorful laces.When you teach you child the “trick”, make sure to let them try to do it by themselves.

, Dare them to do it. Some children may respond well to this tactic. By challenging your child to work hard to learn to tie their shoes, you can motivate them. Rewards accompanying this challenge may also help contribute encouragement.


If laces are too small, start practicing with a rope.

Teach good manners.,
Talk to strangers.,
Model good conversation skills.",How to Teach Practical Life Skills to Your Children2," It's important for children to be polite and respect others. You can start with the basics by teaching 'please', 'thank you', and 'excuse me'. Model good behavior for your young child to see. For example, when your toddler offers you a bite of their food, make a point of saying ""thank you!""As your child grows and grasps the basics, work up to table manners and manners in public. For example, you can teach them to speak politely to siblings and even pets.
Reward good behavior and show you are pleased when your child is using his manners correctly.

, Once you've begun practicing the basics at home, you can help your child take their new skills out into the world. Although you clearly don't want your kids chatting up every person they meet on the street, you do want them to know how to speak clearly, kindly, and politely to people they don't know.For example, when you introduce your child to a new friend, you want them to be able to say, ""Hello"" or even ""How are you?"" without being fearful or too shy.
As your kids grow older, it's also important to teach them to be polite to people like sales clerks and servers at restaurants.

, As a parent, you want to set your child up for success. In order to succeed socially or academically, kids need to learn to have a proper conversation. With younger kids, you can begin by teaching them to ask questions. For example, teach them to ask a friend, ""Would you like to come to my house to play?""As your kids grow, teach them that conversations require two active participants. You want your child to understand that listening to the other person is just as important as talking.
Don't forget the importance of body language. Teach your children not to roll their eyes or scowl when they are talking to others.

Teach your child internet safety.,
Have your child help with dinner.,
Have your child start making basic meals.,
Introduce money management.",How to Teach Practical Life Skills to Your Children3," Have a serious talk about the internet and online chatting in a calm atmosphere so your child can focus and pay attention to you. Explain to your child to never give out their full name, birthday, address, phone number, credit card information, and the school they go to unless they ask you first and you allow them. Tell your child to block or report any users who are making them feel unsafe or worried, and say to them that if anything terrible is going on (such as cyber bullying) that they tell you or a teacher. Check your child's activity by viewing their history.You can occasionally check on them when they are using their electronic by asking a few basic questions. Examples:


""Hey Natasha, are you chatting to Daddy?""
""That's an interesting game you are playing, Henry. What is it called?""
""Good morning, Rosa. I see you're up bright and early. What are you doing?""

, They can set the table, serve the food in dishes, and do other types of jobs. You can also have them clear the table once everyone is done eating. Simple jobs like picking up the dishes, wiping the table, and storing away food is the perfect responsibility for them. If you have multiple children and family members, have them all help up and give each one of them a specific task so everyone can work together.


Do not let your child do this everyday or all by themselves. Too much chores can overtire a child and will make them not want to clean or help again.
Once your child tackles setting and clearing the dinner table at home they can start carrying what they have learned at a guest's house. Encourage your child to clean up with the adults to thank them for the meal they had made. Doing this will not only make your child responsible, but polite and appreciative as well., It's that time that your child needs to learn to start preparing meals for themselves. Have them start with very basic meals such as sandwiches, ants on a log, and other basic snacks and lunches. Have them cook with you in the kitchen and present them on how to make a specific recipe. Encourage them to look for all the ingredients in the pantry or cabinets. Once they tackle the easy recipes, they can move on to harder recipes such as boiling pasta, making a salad, and frying scrambled eggs.


You can also teach your child about cooking safety. Talk about things such as never running with knives, never cook use the stove top without an adult, don't touch sharp objects, etc.Have your child practice making breakfast for themselves. The first breakfast meal you'd want your child to make could be cereal or toast. The steps are rather simple and your child will learn quickly.

, There are many ways that you can help your child learn about money at a young age. Doing so will help your child learn how to handle money and how to care for it responsibly. It will also help encourage independence.Give your child an allowance. Explain to them that if they want a special treat or item, they can use their own money to purchase it.
Count change. With younger kids, you can begin by teaching the value of each coin. Then they can make a game out of helping you sort your change.
Help them open a checking or savings account. Go to your local banking branch and ask a teller to help you set up a child's account. Then teach your child the value of depositing Grandma's birthday checks!

Begin by cleaning your glasses, plates and bowls.,
Clean the cooking dishes next.,
Dry the dishes.",How to Teach Your Child to Wash Dishes2," These are typically the least dirty of all the dishes, so its a good idea to start your child off by cleaning these. First, instruct your child to submerge the dirty glass, plate or bowl into the soapy water or under the running water. Next, have your child remove the object from the soapy water and scrub it clean with the sponge, adding more soap if necessary. Finally, have your child rinse the object with clean water, stacking cleaned, rinsed objects beside the sink.


With younger children, it is always a good idea to demonstrate how to do the above steps before asking them to do it for themselves.

, These are often more dirty, with stains and leftovers that are much more difficult to scrub off. Again, begin by helping your child submerge the cooking dishes into soapy water. Next, instruct your child to remove the object from the soapy water and scrub it clean with the sponge, adding more soap if necessary. Have your child rinse the object with clean water, stacking cleaned, rinsed objects beside the sink.


Remind your child that the cooking dishes can be very dirty, so extra scrubbing may be necessary.
You can use plastic scrubbers or steal wool pads if necessary.

, Once all dishware and cooking dishes have been washed and rinsed, its time to instruct your child how to dry. Make sure the drying towels are clean, and if they become too damp while drying, use a second towel. When everything has been dried, show your child where clean plates, glasses, pots and pans are placed.

Load the dishwasher with pre-rinsed plates.,
Instruct your child how to put soap in the dishwasher and how to begin the wash cycle.,
Complete the wash cycle.",How to Teach Your Child to Wash Dishes3," Dishwasher drains can be blocked by excessive food, and food left on plates can remain stuck even after going through a cycle. If your home has a dishwasher then, after the initial rinsing and before scrubbing have your child assist you in loading the dishwasher. Instruct your child on how to maximize space in the dishwasher by lining up plates properly.
Make sure that plates are not placed too close together, otherwise they may not get clean.
For older children who can handle sharp objects, teach them that sharp knives should be placed so that they always face downward.

, Soap is usually added to a dishwasher on the inside of the door, though this varies from model to model. It is important to instruct your child how to close and lock the dishwasher door properly after loading. The plate racks need to be pushed in before the door is closed. Once the doors are closed and locked, show your child how to run with wash cycle.

, Once the dishwasher has finished cleaning the plates, show your child how he or she can tell that the cleaning has stopped. The is usually indicated by a light or beeping noise. From there, you can show your child how to unload the clean plates, glasses, pots and pans. Help your child put the clean objects back where they belong, and celebrate a job well done together.

Redefine failure as a “learning opportunity.” Change the meaning of the word failure in your family’s vocabulary.,
Challenge them to take more risks.,
Use entertainment to drive home points.,
Give them opportunities to fail.,
Be sure to celebrate risk-taking now and then as well as taking on challenges and working hard to accomplish a goal.",How to Teach Kids to Learn from Failure1," Describe such situations as learning opportunities instead. This helps you use setbacks as teachable moments. Over time, your child will stop viewing failure negatively and look for the lesson.When you child makes an unsuccessful attempt ask them what they learned. For example, they screw up in the spelling bee and get disqualified. You might say, “I can see this is upsetting for you, but how can you use what you’ve learned to improve for the next competition?”
Also, make sure that you emphasize their progress. This will help them to see that they are improving even if they did not accomplish their goal. For example, you might say something like, ""I know you didn't win the competition, but look at how much further you got than last time!"";
, Failure is never a waste of time when it challenges a person to go beyond their comfort zone. Create a fun challenge with your kids to use mistakes as stepping stones. Make this fun and interactive.Develop a weekly check-in time (maybe at dinner every Friday). Have everyone go around the table and share a challenging situation that they failed at. You might even give stickers or rewards for the “biggest failure” each week.
Your kids might say, “I tried out for the baseball team although I’ve never played the sport” or “I asked the new girl at my high school out on a date and she turned me down.”
This check-in should be met with encouragement for the risks everyone took that week. Then, go back to the drawing board and remind everyone to fail even bigger next week.

, Many families connect over exciting movies and TV shows. If you want to help your kids see the lesson in failures, use their favorite forms of entertainment as a reference. You might sit down for an evening of TV and watch for situations when the characters made mistakes and learned from them.


Start a conversation by saying, “Billy failed his English essay, but how did he try to fix the mistake?” Your kids might reply, “He went to tutoring. He asked for an extra credit assignment. And he didn’t try to hide it from his mom—he just came out and told her upfront.”
You can also mention your own experiences with failure. For example, you might say something like, I struggled with math in middle school, but I studied hard and, by the time I was in high school, I was in the advanced class.”

, It’s in an adult’s nature to protect children. Your desire to protect, however, could be reinforcing learned helplessness. Don’t teach your kids that that’s “too hard” or you’re “too little.” Let them take a stab at challenging activities to build self-efficacy.


If you see your kid trying to do something that’s above their skill or developmental level, encourage them as long as it’s safe. For instance, if your young daughter tries to learn how to ride her bike without training wheels, say, “You’re so brave, sweetie. Let’s try this” instead of “Oh, don’t you think you should wait until you’re bigger?”
Let them take on challenges, and just be there to offer support if they miss the mark. It’s all a part of growing up., Avoid rewarding successful performance only."
"
Encourage them to adopt a learner’s mindset.,
Allow them to brainstorm solutions on their own.,
Help them assess feedback and use it to their advantage.",How to Teach Kids to Learn from Failure2," Children can naturally develop the ability to learn from failure when you constantly expose them to new things. The more new things they try, they begin to learn that taking risks doesn’t have to end in disaster.Always help your children search for new skills to acquire or new perspectives to consider. Read books. Get acquainted with new cultures.

, You may want to rush and fix every problem your child encounter, but they are much better off when they have the opportunity to try on their own first. Give your child the chance to consider options and think of a solution without your help.


Let's say your child has a fight with a friend. They may ask you how they should handle it. Give them the chance to figure it out for themselves first by saying, “I'll be happy to offer you some advice, but I want you to try to solve this on your own first. What do you think is the best way to make things better?”, When a teacher, coach or parent offers constructive criticism, many children focus solely on the negatives. Help your child learn to weed out the helpful nuggets found in criticism and take positive action towards improving in the given area.


For example, your son comes home and says, “Coach told me I will have to sit out the next game because I’m not working as a part of a team.” You might say, “I know that must be frustrating for you, dear. But let’s try to use his feedback to help you get better. What can you do to become a team player?”Encourage your child to think about why the person might be giving them constructive criticism as well. Seeing that the person may be doing so out of a desire to help them or out of love for them may also help your child to use the feedback in a constructive way.

"
"
Set realistic expectations.,
Validate their emotions.,
Balance constructive criticism with praise.,
Model a foundation of self-love.,
See a therapist if failure causes anxiety or fear.",How to Teach Kids to Learn from Failure3," Life is full of disappointments, but kids won’t take them so hard when parents start out with realistic expectations. Setting the bar unreasonably high can promote perfectionism, or worse, cause your child to avoid new challenges altogether. Be sure to communicate that you expect your children to do their best, not that they must always be #1.If you are not sure about is normal for children in your child’s age group, try talking with other parents or talk with a mental health professional. You can also read books or check online for information.
Set a rule in your household that everyone should always attempt to be better than the person they were the day before. This is a realistic way to encourage kids to strive without overly focusing on extreme successes.
For example, it may be unrealistic to expect all your kids to be straight-A students. Instead hold each of them up to their personal best. Examine past report cards, and challenge them to improve from where they were before. Challenge them to find useful ways of becoming better like getting a tutor or downloading software to help them practice academic skills.

, Oftentimes when kids face failure, adults move quickly into problem-solving without being sensitive to their feelings. Show empathy for your kids by acknowledging the emotional experience they are going through.You might say, “Jason, I can see that you are deeply hurt that you didn’t get the lead role in the school play. I’m sorry that this is happening to you. Do you want to talk about it?”
After you have validated their emotions, it may also be helpful to suggest activities that may help them to deal with disappointment, such as watching a funny movie, hanging out with friends and/or family, or taking some time to be alone.

, When parents and teachers are constantly berating kids about what they’ve done wrong, it’s easy to develop the notion that not always being right makes you a bad person. Aim to have more positive interactions with kids than negative ones. If you must be hard on a child, acknowledge their strengths in the same discussion.Don’t shame your children for making mistakes. Instead sandwich any feedback between two positive statements. For instance, you might say to your daughter, “You must be upset about your test scores. You are so bright. I think if you study on the mathematics portion a bit more, you’ll do well next time. I love you and I’m proud of your effort so far.”

, Dealing with disappointments is hard for adults, too. Be a good sport when you fail and set an example for your children. Don’t engage in self-pity or best yourself up. Be kind to yourself and demonstrate your faith that things will get better.


Remind kids to treat themselves as they would a friend. When kids have compassion for themselves, they are less likely to get caught up in mistakes. Plus, self-compassion builds stronger resilience for future setbacks., Some kids have a tough time leaving their comfort zones. If your child struggles with social anxiety or have an extreme fear of change, a professional therapist can help.Your child may be struggling with an undiagnosed anxiety disorder. With therapy and gradual exposure to feared activities, they can learn to expand their horizons and take more risks.

Choose carpeted stairs.,
Make sure the stairs have a railing.,
Put up safety gates.,
Move any toys or obstructions on the stairs.,
Show your toddler how to climb the stairs.,
Hold their hand as they go up three steps.,
Support your toddler as they go down three steps.,
Practice going up and down with them several times.,
Supervise your toddler as they climb up and down on their own.,
Remove the safety gates.",How to Teach Your Toddler to Climb Stairs," You should start your toddler out on carpeted stairs, if you have them. Indoor, carpeted stairs will be easier for your child to navigate than outdoor, concrete stairs. Consider adding carpeting or a runner to your indoor stairs if they are hardwood.
, Your toddler should only practice going up and down a set of stairs that has a solid railing on one side or both sides of the stairs. Test out the railing by putting your hand on it as you walk up and down the stairs. It should feel solid and secure.You may also opt for a set of stairs that have a railing that is low to the ground so it is easier for your toddler to reach.

, Start by making sure the stairs are safe enough for your toddler to practice climbing up and down on. Put up safety gates that are at least 22 inches (55.9 cm) high with no more than three inches (7.6 cm) between the vertical bars. Place one safety gate at the top of the stairs and one safety gate three steps from the bottom of the stairs.Make sure the safety gate is screwed into the wall, if possible. If not, secure it with straps or clips on the railing. Do not use safety gates that simply lean against the railing as they can fall, leading to possible injury for your toddler.

, Check that the stairs are free of any toys, books, or pieces of furniture that could get in the way while your toddler practices going up and down the stairs. You may need to move any furnishings on the stairs, such as decorative vases or plants. Make sure the stairs are free of clutter so your toddler has a clear, open path to practice on with you., Begin by showing your toddler how to walk up the first three steps. Hold the railing with your hand and walk up the stairs slowly. Then, turn around and walk back down the stairs. Put equal weight in both feet and take your time.Your toddler should observe your movements from a distance. Be expressive when you walk up and down the stairs. Say to your toddler, “This is how we climb the stairs” or “Watch me first.”
You should also tell your child the rules for climbing the stairs. You may say, ""When we climb the stairs, we move slowly and keep our hand on the railing.""

, Once your toddler has watched you climb the stairs, you can ask them, “Would you like to try?” Then, take their hand and stand next to them as they climb the first three steps one at a time. Make sure they have their other hand on the railing or on a solid portion of the stairwell so they can maintain their balance.Take each step one at a time, syncing your movements with your toddler’s movements so you are supporting them. Help your toddler maintain their balance as they go up the stairs.
When you both get to the top, you may say something positive like “Yay!” or “Great! Look at us.”

, Going down the stairs may be more difficult for your toddler, as they are typically top-heavy and may struggle with their balance. Support your toddler by holding their hand and taking the three steps one at a time. You may try counting each step with your toddler to help them focus on the task and stay balanced, saying “one, two, three” as you go down the steps.If your toddler seems to struggle with going down the stairs, you may let them scoot down on their bottom or their belly with their feet first. This may be less scary for them to try at first. With practice, your toddler may grow to be more comfortable going down the stairs on their feet.

, Help your toddler practice going up and down the stairs several times. Hold their hand tight and encourage them with positive words so they stay engaged in the activity.During the practice runs, you may notice your toddler starting to get more confident with going up and down the stairs. They may start to become more balanced and put less of their weight on your hand. They may also grip the railing more tightly and lift their legs to land on the steps with confidence.
Once your toddler climbs three stairs with confidence, you can try challenging your toddler to go all the way to the top of the stairs by removing the first safety gate. You could then both practice going all the way up to the top of the stairs and back down again together.

, Once you feel your toddler is confident enough to go up and down the stairs, allow them to attempt the first three steps on their own. Stay a couple steps behind (when going up) or in front (when going down) of your child to catch them if they stumble. Keep your arms out and support them if they start to lose their balance, especially when they come down the stairs.Encourage your toddler to go up the stairs with positive words, such as “Keep going!” or “You got it!”
If your toddler does not make it up the stairs on their own the first time, try to remain positive and encouraging. Assure them that you are right there to help if they need it. Sometimes toddlers just need to feel supported to conquer challenging tasks like climbing the stairs on their own.

, If you feel your toddler has mastered climbing up and down the stairs on their own, you may feel comfortable with removing the safety gates from the stairwell. You may remove the first safety gate at three steps so your toddler can go up and down the entire stairwell on their own. Or you may remove both safety gates so your toddler can come and go as they please on the steps.Only do this if you feel your toddler is able to go up and down the stairs without supervision. You may keep one or both safety gates up as a precaution until you feel your toddler is skilled enough to be on the stairs on their own. This is especially important at night if your toddler may get out of bed.
Some experts recommend keeping safety gates at the top and bottom of your stairs until your child is 3 years old."

Floating them around and teaching them to splash are early tools that can have big payoffs later on.
You can also try placing a small child is a secure flotation device to let them explore the water in a new way.;
, Even playtime in the bathtub can help babies and young toddlers adjust to water.


Give your child a chance to experiment with water in the tub and provide toys to show him it is fun, not scary.
Don’t try to shield the water from your toddler’s eyes when you wash his hair, as getting used to the sensation of water in the face will be beneficial when it comes to swimming.

, When you bring an infant or toddler into the water with you, always keep them in your arms and stay in the shallow end of the pool.


Keep an eye on inflatable toys and other pool equipment that can pose a drowning risk and always keep emergency equipment nearby in case of emergency. Your emergency equipment should include basic first aid supplies, as well as a flotation device and CPR equipment.
To make sure your child is extra safe, learn proper CPR technique and become CPR certified at your local fire station or community center.

, By the time a baby becomes a toddler, they are much more active and curious about the water. Before they get in the pool, teach them about water safety.


Make sure your child is familiar with the pool rules, such as not running and only going into the water with an adult. Help your child understand that it is important to follow the rules to be safe and not get hurt.
Each time you go to the pool, repeat the rules so your child is clear on the expectations.

, When teaching a toddler to swim, it is important to do it in a controlled and safe environment. An indoor pool is the most ideal location because of its controlled atmosphere and safety from the elements.


Don’t teach your child to swim in a lake or ocean, as currents, animals, and unpredictable situations can make things dangerous and scary for your child.
If you are using your personal pool to teach your toddler to swim, make sure it is safe with a tall fence and a self-locking gate that children can’t reach. Always remove toys after playing in the pool so your child isn’t tempted to go in after them, and cover your pool with a hard pool cover, not a soft, flexible model.
Remember to always keep a close eye on your child and to not bring things that could distract you from your child’s safety.

, When teaching a child to swim, water wings and other inflatable floating toys can give parents and toddlers a false sense of security.


They can be useful in helping children get into the water, but if the devices were to lose air, your child would be in serious danger of drowning.
The best flotation device is a well-fitting life jacket with an adjustable strap between the legs, although it is not a necessity in a pool.

, The American Association of Pediatrics recommends that children take an organized swimming lesson to teach them basic skills, but recommend that children younger than age 4 only enroll in classes where their parents are in the water as well.Having parents in the water with them helps toddlers be more comfortable in the water, and taking the class from a trained instructor helps ensure they learn age-appropriate skills in a safe environment.
Swim lessons are offered at most recreation centers or through private businesses.

, Ask around for recommendations and visit each location and instructor before signing up. If possible, take a trial class to see if it is a good fit for your and your child.


Toddler swim classes should focus on getting your child comfortable in the water and teaching basic skills like blowing bubbles, floating, kicking, and putting his face in the water. Smaller classes tend to be better for toddlers, as they get more attention and are safer because the teacher has less to distract them.
Look for a teacher who understands proper swimming technique in a pool that is safe and clean. Pools should have multiple lifeguards as well as CPR and emergency equipment at the ready.

, When your toddler is learning to swim, always stay positive. Create a welcoming environment in the pool where your child feels safe and free to learn and explore. Praise your child after even success and don’t push too hard if he is scared or uncomfortable.


Toddlers are fickle, especially about the water, so he may jump in one day and be scared of the pool the next. Stay calm and patient and do things on your toddler’s time.
Don’t rush into learning new skills if your child isn’t ready as that can create anxiety and an unsafe situation.

, If your toddler has a traumatizing experience in the water or they are startled and don’t want to continue, let them have a break from the water. Although swim skills are important, they won’t do any good if your child is scared or anxious around water.


Water fear is a real issue, especially for young children—don’t dismiss their fears quickly, but rather take the time to listen to them and calm them down. Take a break, which can be as short as a few hours or as long as a few weeks, until your child is ready for the water again.
When you bring them back, start slowly and gradually put them back in the water. Bring toys and have a good support system, such as friends or family members, to encourage them to stay in the water.

, You can also teach your child how to swim on your own or supplement their swimming lessons with other activities. Get toddlers excited about the water and remove any stress or fear by using fun games and activities to teach swimming skills.


When trying anything new with a toddler, be sure to fully explain what you are asking them to do in simple terms, such as “I want you to chase after the ball, then I’ll help you kick your legs”.
Always give your toddler a countdown before the activity so they aren’t caught off guard.

, Help your child get comfortable in the water by starting them on the steps of the pool and sitting by them or giving them a toy.


Make sure they start on a level where their head and upper body is safely out of the water.
Slowly encourage them to move down the steps so more of their body is covered with water.

, Show your toddler how to blow bubbles by taking a deep breath and sticking your face under water. Have your child practice the buzzing motion out of the water, and then encourage him to put his face into the water.


It can be scary for kids to put their face in the water, so go slowly and take it at your child’s pace.
Place a small toy or ball in the pool and see if your child can blow it all the way across the pool while you support his body.

, Have your toddler sit on the edge of the pool and show them how to kick with their legs out straight in front of them. If needed, stand in the pool and hold your child’s legs and move them in the right motion.


Have your child pretend they are different animals, such as a dolphin kicking its legs. Tapping into a child’s imagination can help them feel much more comfortable in the pool.
Once they are comfortable, you can also hold them on a kick board and have them kick their legs as you move them around the pool.

, Throw a ball or inflatable toy around the pool and help your child chase after it by holding onto their waist and letting them kick and glide. This prepares toddlers for floating and gliding on their own.


Once you get to the toy, turn around and throw it again before chasing after it.

, Hold your child or sit them on a step. Explain to them what you are going to do and that you want them to go all the way underwater for a few seconds. Count down from three and then either dunk your child by holding them under the armpits or have them go underwater on their own.


Children should take a deep breath and close their mouths. For younger toddlers, you can give them a sharp tap on the forehead right before you put them underwater, which will automatically make them close their eyes and plug their nose.
Take a break after each time your child goes underwater and don’t push them to do it too much in one session.

, Support your child and have them rest their head on your shoulder. Support each half of their body equally so they are floating straight on top of the water.


Floating on the back can be difficult for kids, especially as they get water in their ears, so make sure they know you are holding them and that they are safe.
Start by only floating for a few seconds, then work up to more time as they get comfortable.

, Once your child has mastered the float, prepare him for the glide. Start with your child 3–5 feet (0.9–1.5 m) away from the wall of the pool and support his chest and legs.


Have him put his face in the water and gently glide him to the edge of the pool. As he gets comfortable, increase the distance to the wall and encourage him to kick his legs and move his arms.
Once you are comfortable letting your child go in the water, have him glide from one adult to the other. Give him a good push or have him push off your legs and glide to another adult standing 3–4 feet (0.9–1.2 m) away.

, Have your child sit or stand at the edge of the pool. On the count of three, encourage him to jump into your arms in the pool. This teaches him how to get into the water and makes him comfortable with water splashing in his face.

, As children get more comfortable in the water, you can practice their skills with games such as Simon Says, Follow the Leader, or Wheels on the Bus. You can also take any classic children’s song with actions, such as “London Bridge” or “If You’re Happy and You Know It” and have children do the actions in the water to practice skills and make them more comfortable.

Tell your child that you are proud of them for apologizing.",How to Teach Your Kid to Apologize," The best time to teach a child is when they are young. That way, these ideals and values will stick with them throughout their lifetime.


In fact, apologizing is an art and there are key elements to an effective apology. According to Ellen Notbohm, apologies need to be specific and making amends should be a part of the apology.Children also need to acknowledge or admit that they were wrong and learn how to ask for forgiveness. The same goes for the offended party – children need to learn to forgive and move on.;
, Explain to your child that a good apology has different parts and that a mumbled ""sorry"" will not suffice. For instance, a good apology should have each of the following:


I’m sorry for …. “stepping on your toes” (specific behavior)
This is wrong because …”It hurt you when I did that” (acknowledgement that it was wrong)
In the future, I will … “be more careful where I step on” (restitution for wrong done)
Will you forgive me? (asking for forgiveness)

, Children also need to learn how to apologize in the appropriate tone of voice.


You can model this by saying the same statement “I am sorry I stepped on your toes” in different tones of voice and asking your child which she thinks tells her you’re really sorry.
Body language is also important. Crossing the arms while stating the apology, glancing sideways or looking down at the toes drips with insincerity. You need to encourage your child to look you in the eye when she’s apologizing, to stand straight or at least keep still and use an appropriate tone of voice.

, Children who have been taught by parents how to apologize properly might become baffled at not being apologized to if they are the ones being offended.


Some children are even brave enough to approach the offending child’s parent or caregiver and point out that the other child has hurt her and that he didn’t say sorry.
Even though the other parent can force out an apology from the offending child, you still need to talk to your child about these things. The best you can say is that not all children are like her - ready to admit their mistakes and ask for forgiveness.

, Beware if your child blurts out an apology a little too quickly, such as “Fine – I’m sorry”. Children have a keen sense of an impending lecture, especially if they know they are in the wrong, and will say sorry just to avoid the lecture.


In this case, try to limit lectures the next time your child has misbehaved. Moreover, this attitude will tell you that your child has not really learned anything apart from saying the words. Most younger children won’t even know why the offended party is still upset even though they’ve already “apologized”.
In this case, point out to your child that although saying sorry helps, he still has to mean it. For older children, you can reinforce this by letting them read books about apologies such as ""David Gets in Trouble"" by David Shannon, ""Martha Doesn’t Say Sorry"" by Samantha Berger and ""Zach Apologies"" by William Mulcahy.

, It's important to understand the fact that most toddlers cannot yet grasp the concept of apology and empathy since they are still in the “me” phase. That is why as parents, you need to be able to step in right away during a conflict and be ready to state when an apology is needed.


For children 2 years and below, avoid focusing too much on forcing a “sorry” out of your child after they have done something wrong; instead, focus on the rules that your child has to follow in order to avoid future conflicts.
Examples of these rules are – “no hitting other kids”; “share your toys with your brothers/sisters”; “take care of your toys”, etc. The more you focus on abiding by these rules, the less likely you will encounter conflicts later on.

, Older preschoolers (around 3-5 years old) have a greater capacity to understand simple cause and effect situations, because of their developing language and cognitive skills.


Therefore, you can start to teach her the basics, for example: if she feels pain, he/she says “ouch!”; if he/she hurts someone else, she can say “sorry”. Even if these kids don't fully understand why they have to say it, you can encourage them to make it a natural reaction.
Keep any explanations simple. For example: “We say sorry when we’ve done something that hurts someone – just like when you stepped on Mark’s toes”.

, Help your child to understand empathy by saying something simple like “How would you feel if someone stepped on your little toes? Wouldn’t that be painful”?


Although it's too early for a preschooler to fully understand what empathy is, you can still help them understand in the simplest terms that what she/he feels or will feel when hurt, and that these feelings can also be felt by others.
One meaningful approach for toddlers and preschoolers would be to help them relate the other child’s feelings. This way, children can understand the link between their action and the other child’s reaction.
For example: “Look at Mark, he’s rubbing his toes where you stepped on. That must be painful. Let’s see if he’s okay.”, In order to teach your child to apologize, it's important to continue to reinforce rules and enforce consequences, as necessary. For example, you could say something like:


“If you keep trying to hurt your playmates, we won’t be coming back to this playground anymore and even if we did, nobody would want to play with you. Would you like it if the other kids didn’t want to play with you?""
Sometimes parents focus so much on forcing an apology from the child that they fail to correct the misbehavior that caused the trouble in the first place.

, As a parent, one good thing you can do is ask your child questions to help her understand her actions and how she felt at the time.


Perhaps he/she did something wrong because she was mad or frustrated for not getting to play in the monkey bars. In this case, a lesson in “taking turns” is in order. Next, you can help your child tie his/her emotion and action to the result. For example:
“I understand you got mad because of that, but we don’t hurt others just because we’re mad. Next time, you can tell Mark that it’s your turn at the monkey bars – or better yet, tell him you’ll both go”., Starting at age 6, young children already have a better sense of what’s right and what’s wrong and they start to develop empathy; but that doesn’t mean that apologies will come any easier.


Yes, they are no longer in the “me” phase of their development, but then comes other feelings of fear, embarrassment, and hesitation to “lose face” in front of others – which are equally challenging feelings to overcome.
Here are some things you can do for your child to help them overcome an aversion to apologizing.

, As a parent, you will often hear words like “He did it!” or “He started it!” Make sure to calmly explain to both parties that it doesn’t matter who’s at fault in order for one to apologize. The fact that the conflict happened means they need to be sorry about it.


Calm them down for a while and explain that they need to recognize that something “bad” happened and that they should feel sorry that it had to happen in the first place. You can place your child in a quiet corner and tell her she needs to stay there until she is ready to stop being mad.
You can tell your child to help you out with something to get her mind off the conflict for a while. This will help young children calm down, recognize the hurt feelings and restore the relationship then, before moving on.

, Doing things together also helps young children to calm down. Sometimes the only thing keeping them from apologizing is fear that their apology will be unwanted.


To overcome this, you can say something like “You obviously hurt Mark’s feelings because you stepped on his toes. I’ll go with you and we’ll apologize together, okay?”

, Some kids find it easier to act out the apology by kissing or hugging the offended party or bringing the offended party a flower or a card stating the apology.


Make sure to be present when your child acts out the apology so you can explain to the other child that the action means he’s sorry for what happened.

, It’s hard not to feel mortified when you see your child refusing to apologize for something that she did wrong – whether to you or to another person. But keeping your own anger in check helps keep things calm and you are better able to convey the importance of apologizing to your child.

, No one will feel good about an apology that’s made under duress because if he states an “I’m sorry” that’s just too quick, or in a whinny or snarly voice, then it’s a meaningless apology because he walked out still feeling angry and indignant; and this won’t teach your child anything.


If she/he refuses at first, talk to him privately and calmly ask why he/she refuses to apologize. If he worries that he will be snubbed by the offended party, tell him that you will stay with him during his apology.
If your child is more comfortable showing his apology then you can explain to your child that it's okay to say he/she's sorry by giving the other child a hug, or by making them an apology card.

, If your child is still being difficult, you should let your child know that there will be consequences for his actions and that a refusal to apologize will make people look at him in a negative manner.


Point out that if he refuses to apologize, the other child may not want to be his/her friend anymore, or the other children may not want to play with him/her.
As most children generally want to please others and do not like the thought of people being angry with them, this will often be enough to convince them to apologize.

, A lot of parents feel that saying sorry to their child is a sign of weakness. On the contrary, this is actually a sign of maturity and wisdom. Remember that apologies are not only for kids.


A child who has never been apologized to will not understand the concept of an apology. Moreover if you do not apologize to your child, he/she might harbor feelings of hurt. This will not be good for your relationship in the long run. In fact, the best way to teach anything to a child would be through example.
If you have done something wrong, be ready to admit it but refrain from long explanations. Try to be specific, for example “I’m sorry I yelled at you. That was uncalled for”. This will teach your child that although everyone makes mistakes, it is very important that apologies be made to make things better.

, Sometimes, a child will simply refuse to say sorry to the offended party. According to Dr. Howard Bennett, MD, from the George Washington University School of Medicine, children learn by letting them experience the consequences of their actions. However, this is not to say that you should automatically scold your child.


Instead, you can model appropriate behavior in front of your child and turn your focus to the offended party. Let your child hear you say sorry – “I am so sorry for what happened, Mark. John is usually very careful when he plays but today I guess he just wasn't being careful enough when he stepped on your toes”.
When your child sees that you have given extra attention to the hurt party, he/she will think about what he/she did and if he/she starts working his way towards an apology later on, be sure to praise him/her for that. Be ready to hug your child. This way, he/she will be assured that any mistakes that he makes will not affect your love for him/her.
Remember that rewarding appropriate behavior is more effective than handing out punishments and modelling good behavior is a lot better than forcing a reluctant apology from your child.

, In sibling conflicts or play date squabbles, you can use appropriate consequences to teach your child that he/she needs to man up and take responsibility for what he/she did. Apart from saying sorry for destroying a sibling’s toy or hurting someone during a play date, make sure that he also helps in fixing the toy.


Try to refrain from nagging or spanking right away. There have been numerous studies about how spanking affects children and all these studies basically show the same result – that spanking children does not produce good long term results.
In fact, a major study done at Tulane University published at the American Academy of Pediatrics showed that spanking remains to be a strong predictor of aggressive and violent behavior in children.Simply put, spanking teaches children that it is ok to hit or hurt others who are smaller and weaker. As parents, what you need to do instead is to get to the bottom of the bad behavior.

, Your child must have had a reason for acting so. It might be due to frustration or anger. It could just be way of getting your attention. Nonetheless you need to find out the reason for your child's actions. That way you will know the best way to reprimand him/her.


Older children and teenagers can have heavier consequences in order for them to learn from their mistakes. It could be a few extra hours of house chores for 2 weeks, no video games, no sports or an added effort to reach a specific grade in class.
Whatever the consequence is, make sure that your child comes out of it wiser. Make sure that your child understands the need to fix things up for the offended party.

, It will also help if you let your child know that you recognize and acknowledge his/her feelings of indignation or embarrassment about the conflict and the need to apologize.


When he/she has apologized, show him that you appreciate his humility in asking for forgiveness by saying “It takes a lot of courage to admit your mistake and I am proud of you for that.""

Set the pedal up so your child can start pedalling without training wheels.,
Explain the act of pedalling on each alternate pedal.,
Hold on to your child while she practices pedalling.",How to Teach Your Toddler to Pedal a Bike," While you do not need to go into detail explaining what each part of the bike does, it does help to give your child an idea of what she will be riding around on. Bring your child’s bike out and set it up so that your child can look at it.


Point out where your child will sit, where the pedals are, and how the wheels move.
Plan to begin teaching your child how to pedal when she is between three and six years old. If you show your child how the pedals work before the age of three, she might not understand your instructions.;
, Put your foot or hand on the pedal and make the pedal rotate in order to show your child how the pedal works. Point out that when the pedal moves, the wheels also move. Let your child push the pedals with her hands so she can begin to get a feel for the movement.


Hold the bike up while you do this so that the wheels can move freely and your child can see the bike in action.

, Have your child sit in a chair that is roughly the same height as the bike seat. Sit across from your child, facing her. Put your palms at the height of the pedals and have your child place a foot in each of your palms.


Now push your child’s feet up and down in the same movement that she would do if she was pedalling.
Once she has gotten a feel for the movement, have your child ‘pedal’ with your hands.

, Ask your child to lie down on the floor. Lie down across from her so that the bottoms of your feet are touching the bottoms of her feet. Put your feet up in the air (with her feet still touching yours) and begin to pedal like you would on a bike.


Have your child try to push your feet in a pedalling motion to help her gain the strength she will need to push the pedals on the real bike.

, Sit on your bike and slowly pedal so that your child can see how you move your legs (and how the wheels move because of the pedalling you are doing).


Try to pedal slowly at first, and then more quickly as your child gains a better understanding of what you are doing.

, Bring your child to a park where other kids ride bikes. Watching her peers may help your child to compartmentalize the process of pedalling.

, Because your child is a toddler, she should have a toddler-sized bike. If the bike is too big, your child won’t be able to reach the pedals, so take her to pick out the bike when you purchase it. To determine if the bike is the right size:


Help your child to get on to the bike. Have her stand above the top pipe of the frame with both feet on the ground. If she can do this comfortably, the bike is the appropriate size.

, Seat height is very important for proper pedaling. Begin by putting the bike seat at its lowest level so that your child can practice pushing the bike (rather than pedalling). Once your child is ready to start pedalling, adjust the seat so that it is consistent with your child’s height.


To determine the seat height, make sure that your child can reach the pedal with her whole foot when the pedal is the lowest position.

, It is very likely that your child will tip over or fall off the bike while she learns how to pedal. Because of this, a helmet is of the utmost importance.Fit the helmet so that when it is strapped to your child’s head, it doesn’t wiggle very much, but is also not glued to your child’s head.
The helmet should also sit levelly across your child’s forehead.

, If your child is very scared of falling, consider helping her by putting training wheels on her bike so that she can practice pedalling without the fear of falling.


Once she has mastered riding the bike with training wheels, take the training wheels off and proceed to the next step.

, Grass is good to practice on because it provides a cushion for when your child falls while she practices pedalling.


Pick a spot that has a gentle slope to it to help your child practice going up and downhill.

, The hill should decline just enough that the bike can roll without your child pedalling it. You can even take the pedals off of the bike to help your child practice. Instruct your child to avoid touching the ground with her feet until she makes it down the hill. Doing this will help her to gain a sense of balance.Once your child can go down the hill comfortably, put the pedals back on and have your child place her feet on the pedals. Instruct her to avoid pedalling, put instead to just go down the hill with her feet on the pedals.

, Bring your child (and the bike) to a flat surface. Have your child get on to the bike, with one foot on the ground holding her up. Bring one pedal up so that it is at its tallest height and ready for your child to place her foot on it and start pedalling.


Explain again that the bike will begin to move when she presses the pedal down with her foot.

, Explain that you need to push the pedal alternately. Show that when one pedal is up, the other is down. Explain that your child needs to push one pedal down first, and then push the other when down when it is at its highest point.


Remind her that the faster she pedals, the faster the bike will go.

, Hold on to the bike seat and have your child begin to pedal. Run behind or beside the bike while your child pedals on her own.When she (and you) feel confident with her pedalling skills, allow her to try pedalling on her own. You can even give her a little push to help get her momentum going.

Learn how to perform CPR on a baby.",How to Protect a Baby from Drowning1," Never leave your baby, even for a few seconds, when water is nearby. The risk of the baby crawling in and slipping under is too great.


Turning your back to the baby, or reading a book while he or she plays, even if you're sitting just a few feet away, can also lead to dangerous consequences. Keep a close eye on your baby at all times.
When water is involved, whether it's a pool, lake, or puddle, it's better not to let your baby wander too far off, even when you're watching. Keep him or her nearby.
Always make sure certified lifeguard is present in swimming areas, but don't rely on the lifeguard to watch your baby. Lifeguards have too many people to watch out for; your baby needs constant supervision from you.;
, When you go swimming, outfit your baby with a flotation device that will keep his or her head above the surface of the water at all times. Be sure to use one that's the right size for your child; they're made for babies 8 pounds and up. Never use an adult life jacket, an inflatable raft or tire, or water toys to keep your baby afloat; these are too large, and a baby could easily slip out of them. , If you have a backyard pool, pond, or any other type of open water source, make sure it's covered up. Pools should be fenced with a gate that locks. Even buckets of water can pose a tremendous risk to your infant or toddler, so be thorough.

, When water drains from a pool or hot tub, it creates suction. Yours should be fitted with an anti-entrapment cover or some other type of safety system to prevent your baby from getting sucked under the water. Have a pool technician come to your home to make sure it's properly installed.Make sure other pools you may be using with your baby, such as a friend or family member's pool, have these safety precautions in place.

, Swim lessons are available for babies 1 year old and up. Never assume, however, that because your infant can swim that he or she can't drown. Constant and close supervision is absolutely critical for all ages and swimming abilities.

, Everyone on board should wear flotation devices, including adults, to set a good example. A baby taken on a boat must be supervised at all times and not allowed to climb up on the sides of a boat. As an adult, it is always your responsibility to assess dangers from water. It is up to you to ascertain the following:


Whether it is too stormy to go out boating
Whether the water is too cold, choppy, risky for swimming
Whether there is adequate life safety equipment on board a boat or with you at the beach (e.g., presence of life guards)
Whether other children are being too boisterous around a baby, infant, or toddler

, In the case that your child swallows water and begins to drown, you need to know how to save him or her. Learn first aid for a drowning baby so you'll be able to come to your child's aid in an emergency."

Use the proper technique for bathing your baby.,
Baby-proof toilets and other sources of open water.,
Teach your baby about water safety.",How to Protect a Baby from Drowning2," Fill a shallow tub with just an inch or two of warm water. Never let the baby's head go under water as you bathe him or her; instead, cup your hand or use a container to gently pour water over the baby.


Never leave your baby unattended in the bath. Even an inch or so of water can be life threatening.
Avoid using infant bath seats. According to Safe Kids World wide, eight children per year drown due to the use of infant bath seats. Babies, infants, and children can easily slip out from this and get caught under them or by them, unable to face back to the air.
Do not ever leave your infant or toddler in the care of a sibling in a bathtub. Unless a sibling is 16 years or older, it is not appropriate to place this huge responsibility on a child.

, The toilet lids in your home should be fitted with baby-proof latches. Make sure not to leave buckets of water or other liquids within reach in the kitchen, bathroom, garage, or other areas of the house. Fish tanks, fountains, and other water sources should be covered or well out of reach.


Empty water toys and buckets immediately after using them.
Do not leave standing water in the sink.

, As your baby gets old enough to understand that water can be dangerous, teach him or her the proper way to behave around water sources. Don't let him or her work the water faucets without adult supervision. Make sure older children in your home are also aware of the safety measures that must be taken to keep babies safe from water.

Teach children age-appropriate lessons.,
Make your kids earn money by completing chores.,
Give your children opportunities to shop and compare prices.,
Require that kids develop a savings plan for pricey items.",How to Teach Your Kids to Be Frugal1," How you teach your child about money should change as they age. Smaller children understand concepts differently than older children do, and this is no different when it comes to money. If you start young, however, you will be able to slowly introduce your child to managing money in a way that is easy for them to understand.

Younger children ages 1-4 can learn how to use a piggy bank. Help them place money that you give them into the bank. When the child has enough money, show them that they can use the money to make a purchase.
Children ages 3-5 can help you clip coupons and give them to the cashier. They also enjoy pretend shopping and playing store. Help your child set up a ""store"" in your home, then let them ""shop"" there.
Older children are ready to earn their money by doing chores.;
, All kids want an allowance, but in order to teach your children the true value of money, you may want to make them work for it. You can create a basic weekly allowance depending on good behavior and chore completion at an amount that is comfortable for you. Then, create a chart that lists out how much they can earn for doing additional chores, such as washing the car, babysitting younger siblings, or helping with breakfast., Depending on your children’s ages and knowledge levels, you can start teaching them to be frugal shoppers early on in life. You can do this when you are buying groceries and household necessities for the family, or you can supervise your kids when they spend their own allowance of gift money.

Take them to the store and quiz them on different items based on price, quality, and size. For example, you might show them the price of a 4-pack of toilet paper and then examine the 24-pack. Calculate the amount of savings they can enjoy buy purchasing items in bulk., If your children are in elementary school or older, you can teach them the value of saving by opening accounts in their names. You might deposit small sums into the account as you see fit, but also make sure your child is making deposits as well.For instance, if your son keeps begging you about purchasing a new gaming system, have him research the price of the system with tax included. Sit down and take a look at how much money he has in his savings account. Then, calculate how much he will have to save and for how long to have enough to make the purchase.
Your kids can do odd jobs around the house like taking out the dog or making their bed to earn small sums of money to put into savings. Kids can also use a portion of their weekly allowance to go to savings.

"
"
Teach children how money is acquired.,
Create and stick to a household budget.,
Don’t spend frivolously on yourself.,
Minimize household waste.",How to Teach Your Kids to Be Frugal2," Young children do not yet understand that money is earned and then spent or saved. If you don't teach them that they can earn money, then they may develop a perception of scarcity. This is especially true if you focus on frugality and saving without first showing them that the money can be replenished.

Discuss how you earn your money and help them brainstorm creative ways in which they can earn some. For example, talk to them about running a lemonade stand or selling handmade friendship bracelets.
Teach your children that, while they should respect money, they still have the power to gain more if they choose to put forth the effort.

, If you have not already developed a household budget, you can use such an exercise to teach your children lessons on frugality. Take an afternoon when you don’t have plans and sit down at the kitchen table with your bills and expense documents handy. Children often struggle to comprehend the true costs of living because no one has told them that someone is paying for them to live in their home or that the food that appears in their refrigerator each week has been purchased.Tally up the total cost of the necessities first: housing, transportation, utilities, groceries, supplies, childcare and insurance. Then, include additional budget items such as clothing, travel, or entertainment. Show your children how much you require each month to cover all expenses. Then, each month, you might go back and produce receipts of all money spent that month to make sure you are on the right track.
Show your child how they can track their own expenses so that they can see how things add up.
When money gets tight talk with your family about what you can sacrifice in order to stay within the budget. For example, during a strained month, you may have to eat mostly all dinners at home or skip the usual weekend cinema trip., It’s hard to help your kids develop frugal living skills if they see you being careless with your own spending. If you truly want to teach your kids how to be strict with their finances, you need to be a good role model. This means skipping the overpriced lattes, new sports car, or weekly mani-pedis.


Being a frugal role model also translates to smart spending. Some people believe as long as they purchased an item at a discounted price, then they are practicing frugality. However, if you are buying something that is excessive or that you don’t actually need simply because it’s on sale, you are being frivolous, not frugal., Being a positive example of frugal living requires being strict about household consumption. Food, personal care products, and even energy must be monitored to ensure you are not wasting money. What classifies as waste may look differently between households. In general, this may mean being more energy efficient with electrical appliances and usage, eating leftovers, or using old food as compost.


Explaining why you need to cut down on spending can be hard. So, find a way to add incentive to minimizing waste. For instance, you might say, ""If we are careful with out electricity use this month and remember to turn off lights in vacant rooms, we may have extra money to go on a special outing. Can you kids help me make sure we are using electricity wisely?""

"
"
Find cheap sources of entertainment.,
Play a game at home.,
Come up with silly meals using what’s in the fridge.,
Go thrifting.",How to Teach Your Kids to Be Frugal3," Who says saving money has to be boring? Show your children how interesting a frugal lifestyle can be with a bit of cleverness. Learn how to make do with less as a family.Make your family mantra ""the best things in life are free.""


Cancel your cable or satellite subscription and get acquainted with Netflix or Hulu. Find out all the wonderful amenities available at your local library. Get inventive and swap out weekend cinema visits to outdoor movie theatre in lawn chairs on the backyard. There are tons of ways to have fun while spending little or no money.
Focus on spending time together as a family.
Learn to enjoy spending time outdoors. Nature can be a great source of entertainment if you engage in hiking, picnicking, or just playing in the park.

, Another exciting way to pass along your frugality gene is by creating challenges in your household that allow everyone to join in on money-saving. Find out who can use the least electricity. Choose one day each month to unplug your internet, turn off the lights in your house and go outside for family fun day., Leftovers don’t have to be the bane of your family’s existence. Select one day each week to heat up foods that you already have rather than cooking an entirely new meal. Let your kids go crazy in the kitchen, choosing whatever they can find (that’s wholesome and healthy, of course) to create a meal.

, Are you in the market for a new bookshelf or sofa? Or, maybe your kids need some new outfits for summer. You can find good quality, durable items at thrift stores, flea markets, and consignment shops in your area. Visiting second-hand shops opens your children’s eyes to the multitude of goods that are available at low prices simply because they have been gently used by others.Plus, when you make purchases at thrift stores, you can put the excess money you save towards something else.

Encourage your child to practice treading water for longer and longer each time.",How to Teach Your Kid to Tread Water," Kids should be taught to tread water before they are taught how to swim. Try to teach water treading as soon as your child is capable of following directions and copying the example of the adult.Since younger kids are more prone to accidental drowning, learning this skill early increases their chances of survival if they should end up in the water.;
, Rather than immediately working on everything involved with treading water, it is better to safely work on the different parts of the body that are involved on dry land. Begin with doing some slow breathing exercises, then move on to incorporating arms and legs.An ideal place to practice these movements is at a playground.
Kids learn better when they are having fun, so making games out of the lessons is helpful.

, Start by simply breathing with your child. Try breathing in for a count of four, and out to a count of four. In time, try increasing the number to five or six. Maintaining a slow, steady flow of breath helps your child to stay calm and tread water effectively., Make sure your child knows that in order to tread water, they must be in a vertical position with their head above the water. As you work on breathing and arm movement exercises, remain upright with your child.If your child is not in a vertical position, with his head out of the water, he is technically swimming.
While it is important to teach your child to swim, the ability to tread water should come first.

, Your arms should be held out in front of you, then moved slowly toward the back. You will repeat this motion (front to back, back to front) the whole time you tread water. Demonstrate this movement, and encourage your child to try.It may feel more natural to your child to move their arms up and down, but this is not an effective way to tread water and will tire them out quickly.

, Make sure you're in a space where your child has room to stretch his arms all the way out. Then pretend that you and your child pretend are pushing your way through tall grass or jungle vines.

, The palms of the hands should be facing the direction the arms are moving (as if they are parting the pretend grass or vines and pushing them to the sides so they can get through). When the arms go as far as they can comfortably go toward your kid’s back, they should rotate their hands so that the palms face forward while moving his arms toward his front.These motions should be done slowly and evenly to conserve energy.

, Once your kid has mastered the proper arm motions, you can move on to teaching the proper leg motions. Although breathing and arm-only exercises can be practiced standing up, in order to do leg exercised you will need to sit, lie down, or try other position with your child.Practicing at a playground is ideal because your kid can be helped into a position where his feet are not on the ground.
You can help your kid hang from a horizontal bar or suspended rings on the climbing tower to practice the proper leg motions.
To demonstrate these motions, suspend your own body off the ground or maneuver your child’s legs for him until he can do the motions on his own.

, One of the easier leg motions to learn is known as the ""scissor kick."" To do this, simply move your legs apart (one toward the front and one toward the back) then reverses them. Demonstrate this move for your child. Then ask them to pretend their legs are scissors cutting through a piece of paper., The ""frog kick"" is a move where you bend both legs with the knees pointed outward, then extend both legs at the same time. Demonstrate this for your child, then ask them to pretend like they are a jumping frog., The most efficient leg motion for treading water is called ""the rotary"" or ""eggbeater,"" but it is often the most difficult for kids to learn. For this one, one leg makes slow clockwise circular motions while the other one makes slow counterclockwise motions. Demonstrate this for your kid, then ask them to imagine they are mixing eggs (or cookie dough) with each foot. Try doing each leg independently, and work up to doing both at the same time.The movement of the legs needs to be timed in such a way that as the right leg moves away from the neutral position, the left leg is moving toward the neutral position, and vice versa.

, After your child has learned the arm and leg motions, the lessons should be continued in water. A pool works well for this because it is much safer than using a large body of water like the ocean or a lake.The pool needs to be deep enough that your child cannot touch the bottom with his feet so that he can work on the proper leg movements for treading water.

, For safety reasons, you should stay in the water near your child throughout the lessons in the water. If your kid has never been in a pool, take extra time to help your kid get used to it.Since your kid’s head might end up going under while learning to tread water, make sure that your kid will not panic if this occurs.
To practice going under, ask your kid to hold their breath (and pinch their nose closed) as you gently pull them under water and immediately bring him back up.

, Start the lesson at the edge of the pool so that your kid has the added security of holding onto the wall with one hand at the beginning and just doing the arm motions with the free arm. Once your child manages to tread water while holding the wall, he should be encouraged to release his hold on the wall and allow himself to drift away from it., If your kid is worried about leaving the security of the wall, offer to support him at the waist as long as it can be done without interfering with your kid’s arm and leg movements. This exercise is meant to make them safer and more comfortable around the water, not create additional fear. Avoid pushing them to anything they are not comfortable with.You child can also wear some type of flotation device such as armband floaties, an inflatable loop around his waist, or a life vest, that keeps your kid’s head above the water and does not interfere with the movement of his arms and legs.
When you and your child feel comfortable with the idea, your kid should tread water without any support from you or flotation devices.

, There is no way to know how long your child might need to be able to tread water in an emergency. Depending on the location, it is possible that help might not arrive for hours. Therefore, it is a good idea to work on extending the amount of time that your child can tread water while practicing in the pool. Not only will this work on his efficiency, but it will also increase his endurance.


Depending on the abilities of your kid, you might start at just two to five minutes of unsupported water treading.
Gradually increase it by increments of ten minutes at each practice session.

Emphasize punctuality.,
Teach accountability with weekly chores.,
Practice following directions.,
Give them jobs to do around the house.,
Encourage your child to volunteer.,
Allow your teen to babysit.,
Explain the importance of eye contact.,
Encourage your teen to complete tasks cheerfully.,
Advise your teen to discuss their performance with their employer.,
Help your child pick out some work-appropriate outfits.",How to Teach Your Teen to Be a Good Employee," One of the most important qualities your teen needs to learn in order to become a good employee is punctuality. Showing up late all the time never reflects well on an employee’s record. Encourage your teen to be on time to events and meetings, even if they are just more casual gatherings.Make an effort to be on time yourself so that your teen can learn from your behavior.
If your teen is already employed, be supportive of them getting to work on time each day. Encourage them to prioritize being punctual to their job, and don’t give them instructions that would make them late to their job.;
, Help your teen learn about showing people they are dependable by assigning them weekly chores as part of their household responsibility. Learning how to handle tasks and complete them on time is an important skill for a good employee to possess.Tell your teen that they need to clear the table and wash the dishes every night after dinner. Or you could make them be in charge of cleaning their room and washing their own clothes.
Encourage your teen to get all of their work done on time – whether it is homework, household chores, or tasks related to their job.

, Assign your teen tasks and give them specific instructions. Follow up once the task is complete to ensure that they followed your directions. This is an important lesson for your child to master if they want to become a good employee.If your child struggles with following directions, walk them through the task step by step and supervise the process so that they can learn how to do the task on their own.

, In order to practice the skills your child needs to become a good employee, you should give them jobs to do around the house. In addition to their weekly chores, you can use money as an incentive to complete these additional tasks.You can make the jobs optional if you want, so that your teen learns that you must complete jobs assigned to you in order to earn your paycheck.

, A great way for your teen to practice the skills needed to become a good employee is by volunteering their time somewhere useful. This helps your child practice feeling responsible in a semi-professional way, especially to someone who is not you (their parents).Your teen could volunteer at a local nursing home, at a nearby hospital, or even at church functions.

, If you have close friends or family who are in need of a babysitter, let your child volunteer for the job. This is a low-pressure way for them to practice being responsible, especially if they are already familiar with the family they would be babysitting for.You could even start by letting your teen babysit at your home, where you can supervise, before they begin doing it at the family’s home.

, Eye contact is a very important element of interacting with other people, especially in professional settings. Maintaining eye contact shows that you are focused and actively engaged in listening to the person. This helps to inform your boss that you are paying attention and will be able to retain whatever information they are passing to you.If your teen struggles with maintaining eye contact during conversations, try practicing holding eye contact together, just the two of you. They can also practice with other friends and family members.

, Employers do not want to feel like you hate your job or aren’t happy to be there. Therefore, your teen should try to maintain a positive attitude at work, even when completing menial or unenjoyable tasks.You could try having a deduction system for their chores around the house. Every time your child complains, they earn less money for completing the job.
Encourage your child to complete jobs that you (or their boss) didn’t ask them to do. If they see something that needs doing, they should motivate themselves to do it.

, If your teen is worried about making a good impression at work, encourage them to discuss their performance with their boss. Tell your teen to say that they want to do a good job, and possibly even take on additional responsibility (if they feel ready).


Discuss the importance of accepting constructive feedback with your teen. If their boss tells them to change how they are doing the job, it is important that they heed this advice. Instead of taking it a personal affront, they should use it to improve their performance.

, In order to make a good impression on prospective employers, your teen will need to dress the part. Talk to your child about what is and is not appropriate to wear to various kinds of jobs. Bring up the job they want and discuss together what kinds of outfits would be appropriate for that job.If you or your teen think they don’t have the right kind of clothes for the job, consider purchasing your child some work clothes if you can afford it.
Your child also needs to be well-groomed. In addition to dressing appropriately, encourage your child to bathe regularly and groom themselves.

Develop your own “practice.” Before you can help your children develop a mindfulness practice, you need to develop a practice of your own.,
Set a time for family practice.,
Encourage your children to participate with you.,
Explain the importance of mindfulness.,
Try to practice every day.",How to Teach Your Kids Mindfulness1," Establish a regular meditation practice and incorporate mindful activities into your daily life. During your day, perform breathing exercises and try to develop your concentration.If you have a partner, consider asking them to join you in developing a mindfulness practice.
It will likely take some time to establish your own practice. Be patient with yourself while you develop it.;
, Once you have developed a practice, you will want to set aside specific times to educate your children. Depending on you and your children’s schedules, you should find a time when you are all home and in a good mental space to learn. After you establish a time to practice, make sure that you stick with it in order to build a routine.Consider establishing a practice on the weekends or on week nights when you are not very busy.
Maintaining a consistent routine will be essential to developing your children’s practice.

, Initially, you will spend a fair amount of your time demonstrating how to do things like meditation and breath awareness. However, you should quickly begin to encourage your children to participate in the practice. Use simple exercises like listening to a bell or using a breathing buddy to get your children involved in the practice.Remember that your children will probably not pick up on the practice right away. It will take time before they begin noticing things.

, Because your children will likely be curious about why you are incorporating these new practices, you should explain to them the importance of mindfulness. Sit down with your children, possibly during your family practice, and discuss with them the benefits of being mindful. Explain to them that you are helping them develop a means of calming themselves and managing their anxiety.This method may work better with older children who are better able to comprehend and understand the importance of anxiety management.
For younger children, it may be best to instruct them on the exercises and then address any questions that arise during practice.
Put your explanation into words that your kids can understand. Try saying something like, ""This is sort of like a 'time-in' instead of a timeout. You can use this tool to make yourself happier, so you won't have to go into as many timeouts.""

, The best way for your kids to develop a strong mindfulness practice is by incorporating daily exercises. The more often you make mindfulness a part of the routine, the quicker it will become a part of your family’s culture. Over time, you will find your children engaging in mindfulness practices without being prompted."
"
Practice listening to the bell.,
Guide them through body relaxation.,
Ask them to listen to their heartbeats.",How to Teach Your Kids Mindfulness2," During your family practice, have your children sit or lay down on the floor. Then, instruct them that you are going to make a sound with a ringing instrument and that they should listen carefully until they no longer hear the chime. You can also make it game like by having the children raise their hands once they no longer hear the sound.To make the sound, you should consider using a singing bowl, bell, set of chimes, or another ringing instrument.

, Have your children sit or lay on the floor with their eyes closed. In a gentle tone, begin guiding them through their body’s efforts to relax. Start with the head and neck, moving to the fingers and toes. By listening to your voice, this will help your children focus their attention. It will also help them become more familiar with feeling their body relax.When you are guiding your children, say things like “Feel your neck relax” and “Now, feel the tension leave your fingertips.”
You can also guide your children through an imaginary peaceful place, such as a garden or a park, and describe how scenic it is.

, Have your children jump up and down in place for a few moments. Then, tell them to lay or sit down and put their hands on their heart. Have them close their eyes and concentrate on their heartbeat and breath. Instruct them to think about any other sensations that they feel at the moment.This exercise is also useful for practicing breath awareness.

"
Try ""tense and let go"".,
Practice buddy breathing.,
Ask them to visualize their breath.",How to Teach Your Kids Mindfulness3," Have your children lay on their backs with their eyes closed. Then, tell them to tense up every muscle in their bodies, from their toes to their head. Have them tense their bodies for a few seconds before instructing them to release. Ask them to concentrate on how their bodies feel, paying particular attention to their breath.You can have them repeat the exercise a few times to help your children work on their body and breath awareness.

, To develop their breathing, have your child lay on their back with their favorite stuffed toy on their stomachs. Have your child focus on the rise and fall of the stuffed animal as they breathe. Ask your children to concentrate on their breathing and the sensation of gently raising and lowering their animal., While you guide your children through a meditation or relaxation exercise, have them visualize a rainbow or a bright light coming out of their bodies with every breath. Ask them to concentrate on their breathing while they focus on this image of themselves."

Take mindful walks.,
Try mindful eating.,
Encourage your children to take three mindful breaths throughout the day.,
Share daily gratitude.",How to Teach Your Kids Mindfulness4," Take your family for a walk in a nearby park or open space. Ask the children to pay attention to the things around them. Tell them to notice what they see, hear, smell, and touch. This will help them be mindful or their surroundings and develop a practice that is less reliant on home., Give your child a piece of fruit or a vegetable and ask them to pretend that they have never seen it before. As they eat it, ask them to describe the various sensations that the piece of food inspires. Make sure that they describe the ways in which the food engages with all five of their senses., At various points during the day, have your children close their eyes and take three mindful breaths. Ask them to take three long and deep breaths, fully releasing after each breath. Be sure to join your children in this exercise and make it a family practice.You can come together as a family before you go to school or before you eat dinner.
Try to make it a routine part of your family’s daily habits.

, Before your child go to bed, share with them something that you appreciate. Then, ask your child to do the same. By expressing your gratitude at the end of the day, you are helping your child develop insights about their lives. It also helps them foster an appreciation for the good things that they have in their lives.Try to do this every night in order to make it a regular bedtime habit.

Learn to be patient with the child.,
Start with the basic stuff: Alphabet, colors, animals, objects, things you might call someone else (Ex:dad, mom, sister, brother, uncle, aunt etc...).,
At this point it may become a little frustrating because when you ask the child something, they may not remember it.,
Playing word games is a good way to help the child to memorize the vocabulary.,
Once the child has built up their vocabulary, you can teach them phrases.,
By this point, the child will be able to hold small conversations.,Help them learn new words they might not know, and teach them little poems or puns to help them enjoy knowing the language more

,
Be social.,
Have a person in your child's life speak only in that language to help your child get to know the other language.",How to Teach Your Children a Second Language," The very first thing in teaching a child how to learn something is lowering yourself down to the child's age. In short, your understanding mentality should be of that age of the child. Children's brains are fairly different to adult brains - not just in size but also in processing. So when teaching a child, take it slow. It is tempting to just jump right in and try to teach them big phrases and ask them to recite them back to you. This is called mimicking. All the child is really doing just repeating what you have said without knowing what it means.;
, A good thing to do is buy little toy animals or show pictures of animals to help teach the child what they are called.

, The younger the child is, the more likely they'll forget what you taught them yesterday. So, this stage of the child's learning is all about repetition. You do not have to do a lot of it. Once the child can repeat the object's name or can retrieve the item you might have ask them to bring, then you are good to go on to the next stage.

, One fun game is to hide the toy animals or pick random objects around the room you are teach them in, and ask them to bring it to you. But it is best to switch it up once in a while, kids are quick to pick up on patterns.

, At this point you can either do both teaching them how to read (can do this also in beginning) and speak or just speak. Start out with small phrases then go up to step by step.

, It will be best if the child is taught to talk to you in the language only versus just using the language when needed. This way the child will not forget it, even if they only talk to you.

,, One way children learn language is by being social with people who also know the language. This way, it helps promote good conversation skills.

, Don't frustrate your child by doing this early on, though."

Explain how to ask for consent.,
Teach them the importance of saying “no” or “stop.” You should also tell your child that it is important that they feel comfortable saying the word “no” or “stop” if they do not like how someone is touching them.,
Do not force your child to hug, kiss, or touch others.,
Use the correct terms for private parts.",How to Teach Your Kids About Consent1," Start by sitting your kids down and explaining the importance of asking for consent before you do something to another person. Tell your child that it is important to ask the person, “Can I…?” or “May I…?” Then, they should wait for the person to say “Yes” before they act. This can help them understand that consent is essential when interacting with others.For example, you may say to your child, “What do you say before you touch someone’s arm at school?” They should then respond, “Can I touch your arm?”
You may then reply, “That’s right, and what do you have to hear before you can touch their arm?” Your child should then respond, “Yes. They have to say yes before we can touch them.”
You can also establish the rule of consent for things other than touching, as this will help to reinforce the importance of asking for permission before doing anything to anyone. For example, you may say, “What do you say when you want to play with your sister’s toy?” Your child should then say, “May I play with the toy?”
For children between 1-5 years old, you should focus more on asking for permission, helping others, and saying ""No.""
For children between 5-12 years old, you should focus more on teaching kids to respect one another’s space and to avoid bullying behavior to help grow empathy.
For teens and young adults, the focus should be more on sex, self-esteem, and setting healthy boundaries.;
, This could be touches like tickling, pinching, or even stroking their head. Let them know that their body belongs to them and they have control over how it is touched. Remind them that saying “no” or “stop” to someone means they should stop what they are doing.For example, you may tell your child, “If you do not like how someone is touching you, you should say ‘stop’ or ‘no’.”
You can also prompt your child by asking, “What do you say if you don’t like how someone is touching you?” Your child should then answer, “No” or “stop.”
You should remind your child that even if they say “yes” to something at first, they have the power to say “no” or “stop” if they feel uncomfortable. For example, you may say to your child, “You can say ‘no’ if you start to feel uncomfortable, even if you have said ‘yes’ at first.”

, Resist the urge to make your child hug or kiss relatives hello or good bye. Try not to force your kid to shake someone’s hand if they feel uncomfortable, especially if the person is a stranger. Allow your child to decide if they want to be touched by others. This will help them feel in charge of their bodies and give them the chance to consent before being touched.For example, rather than say to your child, “Kiss your grandmother goodbye”, you may ask your child, “Would you like to kiss your grandmother goodbye?”
You may also simply skip the hugging or kissing portion of a greeting so your child does not feel pressured to do these actions with others. Try to give your child space to decide these actions for themselves.

, Make sure your child understands what their private parts are so they can control how they are touched. Use the correct terms for their private parts, such as “penis” or “vagina,” and encourage them to clean or wash their own private parts in the shower. This will help them understand what their private parts are and allow you to reinforce the importance of keeping these areas private or covered.For example, you may tell your child, “It is important that you keep your private parts covered and that only you touch them. You need to keep them covered with your underwear when you are at school and do not show them to anyone.”
You should also tell your child that no one should touch their private parts. You may say, “No one is allowed to touch you there. If they ask to touch you there, you say ‘no’ or ‘stop’.”

Ask your child for consent on a regular basis.,
Respect and listen to your kid’s feelings.,
Demonstrate consent when you are around other adults.",How to Teach Your Kids About Consent2," As a parent, you should model good consenting behavior for your child. This will normalize consent for your child. Many children learn about how to act with others by watching their parents. One way you can model good behavior is to ask your child for their consent on a regular basis. Before you touch your child, you should ask for their consent so they understand the importance of saying “yes.”For example, before you grab hold of your child’s hand, you may ask, “Can I hold your hand?” Wait until your child says “yes” to then hold their hand.
Or if you are helping your child in the bathroom, you may ask, “May I help you with your underwear?”

, Your child should feel they have power and control over their bodies. One way you can make them feel this is way is to listen and respect what they have to say. Pay attention when they talk about how they feel and encourage them to talk about their feelings. This will allow them to feel comfortable with expressing themselves around you and feel they can trust you.As you listen to your child speak, ask open ended questions. Be a good listener so your child feels they can share their feelings and be honest about how they are feeling.
For example, your child may say to you, “I’m tired today.” You may then respond by asking, “Why are you tired?” or “Why do you think you are so tired?”

, As a parent, you should get in the habit of demonstrating consent in front of your child when you are around other adults. This means asking a person you just met, “Can I give you a hug?” before you hug them in front of your child. Model consent for your child so they know how to do it themselves.You should also be willing to stop a behavior if the person is uncomfortable. For example, if a family member you are tickling says “stop” or “no,” you should stop tickling them.

Speak to your child’s primary care doctor.,
Talk to your child’s teacher.,
Reach out to other parents.,
Do some research online.",How to Teach Your Kids About Consent3," If you struggling with having a talk with your child about consent, do not be afraid to lean on the guidance of your child’s doctor. You may ask your child’s doctor how you can discuss consent with your child and seek their advice. You may also see if your doctor would be willing to explain consent to your child during their next physical. Sometimes learning about consent from a doctor can be more comforting for a child.You may ask your doctor, “Would you mind helping me explain consent to my child?” or “Could you talk about consent with my child during our next appointment?”

, Another resource could be your child’s teacher, especially if they have one main teacher that they say every day. You may pull your child’s teacher aside and ask them if they have any protocol at school on how to talk about consent. Depending on your child’s instructor and school, there may be a program in place to talk about the importance of consent with the students.You may also ask your child’s teacher for advice on how to discuss consent with your child. You may ask, “Do you have any tips on how to talk about consent with my kid?” or “Do you do any activities in class that address consent with the student?”

, You should also consider reaching out to the parents of your children’s friends for advice and guidance on how to talk about consent. Do not be afraid to use other parents as a network for talking about consent with your children.


You may ask a parent, “Do you have any advice on how to talk about consent with children?” or “How did you address consent with your child?”

, You can use online resources as well to learn how to teach your child about consent. There are several articles, websites, and organizations out there that offer help in this area.

For example, An organization called “Stop It Now” has some good guidelines and tips on their website that assist with talking to your kids about consent.

Begin teaching your child how to chew properly at an early age.,
Take the time to talk to your child about table manners.,
Set proper chewing expectations and examples.,
Be a role model for your child.,
Keep a close eye on your child during mealtimes to make sure they chew with their mouth closed.,
Be patient.,
Reward proper chewing.,
Consider creating consequences if necessary.,
Understand that some toddlers may be suffering from a condition that keeps them from chewing with their mouth closed.,
Look for enlarged adenoids.,
Understand that inflammation of the epiglottis could cause your child to chew with her mouth open.,
Look for signs of infection.",How to Teach Your Child to Chew with Her Mouth Closed," It’s much easier to teach a child to chew with his or her mouth closed when they are young than to address the issue a few years later when it is a full-blown habit and they do it to spite the parents.


Use your parental judgment to determine what is the right time—most parents crack down around preschool age or whenever open-mouth chewing becomes an issue.
There are pros and cons to starting earlier or later—younger children are more moldable, but need more constant reminding and teaching. Older children can understand closed mouth chewing better, but it can be more difficult to change their habits.;
, Communication is key - take the time to talk to your toddler, when she’s in a good mood, about table manners and what good behavior or behaviors are expected.


Your toddler is not expected to sit through a 30 minute lecture on what good table manners are but gentle reminders every day or before and during meal times will be helpful.
It can also help to use visual cues for your toddlers such as raising your hand (not too high, just in level with your face) when they start chewing with an open mouth. This can give them a gentle, non-verbal reminder that they should close their mouths.

, Most children will not intuitively chew with their mouth closed, so you'll need to instruct them and tell them why it’s important.

Telling you child why we chew with our mouths closed and setting expectations that everyone at the dinner table will chew with their mouths closed makes it easier for children to want to follow the new rule.






Show your child how it is done by taking small bites and slowly putting each bite in your mouth. Teach them the proper technique and make sure they know exactly what to do.






Take advantage of resources to show your child proper table etiquette. Picture books, such as “How Dinosaurs Eat Their Food” and “Dinner with Olivia” are effective for teaching toddlers and preschoolers the right technique and why it is so important.







, Be an example to your child by always chewing with you mouth closed and making a point of waiting to speak until you finish chewing. When this happens, point out to your child that you waited to talk.


Encourage older children to chew with their mouths closed as well, to set a positive example for the younger children from all members of the family.







, It will take a while for this new eating style to become a true habit, and children will need lots of reminders. To make things easier, consider creating a signal or buzzword to remind children to chew with their mouth closed.


Depending on the ages of the child, this can be as simple as raising a hand when they chew with their mouth open or pointing to your mouth to remind them of the proper way to eat.
When your child doesn't chew with their mouth closed, take a minute to remind them of the proper technique.

, Younger children will need consistent reminders and may take longer to adapt to the new habit. This is most likely just due to their age, not their personality.


Slow things down at dinner by encouraging everyone to take smaller, slower bites and show proper chewing technique.
You may need to stop your young child after every bite to remind them to close their mouth, but repetitious reminders can lead to strong results.

, As with most teaching exercises, children react to rewards. Positive reinforcement and praise when they eat an entire meal with their mouth closed can be incredibly powerful.


Consider making a sticker chart for each meal your child eats with his or her mouth closed, or offer incentives like later bedtimes or fun play dates if they chew with their mouth closed for a certain number of days in a row.
Rewards are dependent on the age and personality of each child, so use your parental judgment to create a system that works best for your child.
You can also reward smaller children by serving their favorite foods at mealtime. This not only creates a positive connection between chewing with their mouth closed and mealtime, but makes them excited to eat every day.

, If you are teaching an older child to chew with their mouth closed, or if your child is chewing with his or her mouth open out of spite, consider imposing consequences.


These can sometimes create a negative association with mealtimes, but can also be powerful motivators to encouraging good behavior. Again, tailor the consequences to each child.
Possible options include removing the child from the dinner table, making them eat alone, or taking away a toy or fun activity.

, Some toddlers may have difficulty breathing while eating, which is why they need to chew with their mouth open. Conditions such as enlargement of the adenoids, inflammation of the epiglottis and throat infections may cause a child to chew with their mouth open.

, The adenoids are a patch of soft tissue located just behind the nasal passage which helps to trap bacteria and other harmful organisms in entering the throat and the body. This usually shrinks by the age of 5..


Sometimes, when the adenoids are enlarged, the child will have difficulty breathing through the nose. The child will constantly keep her mouth open in order to breathe well, especially when eating.

, The epiglottis is a soft tissue structure that is part of the throat. It protects the windpipe or trachea from food particles being inhaled when eating.


Pediatric epiglottitis is different from the same condition in adults in that the epiglottis is more forward located in the throat, thereby becoming more prone to bacterial infections. The most common cause of epiglottitis in children is the Haemophilus influenza type B bacteria.
When an infection in the epiglottis sets in, it is almost always accompanied by inflammation. When this happens in children, there will be fever, sore throat, high pitched breathing sound or stridor, difficulty chewing with mouth closed and difficulty swallowing. There will be evident drooling and a general restless behavior.
If you suspect that your child may suddenly have developed an inflamed epiglottis, seek medical help immediately as this is potentially life threatening.

, Other infections in or affecting the throat, such as the common cold, common sore throat or tonsillitis are some common infections of the throat that may cause your toddler to chew with the mouth open.


Infections and inflammation of the soft tissue in the throat, coupled with cold symptom,s usually make it difficult for anyone to breath normally, much more in a toddler.
So before worrying why your toddler is not eating normally “like all the other kids”, try to be an observant parent first and find out if there is a reason behind the problem.

Engage critical thinking.,
Practice coping skills.,
Teach frustration tolerance.,
Practice meditation.",How to Teach Your Kids Life Skills1," Show your child how to observe problems, think critically, and come up with positive solutions. If your child asks you a question, don’t rush to answer it. Ask, “What do you think?” For example, if your child is curious about why you have to do laundry, ask, “Why do you think we wash our clothes?” Allow your child to theorize and come up with their own answers. Then, spend some time explaining or do some internet research together.Use everyday experiences to practice problem-solving. For example, if you need to change a lightbulb, ask your child what you can use to reach the bulb to change it.;
, Coping with stress is an important part of childhood and adulthood. There will always be situations out of your control or unexpected occurrences that you have to deal with and work through. Whatever your child’s age, validate their feelings (“It looks like you’re feeling sad” or, “I can tell this makes you upset”) and begin to help your child label their emotions and experiences.Once a child is older, say, “What can we do to help ease the hurt of this?” Offer ideas such as journaling, listening to music, or going for a walk.

, Kids (and adults) of all ages can benefit from learning frustration tolerance skills to cope with stress. Some common triggers include transitioning from one activity to another, feeling misunderstood, struggling with a task, or unexpected situations. Help your kid understand their frustration by labelling the emotion (“You look frustrated”) and connecting their emotion with their body.You may say, “I can tell you’re frustrated because you’re making fists and yelling.”


Help your child become calm by practicing deep breathing together. Ask your child to visualize red, yellow, and green stoplights when angry or frustrated. If at red, stop and do some deep breaths. If at yellow, have your child ask themselves, “What are three things I can do?” When they’re at green, they can feel calm, choose an option, and move forward.

, As children continue to experience stress and the bombardment of technology, it’s important for them to know how to unplug and clear their minds into a calm and relaxing space. Especially as children often receive diagnoses of anxiety and depression, meditation can support mental health and be used as a preventative as well.Practice meditation as a family and make it a regular habit. Get together as a family and find a comfortable seating position. Set a timer for 5-15 minutes each day quieting your thoughts and actions.

Show your child how to do basic chores.,
Go grocery shopping together.,
Get your children comfortable in the kitchen.,
Practice waking up and leaving the house on time.",How to Teach Your Kids Life Skills2," As children develop, get them more engaged with chores around the house. Teach young children to sort laundry. As your children get older, show them how to set the dials on the washing machine and transfer clothes to the dryer or hanging line to dry. When doing basic home improvement like hanging a picture or building furniture, bring your child along to buy supplies and complete the task.Get children involved in chores like cleaning the bathroom and washing the dishes to help build skills and contribute as a family.

, Take your child to the grocery store and enlist their help in getting ingredients for the week. Before heading out, sit down with your child and create a shopping list together. Then, show them how the aisles are labeled and how to choose items. Send your child to pick out simple items. You can also begin to show your child how to find sales items or comparison shop.Show your child how to buy ripe fruit and veggies and how to check the expiration dates on foods.

, Basic cooking skills are essential to have by adulthood. Start building these skills early by having young children scoop out yogurt or add fruits to a meal. As a child gets older, enlist their help in making meals and show them how to put together dishes. For example, have younger children add ingredients to the blender for a smoothie and have children ten and older get comfortable using the stove for boiling water or making eggs.Teach your child how to make family recipes and pass them along. Supervise their work but let them measure out ingredients and do whatever work is needed. For example, instead of getting the flour or baking pan, say, “Now you need the flour and the pan.”

, As children become older, they should rely less and less on their caretakers to wake them up or get them to school or work on time.If your older child relies on you to wake up, pick out an alarm clock together that they can start to use on their own. If more than one child gets ready at the same time in the morning, discuss who gets the shower and the bathroom at what times.


Let your children decide how much time they need to get places on time. If your child is often late, help them brainstorm ways to prepare the night before. For example, encourage your child to make their lunch and pick out their clothes so that they’re ready when they wake up the next day.

Teach your kid to speak up.,
Model respect for other people.,
Practice money management and budgeting.,
Get your child comfortable with public transportation.",How to Teach Your Kids Life Skills3," If your child is upset with a grade, coach your child how to talk to their teacher. This can also help if your child doesn’t make the team. Instead of asking the teacher or coach what went wrong, let your kid know that they can do it on their own.Validate their experience, yet encourage them to seek answers on their own.


Say, “I know you’re upset and confused about not making the team. Go to the coach and ask what happened and how you can improve for next time. I know you can do it.”
Teach your child to speak up when something is wrong. If your child is getting picked on or notices another kid getting picked on, tell them to say something. Try, “It’s not okay to be mean to people” or, “If you don’t stop, I’m going to tell an adult.”

, Find ways to teach your kids manners in the moment. For example, have a rule of no cell phones at the dinner table, or to excuse yourself if you need to take a phone call.Your children look to you in how to treat others, so treat those in your life with respect. Apologize when you hurt someone’s feelings and avoid interacting with people in a rude way. Your children can begin to pick up on your example.


Treat those you interact with on a daily basis with respect. This includes the grocery store clerk, delivery person, and the restaurant server.

, When you go to the ATM, make it clear that the machine dispenses money that you’ve earned and doesn’t give out money. Involve your children when you pay bills for your home, helping them understand that things like heat and lights cost money and need to be paid for regularly.Help your child set up a basic budget or savings plan to get the things they want.


Arrange for your children to complete chores and get money weekly. This can help them to learn how to save up for things they want.
For more information, check out How to Teach Your Child About Budgeting.

, As children get older, show them how to ride the train, bus, make a flight, or get a cab. Some people feel fearful with the crowds or knowing when to get off the bus or train. Take some trips with your child to show how to do it. Instill feelings of confidence in their ability to navigate on their own and get places quickly and economically.From a young age, take your child on public transportation. Once they’re older, they can do it on their own and feel confident in their skills.
Build their navigation skills by creating treasure maps and having them look for buried treasure. Allow your child to co-pilot in your car and learn how to follow directions.

Understand the importance of teaching your child stroller safety.,
Establish a set of rules regarding stroller safety.,
Explain your expectations to the child.,
Teach stroller safety using books and songs.,
Teach stroller safety in a positive way.,
Explain to your child the consequences of not following the rules.",How to Teach Your Child Stroller Safety1," Young babies are safe in strollers because they don’t really move and are just strapped in for the ride. Things become difficult for toddlers around 18 months to 2 ½ years because they want to escape or walk by themselves.


This can be especially dangerous in crowded places, where it is easy to lose a small child. If your child runs away or tries to escape, try to look at things from his perspective. Your child is most likely not running away to spite you, he simply wants to exercise his independence and walk or run on his own.
Talk to your child about why he doesn’t want to be in the stroller—once you understand the why of the problem, you can look for ways to solve the issue. For example, if you child just wants to run, let him run free of the stroller once you get to the park or other safe place.
If they try to escape because the stroller is uncomfortable, adjust the straps until they are at the right levels for baby comfort.;
, Establish a set of rules for the stroller that you and your spouse will always implement.


Make sure your child knows what the rules are and why it is important that they are followed. Teach your child that the rules are for their safety and that they could get lost or hurt if they don’t follow the stroller safety rules.
Follow general stroller safety guidelines—your child should always be strapped in to the stroller, no matter how wiggly they are. You should also always set the brake when the stroller is parked and not overload it with heavy bags.
When your child sees that you always follow the stroller rules, they will have a good example and want to follow the rules as well.

, Before each stroller outing, explain that outing’s specific expectations to your child. Tell him or her where you are going and what you want them to do.


If you are going to the mall, tell him, “We’re going to the mall. I need you to stay in your stroller because it is busy, but you can get out and play when we get to the play area.”
Reinforcing the rules and expectations before each trip keeps things fresh in a young child’s mind.

, You can also use entertainment to teach stroller safety principles at home by reading books and singing songs.


Picture books like “Stay Safe, Play Safe” and others can help your children understand stroller safety.
Songs can also be effective. You can make up your own tune to sing your family’s stroller rules or sing along to songs like “Safety Comes First” and “Street Smarts”. Once your child is familiar with the songs, you can sing them while you are out in the stroller to remind them to be safe and stay close to you.

, Children will more easily accept the rules and follow them if they are allowed some freedom. Instead of telling them everything they can’t do in and around the stroller, tell them some things they can do.


If running in public areas isn’t allowed, give them guidelines and show them where they can run around out of the stroller. Knowing that they have some freedom will help children, especially older children, understand and follow the rules.
This doesn’t mean you can’t set limits, but a child will accept limits and more easily regulate himself if there are positive aspects to the rules and places where he can be free.

, Another effective way to teach stroller safety to your child is to explain the consequences.


For example, you can tell your child in simple terms that if he stands or leans out he might fall and hurt himself. Try to be specific and tell him that he might bump his head, scrape his knee or hurt his arm.
You can also demonstrate using his stuffed toy. Make the toy fall out of the stroller and then pretend the toy is crying or hurt.

"
"
Keep your child entertained while they are in the stroller.One of the main reasons that children get upset or are unsafe in the stroller is because they are bored.,
Keep your children close.,
Pretend that the stroller won't move unless the child behaves.,
Praise and reward your child for good behavior.,
Discipline your child when necessary.,
Have a back up plan.",How to Teach Your Child Stroller Safety2,"


Play games while you’re out in the stroller like “I Spy” to give clues about mystery items around the stroller. You can also play a game where the child is on the lookout for clues about where you are going, like directions to the park or the right aisle of a store.
Encourage your child to bring a book or toy in the stroller to distract and entertain them. Having a separate set of “stroller toys” helps keep kids’ attention because it is a fresh set of toys they don’t get to play with all the time.

, It’s safe to let your toddler run ahead of the stroller if you are in a safe, open space, but you should always be able to see your child.


Make sure your child can see you and teach him to look around periodically to see if he can find you. You can remind him to do this with a noise like a whistle, or by yelling a keyword reminder.
You can also turn it into a game and play Catch Me if You Can, where you are the target and your child has to come back and tag you every so often. This is fun for kids and keeps them close by and within your sight.

, You can invent rules to make your child comply with safety measures. For instance, you can tell your child that the stroller won’t move unless he strapped on the safety belts.


You can also tell him that the stroller won’t budge if he is not seated properly or will stop whenever he tries to stand. To make it more realistic, pretend that you really can’t make the stroller move, and connive with his daddy or brother to also pretend and make the ploy more convincing.
This strategy is especially effective if you’re going to a place that your child is excited about, such as the park or the mall. If he remains stubborn and tries to throw a tantrum, stand your ground and tell him again that the stroller will only move when he follows the rules. Keep this in mind because if you give in, it is more likely that he will use this throw-a-tantrum technique to get his own way.

, Children are more likely to maintain good behavior if they see that it doesn’t go unnoticed. Stay positive and praise your child when they do something right.


After each stroller trip, tell them what you appreciated and what they could still work on. For example you could say, “You did a great job! I loved how you played so nicely with your stroller toys. Next time, can you hold my hand while we cross the street to the park?”
If necessary, give your child rewards for safe stroller behavior. Rewards could be as simple as a sticker for each outing where they follow directions and are safe, or could build up to a larger reward such as a toy or fun activity.

, Toddlers can be difficult, especially when they don’t follow the rules you have set. If your child is repeatedly disobeying the stroller rules and putting themselves in a dangerous situation, it may be time for disciplinary action.


Use your judgment as a parent to find a consequence that will work on your child. For some toddlers, having to use a harness or be carried around is embarrassing and traumatic enough that they will follow the stroller rules.
Other children may respond better to a series of warnings and having some of their toys taken away. However you discipline a misbehaving child, be sure to let them know why they are in trouble.
Reiterate why it is so important to be safe in the stroller and go over the rules again. If you children are old enough, you can even ask them to repeat the rules back to you to make sure they really understand what you are asking of them.

, If your child is having a hard time understanding stroller safety rules, always have a backup plan. Be flexible with your schedule and don’t be afraid to cut an outing short if they are misbehaving or being unsafe.


You can also try a different approach to the stroller and use a carrier or harness instead. A carrier generally looks like a large backpack that your child can get strapped into and be carried around. It keeps the child close to you and contained, but can be difficult for older or larger children.
A harness attaches to the child and to the parent and works like a dog leash, giving the child freedom to walk around but keeping them within the range and control of their parent. Harnesses can be difficult to use in crowded places, as someone walking in between the parent and child can trip on the cord and cause injury for everyone.

Explain to your child that every day is a new day.,
Name the days of the week.,
Explain that there are only seven days in a week.,
Teach your child to distinguish between today, yesterday and tomorrow.,
Explain the difference between working days and weekends.",How to Teach Your Child the Days of the Week1," The first step is to teach your child that every time he wakes up, it's the start of a new day.;
, Teach your child the names of the days of the week — Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Tell him what day today is.


Write the days of the week on flash cards and teach your child to rank them in the correct order. Arrange them on a table or on the wall and practice together.

, Try to explain to your child that seven days make one week. When one week is over, another one begins.

, Although it can be confusing for them, try to explain to your child the difference between yesterday, today and tomorrow.


Explain yesterday: Tell your child that yesterday was the day before today. Name it and connect it with what you were actually doing yesterday.
Explain today. Tell your child that this is the current day and try to connect it with the activities that are planned for today.
Explain tomorrow. Explain that tomorrow will come after today. Name that day and emphasize the activities that will mark it

, Tell your child that Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday are the days when kids go to school and parents go to work. That is why these days are called working days.


Then explain that Saturday and Sunday are the weekend, a time for relaxation and fun, when there is no school or work.

Use kid friendly terms.,
Do not compare your children to one another.,
Ask about games without focusing on winning.,
Show your children news stories about sportsmanship.",How to Teach Your Child to Be a Good Sport1," When explaining sportsmanship, tell your child about the issue using terms they will understand. Explaining it in as simple terms as possible will help your child understand and embrace sportsmanship.Explain it in terms of the golden rule. Tell your child, ""Sportsmanship is about treating other people in a game the way you want to be treated.""
Say things like, ""You would not want someone to brag or make you feel bad if they won. You should not be boastful if you won, as that can hurt your opponents feelings.""
Start teaching your child these behaviors while they are still young. If you can, begin these lessons before they start sports.;
, When discussing sports, avoid comparing your children to one another or to other team members. This is not constructive and will only serve to make children feel inadequate. Instead of comparing your kids to one another, focus on their unique qualities and skills.Emphasize your child's general progress as a player. Say things like, ""You really improved from the last game"" rather than talking about how your child compares to others.
Discourage a child from comparing themselves to others. If your child is saying they feel their sibling does better at baseball than them, say something like, ""Everyone is different, and you should focus on what you can do and not what Jamie can do.""

, When you ask your child about games played at school, or with friends, talk about things other than winning. Do not say, ""Did your team win the game today?"" Instead, say things like, ""Did you have fun playing?"" and ""Did you try your best?"" Focusing your energy on areas other than winning will help your child develop a sense of sportsmanship.Kids should be praised for their effort, hard work, commitment, and passion, not for their performance or their victories. This will teach your child that they do not always have to win to be strong or successful.

, Use the news to your advantage. If your children love sports, they probably follow a professional team. Pay attention to news surrounding that team and use it to talk about sportsmanship.If a player does something controversial, like refusing to shake hands after a big game, talk about this. Say something like, ""What do you think about what this player did? Would you have acted differently?""
When a player does something admirable, point that out as well. When watching a hockey game, for example, say something like, ""Isn't it nice how they're all shaking hands, even the team that lost?""
If your child is upset about losing, try to find the stats or history of their favorite player. Point out how this athlete sometimes lost as well. This may help teach them that defeat is a natural element of sports.

Handle situations calmly.,
Remember that setbacks are temporary.,

Teach your child self-care.,
Help your child experience success.,
Encourage your child to take risks.,
Look for future successes.",How to Teach Your Children Optimism," Humans tend to be hardwired to notice and remember the negatives more often than the positive things. Teach your child to balance this tendency by intentionally steering them toward noticing positive things. Ask your child, “What made you smile today?” Start a journal with your child in which they write down the good things that happened that day, and share it before they go to bed.Go on a happiness scavenger hunt and point out things that bring happiness and joy. Perhaps your child sees a flower or a cloud that they like or picks up a neat stone.;
, If your child is upset about something, practice finding something positive in the situation.Help your child to see things from a more positive perspective, then ask your child to come up with a bright side.


For example, if your child is sick and has to stay home from school, look at the positives of staying in their pajamas or getting to watch television during the day.

, If your child is having a problem, allow them space to do some problem solving. Instead of jumping in and solving the problem for your child, give them the tools to do so on their own by teaching them an efficient process. Ask your child questions that help them do the following: define the problem, generate ideas, evaluate and select ideas, and implement solutions.For example, if your child is struggling to write an essay, help them define the problem. You might ask questions like, ""Do you not understand the assignment?"", ""Are you unable to focus?"", ""Are you having trouble understanding the material?"", and so on to figure out the true root of the problem.
Help your child come up with different ways they might tackle the problem. If they don't understand the material, what steps can they take to fix this? Talking to the teacher, working with a tutor, discussing with a classmate, or finding other resources that discuss and break down the material are all possible solutions. Have your child write down all the possibilities.
Go through each possible solution with your child and evaluate whether or not they will be helpful. Talking to the teacher or working with a tutor might not be options if the essay is due the next day, but calling a classmate, finding supporting resources, or even discussing the material with you are all possible solutions. Let your child choose whichever solution seems best.
The final step is for your child to implement the solution. This means calling their classmate to discuss the material or going online or to the library to read different scholarly interpretations of the material.
Teaching your child this step-by-step process will help them make effective, thoughtful decisions in the future.

, Optimism and hope are closely tied, and teaching your child to be hopeful can help build an optimistic mindset. Some of the essential elements of hope include having goals, agency, and social support. Talk to your children about their wants and needs, and help them use their problem-solving skills to see how they have agency in their own lives — that is, that they have the ability to shape their futures and make things happen for themselves. Remind your child that you are there to support and help them, and that they can depend on you to help them reach their goals.For instance, if your child wants an expensive toy, brainstorm with them about ways they could save up for that toy (other than you buying it for them). At first, they might feel that thee is no way to get the toy unless you get it for them. But remind them that they have the agency to save for the toy themselves. You might tell them you will support their goal by giving them chores to do around the house to earn an allowance.
Or maybe your child is taking swimming lessons and wants to move up to the next level. Discuss how they might improve enough to do that — by practicing, going to all their lessons, etc. Offer to support them by taking them to the pool to practice.

, Be optimistic in your parenting style to help your child approach situations more positively.For example, instead of saying, “You don’t allow enough time to get ready in the morning and that’s why you’re always late,” say, “I’ve noticed that when you get up early and give yourself time in the morning, you seem to get off to school no problem.”


If your child has left a mess yet again, say, “It can be nice to have a clean space so that you have room to do the things you enjoy.”

, Part of optimism is facing difficult situations and feeling like they can be overcome. Relate to your own child’s experience by telling something about your own life. If your child struggles with math, say, “You know, I had a hard time with math when I was in school, too. I remember it being really hard. Then I realized that I could do it, it just took some practice, and I’d have to work extra hard.”You can also use examples from movies such as “The Karate Kid” or “The Lion King.”

, If you catch yourself saying, “I’m such a…” statements, know that your children are listening and hear you put yourself down. You may notice your children saying similar things and begin to discourage themselves with negative talk!If you put yourself down, start adjusting your own vocabulary.


For example, if you say, “I’m so clumsy!” or, “I’m just a bad cook,” stop or adjust these statements. You can say instead, “Sometimes I don’t watch where I’m going” or “I’m still learning to make good meals for dinner.”

, If your child is upset about a low grade, don’t upset them further by getting angry or upset about the failure. Instead, handle the situation calmly. Consider your child’s feelings and use the moment to help your child reflect on the experience. Even if you are disappointed, respond optimistically to your child.For example, say, “I know you’re upset about your spelling test. You’ve done well in the past, and I bet you’ll do great again. This was just a low week.”

, If your child experiences failure, remind them that it’s not life-changing. A bad science grade doesn’t mean that they’re bad at science, and a bad soccer game doesn’t mean they should quit soccer. If your child is frustrated with a setback or failure, remind them that it’s not forever and that they’ll be okay.For example, if your child doesn’t make the team, say, “I’m sorry you didn’t make the team, I know you wanted to play. I know you are upset, but the good news is that you can try out again in one month, or you can try a different sport.”

, If your child is upset (“I can’t believe I did so bad on the test! I’m the dumbest kid in the class.”), listen without interruption and empathize with your child’s feelings. When your child has finished detailing their frustrations, use questions to help challenge the negative beliefs. Questions can help your child realize that they didn’t do everything wrong or that they have other chances to do better.If your child is down on their soccer game or painting, ask, “What was one thing you did well?” If your child did poorly on a test, ask, “What’s one thing you can do to improve for the next test?”

, It's hard to stay optimistic if you can't prioritize, de-stress, or allow yourself a break to enjoy life. Emphasize the importance of eating well, getting enough rest, maintaining hygiene, staying active, and taking breaks — all essential parts of self-care. Your child's life should not be scheduled down to the minute; make sure they have time every day to relax and do something fun.Help your child learn to prioritize when they are overwhelmed. Let them know that it's okay to say ""no"" sometimes, especially when they have a lot on their plate.
Listen to your child's fears and anxieties. Do not dismiss them as silly, unrealistic, or childish. Let them express their worries and reassure them in no uncertain terms: ""I will always take care of you,"" ""I will always listen to you,"" etc.

, Starting from a young age, allow your child to do things for themselves. While it may be quicker for you tie your child’s shoes or sort the laundry, have your children experience success in these tasks by doing them by themselves. You may need to guide or loosely help, but don’t do the task for them. Make sure to acknowledge their success.For example, have your child put away toys, set the table, or get the mail. Then, praise your child for their success. Say, “Wow, you did it! Good job. You’re really helping the family.”

, If your child believes that they can achieve something, they are more likely to give a new experience a chance.Every success your child experiences helps to build confidence and opens the doors to experience more success in new adventures. If your child is unsure of something, help them to reflect on past successes.


For example, if your child fears an entry to the science fair, ask, “What other projects have you worked on? Did they turn out okay? Why would this project be any different?”

, If your child does something well, praise the effort that helped the child to accomplish that task. For example, if your child does well with gymnastics, say, “You trained really hard and put a lot of effort into your gymnastics. It really paid off, and as you keep working hard, you’ll continue to move up.”Focus more on the effort and less on the outcome.If your child wins an award, acknowledge the reward and say, “You worked really hard and it’s nice to see how hard work turns out.”

Show your child the days of the week on a calendar.,
Introduce the days of the week through their schedule.,
Countdown to important events.",How to Teach Your Child the Days of the Week2," On a calendar, show your child that one row makes one week. Point out each of the days and color code them to make them easier to distinguish, e.g. red for Monday, yellow for Tuesday, etc.

, Children may notice that some days are different from others due to the events they do on each day. Making an association between an event and a particularly day can help them to remember what day it is.


For example, Monday could be soccer day, Wednesday could be mac 'n' cheese for dinner, Sunday could be visiting grandma, etc.

, Counting down to an important event in the child's life can help them to keep track of the days.


For example, if they are excited about going to a birthday party on Saturday, in the week leading up to it you could ask them ""How many days left until the party?"".
Alternatively, if your child is excited about their own birthday coming up in several weeks, you could ask them ""how many more Mondays until your birthday?""

Use fun, familiar songs to teach your child the days of the week.,
Let your child make her own calendar.,
Make an art project involving the days of the week.,
Use picture books.,
Use jump rope and hopscotch to teach the days.",How to Teach Your Child the Days of the Week3," There are a number of very good song parodies that use familiar rhythms to teach the days of the week. School Sparks is just one blog example that will show you some of these songs including one of the most popular ""Days of the Week” which is sung to the tune of the old Addams Family Theme.


Singing songs works well for memorization because the familiar pattern is easy for the brain to absorb. In addition, each song can be sung virtually anywhere giving the child even more time to practice and to learn the concept that is being taught.
According to experts, singing not only releases endorphins (feel good hormones) but also strengthens memory skills and brain development by making the brain work at several tasks at the same time.
In short, singing makes you happy and makes you smarter – so it is a perfect way to teach your child about the days of the week. You can even practice your new songs and skills in the car on the way to school or to run errands.

, Another great way to help your child learn the days of the week is to show her a calendar and have her say the days’ names with you. Then, with a blank calendar page have your child help you create a new calendar.


Have your child tell you what happens on each day of the week. For example, if she goes to preschool only three days of the week she could say “On Monday I go to school” and so on. Let your child use pictures cut from magazines or appropriate stickers to “tag” each day of the week so that it is easier for her to remember.
Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays could get a school bus or a school building picture or sticker and then Tuesdays and Thursdays could get something that she associates with those days. Saturdays could have a picture of the supermarket or family event and then Sundays could have pictures of your house of worship if you so choose.

, Another fun craft idea is to make Wally the Weekday Worm. At the beginning, your child will make eight circles.


The first circle is Wally’s head so your child can give him eyes, a mouth and a nose and whatever other facial features they would like to add.
Each of the other circles will be labeled with the day of the week’s name and again, the child can add whatever symbols best represents that day- school days, family fun days, etc.

, Try to find picture books that deal with the topic of the days of the week and read them to your child. If your child is able, have her read the book to you, or even try to explain the pictures and events.

, Jumping rope or playing hopscotch while singing can be a good way to teach kids days of the week. While your child is jumping or skipping, they can sing:


“M for Monday, turn around, T for Tuesday, touch the ground, W for Wednesday, jump so high, T for Thursday, touch the sky, F for Friday, say hooray! S for Saturday, time to play, S for Sunday, clap your hands, It’s time to start all over again!”
In the same way, you can let your child play hopscotch. Draw 7 squares, one for each day a week. As your child jumps from square to square they can sing the song.

Teach children to follow directions.,
Encourage your child to praise teammates.,
End games with a handshake.,
Model good behavior yourself.",How to Teach Your Child to Be a Good Sport2," It's important children learn to respect rules. A big aspect of sportsmanship is respecting how the game is played, even if some rules seem unfair or unnecessary.Tell a child why rules exist. Say something like, ""Rules exist so the game can be organized. If everyone was allowed to do whatever they wanted, it would not be fun to play the game. Rules keep things under control so everyone can have fun.""
Never encourage cheating. If your child gains a point by breaking a rule, do not count the point. Say something like, ""Part of playing a game is following the rules. It's not fair to other players to cheat.""

, Children should learn to be genuinely happy for other team members. Keep your child focused on games as a team effort. When a member of a child's team does well, praise that child and encourage your child to do the same. For example, ""Eliza did so good today when she scored those goals, don't you think?"" It's important your child learns to be enthusiastic about other people's accomplishments in addition to their own., Never let a child leave a game on a negative note. After a game finishes up, encourage your child to end things with a handshake and a sincere congratulations, whether they won or not.If your child plays on a Little League team, talk to the coach about incorporating a handshake at the end of each game.
If your children are just playing at home, have them shake hands before and after competing with one another in games.

, Your child learns a lot about acceptable behavior from watching you. Therefore, it's a good idea to watch your own behavior. Always try to be a good sport yourself, as your child will learn from watching you.Always congratulate both teams after a game. Cheer on players equally, and do not get discouraged if your child loses.
If you watch sports yourself, be careful not to complain about the other team. Try to be a good sport if, say, your favorite football team loses.
Children should play sports to have fun, learn teamwork, and become physically active--not to fulfill somebody else's dream of sports stardom. Avoid criticizing them if they lost, and make sure they want to participate.

Respect a coach's rules.,
Remind children to follow the rules of games.,
Let everyone have a chance to play.,
Celebrate victories as a group.,
Discipline your child for unsportsmanlike behavior.",How to Teach Your Child to Be a Good Sport3," You should never argue with your child's coach. Even if you disagree about the coach's choices, avoid arguing or disrespecting the coach's authority. Your child learns respect from watching you. If you're constantly arguing with the coach, your child is likely to do the same.Remember, your coach is looking out for the entire team's best interest and not just your child. You need to respect the coach's choices to make sure all players get a chance to compete.
Coaches should be responsible for making sure that their teams act in a sportsmanlike way. If you believe the coach values winning above the emotional and mental health of their players, you may want to move your child to a different team.
Your child needs to learn to respect others during sports games. If your child does not respect their coach, they're also less likely to respect other players.

, When playing a game, especially with very young children, kids will sometimes neglect the rules. They may want to skip over a particular rule, or only follow certain aspects of it, in order to win. Always gently remind children of the rules.Say things like, ""Hey, you need to follow the rules, remember? They're there to keep the game fair to everyone.""

, Even the players that are less skilled should have fun. When playing with your kids, or when coaching a game for a group of kids, make sure everyone has a chance to play.For example, say you're playing a game of baseball with your kids. Your younger son is not yet as skilled as your older children.
Encourage him to play as well. If your other children complain their younger brother is holding them back, say something like, ""The point of playing isn't to win. It's for everyone to have fun together.""
Encourage the older children to teach the younger children how to play. This will involve the younger children while boosting the older children's confidence about their own skills.

, If your child's little league team wins a game, focus on the victory as a group. Offer to buy all the players ice cream after the game or take all the players out for pizza. Focus on the success of the team as a unit rather than one player's achievements. This encourages your child to see victories as a group effort, teaching your child sportsmanship., If you notice your child is consistently acting out at games, you may want to take action to discipline the child. Have a chat with the coach to see if they can intervene and talk to your kid. You may also decide to have consequences at home. Make sure you talk to your child so that they understand what they have done wrong and how they can act better in the future."

Teach your child the concept of blowing air intentionally.,
Teach your child how to blow air out of his nose.,
Explain what is happening with blowing.,
Practice holding a tissue to your child's nose.,
Point out when yourself or other adults use a tissue to blow their noses.,
Help your child blow his nose when he's sick by holding the tissue to his nose and telling him to blow.,
Teach your child to throw away the tissue immediately after he finishes blowing.",How to Teach Your Child to Blow Their Nose," Blowing air, whether through the mouth or the nose, is a learned skill. Unlike breathing regularly, blowing involves intention. If your child likes to imitate your actions, start by encouraging imitation when he is well. You should do the action first, and your child can imitate what you do.Practice first by blowing with the mouth. Blowing bubbles, using a soapy bubble mixture and a plastic bubble wand, is a very satisfying way to learn to control breath by blowing.
The tradition of blowing out birthday candles offers another perfect opportunity to practice this skill in a fun way. You can pretend to blow out the candle, while allowing your child to actually blow it out.You can also hold a piece of tissue paper about six inches from your child's face, and show him how to make the tissue move by blowing on it. Other things your child can blow with his mouth include pinwheels and balloons.;
, Have him put his hand below your nostrils so he can feel the air as you blow. Show him how you can cover one nostril, then the other, to blow through each nostril individually.


When you're first teaching your child to blow through his nose, remind him to keep his mouth closed. It can help to cover one nostril, then the other, to reinforce the feeling of air blowing through the nose. This will be easier to do when he's well, both because he'll likely feel better and be more interested in learning new things, and because he'll have more of a sense of air moving through the nostrils.
Make a game out of blowing air through the nose. Children often are motivated by races. You can create a ""race"" for two extremely lightweight objects (a sequin or a feather works well) and see who can blow it from one end of a table to the other the quickest., Have fun taking air inside the body quickly, and blowing air outside the body quickly. This is a process of teaching your child to control the air that goes through his nose.


Explain the purpose of blowing the nose. Show your child what mucus is. Use pictures, or hold a mirror up to your child's nose so that he can see what's inside.By teaching your child to connect excess mucus to colds, allergies, etc., you'll increase his understanding of why blowing his nose is important. This will help him make sense of why you might ask him to ""blow his nose"" when he needs to.

, Provide plenty of praise for trying this new thing, even when he's not sick.


Try different varieties of tissue paper, and have your child tell you which one he prefers. Some children may be extremely sensitive to texture or scents that you may not even notice. Having a tissue paper that the child doesn't mind will help this teaching process tremendously.
Make sure you have plenty of the kind of tissue paper your child prefers ready when he's sick. When your child is sick, it's likely that he'll resist doing anything new. He likely will want to be left alone, or cuddled, so be gentle.

, When you have a cold, you can use this opportunity to model using a tissue to blow your own nose, encouraging your child to imitate.Siblings can also serve as role models for your child as he learns how to blow his nose. Younger siblings might be distinguished by the fact that they aren't old enough to blow their own nose. Often, this comparison has a good deal of attraction for an older sibling.
Explicitly point out the steps of blowing the nose, as you do them or as others do. Narrate the process as you go through the steps.

, He might need to be reminded to close his mouth.


Keep a gentle, light tone of voice when teaching this new skill.
If your child wants to hold the tissue himself, let him! While it may be easier for the child to learn simply by blowing into a tissue you hold, some children may prefer to be in charge of their own tissue.

, This may mean that you go through more tissues than you'd like, but teaching the routine of throwing the tissue away will benefit you, and your child, in the long run.


Sometimes the routine of throwing the tissue into the trash can will be a fun incentive for the child in itself. Provide plenty of praise for each tissue that goes from tissue box, to nose, to trash.
Always have a trash bin close by as you are teaching this process. If you don't actually have a trash bin so close at hand, improvise by finding another receptacle (such as a plastic container, or an empty bowl) that can function as a temporary trash location until you can move it.

Children mimic the language and behavior of parents. If you want your child to be nice to other children, be nice to your child.


When your child is around, try your best to keep an even temper. Don't let your child see you yell, or argue with others. Act like an adult. Act like you want your children to act.
Never belittle your child for wanting to play, or for being a child. Let them play and have fun, and they'll behave that way when they're with other kids as well.;
, It's tough to teach your child to ""not"" bully, because some children instinctively want to push the boundaries. It's much more productive to teach your child to be a good and positive friend to others. Focus on showing your child to be loving and kind with other children.


If your child has bullied in the past, it's important to engage them more directly and talk to them specifically about bullying. Just don't put any ideas in their head if your child is innocent.

, Your time and love are the greatest gifts you can give to your child if you want them to grow into well-rounded people. Demonstrating good behavior doesn't need to take up a lot of your time. Just make an effort to engage your child in play a few times a week. Listen to them talk and ask them questions.


Encourage your children in their play. You don't necessarily have to be down in the dirt playing with your child, especially if you've got better things to be doing. But listen to them when they tell you what they did. Ask interested questions.

, If a child is taught from an early age how to pet a cat, or have fun with a dog, this can help them develop a sense of gentle affection for others. If your child learns how to care for a pet properly, they will often be a better friend to their classmates.

, It can be difficult to know how your children behave when you're not around. As a test, make a point of regularly inviting friends and classmates over to your house so you can observe your child in play. This way, you can correct any negative behavior you see more effectively.

, Did your child bully at school, preschool, daycare, church? It's important that you learn all the facts as quickly as possible, if your child has gotten into trouble for being a bully.


Try to go into things with an open mind. You may want to defend your child instinctively, which is understandable. You love them and want to make sure they're not being accused of something falsely. But try to listen to what other people have to say and get all the facts in place.

, Don't scream or yell, but be firm as possible and make it very clear to your child that bullying and beating will not be tolerated. Remember to listen to what your child has to say, but remain firm.


Never hit your child in these instances, or punish them for doing something. If your child has already demonstrated a tendency toward intimidation and bullying, physical punishment will only reinforce negative behaviors.

, Why is your child acting out? You need to learn what's going on in your child's head to figure out how to address the issues causing the bullying. Ask your child these questions:


How is everything going at school?
Are you getting along with the other kids at school?
Do you treat other children with respect?
Do you get along with your friends?
Are other children at the school bullying you?
Do you know what bullies are?

, Most bullies don't think of themselves as bullies. Most children don't see the harm in ""joking around with"" another classmate. For this reason, it's important to show your child that what they do has serious consequences. There are a variety of resources, including videos, books, and other learning materials that you can consult online., It's important for you to try to learn what you child is doing and why your child is acting out. Often, bullies act out because of other problems that might be starting at home. Most bullies have self-esteem issues that you can start to work on with your child, to keep them from working these issues out at school in destructive ways.

, If your child is struggling at school and at home, and you're struggling to figure out what to do, there may be more serious behavior problems that you need to address first. Bullying may be a symptom of healthy problems that can be corrected with counseling or medication.


If you think your child struggles to empathize and can't feel remorse for bullying behavior, it's important to talk to a counselor. This can be a sign of serious developmental and emotional problems down the road.

Allow your child to speak for themselves.,
Teach polite behaviour.,
Model good people skills.,
Eat meals together.",How to Teach Your Child People Skills1," In many situations adults will speak on behalf of children. For example, you may order food for your child, or call their friends’ parents to set up a play date. Kids, however, need an opportunity to practice their people skills. Try letting your child tackle some of these basic social interactions and you can guide them through the process. You can also start small and have them work towards taking on more social responsibility.For example, have your child say “excuse me” to a store clerk in order to get their attention and then you can carry on the rest of the conversation. This will build your child’s confidence without placing pressure on them to engage in an entire conversation with a stranger.
If you have a shy child, you could try creating mock social situations at home and have them practice by interacting with you.;
, If you want your child to develop good people skills, then you will want them to learn how to engage in polite conversation. This includes developing good listening skills and body language, as well as good conversational skills. For example, when conversing with others, your child should not monopolize the conversation or interrupt the other person. They should also engage in a form of give and take when communicating. For instance, they should ask questions as well as share information about themselves.These types of skills can be developed while communicating within your own home. For instance, if your child interrupts someone while talking point this out to them and explain why this is rude.
You can also discuss your child’s behaviour following a social interaction. If, for example, your child was not engaging in polite conversation at a party, you can point this out to them afterwards when you get home.
Explain why their behaviour was impolite and provide them with solutions.

, In order to teach your child good people skills, you need to model them yourself. For instance, if you are constantly on your phone or distracted during conversations with your child or others, then you are not modelling positive social behaviours. Instead, they will think that it is acceptable to read a text message while in the middle of a conversation. When you are interacting with people in front of your child, use eye contact, listen carefully, ask questions, and be polite.Try these tips to improve your own social behaviour:Leave your cell phone or tablet in another room.
Don’t check your email until your kids go to bed at night, or do it out of sight.
Kneel down when talking with your children, so that you can look them in the eye and converse at their level.

, Eating dinner together, as a family, is a great way to practice positive social interactions and teach people skills to your children. This is a perfect opportunity to ask each member of the family to share something about their day. You can also model good listening skills by asking follow up questions.Make a rule that includes no cell phones, tablets, or games at the dinner table. This way everyone will focus on the conversation.
Use this opportunity to ask about potential conflicts and come up with solutions.

Get the right pencil for your child.,
Help your child out with a pencil grip.,
Make a homemade pencil grip.,
Start by using the pencil grip every time your child writes.",How to Teach Your Kid to Hold a Pencil1," Using short pencils, like golf pencils or normal pencils broken in half, can help children find the right grip on their own. Short pencils have less room for unnecessary fingers, so your child has little choice but to use the correct three-finger grip.


You can purchase short pencils at most craft and office supply stores.;
, Pencil grips are simple devices placed on a pencil to encourage children to hold the pencil correctly. In most cases, the grip slips easily over a pencil and rests around the area where a pencil is held. The grip is shaped in a way that helps to guide your child’s hand, while the sticky material keeps his hand in place once he’s gripped the pencil in the correct way.


Pencil grips are available at most learning and office supply stores, or online. They are relevantly inexpensive, so consider experimenting with a few different types until you find the one that fits best and is most comfortable for your child’s hand.

, A simple homemade alternative to a pencil grip is to slide a pencil through a clothespin and have the child hold onto the clothespin between his thumb and pointer finger.


With the pencil through the round cutout near the end, the child can hold onto the long, flat ends and the pencil will stay in a position that allows your child to pinch and hold it with three fingers.

, Soon, your child’s hand will automatically hold the pencil correctly thanks to muscle memory. Once they can hold the pencil correctly on their own, you can remove the pencil grips and have your child use normal pencils.

Guide them through conflict and resolution.,
Help them learn persuasion.,
Teach empathy.",How to Teach Your Child People Skills2," Learning how to solve conflicts is a key skill to teach your child, but it can be difficult. The first instinct that many adults have is to remove their children from the situation when a conflict arises. At times this is essential, especially when violent behaviour occurs. The best way to teach your child how to resolve a conflict is to leave them in the situation and help them figure out a resolution. Then, the next time they are in a conflict, allow them to try and solve the problem themselves.For example, if your child is arguing about playing with a toy, you can step in and provide a solution. Allow one child to play with the toy for 5 minutes and then the other child can play with it for 5 minutes. This provides a fair alternative and gives each child an opportunity to play with the toy.
Conflict resolution should satisfy everyone involved, when possible.
Some conflicts may be more complex and you can always offer your child guidance and brainstorm possible resolutions.

, Being able to persuade someone to understand your side of an argument is an important social skill. In order to persuade someone into changing their opinion of agreeing with your position, you need to be able to make a convincing argument. For example, you may need to cite evidence or appeal to the desires of others. Here are a few ways to teach this skill:If you have an older child, you could get them to try and convince you when they want something new, like a cell phone or a pet.
For instance, they would have to make an effective argument in order to persuade you into agreeing with them.
Each time they present a weak argument, you can explain why, and get them to continue making their case until you have been persuaded.

, If you want your child to have good people skills, then they will need to learn how to be empathetic. Empathy is the ability to understand and respect the values, feelings, and opinions of another person, even if they differ from your own. For example, putting yourself in someone else’s shoes.Talk about the feelings of other people: If your child explains a conflict at school you may ask them to think about how their classmates felt.
Point out similarities between people: Kids are more likely to empathize with people who share commonalities with them. Point out the similarities between people.
Model empathetic behaviour: Demonstrate your own empathy by actively listening to your child and make an effort to truly understand how they feel in different situations.

"
"
Ask them to repeat what you say.,
Listen to your child.,
Play listening games.",How to Teach Your Child People Skills3," In order to develop people skills, your child needs to know how to listen. Listening is a very important part of all social interactions. One way to ensure that your child is listening, is by asking them to repeat what you say to them. This will force your child to stop and focus on what you are saying. It will also help them to remember requests when you ask them to do something.For example you could say “Can you clean your room after school today?” and have your child repeat the request to demonstrate that they were listening. They could say “you want me to clean my room today.”

, In order to teach your child listening skills, you need to model good listening behaviours. It is easy to get busy working, completing household chores, and running errands, but is important to set aside time to actively engage with and listen to your child. For example, put away your phone and other distractions and listen to your child. Show that you are interested by asking “How was your day at school?” or “What did you do while I was at work today?” This will give you the opportunity to model good listening skills to your child.In order to demonstrate that you are listening, you should maintain eye contact, ask them follow up questions, and take an interest in their stories.

, You can also teach good listening skills by playing games that require children to listen. By teaching skills through games, you will make the task of listening seem fun. Your child will likely not even know that they are learning a new skill. Try out some of these games:


Play telephone with a group of kids: Start by whispering a short story to your child. Then they have to pass the story in the exact wording to the kid sitting next to them. The story gets passed down the line to the final child who announces the story out loud. It should be very close to the original if everyone was listening carefully.Tell a group story as a family. Start telling a story and then stop partway through and have another family member continue the story. Try and get three to four people involved in creating a story together. This promotes listening skills and is a fun family activity.
Play Simon Says. In this game kids have to listen carefully to the instructions that are called out and complete the commands that one of the players says.

Teach them to read body language.,
Have your child practice their body language.,
Engage in a staring contest.",How to Teach Your Child People Skills4," People communicate both verbally and with their body language. If you want to teach your child people skills, you should focus on communicating through body language. For example, body movements, facial expressions, tone of voice, and volume are all important aspects of communication. Help your child pick up on nonverbal cues:Ask them questions about the show or movie they are watching. You could say “what is the main character feeling right now?”
They may respond stating that the character is scared. You could then ask “how do you know they are scared?” If your child struggles to answer this question, help them identify some body language features.
You could say “does the character look scared because they are shaking and their eyes are wide open?”

, You can also have your child practice their own body language and mannerisms as a way to teach them people skills. Body language is so important to the way we communicate and learning how to communicate through body language is an essential social skill. Role play some simple social situations with your child.For example, try teaching them how to enter a room. Begin by entering slouched over and staring at the floor. Then enter with your shoulders back, chin up, and smiling. Ask your child ""which one is friendlier?"" Then have them try and mimic your actions.
You can try this out with a number of different scenarios.

, Eye contact is an extremely important aspect of communication and is a fundamental people skill. By looking someone in the eye when communicating, you demonstrate appreciation and respect. Teach your child to become comfortable with eye contact by having staring contests.See how long they can maintain eye contact with a family member.
This game will teach kids to become comfortable with eye contact, something that many kids find difficult.

Practice fine motor skills to make pencil holding easier.,
Use the OK grip to get your child’s hand into the correct pencil-gripping position.,
Teach your child the pinch and flip.,
Practice the ‘finger hide’ to make holding the pencil easier.,
Model and repeat.",How to Teach Your Kid to Hold a Pencil2," Developing fine motor skills and finger strength can give young children the physical skills needed to correctly hold a pencil. Have your child play with small household items, such as straws or Popsicle sticks, by picking them up and dropping them into another container. This establishes finger grip from an early age.


Another way to develop fine motor skills is to have a child practice putting small items through small holes, like corn kernels through the holes of a Parmesan cheese container or noodles through a cheese grater or a straw. Be creative—there are lots of items around the house that are perfect for developing fine motor skills. Anything that requires your child to pinch or grasp the object can help to build the muscles and skills to properly hold a pencil.

, Start with your child making the “ok” sign with their writing hand by connecting their thumb and pointer finger in an O and putting their three remaining fingers straight up. Have them open the thumb and pointer finger of the O slightly, and then place the pencil between the fingers. They can then grasp down and wrap the remaining fingers around the pencil to get their hand into the correct writing position.

, A quick way to get the pencil into the right position is to begin with the pencil lying on the table. Have your child put their thumb and pointer finger of their writing hand at the very top of the pencil, right under the sharpened part. Pick up the pencil and use the other hand to flip the pencil and twist it in a clockwise motion until it gets in the right position.


You can walk your child through this process and be the one to twist the pencil to the right place before letting your child do the whole thing on his own.

, Many children have difficulty keeping their pinky and ring fingers away from the pencil by holding them curled under the hand—their motor skills just aren’t developed enough to separate those two fingers and move them on their own. Have your child hold a small object in those two fingers, which will force the fingers to curl and press against the hand.


Small items such as a marble, play dough, or cotton ball work well for small hands.

, Just like every motor skill development, consistency is the key. Model proper pencil holding whenever you are writing or coloring where your child can see you, and point out how you are holding your pencil.


Encourage your child to hold the pencil correctly whenever they are using a writing instrument and check them as soon as they pick up a crayon or pencil to make sure they have the right grip from the beginning.
Learning the proper pencil grip takes time, but with a constant effort, your child will be more likely to succeed.

"
"
Make sure the pencil fits comfortably in your child’s hand.,
Seek help from an occupational therapist.,
Understand your child’s developmental limits.,
Allow your toddler to work his way through different grasps.",How to Teach Your Kid to Hold a Pencil3," First, check to see if your child’s pencil or pencil grip is comfortable. If something is rubbing uncomfortably against your child’s hand, it may be as simple as trying a new type of pencil.

, If you have tried the above methods and nothing seems to be working, consider talking to your child’s teacher or pediatrician about bringing them to an occupational therapist for additional fine motor skill testing and training. The lack of proper pencil holding can be a sign for other developmental delays, so it is important to catch the problem early and start your child right from the start.

, It may seem easier to just start a child early and begin teaching them the correct pencil holding technique as soon as they can hold a pencil or crayon, but that can have adverse effects. Toddlers and younger children have a difficult time holding a pencil in the correct tripod grip because their shoulder and arm muscles are still developing and steadying.

, When a toddler begins coloring, they will put a crayon in the fist grasp and use their shoulder muscles. As the shoulder muscles grow, most children naturally move to a grip with the pencil in the palm of their hand while wrapping all of their fingers around the pencil. From there they move on to the immature 5-finger grasp and then eventually the 3-finger grasp.


Let your child naturally work their way through the different grasps before you step in to intervene. Although most children won’t make it to the 3-finger grasp completely without help, it will help their development to let them figure it out most of the way on their own.

Place a stool in front of the sink.,
Talk about germs and how they live on hands and surfaces.,
Show your child how to press the soap pump.,
Demonstrate turning on the water.,
Wash your hands for 20-30 seconds alongside your child.,
Rinse your hands together.,
Demonstrate drying your hands.,
Wash your own hands regularly.,
Incorporate hand washing into your daily routine.,
Wash your hands before you eat.,
Wash your hands to signal the end of playtime.,
Praise healthy habits.",How to Teach Kids to Wash Their Hands," If the child cannot reach the sink by themselves, place a stool in front of the sink to facilitate regular hand-washing practicesLook for a stool with rubber grips on the steps. When young children are involved, washing hands can get extremely messy, and you don’t want the child slipping on the step.
The feet of the step should also be equipped with rubber to limit the risk of slipping or sliding across a slick floor.;
, While children may not fully comprehend the concept of germs, explain (in simple terms) why washing your hands is so important. Include what germs are, how they can hurt you, and how hand washing gets rid of germs.Using a small, child-friendly video or song to illustrate the concept of germs may make handwashing more fun.

, Most children are not comfortable or familiar with soap pumps, so show them how to press down a few times before they try. For very small children, you may need to continue dispensing soap for them.Some children might like to choose a fun soap dispenser for their new hand washing habit.

, Show your child how to turn on the tap, focusing on the cold tap to prevent burns. Older children will be able to get this after a few tries, while young children will likely require help for several months before gaining the required dexterity., Most experts say that 20-30 seconds of washing is required to completely eradicate germs. Singing “Happy Birthday” twice or the alphabet song once through will give you plenty of time to finish cleaning germs.You can also purchase a small timer to set by the sink to help children remember how long to wash.

, Show your child how to rinse their hands until all of the bubbles are removed, checking between your fingers and on the backs of your hands.While it is not dangerous to leave soap bubbles behind, children often put their hands in their mouth and getting a handful of soap might deter future handwashing.
This can be something of a game. You can race to see who can get rid of bubbles the fastest to encourage the child to develop an interest in hand washing.

, Finally, show your child how to grab the towel from the hook and dry their hands thoroughly.Make sure the towel is easily accessible. High towel racks that require the child to lean over could result in the child falling.

, Before you start teaching a child to wash their hands, have them watch you as you wash your hands. Doing so not only demonstrates the process itself, but also shows the child that washing your hands is a simple, normal practice that even adults must do on a regular basis.Don’t make an exaggerated show of washing your hands. Wash them quickly and efficiently before cooking, after cleaning, and after running errands to demonstrate good habits.

, Once you have taught a child how to wash their hands, keep the lesson fresh by washing your hands multiple times a day together. Do not make food or move on to other activities before washing your hands.

, Each time you are about to eat, whether it is a full meal or a snack, take a minute to wash your hands together. Do not move on to eating or even setting food out until hands are washed, as some children may see hand-washing as cumbersome and may refuse if food is already set out or visible., Playtime could involve something simple like coloring with crayons, or could involve digging in the dirt for worms. Whatever the case may be, begin a routine of washing hands after each playtime.


While sitting at the table and coloring isn’t exactly a recipe for massive amounts of germs, children cannot differentiate between a germ-heavy playtime (playing with puppies, for instance), and a relatively germ-free playtime (racing toy cars).

, Good behavior is most effectively reinforced through praise. When a child washes their hands, praise their efforts, saying “Good job!” or “Look at you, cleaning away those germs!” This will reinforce the idea that washing their hands is a task worthy of admiration and repeat performances.Avoid bribing (i.e. “If you wash your hands, I’ll give you a sucker,”) as you cannot possibly give a treat every time hands need to be washed.
Be sincere in your praise. If a child runs to you, washed hands waving, and beaming, you can simply say “Awesome! You did so well!” You do not have to throw a parade, so to speak, each time.

Gather your supplies.,
Demonstrate putting socks on.,
Break the process into steps.,
Encourage your child.,
Help her as necessary.",How to Teach Children to Put a Sock on a Foot1," Learning to put socks on her feet is a major milestone for your child. Children are usually ready to begin the process when they are about two years old. In order to help her reach this goal, you'll want to be as organized as possible. Choose a time of day when your child is wide awake and has plenty of energy. Make sure to have an appropriate pair of socks ready to help her learn.Try teaching with a pair of socks that have different colors for the socks and the toes. This will make it easier for your child to position the sock correctly as she tries to put it on.
Use a pair of socks that are a little bigger than necessary. The larger sock will help her maneuver it onto her foot.
Consider having a reward handy for once your child successfully puts socks on her feet. Congratulate her with a piece of her favorite fruit, for example.;
, One of the most effective ways to teach a child a new skill is to model the action for them. Show her how you put your own socks on your feet. Narrate your actions as you go through each step.Keep your tone of voice light and enthusiastic as you narrate. Try saying something like, ""Look! It's fun to put socks on our feet!""

, Putting socks on may seem pretty simple to adults. But for a child, this is something new. It is much more complicated from a child's point of view. Use small steps to help her put the process together.Narrate and demonstrate each step. For example, ""First we get our socks.""
Point out the colored heel of the sock, and then touch the heel of your child's foot. Say, ""See? This heel of the sock will go on your heel.""
Have her scrunch up the sock and put it on her toes. Next, have her pull the sock up towards her ankle.
If necessary, have her adjust the sock so that the heel and foot are in the right place.

, During this learning process, you want your child to feel supported. Try sitting on the floor next to her. As she is putting on the socks, use verbal cues to encourage her.Try saying, ""Great start! Your toes are covered!""
You can also offer encouragement by smiling and clapping.

, It may be tempting to jump in and help your child at the first sign of struggle. But remember, this is a learning process. Help her by offering verbal cues and encouragement. Only offer physical help if absolutely necessary.When you are helping, make sure your child is still involved in the process. Say, ""Ooops! That's twisted. Let's straighten it out!""
Use your hands to guide her hands.

Learn about development.,
Be a positive role-model.,
Communicate effectively.",How to Teach Children to Put a Sock on a Foot2," It's important to understand that all children learn differently. Your child will also learn at a speed that might be different from others. However, you can use general guidelines to know when your child is ready to start learning certain new skills.Getting dressed is one of the first steps a child takes towards independence. At about two years old, your child might be ready to start taking off her own coat and shoes.
She might also be ready to start helping pull her pants up, and find the armholes in shirts.
Talk to your doctor about your child's individual development. He can help you make sure your child is progressing at an appropriate rate.

, Your child will learn best by watching you. Take care to patiently demonstrate many parts of your daily routine. For example, when you brush your teeth, bend down to your child's eye level so that she can see what you are doing.Try to focus on what your child does well, not what she does wrong. Say, ""Great job putting the toothpaste on the brush! You did it just like I did!""

, Good communication is key to helping your child learn. Make sure to speak calmly, but enthusiastically. Make eye contact with your child, and make sure that she is paying attention when you speak.Smiling is a great way to reinforce what you are saying.
Offer hugs as a way to provide affection when you are teaching a new skill.
Allow your child to ask lots of questions when you are teaching a new skill.

Give your child her own ‘toddler spoon’.,
Help guide your child through the movement of eating with a spoon.,
Give your child a little food to practice with.,
Stay by your child’s side while she practices using the spoon.",How to Get Your Toddler to Eat with Utensils1," While your child is learning how to use a spoon, do not have her use regular adult utensils. These heavier metal utensils can hurt your child’s gums or teeth. Your child may also find them too heavy to maneuver. Instead, purchase your child’s own set of plastic, toddler-sized spoons.


Toddler spoons are often tipped with soft rubber to make it easier to grip the handle.;
, If your toddler is still learning how to handle her spoon, you can help her by putting your hand over hers. Move her hand through the whole process of scooping up the food and then bringing the spoon to her mouth.


Do this movement much more slowly than you would to eat with a spoon yourself. Your child is still adjusting to the feeling of eating with a utensil.

, Place a small amount of food in a bowl so that your toddler can practice using her spoon. Putting a small amount of food in the bowl will help if she accidentally swipes the bowl and spills its contents.


Have another bowl with more food ready on the sidelines. When she has used the spoon to eat the small amount of food in her bowl, add some more food from the second bowl.

, Your child will most likely adapt to using a spoon quickly. However, you should still stay by her side while she practices so that you can help her with large bites, or with tilting the spoon the right way if the food is about to slide off of it.


Your child will most likely continue to be a messy eater until she reaches the ages of 2.5 or 3.

"

Choose the right fork for your toddler.,
Introduce the fork to your child soon after she starts using a spoon.,
Help your child to stay positive.",How to Get Your Toddler to Eat with Utensils2," When choosing a fork for your toddler, choose ones that have a wide grip handle with a rubber coating for easy grip.


Look for toddler forks with metal prongs instead of plastic ones so that you are sure that it can penetrate the food, but make sure that the prongs are blunt or rounded so it won’t be dangerous for your toddler to use.

, Show her how to poke or stab the food in her bowl. It may take some getting used to before she can really tell the difference between the fork and the spoon; this means she may try to use a fork in the same way she would use a spoon. Some foods that you can give to your child so that she can practice stabbing her food include:


Boiled or cooked vegetables like potatoes or carrots that have been cut into chunks.
Chunks of fruit like melons, apples, watermelon, or bananas.
Chunks of chicken and small cut up pieces of bread.

, Try to keep your child from getting discouraged by giving her food that is easy to eat with a fork (see the previous step). Avoid foods that are harder to eat in order to keep her positive and motivated. When your child is able to eat harder foods, make sure to praise her for her excellent work.


Noodles can be a challenging food to eat with a fork. Make sure that you are right next to your toddler to provide support and encouragement if she is eating noodles like spaghetti.

Set up a distraction-free zone that is easy to clean.,
Protect against spills.,
Make a place for your toddler at the family dining table.,
Encourage and praise your child while she learns how to eat with utensils.",How to Get Your Toddler to Eat with Utensils3," When practicing or teaching your toddler to self feed, try to prepare the area where you will feed her to lessen your frustration (and added work!) and capitalize on her success, which is the most important part in this whole experience. When feeding, make sure that there aren’t other things on her table or nearby that will distract her from eating.

, Put down a mat or towel under the bowl or plate you give to your child. Doing this will make cleanup easier. You can also protect your child from spills by putting a toddler bib on her. The bib should cover most of your toddler’s chest so that her clothing is protected.


If you don’t have a bib, dress your child in old clothing that you don’t have an attachment to. By doing this, you won’t have to go through the hassle of trying to get a stain out if your child spills on herself.

, Sit your toddler at the dining room table together with the whole family during Mealtime. Yes, it can be quite a long Mealtime when you have to wait for her to finish her meal, but it is important that she see every member of the family eating with utensils.


Keep in mind that you and your family are role models. Show her how you use your utensils so that she learns by observation.

, Encouragement and praise are key to helping your toddler use her own utensils. When she finishes her meal on her own, however messy it got, praise her and tell her she did a good job. This will give her confidence the next time she eats.

Explain what you are doing during meal times.,
Be patient and reasonable.,
Try to incorporate variations of your child’s favorite food into each meal.",How to Get Your Toddler to Eat with Utensils4," Creating an eating schedule will help to teach your child that eating is a part of everyday life and that feeding herself is something she will need to be able to do when she grows up.However, just because meals should be routine does not mean that they should be lacking in fun. Pick out colorful toddler utensils, plates, and bowls for your child to eat off of. Look for ones with fun designs like pictures of dinosaurs or animals.

, There will be days when your child will simply want you to feed her and that’s okay. The next day, you may find that she is again up to the task of feeding herself. Her desire to feed herself is your chance to let her have at it.


Be prepared for your child’s independence to be messy; remember that you are teaching her a life skill—a little pasta sauce on your tablecloth is worth it.

, The important thing is that she learns from her mistakes and keeps on practicing.


Try not to get frustrated when she makes a mistake and food goes flying. While it may be annoying to clean up after your toddler, learning how to use utensils is an essential part of your toddler’s early life. Keeping a positive attitude will help your child to keep trying.

, Explain why you are choosing to use a spoon, rather than a fork, when you eat cereal with milk. Likewise, explain the necessity of using a fork when eating pasta.


Helping your child to understand your choices will help her to make her own choices in the future.

, Give allowances during feeding time and be reasonable with your expectations. You can’t expect her to finish all of her food in five minutes just because you said so. Know that feeding time can be daunting to her as well. The important thing is to make sure that feeding time should be an enjoyable time for both you and your toddler.

, If your child loves spaghetti, try introducing her to other pastas or using a different sauce. If she loves bananas, add them to her pancakes, oatmeal or yogurt. Doing this will help to keep her interested in her food so that she can keep practicing using her utensils.

Give your child finger foods before asking her to use a spoon.,
Watch out for signs that your child wants to use a spoon.,
Understand that your child’s dexterity will take time to develop.",How to Get Your Toddler to Eat with Utensils5," Your toddler may be ready to use a spoon by the time she reaches 12 to 15 months old. However, if you have not introduced her to finger foods by that time, you should do so before starting to teach her how to use a spoon. Eating finger foods will help your child to learn how to bring food to her mouth. Finger foods include:


Chunky slices of fruits and vegetables.
Dry crackers and cereals.

, After your toddler has gotten used to eating with finger foods, you may notice that she starts eyeing your utensils during Mealtime. She might even indicate her desire to hold a spoon. If you see this happening, allow her to try using the spoon all by herself.


Be prepared for a mess and always remember to applaud her efforts.

, By the 18th month, your child will most likely have figured out how to use the spoon properly though there will still be times when she will revert back to using her hands to feed herself. She will revert back to finger foods because at this stage her dexterity is still not that developed.


To help your child’s dexterity, give her foods that will stick to the surface of the spoon.

Celebrate it!",How to Teach a Six Year Old How to Tie Their Shoes," You don’t need to work on tying yet, just introduce the fact that they will be learning to tie. Spend a minute every time they put their shoes on to introduce them to tying shoes. If you have been tying their shoes, you will want to get them notice what is going on.;
, Have them pick out colorful shoelaces. This helps build the association that these are the laces that they can tie.

, It is important to realize that this task can be overwhelming for your child and they will get frustrated if you do too much too fast.

, Call it the crisscross and make it fun. Have them cross the laces with some gusto and cheer when they do it. With the laces now crossed, one lace is laying on top of the other one.

, Call it the topsy. Next will be the turvy.

, Use the words, ""Topsy-turvy"" or ""Over under."" You can mix up the terminology and settle on the one your child latches on to.


Dual colors are very helpful at this stage for identifying which lace is which.

, You might have a chant, ""Topsy-turvy, pull it tight, do it right.""


If they have done it right their shoe should look like the picture above. 'Stop and congratulate your child.


, This step will likely take the most time. You will realize that you have to be very specific about how to make a loop. Focus on creating the right sized loop that is close to the criss-cross.


Don’t move past this step until your child consistently makes a good loop. If you are using regular laces this step may take much longer to master.

, Once your child has a good loop they will then wrap the other lace around the loop. The direction of the wrap does not matter. What matters is that they see that there are two different laces. Dual colored shoelaces make this step easier to visualize and execute.

, Help them by holding the loop while they go in search of the lace through the hole.

,, Once they know that there is a place to grab, it is just a matter of practice to get this step down consistently.

, Small hands will have trouble holding all of the laces so expect that there will be several missed attempts. Most children will be so excited at this point that they will pull their laces all the way through. #*Don’t worry, celebrate that they almost had it. Repetition is the key to figuring out what works and how to get their shoelaces tied tight and evenly.

, Yay! You just learned to tie! This is a huge milestone in your child’s development and one of their first steps towards independence.

Be flexible with their clothing.,
Give them flexibility in other choices.,
Assign chores.,
Avoid over-giving.,
Hold them accountable when they do wrong.,
Forget perfection.,
Don’t push them.",How to Encourage Toddler Independence1," While ensuring that your child knows how to dress properly and appropriately, work to also give them choices. Allowing them to choose teaches them that they have control over themselves and what they put on their bodies. Even when your child picks out an outfit that is a bit odd, allow them to wear it at least once in a while.See what outfits they will pick out and then make suggestions to them based on that. If they are very young, you can also pick out a few outfits and then let them choose one.;
, Beyond clothing, try not to make every single choice as it relates to your child. Don’t pick what toys they can play with, what cartoons they watch, or how much juice they drink. Give them a few options at mealtimes. Allow them certain basic level autonomy., Teach your child the value of hard work and pitching in. Give them daily and weekly tasks based on their age level that they must complete each day. For instance, a two or three-year-old might have to put all of her toys away when she is done.Do not clean up all of your children’s messes for them, especially if they are able to clean it themselves.

, Many who fail to become independent adults were spoiled as children. Avoid buying your child every single toy or snack that they see in the store. Know that it is okay to say no sometimes. Doing so will teach your child the value of both gifts and patience.Do not give your children gifts if they are misbehaving regularly at home or at daycare.

, Know that your toddler will make mistakes and may even throw a tantrum occasionally. Instead of letting them off the hook, set punishments that are fair and age appropriate.For instance, if your child has been acting out, put them in timeout proportionate to their age. As an example, a three-year-old should be put in time out for three minutes.

, Though you want to raise your child to be as good as possible, do not try to make them be perfect. In your quest to raise an independent child, there will be times that you feel that you are failing. Rather than correcting your child over every tiny mistake that they make, know when to let things go and when to act.Your toddler is learning, too, so give them some grace.

, Avoid forcing your child to try something before they are ready. You might be a petting zoo hoping your child will interact with the animals or have just purchased them a new tricycle that you want them to ride. Let them sit in your lap if they are scared until they decide to act. Part of encouraging independence is allowing them the choice of when to act."
"
Teach them rather than do for them.,
Allow your child to help.,
Allow your child to find solutions.,
Avoid immediately replacing broken or lost toys.,
Let them resolve their own issues with siblings and peers.,
Encourage them to feed themselves.,
Teach them potty training basics.",How to Encourage Toddler Independence2," Try to teach your child one new, simple task each week. It can be something small like how to put toothpaste on a toothbrush or how to play a game on your phone.Each new task that you teach them will help them become more independent and will save you the time of having to do it for them in the future.

, Don’t refuse your child when they want to help you, even if their help complicates things. Maybe your son wants to help fold the dishcloths or your daughter wants to help with the vacuuming. Allow them to participate even if for a small period of time., You might observe your child struggling with something; if so, resist the urge to intervene, even if it is a simple fix. You will often find that your child will be able to figure it out if given a bit of time. Feel free to guide them but do not fix everything for them.If your child is learning to ride a bike without training wheels, help and teach them, but allow them to fall a few times under your supervision. It is often the mistakes that children make that are the greatest teachers and motivators to success.
Also, if some of their toys are tangled together, allow them to figure out how to untangle them while helping occasionally.

, Teach your child to be more careful and to value their possessions more by avoiding the urge to replace what they break. Doing so will only teach your child that no matter what they do, you will always fix their problems for them. Avoid teaching them this lesson.Children tend to care more for things that they had to work hard or wait for.

, Rather than intervening at the slightest disagreement, allow your child to try to figure problems out on their own. Children are often able to do so alone without intervention, so give them a chance. Only intervene if the argument becomes physical or if your child is being belittled or insulted., Teach them to be independent by empowering them to feed themselves. Purchase toddler-sized utensils and cups to help them in this process.Cut up their food when necessary and be sure to supervise. You don’t want them to choke.

, Your toddler may have just begun the initial potty training phases. Help them to navigate this process more independently by allowing them some control. For instance, instead of taking their pants down, you can allow them to do that themselves."
"
Purchase blocks.,
Try not to oversee their play.,
Play hide and seek.",How to Encourage Toddler Independence3," Blocks are a great way to help foster your child’s independence in a way that other toys do not. Most toys can only be used or played with in a certain way but blocks allow for greater autonomy and creative control. Purchase a set for your child and see what they create., It is healthy and normal for you to play with your child, but allow them to play without you most of the time. You might unknowingly take over the play more than you realized, thereby limiting their independence.Allow them to play alone while you are cooking or cleaning or having some personal time.
Childproof your home so that you don’t have to worry about them injuring themselves while playing alone. Check in on them every few minutes to be sure they’re okay.

, Encourage your child to play hide and seek with their playmates or siblings, or even with you. Doing so helps them to become comfortable with the unknown and to also be able to make decisions, such as where to hide and where to seek, for themselves."
"
Share “fun” responsibilities.,
Introduce new training.,
Incentivize caring for the dog.,
Incorporate play into caring for the animal.",How to Keep Kids Interested in Caring for Their New Dog1," Depending on the age of your children, you should encourage them to help with chores that they may consider fun, like walking or exercising the dog. These activities teach your children responsibility while allowing them to engage in the more positive aspects of pet ownership. If your children only do the boring chores and fail to enjoy to fun things about having a dog, they will not be interested in the pet for very long.Besides walking or playing with the dog, fun activities can include washing the dog or brushing its hair.
Children under 6 should not be allowed to walk the dog. In addition, children between 6 and 10 years old should not be allowed to walk the dog without an adult nearby.;
, Finding new training activities for your dog is another way to keep your kids engaged with caring for their pet. This can include simple commands like “sit” and “stay” or more complex things like clicker training. As long as you let the children participate, training can be a great way to keep your children invested in dog care., If your children’s interest in caring for the dog is waning, you might perk their interest by providing an incentive. This might be particularly useful for older children and teenagers. Consider giving them a monetary incentive or reward them with a “fun” dog-related activity every time they complete a “less fun” dog chore. You can also attach perks to completing certain tasks, like allowing your child to stay up a little longer or letting them stay out with their friends later.For example, if your older kids refuse to pick up dog poo when they walk the dog, ask them to take a picture of the poo in a bag and then pay them for it when they show it to you.If your child cleans the dog’s crate, you might reward them with extra time playing with the dog.

, Try to make chores seem less stale and boring by incorporating elements of play. Incorporate a points system for completing chores or attach the tasks to fun activities. Finding a way to enliven pet care with a little play will help keep your kids involved in caring for your dog.For example, when you groom your dog, you could encourage your children to leave the brushed out dog hair for birds to make nests. After you brush its hair, put the clumps of dog hair in a bag and then let your children put the clumps on trees and bushes around your home. Eventually, birds will come along and use the hair to make their nests."
"
Talk about what chores your kids can handle.,
Praise your kids every time they complete a chore.,
Do not punish your child with pet-related chores.",How to Keep Kids Interested in Caring for Their New Dog2," As your children get older, you should talk with them about what pet responsibilities they feel capable of performing. Make sure that you give them something that they can handle. They will feel more empowered and better able to care for the dog if they complete an easy chore regularly as opposed to a more difficult chore less frequently.Kids under the age of five can help with some small aspects of caring for your dog but they should always be supervised.
Children between ages 6 and 10 can assume many dog-related tasks like grooming and cleaning up after the pet.
Kids over the age of 10 can perform all aspects of caring for your dog on their own.

, Positively reinforcing your child’s responsibility will help it become a recurring behavior. Whenever your child helps care for your dog, you should let them know how much you appreciate it. As they get older you can limit the amount of praise you give them, but you should still congratulate them from time to time.You might say things like “Thank you for feeding the dog. I really appreciate that, and I know that Rufus does too” or “Thanks for walking Sparky. He appreciates the exercise.”

, One way to turn your children off pet-related chores is by associating punishment with caring for your dog. If your child does something wrong, do not punish them by assigning them extra dog-related chores. Ultimately, the child may become frustrated and resentful towards the dog."
"
Model good pet care.,
Remind the children of the dog’s needs.,
Encourage your children to learn about your dog.",How to Keep Kids Interested in Caring for Their New Dog3," One of the surest ways to make sure that your children continue in caring for your dog is by modeling good pet care yourself. If you are a responsible pet owner, your children will likely follow your model. This does not mean that you need to do everything. However, you do need to show them what regular and responsible pet ownership looks likeFor example, as a parent, you should model how to feed the dog. Feeding your pet regularly and maintaining its diet is a good way to build good habits for the entire family.

, If your children are skirting their pet care responsibilities, you should remind them in an even tone that your dog needs food, water, and exercise like everyone else. Do not yell at the children or scold the children for failing to care for the dog. A gentle reminder should spur some action. If you berate your children, they will likely develop some negative emotions towards you and the dog.Remember to emphasize the importance of your children’s responsibilities. Reminding them that their pet’s general health and well-being depends on them may help them be more responsible.

, Have your children learn about your dog’s breed and history. Encourage them to research the special traits of your dogs breed. If you adopted the dog, research its history. Knowing more about your dog and where it came from can help your children feel more invested in the dog and caring for it.Contact the shelter or rescue group that you adopted the dog from, or talk with the person you adopted it from.

Start early.,
Practice what you preach.,
Visit the dentist.,
Make it a part of the daily routine.",How to Teach Kids to Brush Their Teeth1," Start cleaning your child’s gums even before he or she has any teeth. It will help keep his/her mouth and gums healthy and it sets a pattern of oral care for both of you.


Use a damp, soft cloth or gauze pad, or buy an infant gum brush/massager, and gently wipe the gumline.Begin brushing as soon as a tooth appears. Use a soft brush; many experts advise using a rice grain-sized amount of fluoride toothpaste, but you can at least start by just wetting the brush.;
, You will have many other opportunities to use the “Do as I say, not as I do” method of parenting. Practice good oral health care yourself and let your child know this is important for everyone.


Brush your teeth with your child. Let your child feel like he or she is helping to keep you on the right track as well.

, It is recommended that a child visit the dentist by age one or within six months of the first tooth appearance, whichever comes first.Bring your child to one of your appointments, or that of an older sibling, cousin, or friend. Ask the dentist to let your child observe what happens at a dental checkup. Your child may be more receptive to hearing why healthy teeth are so important from the person in the white coat with all the fancy tooth gadgets.
Find books or videos about visiting the dentist. Help them be more familiar and less frightened.

, Have your child brush his/her teeth at the same times each day. Attach it to other normal tasks -- for instance, brushing right before pajamas come off in the morning and as soon as they go on in the evening. Make it seem very ordinary (yet important).

"
"
Remember “2min2x.” The accepted goal for tooth-brushing, for both children and adults, is two times daily for two minutes each time.The odds are probably good that even if you do brush your own teeth twice daily, you don’t do it for two minutes each time.,
Use toothpaste properly.,
Teach proper brushing technique.,
Let your kid take over when ready.,
Be patient.",How to Teach Kids to Brush Their Teeth2," Remember that what’s good for kids’ teeth is good for yours as well -- and you don’t get a replacement set!

, A rice grain sized amount of toothpaste is recommended for children under 3, and a pea-sized amount for kids ages 3-6. While you should emphasize the need to spit out toothpaste, swallowing this small amount is harmless.


There are fluoride toothpastes formulated specifically for infants and toddlers. The often have fruit flavors (and cartoon characters on the packaging) that appeal to kids.

, Show them how to start the brush at a 45-degree angle against the gum line, then clean the front (and back) of each tooth with short, round strokes. Brush the biting/chewing surface of each tooth with short, sweeping strokes.Don’t expect miracles when it comes to a kid’s brushing technique, but do emphasize the importance of cleaning all surfaces of each tooth, as well as the gumline. It is also good practice to brush the tongue to remove germs and improve bad breath.
Also stress the importance of spitting out the remaining toothpaste when finished. Tell them that even though the paste still tastes fruity-yummy, it is now yucky from cleaning off the teeth and needs to go down the drain.
Demonstrate on a doll or stuffed animal with teeth that can be “brushed” utilizing the correct methods.

, Most kids love to show how “big” they are by trying to do things all by themselves. When you feel comfortable putting the brush in your child’s hands, do so but supervise carefully. Hold your hand over his/hers to start if that helps.


If you are concerned about the quality of your child’s brushing, try taking turns -- he or she brushes all by herself in the morning, you do the work at night, for instance., Yes, your child will likely squeeze toothpaste everywhere and make a big mess repeatedly. Focus on instilling the right habits and demonstrating the right techniques, and allow time for your child to develop the skill and dedication to brush correctly and regularly. Really, it’s just like anything else you try to teach a child -- patience is a virtue!

"
"
Let them choose supplies.,
Use music.,
Play games.,
Utilize online resources.,
Reward their efforts.",How to Teach Kids to Brush Their Teeth3," Store shelves are full of kids’ toothbrushes, toothpaste, rinse cups, etc., with princesses, race cars, and the like plastered on them. Take kids shopping and allow them to pick their favorites. If it helps them enjoy brushing a little more, a branded toothbrush is worth the extra cost versus a generic one.


It is recommended that kids’ toothbrushes be replaced every 3-4 months (or sooner, if the bristles are frayed),so you will have many opportunities to shop for supplies.

, Sing or play a song that takes about two minutes so they know how long to brush. Songs made specifically for kids’ tooth-brushing can be found online,and there are gadgets available that play music, blow bubbles, and do various other things to pass the two minutes. An old-fashioned egg timer works in a pinch as well.

, Most kids like a good competition, and especially winning, and most especially besting Mom or Dad. Take their minds off the drudgery of brushing.


Have a brushing competition between you and your child. Count the brush strokes and see who can do the most in two minutes.
See who can make the foamiest mouth out of that pea-sized amount of toothpaste. This is liable to end up making a messy sink, so also have a clean-up contest afterward.
Say a sentence while brushing your teeth. Your opponent must guess what you are saying.

, There are numerous websites dedicated to helping kids brush better, and they often offer games, video clips, printable charts to keep track of tooth-brushing, and other resources. Some of them make use of favorite kids’ characters as well.


For instance, if your toddler likes Sesame Street, there is a “Healthy Teeth Toolkit” site that would appeal to him/her., Let’s face it, kids like being rewarded. And the promise of the reward of a lifetime of healthy teeth probably won’t cut it. Some call it bribery, but most parents end up calling it a necessity.


Print out or draw up a weekly chart, with two spots for each day to be filled in when the child brushes. Write an agreed-upon reward on the chart, to be earned if each space is filled in successfully. Give the kid a visual representation of the goal and his/her progress toward it.
Let the Tooth Fairy help you out. Tell your child that the Tooth Fairy only brings rewards for healthy, clean teeth that have fallen out -- or at least that the rewards are better for pearly whites.

Explain to children why paying attention to certain things when walking is important.,
Teach your children the basic rules about being a pedestrian while you're still walking with them.,
Instill the need in children to always stop before stepping onto the road.,
Have your children learn to make eye contact with drivers before they cross the road.,
Request that your children learn and obey all traffic signals.,
Teach your children to be careful when walking past driveways, especially hidden and obstructed driveways.,
Make sure that your children understand the dangers of crossing between parked cars or other vehicles.,
Teach children to always cross at pedestrian crossings and intersections, even where this means an extra walk.",How to Teach Children Basic Street Safety when Walking," This doesn't just mean the obvious hazards like speeding cars but also less evident ones such as cars coming around corners suddenly or vehicles not stopping at pedestrian crossings.
Explaining the reasons for staying alert while walking helps children to understand more clearly why something is expected of them, especially if they know the consequences of not paying adequate attention or of not practicing basic safety precautions.;
, You can practice the rules about the road and traffic with them regularly during your walks, so that much of this understanding feels like second nature to the child. In this way, by the time your child starts walking down and across streets without your help, none of the pedestrian road rules should come as a surprise to them.

, Each time they stop, tell them that they must look both ways and listen for vehicles that they cannot see. However, be sure to tell them not to rely on their hearing as the only form of knowing whether or not vehicles are about; explain to them that many vehicles such as hybrids and newer cars can be extremely quiet. Train them to use both their eyes and their hearing together when checking for traffic.


Ask them questions about what they'd do in certain situations when you're walking. For example, you come to a crossing. Ask your child what they should do now. You should expect your child to answer something like: ""I stop, look both ways to check the cars are actually stopping before I cross and only when I am sure they've stopped do I cross"". Keep reminding them of the right approach until they're able to say it back to you in their own words (this shows they've understood it properly).

, This way they can be assured that the driver has noted their presence.


This isn't always possible as some vehicles will be too heavily tinted and some vehicles will be too high for the child to see the driver. At least encourage this as one element of safety.

, Help them to learn the meanings of the traffic and road signs when you walk together; the younger they learn, the easier it will be for them later.


Play games with the signs, such as ""I spy"" or ""Guess the meaning of the sign"", etc. Praise them for getting it right.

, Remind them that people backing out cannot see very well and don't always think to look for children passing by and sometimes don't even slow down. The same goes for alleys and street corners. Always insist that your child stay alert and not expect drivers to be doing the same.


Help the child know what to do if a car suddenly comes out, such as jumping back or stopping and not proceeding any further into the car's path.
It can sometimes help to use model cars to explain safety situations to a young child.

, Tell them that they must never do this as they cannot see a car that might be passing swiftly past the gap they're trying to cross from, as well as not being able to clearly see what is happening on the other side of the road.


It is also important that children learn to wait until the school bus has left before crossing the road the bus is on unless the driver has specifically made it clear that it is safe for the alighting children to cross.

, Explain to them that the exercise is good for them and that it is always better to be safe than sorry all for the sake of minor shortcut. Do not jaywalk(jaywalk means walk when the signal indicates not to walk)!

Be clear about what is expected ahead of time.,
Use humor to lighten tension.,
Develop short and simple, one-word reminders.,
Model by doing your own chores in a timely fashion.",How to Get Your Kids to Do Chores Without Nagging1," You may think your child knows exactly what is expected, but that may not actually be the case. Giving clear and detailed instructions of what you want can prevent you from feeling frustrated when your child doesn’t perform the task in the manner in which you desire.For instance, if you want your child’s room cleaned, avoid saying “Clean your room!” Instead, say “You need to put away your clean clothes, pick up all toys and trash from the floor, and make your bed.”;
, Just about everyone performs better—and has a more enjoyable time doing their chores—when they aren’t stressed, and are instead happy. Using humor to remind your children that they need to perform chores can set the tone for a good day, and have chores completed without fighting.


For example, you can write a note from the dog reminding your child that she is hungry and needs food., Children typically don’t want to hear long lectures whenever they forget to do something. Instead, create straightforward, one-word reminders that can help them to remember their chores when they forget.


For instance, saying “cat” to feed the cat or “homework” to remind them to complete their assignments may be enough to encourage your children to do their chores without causing a fight., Leading by example is one of the most effective methods in teaching children. Your children will likely procrastinate or dislike completing chores if they see you act the same way. Instead, get your own chores done in a timely manner, and display the type of attitude and performance you expect your children to display, yourself."
"
Be realistic about selecting age-appropriate chores.,
Demonstrate how each chore should be done.,
Help them set up a schedule.,
Set a timer.",How to Get Your Kids to Do Chores Without Nagging2," You wouldn’t expect your toddler to wash and fold clothing, and you also know that your teenager is capable of doing more than just making the bed. Selecting chores that are age-appropriate is key, as you don’t want your children getting frustrated or bored because tasks are either too difficult or too easy.


As your children get older, increase the amount of chores and their complexity. For instance, grade school kids can help to match socks, place clothing in the hamper, and feed the pets. Older kids can do dishes, laundry, and help keep the house tidy., Children, especially those that are younger, often learn better by watching how the task is completed, rather than just hearing verbal directions. Therefore, in addition to hearing you explain the procedure, show them, as well., A majority of children thrive on schedules and routines, and chore-completion is no exception. The more you are able to attach chores to an already existing routine, the more likely your children are to complete them without arguments.For instance, have child son walk the dog right when they gets home from school, before they become involved in another activity. That way you can prevent them from getting upset when they have to stop a favored activity to complete the chore.

, If your children tend to put off doing chores, set a timer to only give them a certain amount of time to get it done. If they don’t complete the task in 20 minutes, for example, they don’t get allowance or rewarded for doing chores.Setting a timer may also help motivate your children, as having to get the chores completed within time constraints may feel like a game. Say something like “The timer’s set for 20 minutes. Jump on those dishes!” to motivate your children.

"
"
Explain the implications of not getting chores done.,
Be consistent and follow through.,
Praise them when they take responsibility.,
Offer allowance.The prospect of earning allowance is often an effective motivator for children.,
Negotiate rewards and consequences with your children.If your children have worked with you to develop a set of consequences and rewards that motivate them, you are more likely to see compliance.",How to Get Your Kids to Do Chores Without Nagging3," Be up front and clear about the consequences of not completing chores. Although you shouldn’t box yourself in, you should also let your children know what will happen as a result of disobedience.


For a teenager, an appropriate consequence could be taking the car away or not allowing them to spend time with friends. A consequence for a younger child could be withholding allowance or a favorite toy for a small amount of time., Parents who don’t hold their children accountable for their chores often find that the kids ignore them and wait for the parents to do them themselves. . Instead, make sure they finish what is expected from them.


Also, when you communicate that there will be a consequence when chores are not completed, be sure to actually follow through with disciplining them. Your children will not take you seriously if you make empty threats that never come to fruition.

, Your children will likely be more encouraged to perform when they hear from you that they are doing a good job. This is particularly true when they are just learning a new task. Even if the end result is less than you expected, hearing that you appreciate what the effort is helpful.Give your children praise by saying things like “Good job on cleaning your room!” or “It makes me so happy to see that the dog’s food bowl is filled!”
Also, resist the urge to correct what has been completed, as doing so can make your children feel that whatever they do is never good enough for your expectations., However, one of the best ways to encourage your children via allowance is to offer it through a commission-based system. In other words, instead of offering a set amount each week, only pay your children for the work that was completed.


Additionally, don’t give your children allowance if chores aren't completed. Not having money to do things they want to do will remind them why they don’t have the funds--because they didn’t do what was expected.

, Sit down with your children once a year or every few months and look back over your disciplining/rewarding system. Do the rewards and consequences still match up with your children's interests or developmental status?


For instance, if you have a 7-year old who is addicted to a certain cartoon show, you might reward them by offering allowance that goes toward a fund to buy a life-size toy of the show's main character. However, if your child does not complete chores, a part of disciplining might be to take away TV privileges for a day.
In the example above, if the child was no longer interested in the TV show, the rewards and consequences would no longer be as motivating. Revisit your system regularly to be sure it will encourage your child to do chores.

Make a game out of cleaning their room.,

Once that's done, say ""1, 2, 3, go, orange toys get put away."",
Keep repeating this color process, until the room is clean.

Restore their items.",How to Get Your Children to Clean Their Room2," How messy is it? How long will it take to clean? When you have established how long it will take to clean, decide on a morning/afternoon/day when it has to be done. When that time has arrived, tell your child that you are taking away all their personal electronics and accessibility to electronic devices until their room is clean.


Do not give in, even if they need electronics for school etc. Remind them that they can have it back as soon as they clean their bedrooms and maybe they should keep it clean and they would have their electronic devices.

, This only stresses and angers older children and does not necessarily motivate them. It may be hours, days, weeks or even months before they give in to temptation. Don't worry, eventually they will give in (try living for a day with out electronics and see how you feel!).

, and started cleaning their room, that you have them keep their bedroom door open. That way you can check on their progress every 10-30 minutes and remind them what they haven't done yet.

, When their room is 100 percent clean, (check everywhere), hand them all their personal electronics and grant them permission to all other family electronic devices (TV, family computer, family iPad etc.) Done!

Involve your kids in the decision making process.,
Assign fewer chores when you know your kids are especially busy.,
Take your children's ages and abilities into account.,
Break up overwhelming tasks into smaller chores.,
Assign chores that appeal to your child’s interests.",How to Help Your Kids Enjoy Chores1," Talk to your children about what their household responsibilities should be, especially if they’re preteens or teenagers. Agree upon specific tasks, and make sure everyone is clear about when those tasks should be completed.For example, you and your child might agree that chores should be completed right after school or as soon as they get home. Alternatively, if they’re supposed to load or unload the dishwasher, it might be best for them to complete that task in the evening after dinnertime.
If you have multiple children, hold a family meeting to make sure everyone is on the same page about chore assignments. Ask them, “Does anyone think these tasks are divided up unfairly? Would you prefer to rotate chores, so everyone has different tasks each week?”;
, When assigning chores, consider how busy you and your child are, and place your emphasis on family time over busywork. Try to lighten their load during a sports season, during midterms or finals, or when their workload otherwise increases.Chores are often intended to instill a sense of responsibility. However, if your teen is in honors classes, plays soccer, and is in student government, it might be best to ease up on them when it comes to their workload at home.
If the family’s schedule is generally hectic, consider assigning everyone a 15 or 20 minute daily task to do together, like getting the kitchen and dining rooms in order after dinner. That way, everyone can talk to each other about their days while still keeping the house tidy.

, Assign tasks that your kids are physically and developmentally able to complete, ideally within 15 or 20 minutes. Try to think of chores that are challenging but not impossible for their age and size.For example, having a five year old fold fitted sheets by themselves is probably beyond their abilities. Likewise, expecting a child who is less than four feet tall dust a shelf twice their height without supervision could be a safety hazard.
Age appropriate tasks for pre-kindergartners include: putting clothes in a hamper, matching socks into pairs, and putting toys awayGood chores for six year olds include separating laundry, organizing mail, and watering plants.Have your seven or eight year old set and clear the dinner table, take out trash, and dust.If they’re ten or over, have them vacuum, mow the lawn, help prepare dinner, and unload the dishwasher., Instead of telling your child to clean an entire room, try to assign specific, smaller tasks. This will help them clearly understand their responsibilities and make their chores more approachable.For example, instead of saying, “Clean the living room,” you could say: “First, dust the shelves, television cabinet, and side tables. Then, after you’ve dusted, vacuum the floor.”

, If you know your child likes plants, have them water potted plants inside or the garden outside. If they love animals, have them brush, feed, and walk the dog, or clean out their hamster’s cage. Have them help you make dinner if they show interest in cooking, and make it fun by giving them their own chef’s hat and apron."
"
Avoid using chores as punishment.,
Get your kids used to doing chores before turning on electronics.,
Do chores together.,
Schedule a daily family tidy time.",How to Help Your Kids Enjoy Chores2," The first step to developing an enjoyable chore routine is to associate chores with positivity. If your child misbehaves, consider withholding a privilege, such as a video game or TV show, instead of adding a task to their list of chores.An exception might be if you have multiple children and one of your kids does something to another. For example, if one child steals from another, have them complete a task normally assigned to the one whose item they stole.

, Creating a chore routine involves structure and consistency. Do your best not to let your child turn on the television or their video game system without first finishing a household task.For instance, when they get home from school, make sure their coat is hung up, shoes are away, and bed is made before they can watch TV.

, Completing tasks with younger children will show them how to do their chores properly and in a timely manner. Doing chores with older children will help you keep in touch with them if they have a busy schedule.For example, have your kindergartner sort laundry with you, preteen wash dishes while you dry them, or teenager tend to the garden with you.
If a younger child understands how to complete a task, they’ll be less like to dread their chores. Using chores as a bonding experience with an older child can help enrich your relationship with them.

, Setting aside a specific time for everyone to clean up will help everyone feel part of a larger whole. Incorporate something fun into the routine to motivate everyone to finish their tasks.For example, after dinner, have everyone do a tidying task: have one person pick up odds and ends around the house, have another handle the dishes or dishwasher, and have someone else wipe down the table and counters.
Put on music everyone enjoys and make a party out of cleaning time.
After cleaning time, do something fun together, like make sundaes, watch a movie, or play a board game.

"
"
Use plenty of positive reinforcement.,
Make a chore list.,
Hide goodies that your child will find only if they complete a task.,
Give your child an allowance.",How to Help Your Kids Enjoy Chores3," If your child completes a task well and in a timely manner, use age-appropriate language to let them know what a great job they did. When they complete a task without being told, let them know how impressed you are.If your younger child puts their dirty clothes in the hamper without being told, tell them, “I am so proud of you! You did such a great job, and you’re really showing me what a big kid you’re becoming!”
If your preteen or teen finishes their chore, try saying, “Hey, it makes me happy to see you handling your responsibilities in such a mature way. Thanks for remembering that today’s your day to clean your room.”

, Write down your child’s assigned tasks, and include spaces for gold stars or fun stickers. If they complete their chores on time and without being told for a certain number of consecutive days, they get a reward.For instance, if they make their bed in the morning, put their shoes and coat where they belong, and load the dishwasher, they get a gold star for that day.
If they get five gold star days in a row, they get a day off from chores, a small toy, a dollar bonus on their allowance, or other appropriate incentive.

, Try to find ways to create a scavenger hide using small rewards. Put quarters under lamps, coffee table books, and other places where your child dusts to encourage them to do their job thoroughly. Hide a candy bar, action figure, or other age appropriate treat at the bottom of clean clothes they’re supposed to fold.Try to use the scavenger hunt technique to encourage your child to complete their tasks without cutting any corners.
Mix up your hiding places so they don’t just dig around the bottom of the laundry basket without actually folding clothes.

, Deciding on an allowance amount and whether to offer one at all depends on affordability, their age, and other personal variables. If you do opt to give your child an allowance, make sure they have to earn it instead of getting a set amount automatically.Make sure they know that they might they might lose a percentage of their allowance if they have to be told more than once to do something or are sloppy about completing a task.
Be aware that they might decide they’re fine with losing a dollar a week if it means they don’t have to spend a little extra time being thorough. If an allowance system seems to be encouraging laziness instead of industriousness, consider having a conversation with them about it.
Try saying, “An allowance is supposed to encourage you to be proud of and enjoy what you’ve earned, not cut corners. We’re going to take a break from the allowance. We’ll talk about bringing it back a month from now if you can do your chores completely and without being told more than once.”

Stay calm and think positively.,
Be patient.,
Decide who should do what.,
Design a chart that is fair for the family members based on their abilities and ages.,
Design and make your chart.,
Consider using rewards.,
Plan how to introduce the new routine.,
Set a start date and get started on a new family routine.",How to Get Your Children to Help Out at Home," The laws of attraction state that if you want something positive to happen in your life you need to visualize it happening. If you want your children to help out with chores at home, you can visualize it happening (even though the vision gets cloudy and unclear from time to time). In order to make that vision a reality, you need to stay calm and think positive.


Make an affirmation that you will teach your child/children lessons on how to take care of themselves. Doing so will be beneficial to their independence in the future and they will in time incorporate those lessons into routines of daily living.;
, Change is hard for children as it is for adults, however, if you keep calm and think positive that you will make the right choices for your family by starting new routines, such as cleaning with the goal of it actually getting done, then you are on the right path to a success.


If you're stressed about the changes, your children will be, too. Stay calm, stay positive, and be firm but kind as you implement any new cleaning routine.

, A major part of cleaning your home is having a plan. Getting organized by making a family cleaning chart works well when everyone does their part, and everyone is held accountable for their actions.


What needs to be done in each individual room?
Who should take out the garbage and recycling?
Who will feed the pets or walk them if needed?

, Think about what your child is capable of doing and jot it down.


Toddlers can help by putting their toys away, placing clothes in a hamper, and help dusting for example. Singing a clean up song usually will get them motivated.
Young children as old as 4 and 5 can help vacuum, dust, and help with laundry.
Older children ages 8 and up should be able to do those tasks and more, including washing dishes, filling/emptying the dishwasher, and organizing, without much assistance once they get the hang of it.
Also kids could help clean counters, bathrooms, and floors. Using an all natural cleaner might be ideal under these circumstances, such as vinegar and water (verify if the surface can be cleaned with vinegar before doing so), or even a diluted soapy solution that can be rinsed and wiped with a wash cloth.

, Try to make it visually appealing and color-coded, without making it too distracting on the eyes. You want to be able to focus when you look at it. You can do an online search for options on design. Some websites offer free printable templates or you can create your own via computer. You can also go the old fashioned route of using paper and your favorite writing utensil, if you desire.

, You may also want to decide at this time if you are going to put a reward system in place to keep your children motivated. Choose what works best for your family based on your values and what feels right. If after a few weeks it is still not working, reassess, and revise your rewards plan as needed. Whatever you decide, be consistent.


Sticker charts work well for younger children.
You may decide to use allowance.
You can also be stricter about consequences; for example, if they fail to do their chores, don't let them have friends over. You do, however, want to reward them for following through on their responsibilities and give them extra privileges such as extra time at the park, family date night, etc.

, Your family members may resist at first, so introduce it slowly and be clear and kind but firm about the guidelines. If you have family/friends that live with you and are willing to give you support and input, then take advantage of making this project an inclusive team approach.


Hold a family meeting, preferably when things are light and fluffy and not after any member has had a rough day; as kids are more agreeable when under less stress. Stick to your plan and let your child/children know that chores are a requirement and not a suggestion/option. They may or may not give you grief, but even if they do, stay firm with the decision as it will benefit the entire family as well as the individual child.

, You and your family can totally do this! Getting started is the hardest part, but once you have started you will be much happier when the chores are all done. Think of how accomplished and thankful your children will be to have completed their chores.

Be truthful with others.,
Offer constructive criticism as a sandwich cookie.,
Mind your tone.,
Display relaxed body language.",How to Teach Kids to Be Honest Without Being Hurtful1," As a parent, your best tool towards building adaptive behaviors in your child is to model them in your own behavior. Help your kids learn the value of honesty by being honest yourself. You want your kids to “catch” you exhibiting the behaviors you are trying to teach. This means you shouldn’t lie to others or your kids.Sometimes, in parenting, telling a lie is far easier than explaining the truth. Resist going the easy route. Instead of telling your child “We’re all going to bed, so you should, too,” say “Mommy and Daddy can stay up a little later. But you’re smaller. Your body needs more sleep to grow properly.”
If your child asks about something that is not appropriate for your child’s age, then explain it in a way that the child will understand and that will not frighten them. Do not lie to avoid discussing certain topics.;
, Telling the truth shouldn’t excuse you from being polite. Share feedback to others and your kids by using the sandwich method. Think of an Oreo. It has two crispy cookies and a creamy inside. Any harsh criticism should come in the middle, so that you can buffer it with two positive statements on the outside.For example, remark on your child’s piano performance by saying, “You did an awesome job at the recital. You rushed the end of the second piece, but you recovered quite nicely. Your technique is definitely improving.” Here, the criticism (i.e. rushing the music) is sandwiched between two compliments.
This method helps you practice honesty while preserving the other person’s feelings.
It is also helpful to offer praise often. It is easier to hear criticism if you believe the person has a high opinion of you.

, Tone, the manner in which you speak, is one aspect of communication that adds punch to your words. Even if you are trying to be polite with your words, the receiver won’t deem them as courteous if your tone of voice is inconsistent with the message.In general, it’s hard to know what would be considered okay for one person or rude to another. Even when you are communicating with emotion or passion, try your best to wrap your words in cotton. Rather than spitting out words or raising your voice, stick to an indoor voice in a softer tone.Try excusing yourself for a few minutes when you are upset. Don’t return to the conversation until you have composed yourself. This will set a good example for your child.

, Body language allows you to convey a message without making a sound. Crossed arms. Standing over others. Pacing. All of these seemingly minor behaviors can make others intimidated or alarmed. Being honest without being hurtful requires watching these nonverbal cues to make sure your body language aligns with your intended message.


Being polite entails showing others that you are sensitive to their feelings. Crossing your arms is often used when a person is angry or disappointed, so you may want to relax your arms and legs instead. Pacing or standing over someone can make you appear rude or impatient. If the other person is seated, sit down also. Relax your posture, make eye contact, and leave your arms and legs casually at your sides."

Follow a three-step filter.,
Balance truth-telling with consideration for others’ feelings.,
Challenge kids to engage in moral reasoning.,
Praise truth-telling.,
Use stories.",How to Teach Kids to Be Honest Without Being Hurtful2," Being honest doesn’t just mean blurting out whatever you think as long as it’s true. You must also be considerate of the receiver. Teach your kids to stop before responding and follow this popular three-step filter: Is it true? Is it necessary? Is it kind?If your children believe that what they want to say is true, then advance to the next step. Is the message adding anything of value to the silence? Is it constructive? If so, then you’ll advance even further to determine whether it is kind. This is the final filter because even if the content is true and potentially necessary, you don’t want to speak in unkind ways.
If your children arrive at a message that meets the first two criteria but not the third, teach them to save their remarks. Or, they can brainstorm a more socially acceptable way of delivering the message that doesn’t hurt anyone’s feelings. However, be sure to teach your children the difference between being nice and being kind. Sometimes it is necessary to tell people things they might not want to hear to show them kindness.

, Experts contend that pro-social lying, that is lies that smooth over difficult social interactions and spare others' feelings, can be beneficial. However, children can easily get confused or start excusing their lies if you teach this tactic. Instead help them find ways to be honest and consider the feelings of those around them simultaneously.Teach your children how to make amends if they do hurt someone’s feelings.

, Limit little white lies that you tell to your children and others. If you do slip up and tell a white lie, use the situation as a learning opportunity. Ask your kids how you could have handled the situation better.For example, you tell your sister that you have plans because you refuse to hang out and listen to her boyfriend drama. Your children overhear you. Instead of excusing your behavior, allow them to educate you.
You could say, “Gee, telling lies even to protect someone’s feelings isn’t right. What do you guys think I could have done to be honest in this situation?” Listen to your children’s responses and work together to come up with ways to tactfully tell the truth.
They might suggest you telling her “Okay, we can hang out, but only if there’s a ban on discussing relationship issues. Just for tonight.” This is an honest and straightforward way of telling her how you really feel without being unnecessarily rude.
Another option is to show your kids kind ways to be honest while also teaching them how to avoid getting involved in a situation. For example, you could tell your sister that you're just not feeling like it this evening and set up another time instead.

, If your kids come clean about making a mistake, or even confess later after telling a lie, reinforce their honesty. Being honest can be difficult, especially if kids fear the consequences. Make honesty a praise-worthy habit, and give them a pass when they make the hard choice to tell the truth.


Rather than punishing a child after being honest—which may only make them lie in the future—give them a warning. You might say, “I’m glad you confessed to breaking the vase, Charlie. That was a smart choice, to tell the truth. But, I do believe you owe Grandma an apology for breaking it.”It may be helpful to have tiers of consequences, such as minor consequences for minor offenses like lying and then confessing the truth before they are found out, and more severe consequences for more severe actions like lying and denying that they are lying despite evidence that they are.
Do not ask your children questions that you already know the answers to if you suspect they are lying. This may give your children the idea that if they are creative enough, then they can get away with things. Gently confront them with your suspicion and encourage them to tell the truth.

, Picture books, fables, and kid-appropriate TV shows may offer great storylines that help you reinforce the importance of honesty with your children. Visit your local bookstore or library to find books at your child’s age level that help drive home the message of being honest without being hurtful.Books, movies, and TV shows can work as great conversation starters about the concept of honesty. Afterwards, you will want to discuss with your children what the characters went through and any lessons they learned.Being Frank is a great picture book that expounds on the topic of telling the truth while considering others’ feelings."

Explain the white lies of tradition.,
Teach them gift etiquette.,
Help them find ways to genuinely compliment others.,
Role-play ways to let friends down gently.",How to Teach Kids to Be Honest Without Being Hurtful3," Common holiday and special event traditions often require you to ""lie"" to your children about certain characters. For instance, parents tell kids that Santa drops off present on Christmas Eve, that the Easter Bunny brings special gifts, and that the Tooth Fairy leaves a dollar for a lost tooth. Help your kids understand these traditions, and discourage them from prematurely telling their peers.You might say, ""I know it's not nice to lie, but these traditions help children believe in the impossible. Plus, they make childhood so much fun. Now that you know I need you to promise that you won't tell your younger siblings or any friends. Can you keep it between us?""

, A common dilemma parents of young children face is them not having discretion after receiving a disappointing gift. A young child is quick to shout “This is a dumb gift” or “I don’t like it!” Responses like this effectively humiliate the parent and the giver. It also decreases the chances of the giver giving in the future.


Rather than excusing a little white lie, help your child devise a response that is truthful while still positive. For example, if your child receives a book she already has, she can say, “Thanks, Aunt Rita, I really like this author.”
Similar responses show gratitude for the gift and protect the other person’s feelings., Compliments are also an awkward area for young children. A family friend is getting married. Instead of praising the bride in all her beauty, a child yells “CiCi, your dress makes your butt look big!” This will make everyone laugh, of course, but it may not be what the bride needs to hear right before she walks down the aisle. Help your child learn genuine and appropriate ways to compliment others.Remind your child that even if the comment is true to them it may not be necessary or kind. Encourage them to focus on more socially appropriate compliments like “Wow, your hair is beautiful” or “Your dress is really fancy.” Such remarks will be met with approval from the bride and won’t make her feel self-conscious.

, When you say “honesty is the best policy,” kids take that to heart. Unfortunately, this could translate to them being unnecessarily mean to their peers for the sake of telling the truth. Practice ways to turn down invitations and similar situations without hurting others’ feelings.You might ask your child, “What can you say to Jessica if she wants to play outside and you don’t?” The child might respond with “I don’t want to come outside with you” in a rude tone.
As a parent, you can act out this scenario with your child and ask them how they would feel if a friend said this. Then, think of an honest but friendly alternative like “No, thank you, Jessica. I’d rather play with my dolls inside today.”

"
Teach them to say “thank you.” When your children are young, instruct them to say “thank you” when they receive something from someone else.,
Help them to appreciate the sentiment.,
Aid them in finding a positive.,
Remind them that it is not okay to hurt someone’s feelings.,
Tell them that they can talk to you if they are disappointed.",How to Teach Kids to Accept Gifts Graciously1," As you children get older, have them say “thank you” as a full sentence, highlighting what they appreciate about the gift. Teaching them these habits will prompt a polite and thoughtful response, even if they do not necessarily like the gift.For example, if you give your child a gift, instead of eliciting a simple “thank you,” encourage your child to express their gratitude by saying something like “Thank you for giving me such a generous gift” or “Thank you for the kind gift.”
It is important that you model this behavior yourself. If you are not saying “thank you” and expressing your gratitude, your children will likely not develop those habits either.;
, Teach your children that gifts are an act of love and caring. Remind your children that, even though a gift may have been disappointing, the intention was to please. Instead of focusing on their own disappointment, try to help them concentrate on the caring sentiment behind the gift.When they receive a gift, ask your child about the sentiments behind it. Ask them things like “Why do you think your Uncle Steve gave you this gift?” or “Do you think this gift says anything about how your grandparents feel about you?”

, Instead of fixating on the ways in which the gift is a disappointment, encourage your child to find a positive about the gift. You can practice this by imagining outlandish gifts and then naming what the positives of that gift might be. Ultimately, if your child cannot find anything positive about the gift, you can remind them that someone loved them enough to give them something.For example, if you are practicing gift acceptance, you might envision a stuffed animal that has four extra arms and two heads. Then ask your child what the positives might be of receiving such a gift.
You might also practice receiving “boring” gifts like clothes or school supplies. Ask your child what the positives might be of receiving a pair of socks or a pack of pencils.

, Teach your children that it is unacceptable to make fun of a present or embarrass the gift giver. Even if the giver is not there, being unkind towards them is not okay. Remind your child that their relationship with the gift giver is more important than the gift itself and that it is important to maintain that relationship.This may be a good opportunity to remind your child that if they do not have anything good to say, they should not say anything at all.
If your child is being unkind, you might say something like “How do you think that makes your Uncle Steve feel?” or “How would your Aunt Belinda feel if she was here?”

, If your child is upset about a gift, encourage them to talk to you about it privately. Let them know that you hear their concerns and are considering them. This is a good opportunity to restate to the child that the real value of the gift is the sentiment behind it and that they should appreciate the efforts of the gift giver.Depending on the gift, you may also want to talk to the gift giver to help them understand your child’s reaction and avoid hurt feelings.

Practice daily gratitudes.,
Have your children write thank you notes.,
Be strategic with gift giving.",How to Teach Kids to Accept Gifts Graciously2," Daily gratitudes are a great way to get your children to stop and appreciate the things in their lives that they value. At some point during the day, spend some time with your child talking about the things that you both appreciate. After you have listed some things that you are grateful for, ask your child to share some things that they appreciate.For example, before your child goes to bed at night, sit down with them and say something like “I really appreciated the delicious dinner that we ate tonight” or “I am grateful that our family is healthy.”
This is a practice that children in a wide age group can participate in. You may want to consider having older children keep a gratitude journal.

, When they are young, begin a practice of writing thank you cards or notes for any gifts that you or your child receives. Much like the daily gratitudes, this will help your child dwell on the good things in their life and foster an appreciation for them. Over time, this practice will become a regular occurrence when they receive something.With younger children, you can simply have them draw a picture and, as they get older, write more complicated letters.

, If you are meeting your child’s every whim, it is difficult for them to be grateful for the gifts that they receive. However, this does not mean that you should be withholding. Instead, be selective about when and how you give your children gifts. You should reserve gifts for special occasions and try to keep them a surprise. This will help keep your children from taking gifts for granted and developing a sense of entitlement.You should try to keep gift giving to holiday’s and special occasions like birthdays. However, you may also want to reward your children with gifts for good behavior or after special achievements.

"

Model gratitude.,
Help your children develop intrinsic goals.,
Encourage your children to help others.,
Practice mindfulness.",How to Teach Kids to Accept Gifts Graciously3," Children model much of their behavior after that of the adults around them. If you want your children to be grateful, you will need to express gratitude regularly. Say “thank you” and show your appreciation for others through small gifts, kind words, and loving actions. These things will create an atmosphere of gratitude that will nurture your child’s gratefulness.If you regularly express disappointment or are unsatisfied with the things that others do for you, do not be surprised if your children develop similar habits.

, Children often pursue materialistic goals at the expense of connecting with others or engaging in personal growth. Instead of facilitating a child’s already strong inclination towards materialistic goals, encourage values that build community and help them better understand themselves. As your child develops these intrinsic goals, they will learn to appreciate the things that others have done for them.Foster your child’s intrinsic goals by giving experiential gifts instead of material ones. Instead of toys, take your child on a camping trip or buying them a membership to the local museum.

, By inspiring your children to help others, you are helping them build strong personal relationships with people in their community. They also develop a greater appreciation of the ways in which others help them. With your children, volunteer in your community or donate to local charity groups. These actions will help your children appreciate what they have while being thoughtful of others., Developing a mindfulness practice is a great way to foster gratitude in your child. Being mindful will help you appreciate your connection with your child and other people. Spend time with your child and develop a family mindfulness practice. Help your children develop an appreciation of the world through daily gratitudes, meditation, and anxiety reduction.It is important that you develop a mindfulness practice before you teach it to your children.

Start when they're young.,

Show them the basics.,
Gradually introduce more household chores.,

Explain the logic of cleaning to your children.,
Make cleaning fun.,
Give them some freedom.,
Don't make it a punishment unless you need to.,
Stay calm, empathic and business-like in your approach.,
Help out.",How to Get Kids to Clean," All good habits take time to develop, and helping children learn to participate in household tasks is no exception. The earlier you start teaching them basic cleaning skills, the better it will be for them.


If your child is toilet-trained, they're old enough to learn to put away their things and to keep their toys straight. They're not ready to do the dishes yet, but they're ready to learn to put their own toys away.
Consider enrolling you child in daycare or Pre-School when they're old enough. These schools teach basic clean-up skills that you can build on at home.;
, Engage children in small tasks related to putting their toys away at first, to build the foundations for doing chores. Show your child where their toys go and tell them to put the toy there when they're finished with it. It's easier to teach a child to put away a toy after using it, than to teach a child to clean up a room that's become a total disaster area.


Make sure you have a specific place for everything. If your child doesn't know where something goes, it will be hard to clean. Create special bins for stuffed animals, Legos or doll clothes, for example, and help small children understand that there is a place where their toys can rest when not being used.

, If your child doesn't bring their clothes into the laundry room, let it be known that they won't get washed. This way, they will either get the clothes where they need to be on time, or learn to wash themselves. Keep the task and the consequences for not doing the task clear and as simple as possible.


Don't do it for them. If your child leaves toys laying around on the floor, you might be tempted to just pick it up and put it away for them instead of talking to them about it. Take the time to make this a teachable moment and go over the process with them again. Give your child a chance to get it right.

, Don't assume your child knows how to wash windows, or do the dishes correctly before you teach them. If you want your child to do some task, take plenty of time show them how you want it done, and expect that they won't get it right the first few times. Praise their efforts, and be patient.

, Once kids have the basics of keeping their toys and belongings straight, you can start gradually adding ""special"" jobs to the list. Give kids special responsibilities like setting the table, taking out the garbage, and helping unload groceries. This keeps them involved in the participatory cycle of domestic maintenance.

, As children get older, bigger jobs like mowing the lawn or washing the windows might come with certain dollar values attached. This can give them the option to earn cash for personal spending, especially if they are too young to work.


Ideally, you want to create a system in which children can feel the satisfaction of doing something productive and feeling good about it. There needs to be some positive feeling for doing the chores correctly, even if it's just living in a clean household. Praise them for doing things right, if you're not going to pay for more significant chores.

, Cleaning and keeping your home livable is an important part of living with people. Somebody has to do those dishes, pick up those toys, and do the laundry, or the house will just turn into chaos. You can't do everything. Tell your children why it's important to clean, and make sure they understand the process.


Again, it's important to establish that cleaning isn't a punishment for doing something wrong, it's just a necessary part of life. Make it seem fun and normal instead of grim.

, Opening up the house for a spring cleaning? Blast some music, throw on a monster movie marathon, and have fun while you do it. Find some way of making cleaning fun and like a nice family activity, rather than a depressing waste of time.


Treat everyone to an ice cream or a snack after you finish cleaning for the day. Celebrate a job well done together. If you have something to look forward to, it'll be a lot more enjoyable.

, In your house, once you've laid some basic ground rules, you might be able to change some things. If you have teens, maybe it's ok for their bedrooms to be as disastrous as they want. They are teenagers and need to have some space that is their own.

, Instead of making it a battleground related to tasks, involve your children from a young age in the matter-of-fact routine of living in a household. Cleaning should be a responsibility that they understand, not an arbitrary punishment that they're forced into.


As they mature, you might set up natural consequences if your child fails to do chores. For example, if a teenager leave their stuff lying around the main living area, put it in a box for a week, then in the garage, and eventually give it to charity if they don't want to put it away.

, Nagging or threatening creates an antagonistic dynamic and is not effective nor sustainable. Kids mimic the behavior, language, and attitude of their parents, so if you want them to have a good attitude about cleaning you should have one yourself. Cleaning shouldn't have to be a big fight all the time.

, Your child is much more likely to stay on task if you talk to them while they clean. Use it as an opportunity to spend quality time together, tidying up quickly. Practice what you preach by pitching in and cleaning in the trenches with your kids.


Decide whether or not your family will focus on cleaning up ""your"" mess or just cleaning up mess in general. It may not be important to distinguish between them, but it may be an effective cleaning teaching tool to do so.

Figure out what you can do to solve the problem.,
Let the child know that they can express their concerns.",How to Teach Kids the Difference Between Reporting and Tattling," It is not tattling if the child is concerned that they or another child may be hurt or in danger. Explain to your child what danger and unsafe situations mean. If you are unsure that the claim is legitimate or necessary, ask the child to explain the situation.For example, it is reporting and not tattling if one child pushes another child down and causes injury.;
, It is normal for children to want to avoid blame. No one likes getting in trouble. But, it is not okay if the child tells on another child to avoid blame and/or put the blame on another child. To avoid this situation happening, explain to your child the benefits of owning up to their mistakes. For example, a benefit of opening up to your mistake is encouragement from the adult for making the right decision.Tell your child to come to you anytime they think they have done something they are not supposed to do, or if they feel guilty about something.
It is tattling if the child blames their sibling for breaking a toy knowing that their sibling didn’t break the toy.

, An urgent problem does not have to involve danger. An urgent problem could involve a wide variety of situations. For example, it is an urgent problem if one child has taken another child’s lunchbox. No one is in danger, but the problem needs to be solved as soon as possible.Keep in mind that urgent problems are different to adults and children. Talk to your children about what types of urgent problems they should come to you with. An urgent problem to a child may be that their brother took the ball from them. A child doesn’t need to come to you with that problem. A child should, however, come to you if their brother stole the ball and rolled it into the road.

, This does not necessarily mean that the child has bad intentions. For instance, the child may be feeling that they aren’t getting enough attention. Or, the child may want gain popularity with their friends and/or classmates. The child may come to you over something that even they should know is not worth tattling about. Speak to your child about other, healthier ways to get the attention they desire. This may happen when your child sees an opportunity to get praise for telling on another child. For example, if a child sees another child cutting in line, they may think that an adult would be happy with them for knowing the rules.
A healthier way to get attention from their peers is by showing interest in an activity the other children are taking part in.

, Children do not yet have the ability both mentally and physically to solve all situations by themselves. A child may come to you with a situation that is neither dangerous nor urgent, but can’t be solved by themselves. An example of this is when one child throws another child’s ball on the roof of a building. It isn’t dangerous, but the child shouldn’t handle it alone., Reporting turns into tattling when a child comes to the adults with situations that can be solved without an adult. It is natural for a child to feel nervous about handling a potentially stressful situation alone, but it is important for them to learn how to do it. Decide what situations you think the child should be able to handle and talk with them about it.A child can handle someone cutting in front of them at the water fountain. A child can’t handle it if this repeatedly happens with physical force.

, Talk with your child about situations that involve both tattling and reporting. If a child comes to you in a situation where they are reporting, give them positive reinforcement by explaining to them what they have done right. During instances of tattling, explain to them why they don’t need to come to you, and what they could do to solve the situation on their own.For instance, one situation where telling is not necessary is when a child tattles to you about their sibling sneaking a cookie. Explain to them why it is not their responsibility to come to you with this information unless asked to do so.

, Think of situations that may come up in and outside of school. A few situations in school might be bullying, cutting in line, and stealing. Outside of school, the child might have to deal with a stranger coming up to them, temptation to do something inappropriate, or a confrontation with another child. Come up with a specific problem, place, and people. Tell the concrete example as if it were a story. Ask the child to decide whether or not to come to an adult with the problem.For example, Sarah touched Fred’s lunchbox at school when she wasn’t supposed to. Should he tell an adult about this problem? Probably not.
Another example would be, Sarah took Fred’s lunchbox and won’t give it back. Should he tell an adult about this problem? Yes, she should.

, If you are having trouble making the difference between reporting and tattling clear, try acting out different scenarios. For example, role play a situation where a child is calling another child a mean name. See how the child you are role-playing with reacts and guide them through the hypothetical scenario., You should not expect children to immediately and fully understand the difference between telling and tattling. If the child still tattles, gently remind them why they are tattling and how to solve the problem on their own next time. Over time, the child will learn when they are coming to you with a problem that they can’t solve on their own., Teach the child how to speak to an adult when they think there is a problem. They should know that it is not appropriate to loudly tell on someone in the middle of class. Tell the child to politely ask to speak to an adult privately. From there, tell them how to calmly explain the situation and ask for help.Let your children which adults are appropriate to approach. For example, a teacher or friend’s parent is okay to approach, but it is not okay to walk up to a stranger.
If there is immediate danger, tell the child that it is okay to tell the nearest adult what is happening.

, Teach your child to stop and assess the problem before coming to an adult. If there is danger, like someone is hurt, then the child should immediately find help. When danger isn’t present, the child should take a moment to figure out if they can solve the problem without the help of an adult., Stress to the child that it is okay to come to you if they aren’t confident about handling the problem on their own. Even if the child thinks the situation isn’t dangerous, tell them that it is okay to come to you with their concerns. It isn’t tattling or telling—it is simply getting help trying to solve the problem.Tell the child that they should first think the problem through before coming to you for assistance.

Teach them how to sort dirty laundry.,
Help them load the washing machine.,
Show them how to add detergent.,
Teach them how to operate the washer.,
Show children how to wash clothing by hand.",How to Teach Your Children to Do Laundry1," Here’s where sortable bins come into play. A set of three or more bins gives children a place to separate whites, darks, jeans, and other articles you don’t want to mix. This can also be done in the laundry area, but bins simplify the task for younger children. As you teach them to sort, you can begin explaining why you need to separate the clothing.At first, small children won’t understand why you separate the clothing. Stay patient with them. Explain it as many times as needed as they grow.
Teach them to care for specialty clothing, too. For example, you may not want to wash formal clothing every week. Lycra needs a cold wash and should be done separately.
Sorting is a good time to teach them additional steps, such as zipping up zippers, clearing out pockets, and reading labels.;
, Let the kids throw in the clothing you plan on washing. Teach them the proper load size for your machine. You wouldn’t want to have them stuff in so much clothing that the washer overflows.The proper load size is three-fourths full for a heavy load.

, Before you let them press buttons, remind them to check the detergent level. Show them where to find the detergent tray and how much to add to it. Younger children will have a hard time pouring detergent themselves, so detergent pods are a great alternative.Be aware that detergent pods such as Tide PODS can be dangerous. Some kids have swallowed the pods, thinking they are food. Teach your kids the pods aren’t to be eaten and store the pods in a safe spot up high when not in use.

, At last, it is time to explain the machine’s functions. Washing machines can be complex, and most adults only use a few functions on a regular basis. Start with a normal wash cycle and work your way up to the uncommon functions. Select one load type, such as dark clothing, and show the children which buttons they need to press to wash it. Explain the buttons to them as you go along. Don’t overload them by explaining multiple processes at once.Label the buttons with permanent black marker or stickers. That way, children will have a quick reminder of what the buttons do.
If you are worried, you can let them practice with less valuable clothing. Stay with them until you feel confident they understand what they’re doing, but don’t discourage them. Calmly explain any mistakes they make.
With gradual teaching, children will be capable of handling the machine around age eight.

, Some clothing, such as Lycra items, do better in the sink, but ordinary clothing can also be hand-washed. Read the clothing labels with the child for directions. Help them put a small amount of water in the sink and mix it with the proper amount of detergent. Show them how to swirl the clothing around in the soapy water without scrubbing or twisting. They’ll never be lost without a washing machine!"
"
Have them move the clothing to the dryer.,
Show them the lint catcher.,
Let them add the dryer sheet.,
Teach them how to operate the dryer.,
Show them how to dry clothing by hand.",How to Teach Your Children to Do Laundry2," Let kids move wet clothing themselves. This is a step that any child can do. Since young children can participate, you can make laundry fun to do together as a family. It can even be a good idea to start children on dryer duty before teaching them the more complicated wash cycle., Pull up the lint catcher. Remember that a clean lint catcher helps the dryer work better. You may explain this to kids. Don’t forget to tell them to clean off the lint and replace the catcher before each cycle. Remind them to do this until they remember it for themselves., If you use dryer sheets, have them throw one in before the cycle begins. Young children can do this too. Fabric softener may be used instead, but this can be a bit challenging for younger kids to handle on their own.

Dryer sheets and fabric softener soften clothes, add a pleasant scent, and reduce static. Using them is not mandatory, however.

, Start off with a normal drying cycle. Explain to children what the buttons do and which ones they need to press. Work your way up to more uncommon options like permanent press or low heat cycles. Don’t give them too much information at once.Like with the washing machine, label the dryer buttons with permanent black marker or stickers. It may prevent you from a costly repair bill for a broken knob.

, Read the drying labels together. Show the child how to squeeze out excess water without wringing. Delicate clothing does best when rolled up in a towel and gently squeezed. Otherwise, hang up clothing you wish to air dry.An accordion-style folding rack is a great tool for younger children who aren’t tall enough to reach a clothesline.

"
"
Have them sort out the clothing.,
Teach them how to fold clothing.,
Help them store their clothing.",How to Teach Your Children to Do Laundry3," Once the clothing is out of the dryer, it needs to be sorted. At first, help younger kids do this. Teach them what shirts go together, what pants go together, and so on. This can be done in their room on the bed. Loads with clothing from many family members may also be sorted in the laundry room with stackable plastic bins.All family members can help with this part. It’s usually the most tedious and labor-intensive one. Do it together and it’ll be more bearable for everyone.

, Early on, folding will be difficult. Children ages three and four can start with folding socks and towels. Around age five, they can put away their own clothes but won’t have a grasp on proper folding technique. That’s okay. Teach them at their own pace. As long as they make the effort, you’re teaching them in the long run.

, The final step is to get the clothing back where it belongs instead of on the floor. For younger children, first show them where you want their clothing to go. Do matching socks go in the top drawer? What hangs in the closet? Try labeling the drawers with stickers. Soon enough they’ll be able to put everything away on their own!

Older children may have a sense of how to organize the clothes for themselves. Still, they may still appreciate hearing suggestions on how to do this better.

Make the laundry area child-friendly.,
Have young children participate with safe tasks.,
Make laundry fun for older kids.,
Encourage teenagers to be more independent.",How to Teach Your Children to Do Laundry4," Adjust the laundry process to make it easier for children. Get a small step stool so that younger children can see what you’re doing and reach the top of the machines. Purchase a set of small, plastic, stackable laundry bins. Kids can use these to sort clothing in their room and carry the bins to the laundry room without difficulty.Keeping the laundry area organized is important. Store laundry cleaners up high so young children can’t reach them while unsupervised. Clear off shelves so heavy objects won’t fall on heads. Keep clutter off the ground so no one trips. It’ll keep kids safe.

, It’s best to start young. Get children involved early when they’re curious and will find fun in doing laundry with you. Before age two, take them with you into the laundry room. After that, start them out with simple tasks like picking up dirty clothing and moving wet clothing to the dryer. You’ll notice that doing laundry becomes a habit for them.Teach children under two years old to put dirty laundry in a hamper. At age three, encourage them to fold and store small items like socks. Patiently increase responsibility a little every year. Around age eight, they’ll be capable of handling the machines.The laundry responsibilities you offer a child depend on age and trust. Some children develop faster than others.
Watching an older sibling do the laundry can also encourage younger children.

, Kids near the end of their preteen years and beginning of their teenage years require different motivation to start. Make participation a requirement, but don’t badger them. Instead, say something like, “You’ll get to control these fancy appliances.” Many kids will enjoy the control they have when caring for themselves.

Keep laundry fun and lighthearted. Working as a family and laughing together helps take the nuisance out of the work.
It’s useful to break down the parts for children. Separate washing, drying, and putting away clothes. Consider taking breaks between parts or dividing up the chore. It’ll make doing laundry feel a lot more manageable.

, Stubborn teenagers require more persuasion. Sit down and talk with them. Explain to them in a calm, non-confrontational manner why you want them to do their laundry. Tell them, “I will show you how to be more independent” or “I need you to take this household responsibility for me.” If you’ve never shown them how to use the machines, take them into the laundry room and explain the process to them.

Don’t get upset over mistakes at first. It’s better to forgive and give them confidence.
If they don’t care about taking over their share of the laundry, then you may have to try refusing to do it for them. Tell them calmly that you can’t do it for them forever, and that no one else in your home will do it if they don’t.

Teach basic social interaction.,
Give your children permission to disagree.,
Encourage your child to listen.,
Discuss rude behavior after it occurs.",How to Teach Kids to Disagree Respectfully1," If you want your children to learn to disagree respectfully, start with basic social interaction. If children know how to respect others in normal conversation, they can carry that respect into disagreements.Talk about simple manners. Teach your child how to say things like ""Please"" and ""Thank you."" Praise your child for remembering their manners.
Explain to your children empathy and manners help others feel respected. Ask them to put themselves in another person's shoes. For example, ""Don't you feel better when someone says 'please' when they want you to do something?""
Let your kids know that they can't let their emotions control their actions. Say something like, ""It's always okay to feel mad or frustrated, but you need to treat people with respect even if you're upset."" Encourage children to do things like take deep breaths and count backwards from 10 when they get mad instead of lashing out at others.;
, Children often get hostile during disagreements because they don't know how to disagree. Let your child know it's okay to disagree with others in a respectful manner. This will help your child have a script to fall back on when a disagreement arises.Let your child know how they can disagree. Teach them to adopt phrases like, ""Can I explain my feelings?"" or ""Here's how I feel about that."" You can also let your child know they can politely say, ""I disagree.""
Model these kinds of phrases when disagreeing with those around you. Children learn a lot by observing adult behavior.

, Disagreement is inevitable and your child will need to learn to listen and compromise. Let your child know that, while their perspective is important, they should also be willing to listen to the perspectives of others.Teach your child to abandon distractions when someone is talking. Have your child put down their video games when you're talking to them, for example, and encourage them to make eye contact. Explain that this helps the other person know they are important and being heard.
You can try role playing activities to teach your child listening skills. It can be particularly fun for a child to learn what not to do. For example, you can talk and encourage your child to play the role of the interrupter. Afterwards, ask questions like, ""Can you see how interrupting is disruptive?""

, If your child was rude, it's important to let them know. However, if a child is very upset and acting out, this is not always the best moment to intervene. Wait until your child is calm and then explain why the behavior was disrespectful.For example, if your child throws a tantrum in the grocery store when you tell them they cannot get a toy, wait until you're home and your child is relaxed to address the issue. Say something like, ""I know you were upset back there, but you told me by yelling and kicking. Can you tell me how you were feeling using your words?""
Follow up by saying, ""Next time, can you tell me using your words instead of yelling or kicking?""

"
"
Remind children disagreements are not personal.,
Have children use ""I"" statements during disagreements.,
Help your child stay calm.,
Have your child listen.,
Encourage your child to make amends after conflicts occur.",How to Teach Kids to Disagree Respectfully2," Children often personalize disagreements. If someone does not agree with them, they may feel the person is picking on them or does not like them. Make sure to explain to children they do not need to take disagreements as personal slights.Tell children that, when they disagree, they're mad at an idea, concept, or opinion. They are not mad at the person.
Remind your child everyone is entitled to their own opinion. If someone disagrees with them, it's probably not personal. They just have a different take on a given situation or issue.

, ""I"" statements are statements phrased in a way to avoid blame and judgment. Teaching your children to talk using ""I"" statements can help them disagree in a respectful fashion. ""I"" statements have three parts. They begin with, ""I feel..."" after which you immediately state your feelings. From there, describe the behavior that inspired those feelings. Then you say why you feel the way you do.Finally, ask them to propose a solution or compromise.


For example, a child is fighting with their sibling over a shared room. The child may say something like, ""You know I have a lot of homework on Mondays and it's rude that you play your guitar in our room during that time.""
Have your child rephrase that sentiment using an ""I"" statement. For example, ""I feel disrespected when you play your guitar when I'm trying to study because you know how important my grades are to me. Can you play after I'm done studying or go into another room?""

, Children often have difficulty regulating their emotions. When a disagreement surfaces, help your child stay calm during the conflict. Children may get angry or feel passionate. During these times, encourage your children to remember to stay calm.Teach your child to recognize messages from their body that indicate they might be getting frustrated. Do they start clenching their fists or does their face feel hot when they get frustrated? Helping your child identify these signals means they can use calming techniques before they lose control.
Help your children learn techniques to stay calm. Have your child, for example, take a series of deep breaths, count to 10, or make an effort to relax their bodies. You can also remind a child to take a break from a discussion if they're getting worked up. For example, say something like, ""You seem to be getting upset. Would you like to talk about this later?""
Teach your child they sometimes have to be a bigger person. If a friend or family member is yelling or disrespecting them, tell your child to walk away instead of getting mad in return.

, Make sure your child knows to listen if they're having a disagreement with another person. Tell your child that listening can help them understand another person's point of view, allowing them to resolve a conflict.Tell your child not to interrupt when another person shares their feelings. Say something like, ""You had your turn to share. Now let your brother share.""
Let your child know it's okay if they still disagree after listening. However, make it clear listening is important to resolving a conflict. Tell your child that they should listen to other person and then respectfully voice any disagreements instead of interrupting or yelling.

, If your child has a conflict with a friend, family member, or sibling, encourage them to make up afterwards. Being willing to apologize and move forward is key to respectful disagreements.Ask questions like, ""What do you think would make your brother feel better about your fight?"" Encourage children to explore options like apologizing or doing something nice for the other person.

Model good behavior.,
Be willing to listen to your child.,
Address rudeness as it occurs.,
Praise your child for positive behavior.",How to Teach Kids to Disagree Respectfully3," Remember, your child pays attention to what you're doing. If you show respect when disagreeing with others, your child will follow your example.Always be respectful when disagreeing with your spouse, friends, or family members. Remember to do things like use ""I"" statements and allow the other person to talk.

, You need to show your child they can disagree with you respectfully as well. If your child is upset about one of your rules or regulations, allow the child to voice their objections in a respectful manner.Do not interrupt your child when they're speaking. Acknowledge what they've said after they're done talking.
Being the parent, you cannot always let your child have their way if you disagree. However, you should always show them you're taking their perspective into account. For example, ""I understand you want to stay up a little later, but I think it's important you get enough sleep for your health.""

, Minor disrespect and rudeness should be addressed in the moment. You want to occasionally remind your child how to be respectful of others. For example, say something like, ""That's not how we talk to other people"" if your child is aggressively arguing with a sibling or friend., Children need to know when they've done something right. If your child shows respect to someone, tell them so. For example, ""I appreciate how you agreed to let John play his guitar after you finished studying. It's good that you listened to his point of view even though you were frustrated with him."""
"
Acknowledge the child’s struggle.,
Explain why the child has to wait.,
Provide praise for patient behavior.,
Let children practice patience every day.,
Use a timer.,
Choose the right time to practice patience.,
Be reasonable with your expectations for waiting.",How to Teach Kids Patience1," Let your child know that patience isn’t easy and that what they are doing is difficult. You can even help them learn how to verbalize this difficulty and their frustrated emotions. This can help them understand that waiting is hard for everyone, not just them.For example, you might say, “I understand that it is difficult to wait. I know you feel frustrated. You are doing a good job being patient.”
Remember that children often struggle with delayed gratification. Helping a child express their emotions can help reduce this sense of frustration. Teach your child that while they may need to wait, their feelings are always valid.;
, Your child may be impatient because they don’t understand there are things that go on outside of what they want right that moment. Telling them to “stop” or “be quiet” when you are in the middle of something may not teach them patience. However, explaining why they need to be patient for a few minutes can help teach them that sometimes they have to wait.You can tell your child, “I cannot get you a juice box right now. I am in the middle of a conversation. Sometimes, people have to finish what they are doing before they can help you. Wait until I am finished, and I will help you.”

, When your child is patient, let them know that they have done something good. This is just as important when your child is being patient without having to be told told. Praising them for waiting calmly helps reinforce the behavior.For example, if your child draws calmly while waiting for food at a restaurant or while sitting in a waiting room, let them know you are proud of their patient behavior.

, Children are not going to naturally be good at patience. They have to practice it and get used to not getting what they want when they want it. You can help teach them patience by letting them practice the skill every day.Every day, try saying “Wait” to your child when they ask for something. You can make them wait a few minutes at first, but then make them wait longer or for more things throughout the day as they learn patience.
Older children may benefit from daily meditation. You can teach your child meditation techniques using videos, apps, or soothing music., A timer may be a good way to teach your young child about patience. You can use a sand or number timer, which gives your child something to watch as they wait. It helps them learn that there is an end to their waiting, which helps them understand that it doesn’t last forever.Timers can also help them feel in control of their patience and waiting. It helps them understand that when the timer is finished, they will have their request addressed.

, Sometimes, it is not the right time to make your child wait. Hungry, tired, and cranky toddlers may not be able to be distracted or practice their waiting skills. Try not to practice patience skills around nap or meal times., The amount of time your child can wait may vary based on their age. Older children will probably have an easier time waiting than younger ones. Don’t expect your child to sit through long movies patiently. However, you can expect them to wait a few minutes for you to finish a conversation or task.Most children can reasonably wait for a few seconds or minutes. The more they practice this and get used to waiting, the longer they will be able to wait.

"
"
Teach the child how to distract themselves.,
Try doing tasks together that require patience.,
Play games.,
Avoid using technology.",How to Teach Kids Patience2," Children won’t just sit there and wait for something to happen. Instead, they need to learn how to engage themselves in other ways while they wait. They may distract themselves by playing, singing a song, or dancing in a mirror.You can help reinforce this habit by saying to your child, “We have to wait to do that. Why don’t you sing this song or play with your toys for now?”

, You can also teach patience through hands on activities. By having your small child go through the process of creating something before they get the end result, you can help teach them patience and how to wait for the results.For example, try buying toys that you and your child can put together, like Legos or model cars. Not being able to play with the toy until they have put it together can help teach patience.
Baking is another way to make patience into an activity. Bake a cake with your child and let them help measure and mix ingredients.
Fishing can help you bond with your child while teaching them how to wait for the fish to bite.

, You can teach toddlers how to be patient by playing games with them. It’s hard for toddlers to be patient because of their age, so games can help distract them and teach them how to deal with waiting.Play physical games with them, like having them march in place, sway like a tree in the wind, or play patty cake.
Play knowledge games by giving them categories and having them give examples from that category.

, Some parents just give their children tablets or video games to keep them distracted. This doesn’t teach children how to entertain themselves without technology or learn how to focus. Instead, it reduces patience and decreases their attention span. Teaching patience without technology can help a child learn skills to cope with waiting in life."
"
Delay responding to your child’s requests.,
Refer to the sequence of events instead of time.,
Attend to your child’s request after the waiting period.,
Avoid giving into your child’s whining.,
Model patience.",How to Teach Kids Patience3," Another way to teach patience is by not responding to questions and requests immediately. Just like when your child is whining, you can wait to do something for them or answer them. This helps your child understand that they may also have to wait when they’re not upset. It also helps them realize they are not the center of everything.If your child comes into the room and asks you to come see something, calmly say, “I will be there in a few moments.”
If you are cooking dinner and your child asks for something, nicely explain that when you and others are busy, they have to wait. Try saying, “I am cooking dinner right now, which means I cannot do that for you. I will help you with that as soon as I am finished.”

, Small children don’t really understand the concept of time, so saying “ten minutes” may not help them understand how long they need to wait. You can use sequences to help them understand the process of waiting.For example, instead of saying “dinner is in 10 minutes,” try saying, “dinner will be ready after the chicken is finished cooking.”
You can also say, “We will go to the store, then have lunch, and then you can play.” This gives the child a sequence of events so they know what they are waiting for.

, Having the request met after waiting is important for teaching your child patience. You want to teach them that being patient has positive rewards. This reinforces positive behaviors with your attention and help as their reward. If they don’t get any reward for their patience, it will teach that patience doesn’t result in anything.For example, if your child plays patiently until you get off the phone, make sure you go see them and find out what they needed while you were on the phone. If you told them you would get them a juice box after you finished dinner, make sure you follow through.

, Many parents will do something for their child if they start whining or complaining. This reinforces instant results instead of patience. Instead, try to avoid dropping everything when your child whines, interrupts you, or says that they are bored.For example, if your child interrupts you when you are on the phone, don’t get off the phone or stop your conversation. Instead say, “I am on the phone. Wait until I get finished.”

, Kids learn by watching others. If you are patient, then they will pick up on your habits. Try not to snap at your children when you are impatient. Listen to your child when they talk and don’t get impatient and start doing other things. That models negative behaviors.Try to be patient with your child when they are in the middle of doing something. If you can, let them finish an activity before requiring them to do something else. For example, you may allow your child to finish coloring a page they are almost finished with before they get ready for bed.
Try to avoid doing more than one task at a time. By avoiding multitasking, you are showing your child how to focus and complete one activity at a time.

Screen assignments based on your child's maturity.,
Make choices based on your child's personality.,
Avoid assigning undesirable chores.,
Tailor assignments for their attention span.,
Get creative and playful.",How to Decide on Age Appropriate Chores for Your Child1," When thinking about ""age appropriateness,"" a factor that has to be considered is a child's mental age and not just the number of years they've been alive. Some 12 year olds can be very mature for their age and might be capable of looking after a younger sibling while you're in another room, while some 15 year olds might be too flaky to be trusted with feeding a pet turtle. Asking yourself questions about your child's mental maturity is an important assessment to make. The following are some example questions you can ask yourself:Does my child follow the house rules even if I'm not there, like not going outside by themselves or not answering the door if it's a stranger?
Does my child know how to use the phone and how and when to call a neighbor or an emergency number?
Does my child understand the consequences of their actions, like if they say rude words or talk back?
Does my child generally make responsible choices, like independently cleaning up their own messes?
Does my child seem confident about working independently, or do they need me to help with their homework and anything complicated or new?;
, Rather than thinking about chores as being ""one-size-fits-all"" by age, consider that even young children have preferences that make them unique. Some tasks may suit their personalities more than others quite naturally.For example, if Billy likes animals, and Suzy likes to work by herself in the kitchen, then Billy might enjoy feeding and brushing the dog, and Suzy might like doing the dishes and setting the table. Ask yourself questions like the following:


Does my child enjoy being outdoors or indoors more?
Does my child like to be sedentary or do they like to be active?
Does my child like a daily routine or do they get bored and need variety?
Has my child ever shown an interest in learning something I was doing, like cooking dinner or gardening?
Does my child have any particular interests that would make certain chores more appealing than others, like building things out of toys, painting, or even playing house?

, While you obviously can't let a child opt out of every chore, some children dislike cleaning toilets due to the perceived grossness of the task, and others may dislike vacuums due to the noise or the heaviness of the machine. Think back to your interactions with your child; if they've ever made complaints about about being assigned these chores in the past, redistribute accordingly.


Getting your child's feedback on chores they prefer might seem like it takes some of the power in the relationship away from you the parent, but this technique has been proven to increase levels of cooperation and amicability.If your child simply does not want to do any chores, some kind of reward or points system leading up to earning a prize might be needed to incentivize chores. Earning a trip to the ice cream parlor or monetizing chore completion with an allowance may be helpful.

, Children generally have a much shorter attention span than most people realize. Research suggests that a child's age is the number of minutes you can expect a young child to be able to concentrate on a single task. Children 6 and 7 years old can only maintain concentration on a task that takes 30 minutes to complete if they are actually interested in it.To help keep your child engaged, you may need to make a game of it: a race to see how fast the spoons can all be put away, for example, or getting a sticker/point on a prize graph for every small trash can collected around the house.

, Try using music, dance, and even pretend to make dull chores more exciting. You can easily dance while mopping, vacuuming, and putting dishes away. You could pretend you're robots, fancy maids and butlers, or even undercover agents pretending to clean while really you're trying to spy on someone."
"
Decide based on your child's height.,
Assign housework based on strength.,
Pick routines around your child's general health.,
Select jobs that account for coordination difficulties.",How to Decide on Age Appropriate Chores for Your Child2," A lot of factors go into a child's height, one of which is age. Children who are younger and shorter may find it more difficult to complete tasks that require them to get very high, like dusting the top shelves of book cases or blinds. Similarly, children who are older and taller may have to stoop to perform tasks like scrubbing baseboards or picking weeds.

, A child's strength is affected by a lot of factors much in the same way that height is, including age; as your child grows, their core muscle strength will improve. However, until around the time they are 11, generally speaking, children tend to be much weaker than they are as adolescents or teenagers.When assigning tasks to your children, consider their muscles' limitations.


If you ask an 8 year old to push a heavy lawn mower or try to walk an excitable 60 lb dog, chances are that your child will not be able to complete the task satisfactorily. Instead, pick tasks that don't require a great deal of muscle strength, like folding clothes and towels or watering the lawn with a hose.

, From time to time, children will become ill. At those times, you will want to lighten their overall load and avoid anything very strenuous like vacuuming or mopping to promote healing. It's also important to account for chronic conditions like severe allergies to pollen or grass or mental disorders like ADD that make completing certain tasks difficult. Doing so will reduce potential frustration and stress for both you and your child.


If your child has intense allergies, try to assign them chores that won't expose them to dust, pollen, grass, and other potential triggers, like mowing the lawn, dusting blinds, or picking weeds. Instead, consider chores that won't expose them to allergens like doing the laundry, doing dishes, and taking out the trash.
If your child has a disorder that compromises their ability to concentrate, consider assigning a series of small tasks that they can complete quickly but potentially do many times throughout an evening, like folding socks, taking out the garbage, and making beds. Consider too being more lenient about the time it takes them to finish their chores and encourage them to take breaks for their busy minds before returning to the assignment.

, Children continue to develop and fine tune their motor skills all the way up until they are roughly eight years old.However, somewhere between 6-8% of kids have developmental difficulties that effect their coordination.Take this into account when assigning tasks to your children.


If Tommy has difficulties gripping things, you won't want him unloading the breakable dishes from the dishwasher or dealing with anything sharp. Instead, have him perform tasks where there is no risk of breaking things or injuries, like making the bed or folding clothes.

Compile a master list of daily household chores.,
Determine the amount of time available for chores.,
Add in teaching time for each chore.,
Remove tasks that will take too long.,
Break down large tasks into smaller ones.,
Delegate with equality in mind.,
Mark off any dangerous tasks.,
Have a conversation about the final list.",How to Decide on Age Appropriate Chores for Your Child3," Make a list of the various tasks that you would like help with. Estimate how much time you believe it will take to complete each task. Remember that your children will probably perform their work duties much slower than you would, and it will take more time for your child to accomplish the task than if it was you doing it.

, Although children do generally have more free time than adults, most of them have other responsibilities that will reduce the amount of time available for them to do chores. These can include day care, school, clubs, sports, art, and musical commitments among many others. You will need to take into account both the daily and weekly schedules that will tax your child's time and energy and be sure not to overload them, and you may have to periodically adjust them for busier times of the year like midterms and finals.


Remember that children should still have some free time to engage in independent reading, play, and even rest outside of sleeping.

, Many parents are unprepared for the amount of time that it takes to teach a child to independently perform chores. Until your child is 10 years old, they will most likely be unable or unwilling to do many daily chores we take for granted without prompting.Even if you are very busy with work and while at home, you will still have to make the time to teach and supervise.


Don't make the mistake of thinking that because you have frequently performed a chore in front of your child they will know how to do it. Take the time to demonstrate, step-by-step, how any given task is performed before inviting them to do it with you, and follow that up with stepping back to let them do it on their own while you watch and correct mistakes and praise successes., Once you have figured out both the amount of time for a child to perform the task and how much time you will have to commit to training/supervising, it's time to remove any tasks that exceed the amount of time available for a child to perform those tasks. If you know that painting the deck of your house will take many hours to complete, then asking your child to perform it on a school night when you don't have the time to supervise will likely not lead to satisfactory results for anyone.

, Big tasks can be time consuming, feel vague, and even overwhelming. Especially when working with children who may not know what you mean by ""clean your room,"" you should try to be as clear as possible and break down the large task into multiple smaller ones. Turn ""clean your bedroom"" into ""make your bed,"" ""pick up your toys,"" ""put your clothes in the dirty hamper,"" ""take the dirty clothes to the laundry room,"" and so on and so forth.By turning a large task into a smaller one, you may be able to get a larger task accomplished after all, especially by giving your child multiple days to complete the mini-steps.

, If you have multiple children, you will want them to be responsible for their own personal chores, but it is possible to divide the various household chores for common areas like the kitchen, living room, and yards amongst them, even if some of them are younger and can't help as much.


It's also advisable to make a point of taking a few chores for yourself and making sure that the children know that these are your chores. Children will be more likely to perform chores if they see you leading by example, but they might also take for granted the work you do if it's not apparent.
Remember to make this a group effort: a good way to make your child more receptive to chores is to make them feel like they are contributing to something greater than themselves and functioning as a part of the group.Try to perform your tasks so that you're all working together in the same area and collaborating, such as them picking up their toys while you vacuum and the other parent dusts furniture.

, Young children should not be working anywhere near sharp objects, from great heights, or using chemicals that they could possibly end up ingesting (remember, very small kids like to stick things in their mouths and aren't always great about washing their hands).


Children under 14 shouldn't be operating heavy or potentially dangerous equipment like tractors or riding lawn mowers without adult supervision.Similarly, young teenagers and tweens should not babysit younger children without an adult present in the house: imagine what could happen if there was an emergency and the baby needed to go to the hospital but there was no one to take them.
Depending on the country you live in, it may be considered illegal to leave a child 12 years or younger without adult supervision; similarly, if you employ a child under 18 years old to babysit and something bad happens, you might be considered liable in the event of a crisis.Remember, children tend to be clumsier than adults and the leading cause of deaths for children ages 1-18 is unintentional injury., This is the point at which you will be informing your children of the tasks that you expect them to be able to handle. However, instead of seeming authoritarian about the situation, invite them to have input at this stage and explain why it's important they help. Make it into a conversation that they feel they have some choices in and that there is value to the work being done.


Try saying something like, ""Evan, your father/mother and I are busy working every day. So we feel like we could use more help around the house. From now on, we want you to help us by feeding Snowball, picking up your toys, and helping me fold the laundry. On the weekends when you have more time, we want you to also help water the flowers. We're going to show you how to do it and help you.""
If your child protests or says they don't want to do something, respond with something like the following: ""Okay. We thought that you would like to water the flowers, but if you don't want to do that, okay. What would you like to do instead?""
After presenting them with the idea of having a choice, be sure to follow that up with specific alternatives. ""You can either help with dusting the furniture downstairs or doing the laundry. Which would you prefer?""

Make art part of the routine.,
Don't teach.,
Make observations.,
Ask open-ended questions.,
Make art part of emotional processing.,
Affirm pre-writing.,
Display and save their drawings.",How to Teach Kids How to Draw1," Incorporate art-making into playtime. Make an art-zone if you want to isolate the mess. Tape down paper for them to draw on and spill on, and make a smock out of old clothes. Taping paper on a table can help a small child focus on the motion of drawing, without having to hold down and adjust the drawing paper. Buy chunky crayons and washable markers that are easy to grip.Children will begin their drawing by scribbling. Around 2 years of age, the scribbles will become more controlled and repetitive, and children may begin to grip crayons and markers between their thumb and pointer finger for more control.
Offer a variety of art materials at this age. Don't focus only on drawing with tools: children can draw by tracing pictures in sand, or shaping clay and sticking it on the page. Buy washable paints, nontoxic clay, chalk, child-safe scissors, and many kinds of paper, and store in an easy to access spot.;
, Children develop basic motor skills with every scribble. They also develop creativity, invention, and self-expression. A child this young needs no instructions, only appreciation. Sit with children when they draw, talk with them about their art, but do not attempt to teach.Avoid the impulse to correct. Small children may paint purple grass, floating people, and babies the size of houses. If you correct them you will damage their self-confidence and interrupt their natural learning progress.

, Rather than praising or correcting a child's art, observe it. Comment on the process, not the product. While the child draws, say ""look at all the circles you are making! Some small circles are inside the big circles"" or ""I see you are using orange and green crayons now."" Say what you like about a drawing: ""that big sun makes me think of a day at the beach!"" or ""I like how all the trees have different colored leaves."", Avoid asking ""what is it?"" when presented with a drawing. Instead, ask ""can you tell me about your drawing?"" If a child is excited to talk about their drawing, ask more questions. A child may begin to add more details when you ask questions. When a child is drawing representational work, they will often imagine a story that goes with the work. Asking them to tell you more details of their story will encourage them to draw more details.If you ask ""what does the girl smell,"" for example, they are more likely to add a nose. If you ask ""is the dog lonely at night?"" they may draw more animals. This kind of exchange encourages imagination, story-telling abilities, and drawing skills., If a child is experiencing a strong emotion, offer them paper and markers, or some clay. If a child is having a tantrum, suggest they make an angry picture. If they are sad, a sad one. Art can help children process intense emotions that may be too complex for them to put in words. Giving a child a creative activity over which they have sovereignty can help them gain a sense of control., Around 2 ½ to 3 ½ years of age, children will begin drawing squiggles meant to represent words. These drawings are a child's first steps toward writing. As they grow, the squiggles will become more complex. A child may begin to vary short and long squiggles, or draw letter-like shapes mixed up with real letters. These drawings are an exciting sign that a child understands that words can be written to communicate meaning.Children are likely to tell you that certain squiggles ""mean"" something, or ask you to read them aloud. Affirm the meaning of the squiggles that are read to you, and ask for help reading the others.
Let children use the texts they produce. Bring them to the post office to mail their ""letters"" (with an accompanying note) to relatives, Santa, or themselves.

, Putting children's art up is a way of letting them know their work is interesting and important. Rather than praising every individual drawing, display it. You do not have to put up every piece of art: ask each child what they would like displayed, or create a rotating ""gallery"" that changes weekly or monthly. Keep a portfolio of each child's drawings so they can observe their process.


It is more important that a child's practice is affirmed than that their art products are displayed. Displaying final products is no replacement for encouraging the development of their drawing."

Teach your child to practice observation.,
Train them to draw new objects.,
Practice observing shapes.,
Draw without looking down.,
Coach by observing and questioning.,
Focus on one medium at a time.,
Make a book.",How to Teach Kids How to Draw2," Around the age of 5, you can start teaching observational drawing. This involves teaching children how to draw from the appearance of things, rather than their knowledge or imagination of them. To begin training them in observation, teach them to think of their drawings as practice. Say you are learning a new kind of drawing that takes lots of practice, and that they can practice as much as they want.Provide pencils and multiple pieces of paper, and gently discourage eraser use. Say they can start a drawing as many times as they want, and erase false lines when they are done.
Do not force observational drawing on a child. Pushing a child to a new stage of drawing might discourage or stunt their learning.
Affirm other kinds of drawings as well: storytelling and imagination based drawings, abstract or emotional drawings., Around age 5 or 6, children develop schema, or ways of drawing things. Instead of teaching them to observe things they have ""already learned"" how to draw, like houses, a pet, or trees, let them pick something they have never drawn before. This will prevent them from reverting to learned habits, but will not frustrate them by requiring them to ""unlearn"" something they feel they have mastered., Explain that the child will be drawing an object from one side. Have the child sit where they will be when they draw, and trace your finger around the edges of the object as they are visible to the child. Then, have the child trace the edges. Next, ask the child to trace the shape in the air. They can do this with their finger and with their pencil., Encourage children to draw with their eyes on the object they are drawing. Try putting a square of paper on their pencil, above the spot they grip, so that they cannot see the line they make. Have them draw practice lines first. Have them practice drawing each part of the shape separately.


After they have practiced the lines, let them draw the whole shape. Keep the page of practice lines nearby for further practice or reference.Have children practice drawing without ever looking down.
Have children draw and only look down when they have finished drawing a line. Let them check on their progress, but encourage them to look down as little as possible.

, As you would for a younger child, ask open-ended questions, but ask them about what they see rather than what they imagine. Ask ""which part of the object is lighter? Which is darker?"" ""where does the line bend?"" Compliment lines and angles they depicted correctly, and encourage them to find more details.Say ""I see you drew a strong curving stem for the flower, and you shaded a texture into the dirt. Now, do you see any smaller parts at the end of the stem? Where do they start and stop?""
Avoid showing your own drawings of an object, or drawing on a child's paper. Children are hardwired to learn by imitation, but this is not helpful for learning drawing.

, Offer children the chance to practice with different media. Children between 5-8 may be open to drawing with pencils, which will allow them to focus on shading and contour. Show children different materials and allow them to experiment. Suggest phases: first we will draw with a pencil, then with watercolors.

, Children between 5 and 8 enjoy making up stories to go with their drawings. They may be interested in drawing sequences to tell a longer story. Encourage children to draw and write short books. Help them bind the books together with staples or needle and thread. Once the book has been ""published,"" put it on the bookshelf with the rest of their books.

"
"
Focus on spatial issues.,
Teach proportion through portraiture.,
Anticipate the crisis of confidence.,
Set them observation challenges.",How to Teach Kids How to Draw3," Pre-teen children will be especially interested in depicting perspective, foreshortening, and other spatial information. They will begin to draw horizon lines, overlapping objects, and exacting detail. Assign them spatial sequences, such as drawing an object from three different angles. Arrange neutral-colored geometric shapes near one another so they can practice shading.Let them arrange objects in piles and draw them.

, Basic anatomical proportion is one of the hardest things to learn. People tend to see the head as bigger than it is, the eyes as being bigger and higher in the face. Teach children basic anatomical proportions of the face, then give them mirrors and have them draw themselves. Let them take turns posing for one another, and have them draw quick sketches.

, Around age 9, children have a strong desire to draw realistically. They may become frustrated by drawings that do not look ""right."" They may decide they are bad artist. To head off this crisis of confidence, make it clear to them that drawing is a skill that takes practice. Tell them that when they are frustrated it is because they are moving up a level. If they think they are a bad artist, that is because they have learned to see things they couldn't see before.Children around age 11 may wish to give up on drawing. Teaching them age-appropriate skills and encouraging them to try new methods will help them stay motivated.
Enlarge the child's concept of art. One way to head off the decline of a child's artistic practice is to teach them other forms. Drawing abstractions, comics, or design can rekindle the confidence of a child who is stuck on realism.

, Children who have been observing shapes and attempting to draw realistically for a while are ready to unlearn some of the things they have learned, so long as they are not shamed for wrong answers. Bring them to a tree, or pass around pieces of wood, and explain that they are going to observe all the colors in bark. Set them the challenge of drawing a tree without using the color brown, but rather by blending different colored markers to get a real woody color.

Begin by giving your child a dollar.,
Write them a receipt for the “deposit.” Explain that you are the ""bank"" and that they can earn more money if they give you the dollar back to hold.,
Give them a penny for interest each day.,
Show them how much money they have accrued.,
Illustrate the effects of spending.",How to Teach Kids About Compound Interest1," Get a dollar bill and give it to your child. Explain that you are going to teach them about something called interest.Understand that this method doesn’t demonstrate compound interest. The point of this method is to show kids what interest is. Show this to your child first if they are struggling to understand interest.;
, Make sure to explain that they will get their dollar back, along with more money, when the game is over. To make your point, give them a ""receipt"" showing their deposit and current balance ($1.00).


Explain to them that it is important to keep these receipts in a safe place so that they have proof that they have put that money into the “bank.”

, Explain to your child that they will earn a penny for each day you let them hold their dollar. When you deposit a penny, place it in a container that is their “bank account.”If your child doesn’t know about how banks work, be sure to explain what a bank is. Explain that a bank is a place where you can keep your money safe, and that when you put your money in the bank you are agreeing to let the bank use your money, but it will all be there when you need it.

, Explain how to find out how much money is in their bank account. In this case, explain that all they have to do is ask you. At the end of one week (or however many weeks you want to do this demonstration), ask your child to check their balance. Ask them to check their receipts to figure out how much money they have put into the bank. When they do this, then dump out the pennies, and ask them to count the pennies. Explain that the extra pennies are interest that they've earned.Explain that the original seven pennies have grown to eleven pennies (assuming you added one penny every other day) because the bank paid a penny of it’s own into the account as a thank you for allowing them to use your child’s money.

, Ask the child to withdraw some money from the bank account. Demonstrate that this means reducing their balance, meaning that they now have less money in the account. Give them a new receipt showing the balance after the withdrawal.

Set up three jars.,
Put one dollar in the ""principal"" jar.,
Add 10% interest to the contents of the first two jars each day.,
Add to the interest in the interest jar.,
Help your child add up the new total.",How to Teach Kids About Compound Interest2," Compound interest can be thought of as three amounts: the principal, the interest, and the interest earned on interest. Set up three labeled jars to represent the different amounts.

, Add $1.00 to the jar, and explain that you will help them to add 10% interest on what is in the jar to the ""interest"" jar each day. You will also need a way to keep track of how much money is in each jar and the total amount between them as you add money.You can do this for longer if you want. A week should be enough time to show your child how compound interest works.
Keeping the jar in a place where it is in view will keep you both from forgetting about the project.

, On the first day, you will have $1.00 in the jar, so for the second day, ask your child to help you figure out what 10% of $1.00 is. Once they tell you that 10% of $1.00 is 10 cents, add a dime to the interest jar. Ask them to tell you what the new total is. Keeping the interest figure low will present a more realistic idea of what your child could expect to earn from a bank. If you want to, you can also use higher interest rates., Have your child add another dime to the interest jar on the third day. Then, explain to them that 10 percent of the money in the interest jar must be added to the interest on interest jar. Allow them to calculate that this would be 1 cent and add a penny to the interest on interest jar.


On each of the following days you will repeat this process. Have your child count the contents of the jar, and ask them to help you calculate 10% of the total contents of the first two jars.
Remember to total the amount you have on each day. For example, on the third day you now have $1.21.
On the fourth day, you would add another dime to interest and then calculate that 10 percent of the interest jar is now 2 cents. You can then add 2 pennies to interest on interest for a total of $1.33.

, On the eighth day, you and your child can now take down the jar and count up the new total. Be sure to point out that your child has saved up almost 100% of what they put in the jar in the first place. Remind then that only the dollar represents money that they paid in to the ""bank.""Explain to your child that this is a good way to grow their money.

Explain why banks might pay compound interest.,
Talk about what makes compound interest especially valuable.,
Help children understand why they should care about compound interest.",How to Teach Kids About Compound Interest3," When thinking about why a bank should give you money when they are the ones keeping track of your money for you, it is important to remember that you are giving the bank a loan. When you deposit money into the bank the bank is then using your money for its own purposes. Thus, they pay interest to you as a way of thanking you for the loan.Usually, the bank uses your money to make loans to other bank customers. The bank makes money on this by charging higher interest fees on the loans than what they are paying you in interest., Not all accounts will offer compound interest specifically. Compound interest is a great thing because not only does it pay interest on what you put in the account (this is called the principal), it also pays interest on the interest it paid you last time.This makes your money grow faster than if they just paid you interest on the amount you put in the bank and left the extra interest money out of the equation.

, In the society we live in, it’s important for children to learn why it’s important to save money, and how they can do it most effectively. If you give your children an allowance, teaching them to save part of that allowance rather than running to the store to blow it all at once can create good spending habits that will follow them throughout their life.When teaching children about compound interest, make sure that you begin the discussion by talking about what interest is in the first place.
For example, you can say something like, “When you have a bank account, they do their best to keep your money safe. At the same time, though, they take your money and lend it to other people who need it. As a way of saying thank you, banks usually pay you a little bit of money. This is usually a percentage, say 5%. They pay you 5% of whatever you’ve got in your account. So if you have $500 dollars, they pay you an extra $25 just because they appreciate you keeping your money with them.”

",How to Teach Critical Thinking,"


When children begin to make detailed observations about objects or information, they are then able to draw conclusions or make judgments based on those observations.
When a child asks the question ""Why?,"" respond with ""Why do you think?"" to encourage the child to draw his or her own conclusions.
This is the beginning of scientific observation skills that will be useful and necessary throughout life.;
,


This allows children to tell the ways things are similar and different and helps them analyze and categorize information.
A simple example of this activity is to have children compare and contrast an apple and an orange. Allow them to describe all the ways they are similar and different.
Comparing and contrasting stories is another way to encourage critical thinking. Children are analyzing characters, settings, plot and other story elements when they list the way stories are the same and different.

,


Have children ""retell"" a story you have read in their own words. This encourages them to summarize the main ideas of the story instead of just responding to specific questions with facts.
Ask questions that do not have direct answers in the story. This makes the children infer and draw their own conclusions based on their understanding of the story. An example of this would be to ask ""What do you think the author meant when?"" or ""Why do you think the character?"".
Ask the children to analyze character and setting elements in the story. This is a good opportunity to have the child compare and contrast within the story and outside of the story.
Have the children relate the story to their own lives or outside events. This is the beginning important critical thinking skill called synthesizing, where children begin to use the information in new ways and apply it to different ideas.

,


Providing cooperative learning opportunities will help children develop critical thinking skills as they share ideas and learn from each another.
Encourage children to read stories together and share their evaluations of the story. This can spark a healthy debate with older children, in which they must defend their opinions.
Let children explore creatively with common play activities, such as with water, sand or bubbles. Ask them questions about what they are doing.

,


Telling a story without an ending and asking the children to finish the story is another way to encourage critical thinking skills such as synthesis. The children must take the information from the story and creatively compile it, draw conclusions and come up with their own ending.
This can also be done by asking a child ""What do you think happened next?"" on a familiar story that does have an ending, such as a fairy tale.

,


Socrates was famous for teaching critical thinking through questioning. Children are already naturals at questioning, so turn the tables a little and question them back. Take an opposite position and try to get them to defend their opinions on a topic by asking pointed questions.

,,, Discuss the ""appeal to authority"" approach, to assist a person in knowing whether an appeal to authority is real or fallacious. Use a book such as Jill LeBlanc's ""Thinking Clearly: A Guide to Critical Reasoning"". She posits four ways to identify a true appeal to authority; it must meet all four ways to be supported:


The authority must be identified
The authority must be respectable
The matter must be in this authority's field of expertise
The matter must be one on which there is a consensus of experts.

Tell your child what civility is.,
Talk about how civility is on the decline.,
Inform your child of what incivility often leads to.,
Teach your child the importance of politeness.,
Emphasize respect for all persons.,
Discuss how to disagree respectfully.,
Alert your children of when you don’t agree with their behavior.,
Take a stand against bullying.,
Set age-appropriate consequences for unsavory behavior.,
Apologize when you are wrong.,
Show good behavior.,
Teach your children to do chores.,
Model good manners.",How to Teach Civility to Kids," Explain that civility is about treating people with respect. Along with being polite, civility is also listening to others without being rude, even if you don’t agree with them. Civility is also respecting people and treating them properly even if you don’t necessarily get along with them.


You might tell your children that civility is “treating people the way they would want to be treated.” Then, you can discuss scenarios in which civility can be demonstrated. Think, holding doors for others, saying “thank you” after receiving a gift, and showing good sportsmanship after losing a game.;
, It’s not a secret that a majority of children aren’t as polite as they were many years ago. In fact, your child has probably been witness to this. By talking to your children about how civility is disappearing, and how this has had a huge effect on the way the word is, shows just how important it is to treat others with respect.


Give examples of people who treat others with disrespect to show how unattractive the behavior is. Although you will need to base your examples on what is appropriate for your child’s age, you could talk about politicians, celebrities, or even family members who have displayed rude behavior., Being rude to others and treating people with disrespect leads to many things, and most are unpleasant. Explain to your child that not being nice to others not only makes people feel bad about themselves, but can have dangerous consequences, such as being kicked out of school, getting fired from a job, and losing friends. In more extreme circumstances, it can end in violence and even in getting arrested.Give an example, like “If Mary was using the scissors to cut out her hearts, and you snatched them away to cut out yours, how do you think Mary would feel?” Answers may include “mad” or “sad.” Then, you might explain how this could ruin their friendship with Mary.
However, politely asking Mary, “Can I borrow the scissors when you are finished?” shows good manners and patience.

, In order to help your children understand what it means to be civil, instruct them on how to be polite. You can demonstrate politeness by reminding them to use manners like ""Excuse me"" or ""Thank you"" in everyday interactions.


Encourage them to practice minding their manners during playtime by sharing with others, waiting until their turn to speak, and holding a door or helping people as needed.Praise your children when you see them being polite to reinforce the behavior.

, Respect is both a personal and social concept. Children must understand that they are owed respect and that they should be respectful of others. Personal respect may be learned by encouraging your kids to maintain a clean and groomed appearance, speaking properly and using polite titles like ""ma'am"" or ""sir,"" and setting personal boundaries in relationships.


Give them opportunities to show respect for others. This can be achieved by exposing your children to people from all walks of life and pointing out how they all have the same basic needs. Volunteering, learning a new language, and spending time with their elders can help children learn how to respect--and learn from--people who are different from them., Civility is also exemplified in how your children disagree with opinions and beliefs that are different than their own. Many children are quick to say ""You're wrong"" or ""That's dumb"" to an opinion that is drastic from theirs. Give your children constructive opportunities to manage differences in opinion and resolve conflict gracefully.For example, your child might be arguing with a friend over their favorite movie. You hear him say, ""Why is that your favorite movie? It's silly and the ending doesn't make sense."" You might correct him and explain how he can disagree with respect. A better response might be ""Wow! Our favorite movies are so different! What about that movie do you like the most?""

, Stop your child in the moment when you see a display of rude behavior. Telling them that how they are acting is rude and disrespectful may help them see the situation from a different point of view, as they may be so involved they aren’t able to see any other perspective but their own. Tell them why what they did was wrong, and how they should have acted, instead.For instance, you visit a family friend’s house and your son runs and dives onto the couch. You might correct him and say, “No, Darren, you do not jump on the furniture. You can break something or destroy Ms. Peterson’s nice pillows. We walk inside and sit down softly…like a gentleman, remember?”

, If your child is a bully, you’ll need to take disciplinary action against them. Explain why bullying is prohibited, and inflict a punishment that is appropriate. If your child is friends with a bully, consider ending their relationship. Allowing them to remain friends gives the impression that you are OK with your child being close to someone who bullies others. The friend may also influence your child to exhibit the same behavior.Additionally, encourage your children to befriend other children who may not be popular or are considered outsiders. Doing so teaches them to be respectful towards everyone, no matter what others may believe about them., Whether you are watching TV, or are in a situation in which others are around, make mention of any rudeness you see and follow through with an appropriate consequence.Explain what will happen if your children demonstrate inappropriate behavior clearly. You might say, ""If you do not share your toys, I will take them away"" or ""If you are cited for bullying at school, you will lose your video game privileges.""
Make sure that consequences are understandable and appropriate for your child based on their age. Also, be sure to always follow through on consequences to demonstrate consistency and prevent confusion.

, One of the biggest aspects of civility is showing compassion and empathy towards others. Apologizing when you’ve made a mistake shows that you are humble and can realize when you’ve done something wrong. Along with saying you’re sorry to other adults, make sure you apologize to your children when you’ve done something wrong, as well.


When apologizing to your children, explain to them how you made a mistake and that you are very sorry about it. Then tell them how important it is to apologize when you are in the wrong because it shows that you are empathetic.
Also, tell your children when you apologize to others because of a mistake you’ve made, particularly if they witnessed the mistake. Children learn by example and will be more likely to exhibit the same behavior they witness, both good and bad., Your kids are watching you, and you set the example for them. When you show civility towards others, they will do the same. When you are less than polite and kind to others, they may also model that sort of behavior.


You can’t be perfect all of the time. If you do find yourself acting rude or unkind towards others, explain to your children how that was wrong. Then, apologize to the people you behaved badly to, in front of them., Helping to take care of the house shows an aspect of humility. It teaches children how to serve others and perform selfless acts that may not directly benefit them, but benefits others. Chores also teach children discipline, which is important in learning civility.You’ll need to find age-appropriate chores for your children to complete. For instance, toddlers can dust, feed the pets, and help pile books and magazine. Older children can load and unload the dishwasher, make their beds, and help fold laundry. Avoid being too critical with the chores and make sure to give plenty of praise for what they’ve done., Saying “please” and “thank you” goes a long way. Teach your children to have good manners, and display them yourself, as well. Opening the door for others, asking “may I?,” and calling people “sir” and “ma’am” teach children to have respect for others."

Do not give your child a task that they cannot perform, such as giving a dog a bath.,
Supervise your child for the first week or so to make sure they don't make some small mistakes that can cost you.,
Give your child some harder tasks after a few weeks.,
Give your child some simple rewards for taking great care of the pet.",How to Teach Children to Care for Pets," Give them a simple pet to take care of depending on their experience with animals. You should ask yourself some questions:


Is your child quite young or is he/she a bit older? Taking on the responsibility of caring for a large pet such as a dog is quite a task and isn't suitable for little children who won't be able to control the pet, let alone care for it. A fish or a hamster is a suitable pet that is easier and more reasonable to take care of.
Has the child suffered from animals in the past? Ask the child if he/she has ever been harmed by an animal before. It doesn't have to be a big bite from a dog, it could just be a simple nip from a mouse. No matter how small the injury, always let the child have the choice to care for the pet instead of forcing the chore upon them.
Does the child have a fear of the animal? You could always try curing this fear, but no matter what you do, the child could still become anxious around the pet. As always, ask if he/she is okay with taking care of the pet and say that it is alright to not be okay with it.;
, If it's either to give your child responsibility, give them a chore or even if it is because you are bringing a new pet into the household, you should explain to them calmly and in a quiet area.


Leave the topic open for discussion. Do not refuse to listen to what your child has to say, let him/her give their own opinion and always be willing to answer any questions that they have.

, Even if these are big mistakes, be understanding and do not give them harsh consequences for treating the pet wrong, everyone makes beginner mistakes!

, This is a great organizer for both you and your child. Whenever he/she does the job properly, put a sticker on their chart to encourage them to do all the jobs properly. It will also make caring for the pet fun.

, If s/he has never seen the pet before, a nice introduction is a nice start before the child starts to care for the pet.


Give him/her time to get use to the pet. Let her play with the pet for a while, unless it is a pet that is not to be played with such as a fish or bug. Remember to supervise your child and the pet to make sure that s/he or the pet doesn't get hurt or that the pet doesn't escape.
Give your child some helpful information about the pet. Tell him/her what the pet cannot eat, what the pet likes and tell him/her what to expect of the pet.

, If their job is to feed the pet, tell them how much food they should get and when they have to feed them.

, Even if it is a small animal like a bird, it can still escape and you will have to spend time trying to catch it. If you are going to give them a hard task, help them with it.

, Such as feeding the goldfish too much, the fish will over-eat and kill itself.


Do not leave them to do all the work by themselves. Give your child plenty of free-time and help them when they need help.

, Let him/her take care of the dog without help or let them take on some harder jobs such as walking a dog or grooming a cat (with supervision).

, If they have continuously been taking care of the pet without fussing or having to be asked, giving them a little reward is always great encouragement for the child.

Explain that estimation is like guesswork.,
Give examples.,
Use flash cards.",How to Teach Estimation1," Your child is probably already familiar with the concept of guessing. Explain that estimating is similar, but that the goal is to make educated guesses that are as accurate as possible. Learning how to estimate effectively will let you save time and energy in situations where an exact number is unnecessary.;
, If you pay attention, you’ll see examples of estimation frequently in your daily life. You might, for example, estimate how much your grocery bill will be, how long it will take you to drive somewhere, or how many cups of milk are left in the carton. Explain these examples to your child in a developmentally appropriate way.


When you give these examples, it can help to explain why estimating, rather than calculating, is appropriate in the particular context. Tell your child, for example, that if you needed to know exactly what your grocery bill would be, you could add up all the prices and get a precise number, but, in this case, you’re only trying to get an approximate number so that you don’t spend too much.

, To reinforce the concept, show your child a flash card or picture with multiple objects on it: animals, toys, whatever your child likes. Show the card to your child, but not for long enough to count the objects, then ask your child to estimate the number. Give high scores to close estimates. Repeat the game until your child seems to understand the concept.

"
"
Focus on activities that interest your child.,
Teach visual isolation.,
Play guessing games.,
Emphasize the vocabulary of estimation.,
Teach your child to strategize.,
Be persistent.,
Reward your child’s progress.",How to Teach Estimation2," Every child is different, so tailor your activities to suit your child’s particular interests. Make these activities fun! Children tend to have tons of energy but minimal attention spans, so it’s important for the activities you choose to entertain them.

, Your child may struggle to filter out unnecessary information and focus only on the subject to be estimated. You can teach this skill with simple games. For example, you might put red and blue balls on the floor, then ask your child to guess how many red balls there are (ignoring the blue ones).

, You can have your child guess how many jelly beans are in a bowl, how many pennies are in a jar, or how many marbles are in a box. Emphasize the need for estimation, not counting or calculation.


There are online games that help teach estimation as well. For example, your child can play “Guess It!” at http://www.theproblemsite.com/junior/estimation.asp, where Professor Puzzler will show various groups of colored dots, then take them away and ask for an estimation. This site will let you increase or decrease the amount of time the dots stay on the screen, too, letting you customize the game for your child.

, Explain to your child that when people estimate, they use words like “about,” “approximately,” or “more or less.” When you play guessing games, encourage your child to use these words and to construct sentences that reflect estimation.

, Remind your child that estimation is not about random guessing; it’s about making educated predictions. Instead of throwing out random numbers, he or she should use visual cues to get as close as possible.

, Repetition is key. Children need to practice these skills over and over again in order to master them. Vary the activities so that your child does not get bored, but don’t give up on teaching estimation.

, Children will be more interested and motivated if you offer a reward. If you play a guessing game with jelly beans, for example, you can give your child a few to eat when he or she makes a good estimate. If you use pennies, let your child keep them if he or she does well.

Give feelings a name.,
Praise your child when he shows empathy.,
Develop your child's sense of morality.,
Ask your child about what others think or feel.,
Encourage your child to make ""I"" statements.,
Help your child to develop a sense of concern.",How to Teach Empathy to a Child1," When you are angry, or you see someone who is angry, point this out to your child and explain how you can tell (loud voices, angry expression, etc). Do the same thing for happiness, sadness, surprise, jealous, and any other emotions you can think of.


Take every opportunity to draw your child's attention to different emotions. For example, if you see someone who sitting alone and who looks sad, tell the child, ""That man is sitting alone on the park bench. He must be lonely."";
, Draw special attention to your child's behavior when they show empathy by doing something nice for someone else. Say something like:


“It's nice of you to share toys with your friend. That made him happy. I could see him laughing”
Rewarding your child for empathetic behavior could help them to develop a natural sense of empathy over time.

, Explain to your child how bad behavior affects other people. For example, explain to your child that when he does not share his toys, his friend feels sad. Or let him know that when he is naughty or mean to his sister, it makes you feel angry.


Understanding the consequences of their actions and realizing how their behavior can negatively impact on someone else will help your child to put themselves in the other person's shoes and becomes more empathetic.

, If your child witnesses something bad happening to someone else, ask them how they think that person feels. For example, if your child sees another kid dropping their ice cream, ask him ""how would you feel if that happened to you?""

, Explain to your child that when something bothers him, he should clearly express how he feels, rather than placing the blame on someone else.


For instance, instead of saying “you broke my toy!” encourage him to say “I feel sad and disappointed because you broke my toy”.
This helps the child to identify his own feelings and allows him to communicate better with others.

, A large part of empathy is showing concern for other people, so you should try to foster this instinct in your child.


For example, if your child mentions that someone in their class was missing from school, ask your child about it. Ask them ""Why was that child absent? Were they sick?""
Then you could get your child to make a ""Get Well Soon"" card for their sick classmate and help them deliver it or put it in the mail. Activities like this will teach your child to show care and interest in other people.

"
"
Show empathy to your child.,
Acknowledge the child's opinion.,
Teach them to find common ground with other people.,
Teach your child to see things from someone else's perspective.,
Teach kids to listen.,
Encourage your child to do something nice for someone else.,
Do not forget your child's feelings.",How to Teach Empathy to a Child2," Your child will find it difficult to learn empathy just by talking about it. Therefore, it is recommended that you try to teach by example and actually show your child what being empathetic means.


Show empathy to your child by expressing concern and sympathy when they hurt themselves or are feeling sad. You could say something like ""Please cheer up. It makes me sad to see you sad.""
If they see this behavior in you, they are more likely to display empathy in their dealings with others, first out of habit and then out of genuine emotion.

, Let your child know that you always listen to them and that you appreciate their opinion on things. In this way, your child will not only learn to value themselves, but also learn how to appreciate other people's opinions.

, Do they like the same games, do they have the same hobbies, are they scared when watching horror movies? In this way, they will learn how to identify the similarities between their own and others' feelings in certain situations, making them more empathetic.

, Present your child with a problem from someone else's perspective and encourage your child to put themselves in that person's shoes.


For example, if there is a girl playing all by herself in the playground, ask your child to imagine how he would feel if he were her. Would he want someone else to ask him to play?

, Use the following phrase to teach your child about the importance of being a good listener:


“You have two ears and one mouth. That's because you're supposed to listen twice as much as you speak.”
Encouraging your child to be a good listener will help them to identify more with others and make them more empathetic.

, This could be something as simple as helping his dad with the gardening, or going to visit his grandparents.


However, if he really wanted to do something good, he could participate in a charity activity, like a bake sale or a fun run.
These kinds of activities will help your child to develop a sense of responsibility towards others and to gain a sense of satisfaction from helping those around him.

, Although you want your child to be empathetic and kind to others, he should not let other people walk all over him either. He should know that his feelings are also important and be able to stand up for himself when necessary.

Teach the child about facial expressions and non-verbal signs.,
Do some people-watching.,
Play pretend.,
Make them wait their turn.,
Play with dolls or action figures.,
Grow plants or care for animals.,
Play “feeling of the week”.,
Use picture books.",How to Teach Empathy to a Child3," Make different facial expressions and ask your child to name the emotion you are trying to portray. Alternatively, you could draw the expressions on a piece of paper. The ability to identify a particular emotion when they see it will help your child to respond appropriately and show empathy.

, Sit down at at a cafe or on a park bench with your child and watch all the people walking by. Ask your child to guess how they are feeling based on their expressions and body language.


Take the game even further by asking your child for suggestions on what they could do to cheer the stranger up. For example, if you spot a little girl crying in the park, you could ask your child what he could do to make her happy.
Encourage answers like ""I'd ask her to play with me"" or ""I'd give her a hug.""

, Role play with your child and pretend that you are pirates, warriors, princesses, anything you like. Through acting, your child will learn how to express feelings both verbally and non-verbally and react to the feelings of others.

, Waiting their turn to play a game is a good way for kids to overcome their own feelings and impatience and show respect for other people's time and other people's feelings.


Choose a group game and make each child wait their turn while the others are playing. The game can be anything, from hopscotch to a karaoke competition.

, Playing with dolls or action figures can help your child to develop empathy in a fun way. Playing with dolls can teach your child how to care about other people's needs, to clothe them, feed them and so on.

, Plant some seeds with your child and make them responsible for caring for the growing plant. They will need to water it, make sure it's getting enough sunlight, and remove any weeds.


Older children could even take responsibility for caring for a pet, by feeding it, playing with it and bringing it for walks.
These activities will teach the child to put someone or something else's needs before their own.

, Select a feeling and stick it on the fridge. Then all week, ask your child to point out this particular feeling when they see it in themselves or in others.

, Picture books with the theme of helping or caring for others can be useful in explaining empathy to your child.


Show your child the characters in the picture book and ask your child to guess how they feel and explain why.
Which gestures indicate that someone is happy, angry, or jealous?

, Show the child in your hand how to hold the scissors, and then have them try to copy it. If they aren't able to alone, help move their fingers and thumb into the right position.


Teach them that the thumb always goes in the hole. Draw an eyeball on the small thumb hole and explain that the eyeball will always be on top.
Teach them that two fingers in the larger hole. Help them put their index finger and their middle finger in the hole.

, This practice will help the child build up the strength to control the scissors.

, Start with a paper that's sturdy but not difficult to cut. This will help them cut straight and once again learn to control the scissors.


Use hand-over-hand techniques to help guide the child's cutting, if necessary.

, Draw thick lines with a black marker for the child to trace.

, This will prevent the child from turning the scissors up side down. Show the how to move the paper along with shuffling motions so that they maintain control of both the paper and the scissors.

, While you don't want to scare your child or make the possibilities sound like a horror movie, you do want to make sure they know what dangers fire brings. Talk about general safety often; you can talk one-on-one in discussions about what to do in emergencies, and you can bring the issues up more casually too, as you talk about movies, games, and make-believe.


Make sure your kids know, from a very young age, about policemen and firefighters. By focusing on these fun, kid-friendly icons, you can reinforce the general ideas about safety. When you and your child use toys or props to ""play firefighter"", you're actually building their understanding of fire safety, which is a good thing!

, You want your child to take the topic very seriously, but you also don't want to scare them. Anything practiced in play has the power to become ""learned"" and habitual; if you practice escape routes around your house as part of a firefighter game, they just might use those routes again in the event of a real emergency.

, Tell them dangerous fumes can overcome a person in just a few minutes. Practice crawling on the floor and escaping the house with them. If there are no passage ways available they will have to use a secondary escape route such as a windows or ladder, and if there is still no escape route, wait at the window for firefighters. Drill into them the famous slogans:


Don't hide, go outside
Stop, drop and roll
Fall and crawl
Do not play with matches

, Teach them your country's Emergency Services phone number and if they are old enough, that the international standard emergency number for mobile phones is 112.

Emphasize patterns.,
Predict everyday events together.,
Draw on their previous experiences.,
Encourage them to explain their predictions.",How to Teach Children Prediction Skills1," Pattern recognition is essential to prediction skills. Children in preschool are often developing their ability to recognize patterns. You can help them by pointing out patterns in your everyday life.You might use cut-out shapes to teach them patterns. Organize a basic pattern by alternating shapes. For example, you might lay out a square, a circle, a square, a circle, and a square. Ask the child, “What shape goes next?” As they get older, you can introduce more advanced patterns with more shapes.;
, For young children, predicting small everyday events is a helpful tool to help them find patterns and consider consequences. Ask the child questions about what they think might happen before you do basic events.Before you eat a meal, ask them what they think it will taste like. You can ask, “If I gave you a spoonful of honey, would it taste sweet or sour?”
You might ask them to predict the weather. For example, you could say, “The sky is cloudy today. Do you think it will rain?”
Five minutes into their favorite cartoon, you can ask, “What do you think will happen?”

, If a child does not know the answer to a question, ask them to think about the last time something similar happened to them. See if they can draw a connection between the previous event and the present one.For example, you can ask them, “What happened the last time you skipped your nap?” They might answer that they were sleepy or that they became grumpy.
You can also ask them if they think the same thing will happen again this time. For example, you can say, “Do you think that will happen again? Why do you say that?”

, To help children form concrete connections between past and future events, you should also follow up your questions with an explanation. Ask them to point out clues that support their prediction, or see if they can connect a past event to a present one.You might say, “I see you think that the sun will set before dinner today. Why do you say that?”
Another way of saying it is, “So you think that the coin will land on heads? Why do you think that is?”

Guess the contents of a box.,
Ask them to imagine what happens next in photographs.,
Let them guess how objects feel.,
Ask “what if” questions.",How to Teach Children Prediction Skills2," Put an object inside of a box, and seal it shut. Hand the box to the child, and ask them to guess the contents without looking inside. Encourage the child to hold, shake, and listen to the box. See if they can predict what is inside.Small objects work well for this activity. You can put marbles, coins, beans, or dice in the box. A small ticking watch or a wind-up car might also work well.
You can prepare multiple boxes with different objects inside. Ask the child to note the differences between each box. Is one heavier than another? Do they sound different when you shake them? What do they think is in each box?

, Print or clip out images from a magazine, newspaper, or website. These might be images where the subject is actively participating in an activity such as driving, eating, or running. Ask the child what they think will happen next, and make them point out clues in the image that support their prediction.For example, show a child an advertisement with a spilled cup of coffee. Ask them, “What do you think will happen next?” They might say that someone has to clean up the mess or that they need another cup of coffee.
Advertisements and news stories are a good source for images to use in this activity.

, Collect a few different objects with various textures—such as soft, rough, coarse, bumpy, and smooth. Show each to the child. Ask them to tell you what they think it will feel like without touching it themselves.

For example, you might ask them to look at a coconut, a stuffed animal, sandpaper, a raincoat, an ice cube, and a brush.
For each object, you can ask, “What do you think this will feel like?” If they are unsure, try giving them a few options. You can say, “Bumpy? Prickly? Smooth? Cold? Warm?”

, Imagination is an important part of prediction. To help encourage a healthy imagination, pose “what if” questions to your child, and see if they can predict what might happen. Follow these questions up with more specific details to get them to think about different consequences.You can ask them:

“What if I put salt instead of sugar in your tea? What would it taste like?”
“What if the sun didn’t rise? Would it be warm or cold? Dark or light?”
“What if everything you touched turned into candy? What if you touched your friend?”
“What if we went to the moon? What would you see there?”

You can ask: “By looking at the cover, what do you think this story is about?”
Follow the question up by asking: “Why do you think that? What clues tell you that?”, After a few pages, stop reading, and ask the child what they think will happen. Encourage them to compare their original prediction with what they know about the story already.You can say, “Is this what you thought would happen? What do you think will happen now?”
Keep encouraging them to pick up on clues, both in the pictures and in the text. You can say, “Can you point to any clues that tell you that?”

, Once you have finished the story, talk about your predictions together. Ask the child if their predictions came true. Invite them to explain why the book ended the way it did.You can say, “Was this what you predicted would happen?”
If they did predict the ending, you might say, “Good job. How did you know?”
If they did not predict the ending, you might say, “Are there any clues that you missed that could have helped you predict the ending?”

, If the child is reading chapter books on their own, you might ask them to write a paragraph or draw a picture every time they read a chapter. Ask them to record what they think might happen in the next chapter. Encourage them to record why they think this will happen."

Attach a short rope to the seat post.",How to Teach a Child to Ride a Bike1," Tell your child how much fun it is to ride a bike. Set a good example by riding your own bike and having a good time. Make sure you always wear your helmet! When your child gets on the bike show them how fun it is. Tell them not to put their feet on the ground and show them how to pedal.;
, Make sure each time your child practices with his/her bike they are wearing safety gear. This teaches good safety habits.

, Training wheels make learning to ride much easier and safer.

, Help them into the seat. Make sure the height is set so that they can keep their feet on the ground while sitting on the seat. For the first bike ride with training wheels, keep your hand under the seat behind them, or on the bike to comfort your child. Stay near your child until they feel more comfortable with the bike and come to enjoy the ride. After a few weeks, you may move on to the next steps that are more specific toward teaching your child to ride a two-wheeled bike.

, The first two-wheeled bike ride will be a bit intimidating to your child, so speak words of encouragement along the process.

, Continue to hold the bike upright. You may wish to do this and the next few steps for the first time on grass to ensure a soft landing for the inevitable first fall.

, Don't let go yet!

, Reassure them that they are doing fine. Tell them you are going to let go of the bike and they'll keep going on their own.

, Continue to offer encouragement and support, but don't try to correct them.

, Make sure they aren't hurt without scaring them. Help them back onto the bike to try again.

, There are going to be many, many falls, and your child may want your help.

, Wrap a large bath towel around your child's waist and twist the ends to form a large soft ""rope"" behind him/her. Do NOT twist the towel too tightly. Hold the towel rope firmly by the ends and jog along behind the bike while your child rides and balances on the bike by him/herself. Do not hold the bike or your child, but use the towel to gently keep their balance as they pedal along. This method is much more effective than you holding onto the bike as your child must find the correct balance almost exclusively on their own while the towel provides a ""safety net"" they can lean against should they start to tip over.

, This can initially be used as a handle to keep the bike upright while they are learning to balance. As their balance skills grow, you can let out more slack in the rope, yet still have the ability to catch them and keep them from falling by pulling the rope tightly upward.

Introduce numbers and counting.,
Teach the concept of trade before introducing money.,
Introduce the names of various forms of money.,
Don't buy your toddler whatever he or she wants.,
Buy your toddler a toy cash register and toy money.,
Allow your toddler to pay at the store.,
Help your toddler begin saving money.,
Teach your child about making smart purchases.,
Let your child make some financial choices.,
Teach your child how to safely handle cash.",How to Teach a Toddler Simple Money Habits," A two or three year old toddler can generally learn to count to ten, or even higher, although they may not understand that numbers represent quantities. For a young child, the first step is to learn the correct words in the correct sequence: ""One, two, three, four, five…""


Start early by making counting part of your regular conversations. For example, you might say: ""It's time to put on your socks! One sock, two socks!""
Count things throughout the day, such as oranges in a basket, crayons on the table, people in a room, etc.;
, Money is symbolic and difficult to understand for young minds, but a toddler is not too young to learn about trade and bartering. Since the concept of trading one thing for another is really the basis for understanding how money works, this can provide an early foundation for understanding financial concepts later.


Teach your toddler about one to one trades by swapping and sharing toys when playing. For instance, if you are reading a book and your toddler wants to see it, ask him or her to bring you another book so you can both have one.
Teach your toddler about trading based on comparative value. Give your toddler a plate of blueberries, and give yourself a plate of strawberries. Ask your toddler if he or she would like a strawberry, and then ask for three blueberries in exchange for one bigger strawberry.

, While your child won't understand the difference in value between a penny, nickel, and dime, he or she is old enough to begin learning the correct names for each piece of money. Identify the right words when you are shopping, by telling him or her ""I'm going to pay for this with a dollar,"" or ""I need five dollars and a dime to pay for this.""


You can also turn coin identification into a fun puzzle. Take a piece of blank cardstock and trace the outline of coins on the paper. If you're in the United States, for instance, you would trace a penny, dime, nickel, and quarter. Then, place the coins in a pile next to the paper and ask your toddler to match them each to the correct image.Be sure you watch your child closely while he or she examines or plays with coins. Some toddlers have a tendency to put coins in their mouth or nose, which can pose a safety hazard.

, While it can be fun to give your toddler a treat every time you go to the store, your toddler needs to begin to understand the importance of waiting and saving money.


It is OK to tell your toddler that you don't have enough money to purchase something they ask for at the store. Explain that it is expensive by saying, ""This toy costs ten dollars, but we don't have ten dollars to spend on this. If we buy this toy, we can't buy your brother his birthday present.""Teaching your child patience and the value of waiting helps him or her understand the importance of not making rushed purchases. You can turn every day moments into ""teachable moments."" For instance, when your child has to wait in line to ride a carousel, talk with him or her about how sometimes you have to wait for what you want. Although this is not directly related to money, it instills an important lesson that applies to finances., Kids of all ages love playing store, and toddlers in particular are keen to copy behaviors they see adults doing.You can set up a simple store in the living room by placing empty food boxes, produce, or other small nonperishable items on a table top. You can give your toddler a reusable shopping bag and some play money and allow him or her to gather and ""purchase"" groceries as you act as the cashier.
Don't forget to switch roles and let your child also have a turn at the cash register. Allow him or her to make change incorrectly for now; the important thing is to understand that trade takes place when someone makes a purchase.

, Your toddler might not understand what is happening, but allowing him or her to pay for groceries or other items is a good first lesson in how money works and how purchases are made.


If your toddler is big enough, allow him or her to put items on the counter for purchase. Then, after the cashier rings up the purchase, hold your child so he or she can hand the cash or credit card to the cashier.
If your toddler receives money for a holiday gift, help him or her pick out something from the store and purchase it themselves. This way they begin to understand that money can be exchanged for something they want to have. It helps to let your toddler carry a small purse or bag to hold the money and any change they might get.

, One of the most important money skills that some people never seem to learn is how to save money. Purchase a cute piggy bank for your child. If you can, choose a clear one or another clear container so that your child can watch his or her money accumulate.Consider giving your toddler a very small weekly allowance. For example, you might give your child a quarter or fifty cents. Your toddler can put that allowance into the piggy bank and save it. You can help him or her count it regularly. Be sure to explain that each week, there is more money than there was before. The more he or she saves, the more the money grows.
When your toddler asks for a toy in the store, set a goal together to save money to purchase it. If the toy is too expensive for the child to afford on his or her allowance, consider giving more money for household chores or ""matching"" the child's contribution to make the goal attainable.

, Take your toddler to the store with you and talk with him or her about your options.Use words like ""more expensive,"" ""less expensive,"" ""cheaper,"" or ""a better deal"" to help your child learn that saving money is preferable.


Plan your shopping trip in advance, including any toys or treats you might purchase for your child. Most young children ask for things at the store. Tell your toddler beforehand whether or not you will purchase anything in particular for him or her, and stick with what you say. That helps your child learn not to make last minute impulse decisions., Allowing your toddler to choose between alternatives helps reinforce the important lesson that money only goes so far. It also gives him or her some personal stake in how money is used, so they will be more open to learning to use money wisely.


If you have $20 to spend on an outing with your child, make a list of things in that price range and let him or her choose. For example, your child might choose between seeing a movie, going to the pool, or going for ice cream. Explain to him or her that they can only choose one because you only have enough money for one.
You can also try giving your child a few dollars and asking him or her to choose the vegetable or fruit for your family's dinner., Coins present a choking hazard to toddlers and cash is covered with germs. Some toddlers might also accidentally rip or tear bills, so be sure your child knows how to properly handle money.


Explain to your child that he or she should never put money in their mouth.
Make sure your child washes his or her hands after handling cash.

Encourage the child.,
Make them comfortable.,
Carry them gently and let them lie on their back.,
Slowly release your arms from their back.,
Practice.,
Reward the child for their hard work.,
Continue to practice.",How to Teach a Child the Back Float," Encourage him/her to get into the water to learn to float. True, children don't realize how learning to float will benefit them. For them it is just a waste of time. Time they could use to play Lego or play with their tablets. Promise them a reward every time they go into the water. Rewards like buying them ice-cream, candy, or play time with a favorite toy or willing person (you, a relative, a play-date, etc) will likely be enough to make them eager to accomplish the task you wish them to do. Make sure that you do give them the reward they worked hard for, or else you will only lose their trust, which will be very hard to regain.;
, Make them feel safe in the pool with you. Go to the shallowest part of the pool. Then, let them play in the water for a while if they wish. If there are any signs of resistance, remind them of the reward they will receive when they coordinate and follow your instructions.

, Let them know how long you will do this. Tell them to count 10 seconds slowly in their head and that you will carry them again after the given period of time. Do this exercise 3 more times.


Using floating devices for the arm might be useful, but if none, your arms will serve as the child's assistance to float. Be extra careful that water doesn't get in their mouth or nose, as this might give the child a bad experience and use it as an excuse to why they doesn't want to continue.

, Do this after the previous exercise. Tell them that you will do the same exercise, but you will slowly release your arms. Instruct the child to lie as parallel to the ground as possible, as horizontal as possible. Also, explain to them in a non-boring manner the importance of acquiring as much surface area as possible. When you know that the child will sink, assist them with your hands. Then, little by little, stop the assistance.

, Do the second exercise once more, then praise and be cheerful. Tell him how fast they learned and how good they did. Encourage him to do the exercise again cheerfully. Make sure the fun factor is always there.


Once they agree, repeat the second exercise and gradually increase the challenge and difficulty by again, slowly releasing the assistance from your hands. This time, make them move their hands and kick slowly to generate greater surface area. This will make them more confident and secure.

, Encourage them to do the exercise in another day for another treat. Again, tell them how well they did, and how awesome they looked while floating. Tell them how fast they learned, too.

, A child without any back round in swimming won't be able to learn this overnight. Correct practice makes perfect. Continue to practice and do the exercises. a child will ideally learn to float within a week or two.

Know what age kids can start to sew.,
Allow kids to use the sewing machine.,
Instruct that speed doesn’t equal quality.,
Have kids pick the pattern, fabric, notions, thread, etc.,
Let kids sew the same thing over and over.,
Change the pattern paper.,
Draw ‘real’ lines on the fabric for guidance.,
Demonstrate how to put the pattern on the fabric.,
Select thicker thread for hand sewing projects.",How to Teach a Child to Sew1," Age, in general, doesn’t matter. What matters is motivation. If you’re child shows an interest in learning how to sew, this is the indicator that they might be ready to start learning.Some sewing instructors, however, recommend waiting till your child is around 6 years of age before introducing them to a sewing machine. Prior to this, hand sewing is the best option.
Because hand coordination is required for sewing, another indication of whether your child is ready can be based on hand-eye coordination.;
, Sewing machines can be a little intimidating for first time sewers. As with sewing in general, the best indication of whether your child is ready for work on a sewing machine is their interest in the machine. While it may seem like a good idea to buy a sewing machine specifically for children, these machines are normally of a very low quality and will easily break. There is no reason why a child cannot use a ‘real’ sewing machine from the start.Remember to start off any lesson on the sewing machine with a ‘safety talk’ so your child understands where to and not to put their hands.
One possible way to start a child on a sewing machine is to allow the child to work the pedal, while you control the fabric. This will allow the child to feel a part of the process, without being scared of having fingers near the needle. Once more comfortable, you can allow your child to take over control of the fabric as well.

, When using a sewing machine it is often tempting for the child to ‘put the pedal to the metal’ and sew really fast. Unfortunately not only can this cause injury to little hands, it is incredibly difficult to control the direction of the fabric when going this fast. Teach your child that the best way to sew is slowly and carefully.The ‘slowly’ tip also works for hand sewing. While kids can only sew as fast as their hands can move, there is no need to rush hand sewing. If it takes all day to sew a square — that’s okay. It is better that they feel good with their accomplishment rather than needing to make several corrections because they went too fast.

, Allow your child to pick every aspect of the sewing project to be undertaken. This may mean odd combinations of fabric and colours, but that’s okay. The sewing project should be about the child, and making sewing fun and exciting. Kids are more likely to enjoy the project if they feel they were apart of all the decisions.One exception to this ‘rule’ is to provide advice if your child wants to use a pattern that is really complicated (e.g. a shirt) or a fabric that is difficult to work with (e.g. velvet). You don’t want to set your child up for failure, so you may need to encourage an alternative in this situation.

, Once kids have found a pattern they like, and they’re able to sew the project with great success, they may want to sew the same project over and over (and over and over). Having them grow really comfortable with a specific pattern is great as it will boost their confidence.As your child is sewing the same project again, suggest they change something up. Add a different feature, or a different colour combination, etc.
One small and simple project can actually teach kids a large variety of sewing skills that will help them with every new project they take on.

, Most professional patterns are made on very thin and flimsy tissue paper. While they type of paper is fine for adults, it can be really frustrating for kids to work with. Instead of using the tissue paper, trace the pattern onto thick paper or cardboard for your child to use.


Thick card stock paper may work, as well as the cardboard cereal boxes are made from.Instead of pinning the pattern to the fabric (as you would with the tissue paper), simply have your child trace the pattern onto the fabric with a fabric pencil. Cutting around a pinned pattern is not easy, even for more experienced sewers. Tracing the pattern directly onto the fabric will make it easier for your child to cut it out properly.

, When experienced sewers are sewing pieces of fabric together, they know they have to keep their stitching ¼” or so from the edge of the fabric. The line that needs to be sewn along is, technically, invisible. For an older child or an adult, this is an easy concept to master. For a young child, this can be really confusing. Instead of telling kids to follow an imaginary line while they sew, use a fabric pencil and draw the line they need to stitch along directly onto the fabric., Normally, when laying the pattern pieces out on a piece of fabric, you want to cover as much of the fabric as possible so you don’t waste any. Kids, however, may find it more fun to start by cutting pattern pieces out of the middle of a piece of fabric, making it harder to use the fabric again later.Demonstrate to your child how to lay out all the pattern pieces so you maximize your use of the fabric. Encourage them to do the same. Indicate that more projects can be made if less fabric is wasted!

, One of the hardest parts of hand sewing is getting the end of a piece of thread through the eye of a needle! To help alleviate this frustration with your child, use embroidery needles and thicker thread instead of the ‘normal’ stuff.Thicker thread could include the thread used for hand-quilting or upholstery. ‘Regular’ thread is quite thin and can tangle very easily.
An embroidery needle — around size 5 — works best. The eye of this needle is easier to see and thread.

Get the right materials.,
Cut the cardboard and mesh.,
Thread the needle.,
Make a string of beads.",How to Teach a Child to Sew2," To help toddlers get the hang of stitching and sewing, there is a simple project you can try with them that uses a lot of things you already have around your house. You’ll need the following: a piece of cardboard; mesh from a bag of potatoes, citrus fruit, etc.; a stapler, a pair of scissors and an Exacto knife; an embroidery needle with a blunt tip; and thick embroidery thread or yarn., The mesh will essentially be used as your toddler’s sewing surface, and the cardboard is used to stabilize the mesh as a frame. The setup is very similar to a cross-stitch frame and fabric. Therefore you can cut the cardboard and mesh any size that works for you and your toddler.Attach the mesh to the cardboard using the stapler.
You want the mesh to be approximately 1.5” longer and wider than the cardboard frame.
Pull the mesh taught over the cardboard so it’s not too flexible in the frame.

, You may need to thread the needle for your toddler, even though the eye is quite large. Once you have the needle threaded, show them how to stitch in and out of the mesh squares. Change-up the colour of the thread (or yarn) every so often.Once you show your toddler how to stitch, let them go at it however they want. Don’t worry about ‘normal’ sewing rules.
If they want, you can use a marker to draw a pattern on the mesh for your toddler to follow.

, While not a exactly a sewing project, stringing beads will help a toddler with their hand-eye coordination. Plus the motion of stringing beads is almost the same as threading a needle, so this skill will be useful should they want to sew in the future.Making a string of beads is incredibly simple. For the ‘string’ you can use plastic gimp, yarn, or thick thread. The beads can be any type that you find at a craft or fabric store. The younger the child, the bigger the beads should be. You can even use buttons instead of beads.
Demonstrate how to put the beads on the string, then allow your toddler to take over.
The resulting string of beads can be used for just about anything: bracelet, necklace, bookmark, keychain, etc.

Teach kids how to thread a needle.,
Get some practice fabric.,
Practice different stitches.,
Complete some other practice hand sewing projects.",How to Teach a Child to Sew3," For practice purposes, cut a piece of thread about 2 feet (0.6 m) long. Thread one side through the eye of the needle. Pull the thread through the needle until both ends are beside each other. Put 1-2 knots in the end of the thread, about 1” up from the end.For visualization purposes, you should be able to hold up the entire length of thread, with one end in each of your hands, and the needle should dangle in the very middle of the piece of thread. You can then bring the two ends together to tie the knot. The knot will be at the opposite end of where the needle will dangle.

, In order to practice hand sewing, get two pieces of scrap fabric and put them together. Your child will use these pieces to practice stitching. This fabric doesn’t have to be fancy, but it should probably be a type of fabric you’ll use often, such as cotton.One type of practice stitching could be to sew along the edge of the fabric, so make sure that at least one side of your scrap pieces line up to each other. If necessary, cut the fabric along one edge so it lines up.
You may want to select fabric and thread that are two very different colours. This way your child can easily see the stitches made on the fabric.

, Start by having your child practice stitching a straight line along the edge of the fabric. Encourage them to keep each stitch the same size, and keep all the stitches in a straight line without going off the end of the fabric. Continue having your child practice stitches until they’re able to get a good straight line with even-sized stitches.The end result may be one or more sets of scrap fabric with all sorts of crazy and uneven stitches in them. But the point is to allow your child to get the hang of hand sewing with practice. Using this method will also allow your child to see improvement between each attempt.

, Another potential way to practice hand sewing is to use styrofoam plates and colourful embroidery thread. This form of practice may be better for very young children (less than 6 years old). They can also sew neat patterns onto the plates with different colours and put them on display.The styrofoam plates stay stiff while kids are sewing, helping them get the hang of the stitches without getting frustrated with fabric. The styrofoam is also easy to poke a dull-ended needle through.
For this type of practice you can use tapestry needles as they have large eyes and dull ends. This will help your child get use to threading a needle without accidentally poking themselves with the needle.
You can start by having your child get use to pulling the needle in and out of the plate to make stitches. Then work from there and have them stitch straight lines or objects (e.g. stars, letters, flowers, etc.). You can even draw the shape onto the plate with a pen first so your child has something to follow.

Buy the materials.,
Cut the fleece.,
Tie the fleece together.,
Put the pillow form inside the fleece.,
Enjoy your pillow.",How to Teach a Child to Sew4," For this project the materials are simple — you’ll need a 14” by 14” pillow form and two pieces of fleece that are at least 16.5” by 16.5”. You will also need a good pair of sewing scissors., Each square of fleece has to be at least 16.5” by 16.5”. Because the pillow form is 14” wide, the additional 2.5” will be used to cut strips to tie the two pieces of fleece together. If you want strips longer than 2.5”, just cut the fleece larger than 16.5” by 16.5”.Once the two squares are cut, cut strips out of all four sides that will be 1” wide and 2.5” long.

, Make sure the two pieces of fleece are on top of each other, with the ‘right' sides of the fleece facing outwards. (Most fleece doesn’t have a good and bad side, so it may not matter.) Starting on one side, start knotting one strip from the top piece of fleece to one strip from the bottom piece of fleece. Use a double knot.Complete knotting 3 of the 4 sides of the pillow case.

, Once 3 of the 4 sides are knotted together, slide the pillow form inside the fleece pillow case. Once it’s inside, knot the 4th side of the pillow case strips together, also using double knots., This project is super-easy and can be completed by kids of just about any age. If the kids are too young, you may need to do the cutting for them, but even young kids can practice tying knots. Plus, you can buy pillow forms of any size as long as you also buy fabric that is 2.5” longer on each side for the knots.Note that ONLY fleece works for a project like this because the edges do not fray.
The same method can be used to make blankets, seat covers, pet beds, etc.

Print some sewing practice sheets.,
Show the basic sewing machine functions.,
Practice with thread.,
Continue to practice by making a snake charmer.,
Complete pre-sewing machine preparations.,
Sew the snake together on the sewing machine.,
Finish up the outside of the snake.",How to Teach a Child to Sew5," Many kids’ craft websites have sewing sheets you can download and print at home. These sheets have a variety of different patterns on them for your child to follow using a sewing machine. Print several sewing sheets for your child and go to the sewing machine.These sheets have a variety of fun patterns like mazes and dot-to-dot patterns. The purpose is to teach your child how to control the sewing machine BEFORE you put thread in it.

, Once at the sewing machine, show your child the following: how to raise and lower the needle/foot; how to use the pedal to make the needle move; how to use the manual dial to move the needle; and how to guide the paper while the needle moves.Once your child has a handle on the straight-forward functions of the machine, use the patterns you printed to practice these various functions.
All that is happening is that the paper is having tiny holes punched in it from the needle. No thread is being used.
Use these practice sheets to show your child how to do a pivot stitch around a corner (where the needle stays down, but you turn the paper in a new direction).

, Once your child has the hang of the basic functions of the sewing machine without thread, it’s time to add the thread. Start with a folded piece of fabric and a regular-sized straight stitch on the machine. Demonstrate the differences with the functions your child has already learned now that there is thread involved.It might be too early to demonstrate how to thread the machine and create a bobbin, so you may just want to do this on your own.
Show your child how to line up the edge of the fabric with the edge of the lowered foot. This allows the stitching to be about ¼” from the edge of the fabric. If it helps, you can draw this line directly onto the fabric for your child to follow.
Show your child how to lower the needle into the fabric before touching the pedal. You should instruct your child that the needle must always be all the way down before pressing the pedal.
Practice pressing the pedal slowly and lightly to start the needle. Show them how to use the back button to do a backstitch over top of the forward stitches already in place.
Practice anchoring the stitching by using the backstitch (which should always be done at the start and end of every line of stitching).
Continue practicing along the edge of the fabric, including pivoting around corners.
When finished a line of stitching, remember to anchor the end of the stitching. Demonstrate how to use the wheel to raise the needle all the way up, and then raise the foot off the fabric.
Finally, show your child how to pull the fabric away from the machine and cut the thread.

, Snake charmers are a very simple project that can be made on a sewing machine. This project doesn’t require an actual pattern, it just uses measurements. You’ll need the following items to complete this project: easy-to-sew fabric like cotton that can be cut into two 2” by 9” pieces; two small buttons (¼” to ⅜” wide); a small piece of red ribbon (¼” to ⅜” wide); plastic pellets for stuffing; thread; and scissors.The fabric and thread can be any colour your child wants — they don’t have to match!

, Complete the following steps before going to the sewing machine:Cut two pieces of fabric so they’re 2” by 9” in size.
Sew the two buttons (which will be eyes) to the ‘right’ side of the end of one piece of fabric. The buttons should be between ⅜” to ½” from the edges of the fabric piece.
Cut the red ribbon (which will be the tongue) so that it’s 1.5” long. Cut a triangle out of one end so it looks like a forked snake tongue.
You can cut the fabric and ribbon using scissors or a rotary tool.
Pin the red ribbon to the ‘right’ side of the fabric, between the buttons. The flat end of the ribbon should line-up with the flat end of the piece of fabric, the forked end of the ribbon should point towards the other end of the fabric piece. (The tongue should not be hanging off the end of the fabric.)
Pin the two rectangular pieces of fabric together, with ‘right’ sides facing inwards.

, Now it’s time to take your snake to the sewing machine and bring him to life.Starting on one of the 9” sides of the fabric, sew a straight line from one end of the snake TOWARDS the end with the eyes. The stitches should be ¼” from the edge of the fabric (which should be easy to measure by aligning the edge of the foot with the edge of the fabric).
Pivot around the corner and sew a straight line below where the eyes are (keep in mind you won’t be able to see the buttons, as they’ll be on the inside of the two pieces of fabric). This stitch should also anchor the red ribbon onto the fabric.
Pivot around the second corner and sew a straight line down the second 9” edge.
Remember to anchor your stitching with a backstitch at the beginning and end.
Take the fabric off the sewing machine and cut and trim all the thread.

, Before turning the snake right-side-out, trim the two corners (pointy edges) off the fabric on the eye and tongue end. This will help make it easier to flatten out the corners when the fabric is turned right-side-out.Turn the pieces of fabric so the ‘right’ sides are facing outwards. Use a stick to straighten out the corners (near the eyes) if you need to.
The tail end of the snack should be open — fold the raw edges of the fabric inside at the tail end by at least a ¼”.
Fill the snake with 3 tablespoons of plastic pellets. Use a funnel if you have to.
Use a hand stitch to sew the tail end of the snack together so the pellets don’t fall out.
Enjoy!

Use objects to demonstrate how addition works.,
Group children and use their bodies as human ""manipulatives."",
Consider having children create their own manipulatives.,
Employ game pieces in new ways to create addition games.,
Count with coins.",How to Teach a Child Addition1," Children respond well to visual tools that help them understand addition concepts. Any easily handled object may be used, from beads or blocks to Cheerios. Start with a small number of items and use a variety of tactics to demonstrate number relationships:


Give the child two small groups of items -- say, a group of two blocks and a group of three blocks. Have the child count the number of blocks in each group.
Have the child combine these two groups of objects and count the total number of blocks. Explain that he or she has ""added"" these groups together.Provide a set number of objects -- six Cheerios, for example -- and ask your child how many ways he or she can combine groups of Cheerios to make six. She might create one group of five Cheerios, for example, and one group of one.Demonstrate how you can ""add"" to a group of objects by stacking. Start with a stack of three pennies, for example, and add two more to the stack. Ask your child to count how many pennies are now in the stack.;
, In a classroom setting, take advantage of your young students' need to move around regularly by using them as human manipulatives. Utilize tactics similar to those you'd use with objects to group and combine students and have them count themselves in different configurations.(Stacking students is not recommended!)

, Use modeling clay to create manipulative objects, or combine your addition lesson with an art lesson in using scissors to create a collection of paper shapes., Dice lend themselves easily to beginning addition games. Have students roll two dice and practice adding the resulting numbers. You may also use playing cards or dominoes.When working with groups of students with varying abilities you may tailor this game to provide an extra challenge for quick learners. Instruct them to add the results of three or more dice or playing cards.

, Use money to practice adding ones, fives, tens, and even intervals of 25. This tactic teaches money skills in addition to addition, and has the added benefit of demonstrating the practical advantages of learning addition."
"
Familiarize children with addition symbols.,
Teach children the words that signify ""addition."",
Use ""fact families"" to help children understand number relationships.",How to Teach a Child Addition2," Teach them the meaning of the symbols ""+"" and ""=."" Then help them learn to write simple ""number sentences"" -- i.e. ""3 + 2 = 5.""


Begin with horizontal number sentences. Young children are already learning that they are supposed to write words and sentences ""across"" paper. Following a similar practice with number sentences will be less confusing. Once children have mastered this concept you may introduce the concept of vertical sums., Introduce terms such as ""all together, ""put together,"" ""how many in all,"" ""total,"" and ""sum"" that commonly indicate a child will need to add two or more numbers., Fact families show how the various numbers in an addition problem relate to each other. Fact families often incorporate both addition and subtraction to help students understand the inverse relationship between these two skills. The integers 4, 5, and 9, for example, are a ""fact family,"" because 4 + 5 = 9; 5 + 4 = 9; 9 - 4 = 5; and 9 - 5 = 4.Consider using milk cartons to illustrate ""fact families."" Cover cartons with paper, or a wipe-clean surface if you'd like to re-use the cartons. Have students list the integers of a fact family on the top of the carton -- for example, 4, 5, and 9. Next, have them write one fact from these numbers' ""fact family"" on each of the carton's four sides."
"
Instruct children in ""skip counting."",
Encourage children to memorize ""doubles."",
Use flash cards to stimulate memorization.",How to Teach a Child Addition3," Learning to count by twos, fives, and tens to 100 will improve your child's understanding of number relationships and begin to provide easy reference points., ""Doubles"" are math facts such as ""3 + 3 = 6"" or ""8 + 8 = 16."" Again, these facts provide easy reference points as students learn to add. A child who knows instinctively that ""8 + 8 = 16,"" for example, can more easily figure out the sum of ""8 + 9"" by simply adding one to the total., Try grouping cards by fact families to emphasize the relationships among these numbers. While students should recognize how numbers interact with each other, rote memorization of basic math facts will provide a complementary foundation for moving on to more complicated arithmetic."
"
Practice different types of story problems.,
Teach children to recognize ""join,"" ""part-part-whole,"" and ""compare"" problems.,
Utilize books that teach addition concepts.",How to Teach a Child Addition4," While some students can find story problems more complex, others will thrive when they better understand the real-world implications of learning addition. Help your child recognize three different situations that require addition:


""Result unknown"" problems -- for example, if Meredith has two cars and on her birthday she receives three more, how many cars does she now have in all?
""Change unknown"" problems -- for example, if Meredith has two cars, and after opening all her birthday presents she now has five cars, how many cars did she receive for her birthday?
""Start unknown"" problems -- for example, if Meredith receives three cars for her birthday and now she has five, how many cars did she have to start off with?, Real-world situations will involve different parameters. Understanding how these work will help your child develop tools to solve addition story problems.


""Join"" problems involve the growth of a quantity. For example, if Elizabeth bakes three cakes and Sara bakes six more, how many cakes are there altogether? ""Join"" problems may also ask students to solve for unknown change or start figures -- for example, if Elizabeth bakes three cakes and Elizabeth and Sara produce nine cakes in all, how many cakes did Sara bake?
""Part-part-whole"" problems involve adding two static figures. For example, if there are 12 girls in the class and 10 boys, how many students are in the class altogether?
""Compare"" problems"" involve an unknown in a compared set of values. For example, if Geoff has seven cookies, and he has three more cookies than Laura, how many cookies does Laura have?, Reading- and writing-oriented children may especially benefit from books that incorporate addition themes. Conduct a Web search for ""teaching addition with books"" to access lists of useful volumes compiled by educators."

Teach your child the importance of waiting.,
Play games that focus on money and spending.,
Include children in basic financial decisions.,
Explain short term versus long term financial goals.,
Have a yard sale.,
Have your child save up for something.,
Enroll your kid in a class at your local bank.,
Discuss the cost of college.,
Teach your child about responsible credit card use.",How to Teach a Child the Value of Money," Good spending habits are rooted in the ability to delay gratification. You wait for a month, for example, to buy a computer program you've been eyeing. Children begin to comprehend the concept of waiting between ages 3 and 5. This provides you with the opportunity to teach them about how waiting factors in to saving and spending.


Start small. If a child is waiting in line to use a slide or a swing set at a playground, explain to them part of life is learning to wait for the things we want.Use allowance to teach children about waiting and spending. Find a reasonably priced toy, say around $5, that your child wants and tell them they'll have to wait and save for the toy. Give the child $1 for allowance each week and, when 5 weeks pass, take the child to buy the toy.;
, Young children learn primarily through play. There are a variety of games you can engage in that will help teach them about money and spending.


The coin identification game is a great way to help kids understand different values. Many young children choose nickels over dimes strictly because of their size. Teach your kids how much each coin is worth and have them line up a series of coins from most to least valuable.Kids love to play store. Set up a variety of fake shops in your living room and allow children to spend fake money on items. Teach children between reasonable and unreasonable prices. If, for example, a child's flower shop charges $100 for a rose, step in and explain that flowers in the real world sell for much less.Oftentimes, children's games involve money and spending. Monopoly and Life focus heavily on finances. There are a variety of computer and video games that teach addition and subtraction using monetary examples., Allow children to participate in small financial decisions in the household. Introducing them to real life money situations, in addition to games, allows children to see the impact money has on day-to-day activities.


Clip coupons with your child. Even children who cannot read can participate as many coupons include pictures. Explain how coupons help save money and allow your child to identify coupons for items you buy frequently. When going to the store, give your child a small task such as holding an envelop containing the coupons.Give your child a small amount of money, $2-$3, and allow him to make decisions shopping. For example, your child can pick a fruit or vegetable for the family that it's in the provided price range.Talk out loud when you're shopping so your child understands your thinking process surrounding money. For example, ""This generic orange juice is fifty cents less than the name brand, so I'm going to buy this instead."", As children grow older, starting around age 6, their thinking becomes less based in the immediate. They're able to think longterm and comprehend certain things, like money, have finite value. This provides you with the opportunity to teach children about the importance of longterm financial planning.


Use a change jar to illustrate how money accrues overtime. Place spare change in a large glass jar and, after it's full, take your child to the bank and cash in. They can see how a collection of coins grew into a solid sum of money.Introduce a reasonable allowance, giving the child the opportunity to manage their own finances. If a child wants a particular toy, make it that they'll need to earn the money themselves by saving up their allowance.If you can afford it, consider starting a savings account for your child. Put $100 in the bank and get statements each month, showing your child how interest grows each month and the amount of money increases over time. You can even encourage your child to put a fraction of their weekly allowance into savings., A great way to show kids the concrete value money has is to allow them to gauge about how much their clothes, toys, books, and other possessions are worth. A yard sale is a great way to convey worth in a concrete manner.


Allow your child to select items they no longer use to put out for sale. Talk to them about how much they can reasonably charge for said items and allow them to sit next to the cash register as items are purchased. Give them the money they earn to save or spend as they choose.
You can also peruse yard sales in the area. Your child can see how buying items used is cheaper than going to the store. This will teach them how to be frugal about funds later in life., Help your child select a longterm financial goal, such as an expensive toy, video game, or electronic device. Teach them how to save up for the item and earn the money in a reasonable timeframe.


Remind your child of the goal as they make other financial decisions. If, for example, they want to spend $1.50 on a bottle of soda, remind them that money could go towards savings. Help them understand the difference between immediate wants, a craving for soda, and longterm wants, the particular item.
If your child is old enough to work, you could consider letting them take up a paper route or a lawn mowing business. This will allow them to learn how hard work leads to financial gain.

, Adolescence is a great time to teach children about banking and savings in a more complex manner. Many banks and credit unions provide classes to teach children about finance.


Check with your local bank or credit union. If they do not offer classes or seminars, they might be able to have an employee sit down with your child one-on-one. Bank employees might also recommend neighboring banks or credit unions that offer seminars.Your child can learn about compound interest rates using specific numbers and scenarios to show them investing money results in the amount growing over time. They can learn to calculate investment pay-offs and begin putting away small amounts of money for their own financial future., As your child enters high school, discuss college and costs of tuition. This will teach your child how to invest financially in their future, increasing the likelihood of financial stability and success longterm.


Be honest with how much money you can personally contribute and how much will need to come from outside sources. This way, your child will have realistic expectations when it comes to the cost of college.Discuss financial aid. Make sure your child understands the difference between free money and money that must be paid back. Start early when it comes to looking for scholarships, grants, and other routes to free or reduced tuition.Websites like College Scorecard can be used to explore the financial benefits of colleges. The site provides information on employment rates of alumni, the average student debt, and and whether the money spent ultimately pays off.Using the FASFA website, your child can estimate how much money they will receive in aid. This will give your child an early sense of what post graduation debt will look like, and how to go about paying off student loans., Credit card debt is a serious problem in America. The average household owes over $7,000 to credit card companies.When your child turns 18, they'll be old enough to take out credit cards and will likely be courted by credit card companies early in college. Talk to your child about credit card use throughout high school so they do not inadvertently start adulthood off in heavy debt.


Explain that you should only use a credit card if you can pay the balance in full each month. Using concrete figures for examples, show them how interest builds up if you only pay the minimum and debt can become unmanageable fast.Make sure your child knows cards are for emergencies only and they should not charge every day items to their credit card.Talk about credit scores, and how maintaining a credit card responsibly can help boost your score over time. Make sure your child knows the longterm consequences of a poor credit score and how this affects job, housing, and career prospects down the road."

Give your baby lots of tummy time.,
Limit the time your baby spends in walkers, car seats, or high chairs.,
Help your baby develop strength in his back.,
Make sure your baby is ready to crawl.,
Consider your baby's age.,
Find a comfortable place.,
Carefully place your baby on the floor on his or her back.,
Move your baby on his tummy.,
Place your baby's favorite toy just out of his reach.,
Have your baby crawl toward you.,
Place a mirror in front of the baby.,
Crawl beside your baby.,
Know your baby's limits.,
Encourage your baby after crawling time is over.",How to Teach a Baby to Crawl," Babies love playing on their tummies, and putting them on their tummies and letting them explore the ground and their bodies is essential to helping them develop their motor skills and head control, as well as the muscles in their arms and neck. You can start tummy time with your baby as soon as you can, allowing for just a minute or two of tummy time at first, which may not be comfortable for the baby. When your baby is just entering the world, he'll find tummy time uncomfortable because he won't feel much control over his body. However, giving him just a few minutes of tummy time a day from the start can help him develop -- and to learn to crawl at a faster pace.As your baby gets older, around 4 months, he may be able to lift and support his head, and to look around and gain more control over his body. This will mean he's on the way to learning to crawl.
Make tummy time fun for your baby. Talk to him in a soothing way, let him play with toys, and even get down to your baby's level so he feels more comfortable on his tummy, too.
Of course, when you put your baby down to rest, you should always put your baby down on his back, so he does not end up injuring himself, or in the worst cases, suffocating. But when he's up and in a good mood, tummy time can be very beneficial.
Make sure your baby has good associations with tummy time. Put him down on his tummy after he's fed and well rested and in a good mood. You don't want him to start tummy time when he's already cranky.;
, Though it's important for your baby to sit some of the time, you should make sure your baby is as stimulated during his waking time as possible. Contrary to their name, walkers can actually make a baby walk less quickly because he won't feel the urge to do it on his own. If you and baby are hanging out, put the baby on his tummy or just encourage movement instead of putting him in a chair and having him stare at a mobile or a toy for hours.


The more movement your baby can do without getting tired, the better. You want to encourage your baby's motion as much as you can, so he will be ready to crawl and walk when the time comes.

, Before your baby can sit up on his own, he'll need your help. If your baby tries to sit up, make sure you use your hand to support his back and head so that your baby's head doesn't get wobbly and so your baby stays upright. This will help your baby develop the muscles he'll need to hold his head up while crawling.


The more tummy time your baby has, the sooner he'll be able to sit.
You can also encourage your baby to look up by waving colorful toys above his head. This will help your baby strengthen his back, neck, and shoulder muscles.
Once your baby can lunge forward and balance on his arms, he may be ready to crawl.

, You don't want to force your baby to crawl before he's ready, because this can lead him to get hurt or just to feel discouraged by a process that he's not ready for. Instead of comparing your baby to other babies, just focus on letting your baby develop at his own pace. Babies are ready to crawl after they are able to easily sit up without support, and when they can move their heads around and have control over their arms and legs instead of flailing them. Baby should also be able to roll over. If your baby is showing these signs, then he may not be far from crawling.


Once your baby is able to sit up, he'll get more comfortable with the idea of moving onto all fours while being able to keep his head up, and to see that moving around, or just rocking, isn't so bad.
Your baby may already even be at the point where he's on all fours and gently rocks back and forth, trying to go forward. This is a sign that he is nearly ready to crawl!
If your baby is moving his or her legs equally on both sides and has strong coordination, then you shouldn't worry if you've reached the 10 month mark and if it's a no go. If you have other concerns about your baby's development, then of course you should see a doctor.
Some babies show that they're ready to crawl when they begin cross-crawling. This is when the baby uses an opposite arm and a leg to move forward instead of moving forward with the same side of the body. There are many different ways for a baby to start crawling so don't worry about having your baby do everything the way you expect it to be done.

, If your baby is 6 months or older, then he or she may be ready to start crawling. Just keep in mind that the range for crawling is, on average, between 6 months and 10 months, though many babies begin to crawl earlier, or even much later, than that. If your baby is just three months old, however, then you probably shouldn't try to get him to crawl unless he's showing signs of being ready, such as supporting his head, rolling over, dragging himself across the floor, etc.

, Your baby should learn how to crawl in a place that is comfortable and soft, but not so soft and comfortable that it is difficult for your baby to move. A blanket placed over an ordinary carpet or just a comfortable carpet will do just fine. If you have hardwood floors, you should place a nice, soft blanket over the floors. This will make your baby more comfortable and will minimize the chances of injury if your baby comes down on the floor suddenly.


Some parents also recommend that you put your baby on the ground in a onesie or a diaper, so that he or she can make direct contact with the ground. This will give your baby a stronger connection with the ground. Putting too much clothing on your baby can also lead him to feel restricted.
Make sure you have some lights on that are fairly bright. If the room is too dim, your baby is more likely to get drowsy.

, Look at your baby when you do this so you feel more connected. This can get your baby used to the floor and can reassure him that you're there. Make sure it's been at least 10-15 minutes since your baby has eaten so he's had some time to digest his food. He should be feeling calm and happy when you place him on the floor.

, If your baby is comfortable with rolling over, then he can do this himself. You may need to give him some help, and move him on his tummy. He should be able to support his head with his hands, and to comfortably move his head when it's up. He should have control over his arms and legs when he gets into this position. If he cries or looks really uncomfortable, you should try another time. But if he looks ready for more, then see some of the techniques in the next section for helping him crawl forward.

, You can talk to your baby and encourage him to get the toy, or say something like, ""Come on, come get your toy..."" to help your baby move forward. Your baby should start rocking back and forth, should start scooting his body toward the toy, or should just start to move closer to the object. Just make sure that this doesn't frustrate your baby or make him angry that he doesn't have his toy.

, You can also walk a few inches away from baby, go down to baby's level, and say, ""Come here! Come to mommy/daddy!"" Again, if they get frustrated, go to them so that they won't cry. This can help your baby want to move toward you, and to see that crawling and getting down on all fours isn't so scary. He may want to mirror you and to get closer to you, and this is another great way to motivate your baby to move forward.


When they start moving (but not crawling) hold their torso up as they move around.

, Hold or position a mirror about 10 inches (25.4 cm) in front of your baby in a position where baby can easily see his or her reflection. Baby will want to have a better, closer view of him/herself, and may try to crawl forward to do so. If you get your baby used to playing with mirrors in general, this may be even more effective.

, Instead of having your baby crawl toward you, you can also crawl alongside your baby. You and your baby can both move toward the toy, the mirror, or another parent. This will encourage your baby to do what you're doing and will make him feel less alone. He'll feel more like he's playing a game and that he wants to do what mommy and daddy, or a sibling, are doing.


Having an older sibling crawl next to your baby can also encourage your baby to crawl forward.

, When baby start crying or seems to be getting frustrated, don't force him to keep trying. Instead, wait until the next day to try again. If you try to force your baby to crawl when he's not ready or just not feeling it, then you'll delay the process and make your baby associate crawling with having a bad time. Instead, your baby should look at crawling as a fun, empowering activity.


Don't give up. Even if baby can only tolerate being on the floor for a few seconds at a time, try again later or the next day.

, Once you're done with teaching your baby to crawl for the day, make sure you give your baby lots of love and encouragement. Don't get frustrated if your baby doesn't get very far. Instead, give your baby lots of physical love and attention, a warm bottle if he needs one, a toy, or a treat if he's old enough to eat them. Your baby should have positive associations with crawling time and should feel excited to come back for more.


It goes without saying that, if your baby was crawling toward a toy, you should give it to him at the end of the exercise, even if he wasn't able to reach it himself. He should feel satisfied, not frustrated, about learning to crawl. This will make your baby even more excited about trying to crawl the next time around!
Once your baby is able to crawl and explore your home, then you can celebrate! And then, get ready to babyproof your house!

In general, it's good to take the opportunity to educate your teen about sexual health and safety, having a general ""birds and the bees"" conversation, but it's not always necessary to discuss masturbation specifically.


There's no one way, and no right way, to approach this issue. On one end of the spectrum, some sex-positive parents might find it appropriate to encourage masturbation, or even give a sex toy to a teenager and talk specifically about the difference between love and sex, while other parents on the other end of the spectrum may find the idea abhorrent.
Above all, you need to decide what you're comfortable with and what attitudes and behaviors you want to promote for your teenager as they're coming into adulthood.;
, According to most recent studies, an improved understanding of masturbation is critical to a comprehensive understanding of healthy adolescent sexual development. Instead of simply telling your teen to stop masturbating, or telling them that masturbation is normal, you should consider helping them understand how it is a part of sexual health and well being. While the conversation might seem awkward, keeping it focused on the following topics will help to alleviate the awkwardness. Take the opportunity to educate your teenager about:


Health and cleanliness
Common misconceptions
Moderation

, If the subject of sex is awkward to discuss between parents and teenagers, the subject of masturbation is possibly even more so. It's also a teachable moment and an opportunity to promote health and safety, so it's not necessarily something to ignore. It's important for you to take a step back, relax, and plan what you'll say and how you'll say it.


Your reaction to the fact that your teenager is masturbating may form a big impression on your child's body image, the way your child understands sexuality, and the way your child develops into an adult. It's important to keep this in mind.

, There's nothing psychologically or biologically wrong with a teenager who masturbates. In fact, masturbation is a normal part of healthy sexual development. But for some parents, the primary concern, if there is one, with their teenager's masturbation has to do with religious or cultural concerns. If you were raised to think that masturbation is morally wrong, it's still important to put your teenager's health at the fore of the conversation.


You don't have to discuss whether or not masturbation is ""wrong,"" even if you think it is. Instead, focus on cleanliness, pornography, and other tangential topics, to make sure your teenager doesn't develop bad habits.
Most religious texts do not address the topic of masturbation at all, leaving this form of sexuality in somewhat of a gray area. It's not recommended that you ever make a ""big deal"" of the situation, or attempt to discourage or shame your teenager. Masturbation is extremely common, physically and psychologically normal, and isn't harmful in any way.

, It's likely that your teenager has already heard a lot of urban legends and hearsay about masturbation at school, or among friends. You may have even heard these myths yourself, but aren't sure what is truth and what is fiction. It's important that you learn to distinguish between the facts and the misconceptions if you hope to guide your teenager through this.Masturbation won't lead to blindness, hairy palms, or impotency.
Nocturnal emissions or ""wet dreams"" aren't a form of masturbation and aren't the sign of ""seminal weakness"" or a poor moral character.
It's neither true that ""everyone"" or ""nobody"" masturbates. A great many people, men and woman, masturbate regularly, but it's neither necessary for a happy and well-functioning life, nor a roadblock to that life.

, Let the experts do some of this work for you, and consider giving your teenager a book about sexuality as a gift and as a guide. This can be an excellent way of alleviating some of the awkwardness of the conversation, as well as making sure that your teen gets good, sound advice about sexuality at this important stage. All of the following are excellent guides for teen sexuality:


""Changing Bodies, Changing Lives"" by Ruth Bell
""Our Bodies, Ourselves"" by Judy Norsigian
""S.E.X.: The All-You-Need-To-Know Progressive Sexuality Guide to Get You Through High School and College"" by Heather Corinna
""100 Questions You'd Never Ask Your Parents"" by Elisabeth Henderson

, The dinner table with grandma and grandpa isn't the time to bring up a sensitive subject like this. Make the conversation as brief and as painless as possible by doing it in private, at an appropriate and non-serious moment, not when you're feeling flustered because you just found some ""evidence,"" or because you're frustrated.


Try to put yourself in your teenager's shoes and anticipate how they'll feel when you bring this up. Many teens feel embarrassed and isolated, feeling as if they're the only person going through this., This may be an embarrassing conversation for your teen, so avoid probing. You don't need to know ""how often"" your teenager is masturbating, or other potentially awkward questions. Focus on what you want your teenager to know and make it relatively simple, and keep it brief. Try leading with the following script:


""I don't want to embarrass you, but you're old enough to talk about sex and masturbation and there are a few things I need you to know, ok?""

, Nothing about this conversation should communicate that your teenager is in trouble. Use a calm, even, and reassuring tone of voice, the same kind of tone you'd use when discussing household chores or homework. Make it routine.


If you're feeling upset or awkward, acknowledge the situation: ""My parents never talked to me about these things, and I wish they had. I think it's important, even though it's a little awkward.""

, If you only communicate one thing to your teenager, it should be to reassure them that what they're going through is normal and that they shouldn't feel guilty. Teenagers may be getting extremely mixed messages from their friends at school, and it can be confusing to reconcile their personal urges with what others are saying.


Try saying, ""I know what you're going through may be confusing, but you need to know that this is normal, healthy, and you don't need to feel guilty about it.""

, Another important thing to inform your teenager about is basic safety and cleanliness when it comes to masturbation. When teens are first exploring their bodies, it's possible to wander into risky behavior, and you want to make sure your teenager is informed about what to avoid.


For girls, it's important to encourage the proper washing of hands and toys, appropriate toys or devices, as well as to talk about urinary tract health and sexual activity as a part of a general discussion about sexual health.
For boys, it's important to encourage cleanliness during and after masturbation, and to discuss safe practices.

, Just because masturbation is normal and healthy doesn't mean it can't become a problem. Addiction and distraction are potential problems that teenagers face in regard to masturbation, so it's important to encourage moderation.


You don't need to get specific in terms of frequency: some people's sex drives are much higher, while others are much lower. One isn't right or wrong. Still, it's important to reinforce the idea that masturbation shouldn't get in the way of a healthy social life, other normal teenage activities, and responsibilities like school work.It's also important to encourage moderation in terms of physical sensations. Teenagers need to be gentle with their own bodies as their sexuality develops, taking care to avoid injury, but practicing healthy sexuality.
All teens must become accustomed to controlling and understanding sexual desires, distinguishing lust from love.

, The best thing that you can offer your teenager at this stage is an open door. Make yourself available for questions, and endeavor to answer those questions as openly and honestly as possible, without making things too awkward. Don't press the issue, if your teen isn't interested in talking more, make sure to end the conversation by letting your child know that you're always happy to talk.

, If your child has reached sexual maturity, they will benefit from having a conversation about masturbation. You don't ""need proof"" and you don't need to snoop through your child's private life, inspect their sheets and undergarments, or dig around on their computer browser history to have a good idea that your teenager is probably masturbating, or at least experiencing an upswing in hormone production that has thrown their sex drive into high gear.

, There's no reason to punish masturbation, unless you're concerned that a teenager has developed an addiction, in which case you should probably seek professional guidance. Doing this can be confusing and traumatic for teenagers, and it's best avoided.

, Remember that education is different from setting rules. Often, when someone has enough of the right information, they can set their own rules. This may be a good learning experience for many teens. If you choose to sit down with your teen and talk about this issue, remember that simple education can can make a positive influence on your teenager.

, Some teenagers will be mortified at the thought of talking to a parent about masturbating, and that's understandable. It's an intensely private behavior that's not common to discuss in any situation. If you feel you must bring it up for the safety and health of your teenager, do so, but also recognize when it's time to draw the line and end the conversation, short of awkward specifics.


Don't snoop after what you suspect to be fact, and don't feel the need to make remarks when you notice your teen lingering in the bathroom during a shower. If you've done your job and had the conversation, leave it alone.
If you feel you must, or feel your teenager has a masturbation problem, address it by limiting your teen's time alone and restricting Internet access if necessary.

If your town does not have a vandalism hotline, call your local non-emergency police number. Note that this is not the same as the emergency number. It should be a 10-digit number starting with your local area code.

, In some jurisdictions, you may be able to file a report of vandalism or graffiti online. A few examples of cities with an online reporting service are San Francisco,Sacramento,or Irving, Texas.To find out if your local police department will accept an online report, check the website for your police department.

File a police report.,
File an auto insurance claim.,
File a homeowner’s insurance claim.",How to Report Vandalism2," If you discover that your property has been vandalized or broken into, call the police to file a report. Be careful not to interfere with any evidence until the police arrive to write a report., If you have comprehensive auto coverage, your insurance company will likely pay to restore your car after vandalism has occurred. You will need to be able to provide a copy of a police report, along with any photos or other evidence of the damage., If the damage was done to your house or other property, but not your car, you may be covered by your homeowner’s insurance instead. Contact your insurance company to make a claim. You will still need to show evidence of the damage and a copy of the police report."

Emphasize your child’s qualities.,
Encourage your child to be satisfied with how they look.,
Compliment your child.,
Encourage your child’s involvement in activities.,
Talk to your children about the importance of physical activity.,
Teach respect for people of all body types.",How to Talk to Your Kids About Body Image1," While it’s important for your child to take pride in the way they look, your child should not place their worth on their looks. Make sure that your child learns that body image and self worth comes from everything, including traits, qualities, and talents that they have. Place less emphasis on looks and more emphasis on how your child acts.For example, your child should realize that their compassion, intelligence, humor, and inquisitive nature are all things to be confident about. These things are just as important as their looks in making them a worthy person.
When you child does something nice for someone else, tell them, ""I'm proud that you shared your toy"" or ""Thank you for carrying the neighbor's bag for her. That was very kind of you."" If your child asks a lot of question, encourage that behavior by saying, ""It is wonderful that you are so interested in the world. Keep asking questions about things you are interested in. Why don't you start trying to find the answers? Maybe we can do it together."";
, One of the main tendencies for young people is to compare themselves to others. They may compare themselves to peers or people on television, many of whom are much older playing younger teens. Help your child learn to be happy with how they look instead of comparing themselves to someone else.Your child may be upset because they have acne and other teens don’t, or they have had a growth spurt that makes them taller than everyone else.
Tell your child, “Acne is a natural part of puberty. There is nothing to be embarrassed about. However, we will get you some acne wash to help heal it up” or “Yes, that other girl does have pretty hair. And so do you. You may look different, but you have nice features too, such as your eyes and smile.”
Point out to your child that people on television and magazines are not a realistic image of someone. You can talk about photoshop, makeup artists, CGI, and touch ups, which display an unrealistic image in the media.

, Provide positive feedback to your child, not criticism. You should compliment your child’s looks, qualities, and talents. Providing a body positive environment at home can help them develop self-confidence and feel more self-assured around their peers.For example, you may say, “That shirt looks nice on you,” “Your guitar skills are really improving,” or “That was a really kind thing you did for our neighbor. You are such a kind and thoughtful person.” Praise their physical capabilities, like their strength, energy, or balance, along with qualities, like intelligence, humor, or compassion.
Avoid criticizing your child, even if you are joking. Teasing your child for being “chubby” or “slow,” or having pimples, a squeaky voice, or being at an awkward height can negatively affect their self-esteem.
Teach your child to give compliments to him or herself as well. Try to encourage your child to find one nice thing to say to him or herself every day. For example, your child might give him or herself a compliment by saying, ""Whoa! Look how strong my legs look in these volleyball shorts."" Or, ""My hair looks so good curly, I'll let it air dry again today.""

, One way to help your child’s body image is to get them involved in activities. When you talk to your child about body image, ask them what they are interested in. Support your child’s interests and help them find validation and confidence through the pursuit of their interests and talents.For example, if your child is interested in music, let them take voice, piano, or guitar lessons. If they are interested in drawing, encourage them to paint, draw, or take photos. Let them join a sport or take dance lessons.
Help your child realize that body image and self-confidence comes from multiple sources, not just their looks.

, Nutritious eating is only part of developing a healthy body and body image. Physical activity is another key part of a healthy lifestyle. Discuss with your child the importance of physical fitness and taking care of their body. Remind them that sports or going to the gym are not the only ways they can be active.Encourage your child to try different types of activities. They may love team sports, or a one-on-one sport like tennis. They may prefer to run or walk, do martial arts, learn yoga, or try a dance class.
Find ways for the whole family to be active together. Go on hikes and nature walks, ride bikes together, or swim at a lake.

, Children are surrounded by society telling them that fat is bad or ugly. The media also supports the idea that people who look different are somehow less. You should teach your child that everyone is important and valid, no matter their body shape or the way they look. Don’t allow your children to make fun of kids who weigh more, kids who have special needs, or kids who are different in other ways. Encourage positive talk about people who look different.You should teach that everyone is different, and that different is beautiful. People have different hair colors, body shapes, skin colors, and features, and all of this is okay.
For example, if you and your child see someone who looks different, say, ""That person looks different from you. The world is full of interesting, beautiful people of all different shapes and looks.""
If your child makes fun of someone, correct them and teach them to respect others. You can say, ""You shouldn't make fun of people who are different than you. It is okay that people are different. Try getting to know people different than you and being friends with them. You can learn so much from people different than you and see how beautiful everyone is no matter what they look like.""

"
Reassure your child when they express self-criticism.,
Set boundaries for personal grooming.,
Talk about the perfection myth.,
Avoid gender stereotypes.",How to Talk to Your Kids About Body Image2," As your child grows up and hits puberty, they will more than likely start self-criticizing themselves. They may spend more time at the mirror or do extra grooming activities. Help them stop criticizing themselves by providing acceptance, understanding, and positive reassurance.For example, your child may say things like, “I hate my nose,” “I’m too short,” or “I’m ugly.” Reassure them that these things are not true or there is nothing wrong with the way they look. Help remind them not to compare themselves to others and value their uniqueness.
Try to teach your child how to talk back when they have these kinds of thoughts. For example, you might tell your child something like, ""I know how you feel when you say you don't like a part of your body. Did you know that sometimes our brains can be too over-critical and a lot of the time those types of thoughts aren't even true? When I find myself saying my nose is too big, I remind myself that my nose is just my nose, and I tell my brain to hush about my nose because there are so many more fun things for me to focus on.""

, To help your child learn healthy body image and self-discipline, you should help them set boundaries where their personal grooming is concerned. Allow them to spend time on their hair, makeup, and clothes, but help them refrain from obsessing about it.For example, you may allow them a certain amount of time in the bathroom each morning, but help them understand that they should share the space with others. Allow them to buy new clothes occasionally, but help them not spend all their money obsessing about buying clothes and accessories.
If your child is too obsessed with their looks or spending excessive amounts of time in front of the mirror, talk to them about balancing their life. Help them realize that their looks are only one aspect of their personality.
If you believe your child has a problem, such as Body Dysmorphic Disorder, you should take them to see a doctor or psychologist.

, Your child may think that they have to look or act perfect. They may look at people on television or in their classes and believe they are perfect. Help them realize that there is no such thing as a perfect person, body, or look. Let your child know there is no one way for people to look or act.For example, your child may believe that the popular kids in their class are perfect, or that actors in movies are perfect. Remind them everyone has things that they don’t like about themselves or feel insecure about, and that is okay. However, reassure them that no one can be perfect and that trying to be perfect is an unachievable goal.
Tell your child, ""No one is perfect. You shouldn't try to be perfect. Even though you may think someone is perfect, remember, everyone has flaws, and that is okay.""

, Gender stereotypes can negatively affect a child’s body image. Teaching your daughter they should only like dolls and pink and your son that he should like sports and not show emotion can create unrealistic and harmful expectations for your child. Instead, talk to your children about how they can like or do anything no matter their gender.For example, some girls like trucks and sports and some boys like dolls and the color pink. Eliminate gender constraints on your child so they can learn to be confident in themselves no matter their interests or likes.
Hypermasculine images that depict men as aggressive with large muscles can teach young people incorrect assumptions about men and masculinity. Hyperfeminine portrayals of women in skimpy clothes with large breasts, or acting helpless and unintelligent sends the wrong message to young people. Limit your child’s exposure to these images, and if they see them, help them understand that those stereotypes are not reality."

Prioritize healthy choices in your family.,
Monitor what you say.,
Focus on being healthy instead of weight loss.,
Eliminate certain words from your home.",How to Talk to Your Kids About Body Image3," You should make healthy choices a priority in your family. You should teach your child about making healthy food choices and getting enough physical activity. Include your child in the process of choosing foods and activities. This helps your child feel part of the family and gain confidence in their own choices.


For example, take your child shopping with you and let them help you choose vegetables, fruits, and healthy grains. Let your child choose which healthy snacks they would like to eat.
Encourage your child to choose activities for the family to participate in. Your child may decide that the family should go hiking, bicycling, or to the park to play a game of baseball.

, Your children learn from you. This means you should always think about what you are teaching them. This is especially important with body image. The way you view and talk about your own body will filter down to your child. Speak about yourself in positive terms to set a good example.For example, refrain from saying things like, “I look so fat today” or “This dress makes me look huge.” You should also avoid saying things like, “She looks like she’s gained weight” or “Wow, that man is fat.”

, If you or someone in your family needs to lose weight, think about the way you present that to your child. Focus on making healthy eating choices and getting physical activity instead of dieting or losing weight. Be careful not to participate in excessive or obsessive workout routines, which could send the wrong message to your child. Tell your child you are choosing to live a healthier lifestyle.Emphasizing the importance of a healthy lifestyle can help your child adopt good habits and have a better self-image than focusing so much on weight or the number on the scale.

, Another way you can help develop a healthy self-image for your child is to avoid using certain words. When you talk about body image, you may want to stay away from words like “fat” or “skinny.” You may not want to talk about weight and numbers, and avoid the word “diet.”Labelling people based on their size can be damaging to a child’s body image. Focusing on the number on the scale and learning that dieting is a solution that will make their body more acceptable can lead to eating disorders and unhealthy behaviors.

Stay calm.,
Let the child cry.,
Comfort the child.,
Give them some space.,
Acknowledge appropriate behavior.,
Redirect the child.",How to Respond to a Frustrated Child1," Your attitude will affect the child's. Do not allow yourself to get frustrated by the child’s outburst. Children will pick up on your tension and frustration, and it may make the situation worse and more difficult to handle.If you are finding yourself frustrated or worked up by the situation, walk away for a few minutes if you are able to. Take a five-minute timeout in the bathroom if you need to. If you are not able to, try deep breathing in order to stay calm.
You could say, “I need to use the bathroom. Keep working on this puzzle until I get back, and if you’re still frustrated, let’s find something else to do!”
If your co-parenting​ is available, ask them to take over when you're feeling frustrated. We all have limits, and sometimes it's better to switch off the parenting duties.;
, If the child is upset, let them be. If they want one, you can give them a hug, or sit next to them while they are sad. Don’t tell them to stop crying.If you tell a child to stop crying, they may feel that their sad feelings aren’t valid. It also doesn’t make a child feel any better. Instead, acknowledge their sadness and say something like, “I know you’re sad that you couldn’t play with Fatima today.”
The child may also be angry and acting out. As long as the behavior isn’t distracting (as in a classroom environment) or harming anyone, including the child, let them get out their frustrations physically. They might want to rip a piece of paper, stomp their feet, or punch a pillow.
You can say, “It’s okay to be frustrated that you can’t draw the picture the way you want. I bet you feel pretty mad and sad right now. What do you need to do to get these feelings out?”

, When kids are acting out or upset, most of the time they are looking for someone to connect with them in their sadness, frustration, or anger. One of the best things you can do for an upset person, young or old, is to simply be with them as they work through their emotions. Sometimes that can feel scary, particularly for kids, and it is helpful to have the calming, soothing presence of a trusted adult with them.Use your nonverbal behavior to help the child learn how to cope. Sit still, take deep breaths, and move calmly and slowly. Over time, your child will hopefully duplicate your behaviors.
Give the child a hug, or let them sit on your lap and hold them if it’s appropriate. You don’t need to say anything, you can just be present with them and let their emotions run their course.
Hold them while they cry, or sit next to them while they punch some play dough, for example.
Once they seem to have calmed down, then you can talk about their feelings more in-depth.

, If their frustration has turned into a full-blown temper tantrum, the best thing you may be able to do for the child is to let the tantrum run its course. Ensure their behavior will not harm themselves or others, but otherwise, step back and let the child work through it. Before you walk away, however, tell your child that you are giving them space, why you're doing it, and where you'll be. This will help them understand that you aren't abandoning them.Say, ""I can see that you're upset, so I'm going to give you some time and space alone because that usually helps me feel better. If you want to talk or get a hug, I'll be in the kitchen making lunch.""
You may wish to sit nearby and read a book while the temper rages. This way, you are still present with the child, but you are not paying attention to them and feeding the tantrum.
If they are a distraction, or at risk of causing injury, you may need to remove the child. If you are at home, send the child up to their room. If you are in a classroom setting, you may wish to remove the child to a corner of the room, if possible. You could say, “You need to stay here until you have calmed down enough so that we can talk some more. Right now I think you are too wound up to have a conversation.”
If you are afraid that the child could harm you, remove yourself from the situation. Do not try to make them go somewhere else., After they have calmed down, talk to them about the good ways in which they managed their frustration. During your discussion, help your child understand other coping strategies that they can use. When possible, find ways for your child to use their interests and passions as a way to cope with life's frustrations. This may help them better deal with frustrating situations in the future, and have better strategies to calm themselves down.You could say, “Wow, you seemed really angry that you spilled your milk and had to clean it up. But I liked that you took a few deep breaths, then asked me to help you get some more paper towels.”

, If the child has not gotten too frustrated or upset, you could try to redirect their attention to another activity. Look for another toy or book that might occupy their attention, or ask if they want to take a break from their current activity.Once they've calmed down, bring them back to the original activity. This will help them learn to cope with and overcome obstacles.


You could say, “Let’s take a break from trying to build this for a few minutes. Would you like to go read a book with me on the couch?”
For an older child, you could point out their frustration and suggest they step back for a few minutes. For example, “You’ve been working on that math problem for twenty minutes! No wonder you’re getting frustrated. Why don’t you go shoot some baskets for a few minutes to get a little break?”

Use calming, attentive body language.,

Ask the child what they are feeling.,
Empathize with the child.,
Admit you can’t do things perfectly, either.,
Help your child reassess their expectations.,
Tell your child when you are experiencing frustrations.",How to Respond to a Frustrated Child2," Show the child that you are actively interested in what they have to say through your body language. Put your whole focus on the child and avoid being distracted while talking to them.


Kneel down to the child's level.
Do your best to make eye contact with the child, but don’t force it.
Speak in a quiet, calm voice.

, Acknowledge their frustration, sadness, or anger. Naming their feelings helps the child find the words to describe their experience and emotions. You can help them better communicate their feelings for the next time they encounter a challenging situation.Lots of feelings are very difficult to discern. They feel very similar in the body, and the child might not have the word to describe “frustrated.” So they cry or get angry instead, which is normal.Tell them how you might feel if the same thing happened to you. For example, “If someone had taken my favorite toy at school and wouldn’t let me have a turn playing with it, I would be angry, too. I would be mad that I had to wait my turn.”

, See if they can describe their emotions. If they do not have the words to describe what they are feeling, see if they can point to where they feel it in their body.


Ask open-ended questions like, “How did it feel when that happened?” or “What happened that made you so angry?”
You could ask younger children to describe the physical feelings in their body. Have them point to where they feel things in their body and ask them to describe the feeling. You could give the child an example, like “Sometimes when I make a mistake, I feel a scary feeling in my tummy.”
Older children may be able to better describe their feelings, and may only require a little help in naming them. They might say, “I felt really stupid having to wear that shirt to school,” and you could say, “It sounds like you were embarrassed.”

, Try to put yourself in the child’s shoes and imagine how you might feel if the same thing happened to you when you were their age. Keep in mind, you didn’t have the same level of life experience that you do now, nor did you likely have the words to describe how you felt.You could say something like, “I’m sure it’s really frustrating to be told you need to go to bed when you’re in the middle of something fun. I can see how it would have been upsetting and felt like it came out of nowhere. Next time, I’ll give you a warning first.”

, If the child is struggling with being successful at an activity, let them know that no one was born knowing how to do everything. Acknowledge that you, and everyone else in the world, makes mistakes and needs to practice.


If you make a mistake, point it out to the child to normalize mistakes and diminish their power. “Oops, I forgot to put the cookies in a place where the dog couldn’t get them. I’m a little mad at myself that I didn’t remember, because now we have no cookies, but it was just a mistake.”Talk to the child about the importance of practice and working hard to achieve a goal. You could say, “I know it’s overwhelming to keep making mistakes and not know what you’re doing. But I promise, if you keep working at it and practicing, it will get easier, and you will get better at it.”

, People often set unrealistic expectations for themselves, and children are no exception. Talk to your child about what they expected from the situation that made them frustrated, and then review why that expectation was or was not reasonable. For example, if your child expected to hit a home run at their first little league outing, then you can help them understand why that expectation may have been too high.

Explain, ""While it's good to set high expectations, you also need to understand that most people will fall short. It takes time and hard work to get there, so don't give up because you didn't meet your goal this time.""
Say, ""I like to see you aiming so high, but sometimes setting high goals for ourselves makes it hard to reach them.""
Help them reform their unreasonable expectations to make them reasonable so that they will know how to do so in the future. For example, they could set an expectation to attend all practices and games for the season, as well as to gradually increase their batting average.

, One of the best ways to help your child learn to manage their emotions is to model good behavior for them. While that can seem like a challenge, an easy way to accomplish modeling is to tell your child when you encounter an issue and then tell them how you'll deal with it. Show them your problem-solving methods and let them see how it can work successfully.

If your child never sees you work through issues, they may assume that you don't face any. This can cause your child to feel that something is wrong with them.
You don't need to tell them about serious issues such as missed mortgage payments or health scares. Instead, tell them when you're frustrated that the store is sold out of your favorite haircare product or when your friend forgot about your lunch date.
Say, ""I'm really frustrated that they don't have my shampoo. Now I'm going to have to make an extra trip to the store instead of getting to spend time on something else. Maybe I can try another brand this one time.""

Help child to identify the problem.,
Have the child propose solutions to the problem.,
Imagine the outcome with the child.,
Consider stepping in.,
Schedule an appointment with a mental health professional.",How to Respond to a Frustrated Child3," Help the child pinpoint what is causing them to feel frustrated. It may be helpful for you to break down the frustrating activity step-by-step in order to focus the frustration to its smallest possible point. For example, your child came home frustrated after a day of school, announcing “I hate school!” After talking to your child, you find out that they had a difficult time with math today. Your child just started learning about fractions and was confused. “Hating school” narrows down to “confused about fractions,” which is a much more manageable problem to solve.

, Have your child come up with a few ways to deal with the frustrating issue. Some of the solutions to the problem could also be ways for the child to remain calm. Praise your child for their suggestions and their willingness to try solving the problem rather than giving up.


For example, if your child is having trouble with a certain subject in school, you might ask them to brainstorm some ways to improve their study skills, pay attention in class, and calm down if they are feeling overwhelmed by the material.
You could ask, “How do you calm yourself down? Do you have any good ways to do it that always work for you? What are a few that you could choose from the next time you are in a situation like this?”

, Have the child imagine what would happen if they implemented one of their ideas. You could even role-play the suggestion to help the child practice and gain confidence.For example, you could say, “I’m going to pretend that I’m you. I’m practicing the piano and I can’t get a part right. I’m getting really mad at myself. Now I’m going to try your suggestion of slowing down the tempo and playing very slowly. Oh, look! It’s easier for me to to find the right notes when I am slowing down. I am going to repeat this over and over again until my fingers know where they need to go.”
You could ask, “What do you think it will be like if you try asking your teacher for help tomorrow? What do you think he will say?”

, In some cases, children aren’t equipped to handle problems on their own, or they may be too emotional to effectively deal with it. Sometimes it may be best for you to “fix” the problem.Step in if a child is becoming aggressive towards someone else. You could say, “I’m sorry you’re frustrated, but that does not give you an excuse to hit. You need to come into the other room with me now.”
Step in if the behavior is escalating. For example, if a child is becoming frustrated while trying to build something, and begins throwing the blocks out, step in and have the child take a break to cool down.
If you do need to step in, explain to your child why you did it and why you made the choices that you did. Make sure that they know that you will not always be there to step in. This will help your child understand how they can solve their problems in the future.

, If the frequency of your child's frustration is increasing or often requires intervention, you may need to take them in to be evaluated by a mental health professional to make sure that there are no underlying issues that are contributing to the problem. While you may be hesitant to seek professional care, it's very important that your child get the help they need."

Stay calm.,
Do not pick sides or place blame.,
Encourage your kids to describe their feelings to each other.,
Ask them to come up with a solution to the issue.",How to Reduce Arguments Between Your Kids1," Try not to get upset or angry at your kids when they fight. Displaying anger can end up causing the situation to escalate and make your kids even more upset. Take a deep breath when you address an argument between them and remain calm. Act unfazed by their argument and maintain your cool.To stay calm, you can take a few deep breaths before you address your fighting kids. Or you may close your eyes for a second to calm down and then address them.;
, As the parent, it is not your responsibility to be the referee for the argument between your kids. Avoid picking sides or placing blame on any of your kids. Doing this will only make one child feel hurt or left out. Often, this also results in the arguments getting worse or more intense between your kids.Try not to use the phrases, “It’s your fault”, “Who is responsible for the argument?” or “What did you do?” when speaking to your kids during a fight.

, To help break up an argument, encourage your kids to resolve them on their own with your guidance. Start by having your kids describe their feelings to each other using “I” statements. Tell them, “Explain how your brother’s actions made you feel using ‘I feel’” or “Tell your sister how your actions made you feel using ‘I feel’.” This will allow your kids to express themselves on their own and be aware of how they are both feeling during the argument.Explain to your kids that what they are feeling is valid, but that reacting to their feelings with anger or violence towards someone else is not okay. Discuss the importance of listening to other people’s feelings and taking into account the feelings of others before they act.

, Rather than try to come up with a solution for your kids, ask them to do this themselves. Put the responsibility of coming up with a solution to an issue on your kids so they learn how to resolve issues themselves. You may ask them, “How can you both resolve this issue?” or “What is the solution to this problem between you two?”Have your kids talk out the issue and reach a resolution together. Encourage them to keep talking to work it out by reminding them to use “I” statements and to express how they are feeling. Tell them to be good listeners for each other and to respectfully pay attention to what is being said.

Show your kids how to share.,
Teach your kids how to express their feelings.,
Encourage your kids to appreciate one another.",How to Reduce Arguments Between Your Kids2," To reduce the number of arguments between your kids, teach them important skills like how to share. Make sure they know sharing is voluntary and they are never required to share. Sharing should be a choice or an option they choose when they play with others. This way, they learn to choose to share, rather than feel forced to do it.If it is not possible for sharing to be voluntary in your home, such as an instance where you only have one of the same toy to share among two or three kids, encourage your kids to share with each other. Intervene in a positive way if they fight over a toy and guide them on how to share.
For example, you can intervene in a fight between your kids over a toy by asking one child, “Can we share the toy with your brother?” Then, have the other child wait while their brother decides to share.
It can be hard on one child to wait for their turn to share. You can speed up the process by asking the waiting child, “It can be hard to wait for a toy, I know. Can you ask your brother again to share the toy with you?” Make sure to have a different toy for the child to play with while they are waiting for their sibling to finish playing with the toy.

, Often children fight because they do not know another way to communicate with their peers. Teaching your kids how to express how they are feeling can help them communicate with others in a calm, civil way, rather than fight or squabble all the time. Try to get your kids to learn how to express their feelings early in their development, to you, to their siblings, and to themselves.For example, encourage your kids to use “I feel” or “This makes me feel like…” when talking about a situation. Teach them different expressions of feeling, such as “I feel angry,” “I feel concerned,” or “I feel worried.”
It is important for children to develop empathy, which means they are able to recognize other people’s feelings and relate to them, by around the age of 3 or 4. Otherwise, the child may not understand why apologizing to a child who is crying is important and they may think this is just a form of manipulation. To help your child develop empathy, ask them things like, “How do you think your brother/sister is feeling?”, Strengthening the bond between your kids can help them feel they are a team and need to work together, rather than fight with each other. Encourage your kids to learn to appreciate one another, focusing on the positive things they do for each other. Get your kids to view themselves as part of one unit and emphasize the importance of getting along together as a team.For example, you may tell your kids, “Think of a positive thing your brother has done for you lately,” or “Tell me something you appreciate about your sister.”

Spend one on one time with your kids.,
Reward positive behavior from your kids.,
Be a good listener for your kids.,
Set a good example for your kids.,
Avoid situations where your kids tend to fight or argue.,
Consider a therapist if the arguments get worse.",How to Reduce Arguments Between Your Kids3," Sometimes kids fight to get attention. You may notice your kids fighting more when you are not present in their day to day lives or less involved in their daily routine. Address this issue by spending one on one time with each child on a more constant basis. Doing this can help your kids feel acknowledged and loved, leading to less fighting between them.For example, you may take 10 minutes out of your day to play with one child and then spend 10 minutes tucking your other child into bed. Or you may set aside 30 minutes to hang out with one child and then 30 minutes to spend time with your other child.
If you have a partner, you may also talk to them about having more one on one time with each child on a more constant basis. You may plan outings with each child so you spend quality time together and bond.

, If you see your kids modeling good behavior, acknowledge it and encourage it. Doing so will let them know that acting in a positive way is beneficial for them and should make them feel good. You may reward them with verbal praise, such as, “It was nice of you to share with your sister, thank you for doing that” or “I appreciate that you worked out the fight as a team, great going both of you.”You can also give your kids material rewards for positive behavior, such as a candy or a new toy. However, try not to give your kids material rewards only, as this can cause them to expect items as rewards all the time.
Experiential rewards, such as a trip to get ice cream or a fun outing as a family, can often be more effective than material rewards.

, Being a good listener for your kids can make them feel supported and acknowledged. Try not to brush off complaints or concerns from your kids. Sit down with them and be a good listener so they know their voice matters. Ask them thoughtful questions to help them express their feelings and maintain eye contact when they are speaking to you so they know you are listening.For example, perhaps your child expresses anger at their sibling for taking their toy. You may then ask your child, “Why does that make you upset?” Listen to your child’s response and encourage them to express their feelings to you.

, Your kids will watch your behavior and model themselves after you. Be a good role model for your kids so they learn how to share, play well together, and appreciate each other. Be caring, generous, and compassionate when you are around other adults and other children. Avoid fighting or arguing in front of your kids, as this can end up reinforcing negative behaviors where conflict is acceptable.For example, you and your partner may have a ""no fighting in front of the kids"" rule, where you agree to keep arguments away from your children. Or you may try to work through issues with your partner in a calm, collected manner rather than shout or yell at each other so your kids learn how to deal with conflict in a positive way.

, As a parent, you may know that there are certain situations where your kids tend to fight or argue. Your kids may fight over the same toy or they may argue over who goes to bed first at night. Be aware of any patterns in your kids' behavior and avoid these situations to reduce the fighting between your kids. You can also try preparing for these situations in advance so there is less arguing.

For example, if you know your kids tend to fight over the same toy, you may have a talk with them about the importance of sharing the toy. Then, if they do end up fighting over the toy, you can remind them of the talk you had earlier and encourage them to share.
You can also try having two toys on hand so both child is occupied with a toy and there is less fighting when it comes to play time.

, If the arguments between your kids do not get better and appear to be getting more angry or physical, you may want to bring them to a therapist. You may go to the therapist as a family to try to work on these issues or bring your kids to a child therapist.Speak to the therapist beforehand and describe the situation. The therapist should be able to recommend which type of therapy would be best for your kids.
Your primary care doctor can recommend a child therapist. Your pediatrician may also be able to give you a referral to a child therapist.

Choose your battles.,
Stay in control of yourself.,
Ask probing questions.,
Stay firm with rules and consequences.,
Don’t justify your rules and decisions.,
Praise politeness.,
Don’t confuse back-talk with verbal abuse.",How to Reply when Your Kid Talks Back1," Like it or not, children are wired to challenge, question, and second-guess you. They don’t yet have an adult’s impulse control or perception of consequences, and it is natural for them to test boundaries. So, without being a pushover, it’s best for both of you if you more tightly define your notion of unacceptable back-talk.You might, for instance, let a sour smirk and some muttering under the breath go without mention. However, an “I won’t do it!” or “I wish I had Judy’s parents!” should be addressed.;
, You might already encourage your tantrum-throwing toddler to “take a deep breath and count to ten,” and this is good advice for you as well. If you feel your blood starting to boil after after a shouted “No! You clean it up!”, wait to respond until you can do so calmly and rationally.Children talk back to test boundaries and to test you. They also learn by watching you, so make sure they see how to properly respond to provocation. Instead of “Don’t talk to me like that!”, try “That was hurtful and not a nice way to speak to me.” The more rationally you can speak to your child, the better the example you will be setting for them.

, Both teens and younger kids often lash out at parents as undeserved targets for back-talk. You can help both of you understand the cause of the back-talk by asking questions that encourage self-reflection: “That was hurtful to say. What made you choose to speak to me in that way?”You can also ask for clarification to help children develop their communication skills: “I’m not sure I understood what you meant by calling me a super-meany.” ""Can you explain it to me in another way?""; or “I know you want to be treated more like an adult — can you rephrase that in a more mature manner?”, While you should empathize with the feelings of powerlessness and lack of control that kids deal with, that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t address the back-talk that often emerges from these feelings. Clearly define your expectations and rules for your child, as well as the consequences of ignoring them.If you’ve clearly established that an outright refusal to complete a requested task or a nasty personal remark equals no social media for three days, hold fast. You’re doing your child a disservice if they come to believe that talking back or slacking off pays off.

, While shouting back “Just do as I say!” is not the healthiest way to deal with back-talk, it is also not your responsibility as a parent to justify every policy you have and choice you make to your child. Make your rules thoughtfully and responsibly, express them clearly, and hold to them without wavering and without negotiation.So, respond to that endless “But why?!” with a superior version of “Because I said so,” such as “Those are the rules here and they need to be followed.” Sometimes it is best to simply walk away. Children will try to test your patience with snarky remarks, but do not let it get to you.

, It is common for parents to correct bad behavior, but to ignore good behavior. While you’re working hard to remain calm and turn episodes of talking back into positive learning experiences, don’t forget to notice and praise every instance in which back-talk is avoided or politeness is offered. Teach kids that polite acceptance is welcomed, appreciated, and rewarded.For instance, say: “Thanks so much for coming up for bathtime so quickly” or “I’m proud of you for cleaning up your stuff when I asked you.”
When they apologize for talking back, thank them as well.

, While you as a parent will have to determine what constitutes foul language or excessive name-calling, intentionally hurtful verbal attacks and any type of physical assault should not be brushed off as back-talk. If your child consistently loses all self-control or tries to specifically wound you with words, you may have a more serious issue to deal with.Just as with typical back-talk, don’t angrily reply with a verbal barrage or respond physically. Remain composed and express that the behavior is wrong and won’t be tolerated. Consider enlisting the help of a child or family therapist for ongoing problems.

"
"
Praise them when they do well.,
Model the behavior you want them to display.,
Give kids a transition period along with your commands.,
Look for root causes.,
Encourage healthier avenues for expression.,
Create a “back-talk window” for them.,
Reassess the rules every so often.,
Let them deal with consequences more often.",How to Reply when Your Kid Talks Back2," Positive reinforcement helps to reinforce positive behaviors and is more effective than negative reinforcement. This can help to encourage your child to do the things you want them to do more often.For example, if your child gets a good grade in school, then praise them for the good grade. If they help out around the house, praise them for helping out.

, Small children are like sponges when it comes to picking up habits and behaviors from adults, and even teens (although they won’t admit it) take cues from their parents. If you regularly whine, complain, grumble, snap back, or otherwise talk back when dealing with other people, your kids will normalize this behavior. Don’t just tell them that talking back is inappropriate; show them.Instead of snipping to your spouse “Can’t you take out the trash for once — I’m busy!” try “Can I do it in a little while, or can you take it out this time while I finish up what I’m doing here?” Remember that if you frequently model a type of behavior, such as making rude comments to your spouse, then your child will think this is unacceptable.

, With children, statements as routine as “It’s time to get cleaned up for dinner” can lead to explosive outbursts. While kids can have famously short attention spans, they can also have difficulty transitioning from one activity (especially one they’re engrossed in) to another. Therefore, build in some adjustment time for them.Try, for instance: “In ten minutes it will be time to stop playing and wash up for dinner.” Give five- and two-minute reminders as well.

, More often than not, the back-talk has little to do with any personal animus towards you, even if you are directly accused of being mean or unfair. While it’s natural to feel insulted when you’re challenged or called names, ignore this inclination and look for deeper causes of the back-talk.Especially if you are noticing an uptick in talking back, do some sleuthing and talk to your child about possible causes like school stress, relationship troubles, bullying, and so on. See if the back-talk as a warning sign and an opportunity to help your child.

, Talking back isn’t the most helpful way to process and express emotions, but kids and adults often use it for that reason anyway. Work with your kids to develop better ways to deal with anger, anxiety, frustration, and other emotions that can boil over into back-talk.Encourage emotional expression through activities like journaling, drawing pictures, squeezing or bouncing a ball, deep breathing, taking a walk, or simply having a conversation. It may be easier to encourage younger kids to embrace these methods, but even strong-willed teens can come around once they see the benefits.

, You aren’t likely to be able to eliminate back-talk, but you may be able to corral it. Try setting aside a defined time each week — Saturdays after breakfast or whenever else — when your kid can freely (but respectfully) express their grievances, gripes, and groans. This might be especially helpful with teens.Think of it as lifting the lid off a boiling pot of water to release the steam every few minutes instead of letting it boil over unexpectedly. Ideally, you’ll turn a potential point of confrontation (antagonistic back-talk) into an opportunity for a fruitful weekly conversation.

, Talking back is not a justifiable way for a child to express displeasure with your rules and expectations, but constant back-talk may indicate that a “policy review” is warranted on your part. Every parent knows just how fast kids grow up, and sometimes the rules can lag behind the reality.Don’t cave in on the spot and move bedtime or curfew back an hour, or the child will think that whining works. Instead, agree to sit down in the near future and discuss a change, then announce any changes at a point after the meeting (so it is clear that it is your decision and there is no room for debate).

, This can be one of the toughest things for a parent to do — allow your kid to fail or flounder when you know it’s going to happen. If their back-talk is a refusal to do something you know they’ll regret not doing, you may be serving them best by letting them find out the hard way that actions (and inactions) have consequences.For instance, if they snap back at you every time you ask them to get started on their history report or encourage them to start preparing for the baseball team tryouts, you may need to simply let them deal with the bad grade or not making the team.

Ignore minor offenses like teasing.,
Allow the children to work out their own differences.,
Set consequences that apply to everyone involved.,
Give all your children special, quality time alone with you.",How to Reduce Sibling Rivalry (for Parents)1," Sometimes, they will bicker simply to get your attention. Refrain from giving them attention for negative behavior. Try your best to stay out of it. Removing yourself from the room when they start to squabble will send them the message that their arguing does not garner any attention from you. No need to say anything, just simply and quietly go into another room when they start up.Be careful to monitor the situation to make sure it does not go beyond minor teasing and into the realm of hurtful abuse. If there is one child that is always targeted or even picked one by a group of siblings it may be time to step in to protect the child in the minority.;
, As long as they are not physically or emotionally hurting each other, they can learn a lot from refining the process of solving their own squabbles.You can offer them a framework to start the process off in a positive light. You can do this by modeling active listening and problem solving within your relationships in the household.
For example, when one person is talking, others should face their direction and refrain from interrupting until the person has finished speaking. Offer solutions that allow everyone to benefit like ""Okay, so we both want to watch TV, but we have different choices. We can watch your pick for an hour and then watch mine.""

, These consequences should be logical and systematically used. You can also involve the kids in setting up the consequences so they know what happens if they don’t work things out and why it happens.Deliver consequences that are logical and apply to everyone involved. For example, all the children who are bickering may lose the same amount of minutes spent arguing from an activity of choice. The children have the chance to decide for future cases whether taking part in the argument is worth missing out on that activity.

, Focus on what makes each child unique and do activities around that to give them as much positive attention as possible. Focus this time on getting to know each child and exploring their individual needs.If both parents are in the household, each parent should find a way to spend at least 10 minutes alone with each child every day. Show the kids that you are readily available for positive time together so they do not feel the need to fight to gain attention.

"
"
Model healthy conflict resolution.,
Create systems for situations that generally provoke arguing.,
Praise them when they are behaving appropriately.,
Encourage your children to talk about their feelings.",How to Reduce Sibling Rivalry (for Parents)2," This includes the way you interact with the kids, your spouse and the discipline you use. You cannot ask the kids not to tease each other if that is the way you joke with them. Kids will model what you do but often take it to an extreme.Be mindful about always “fighting fair”, meaning you model positive ways to solve problems instead of blowing up in an aggressive way.This may include allowing everyone to participate in the process of brainstorming solutions together. You can model this by giving the kids opportunities to think up fair solutions to everyday problems.
For example, if you and your partner are disagreeing and shouting, you might call for a time out and then regroup at a later time to discuss the problem more objectively. Similarly, the children can call for a time out while everyone goes to brainstorm some possible ways to fix the problem. Once they regroup, everyone can take turns sharing their solution and everyone votes on the most sensible plan.

, If you know your children will argue about who gets to do what, come up with a plan to rotate privileges so that everyone gets an equal opportunity. Talk about these systems with the kids and let them come up with the rotating schedule so that they all feel invested in sticking to it.Encourage the kids to compromise and create their own system to balance things out. For example, if they always argue over a prime seat in the car, suggest solutions that will make it fair to everyone like every other turn they switch off.
At first you may need to be the neutral party who keeps track of who went last and who is first the next time, but once they get used to the system, the kids should be able to do this together.

, You can even implement a system for rewards like a token reward system. A system based on token rewards basically mean that for times when you see positive behavior that has already been defined you can give the kids a token or point. Within the system a certain number of tokens add up to a reward.The reward can be something as simple as a special activity, but it should be something the kids value. It also needs to be something they can actually obtain, so start with smaller values to add up to the reward.
Praise might also be verbal. For instance, you might say ""Well, look at you two sharing without being asked. Great job!""

, The level of rivalry may change as your family changes, so be aware that this conversation is not a one-time thing but on going. These conversations can be with a parent, with a trusted adult or even part of a program for kids in similar situations as long as the person is willing to listen and engage.At home, you can have one-on-one check-ins with each child to encourage sharing. ""Robert, I've noticed you seem distracted. Why don't we talk about what's been going on?"" is a great start to getting your child to open up. Plus, he or she will probably appreciate that you noticed a change.
Examples of classes for kids in unique situations would include families that are expecting a new baby and the changes that come along with that, or even sibling groups for families that include one or more kids with special needs. These situations may increase sibling issues and require more supports.

"
Avoid comparing your children.,
Drop the labels.,
Don’t take sides during a disagreement.,
Refrain from giving them the idea that life is fair.,
See a trained professional for serious conflict issues.",How to Reduce Sibling Rivalry (for Parents)3," Recognize and highlight the unique characteristics of each child. You may think that every younger child looks up to older siblings, but comparing them does not actually make them want to succeed to follow in the older’s footsteps. It can do the exact opposite when the one child feels like it is impossible to measure up so the best thing to do is give up.In addition, avoid trying to use one child as a teacher or protector of one of the other kids. This creates an unbalanced sense of power and can make the younger or less talented sibling feel bad. If the kids look to each other for advice or guidance this is the time to encourage working together.

, Calling one child the “troublemaker” certainly won’t encourage friendly, polite interactions between your children. Neither will describing one as the “brainiac”. Doing this allows each child to develop their own sense of self. It also allows each child to play a variety of roles.Labeling the kids based on their birth order is another form of labeling. Do not force older siblings to always be the grown one or take on a care giving role. At some point, all the kids will play the role of teacher and student.
Be careful about giving one child too much responsibility as far as being a role model or “super kid” to take care of a younger child or someone with special needs. While most kids will strive to be helpful, it isn’t their role to take care of a sibling.

, You are not doing anyone any favors pointing out who is right or wrong. It may seem like a logical way to end an argument is to tell the kids who won, but this just creates a more desperate situation for the child on the losing side of the argument to get attention—whether negative or positive.Each child needs to know they are valued and loved. Even if it is obvious one of them is right, you pointing it out can come across as playing favorites.
If the children are persistent in trying to make you take sides, come up with a line you can repeat that reminds them that they need to resolve the matter without your input. This may be something like ""You all need to work through this without me because I will not take sides. If I have to get involved, everyone will have the same punishment.""

, Most things in life are not. Set realistic expectations for your children about parenting and how much time and attention you can provide each child.Avoid getting caught up in trying to treat each child exactly alike or spend equal time with each. Each child will go through times where one may suddenly need a lot more time to address a need and this is OK. There is no system that says you have to give each child equal treatment, you should focus on showing each child love however it is needed.

, In some severe cases, you may have to attend family therapy to resolve sibling rivalry. One or more children may gang up on another or your efforts to intervene may be ineffective. Professional counselors and therapists who work with families can help you identify the root cause of the rivalry and help your entire family learn to communicate and manage conflict more effectively."

Remind them of their limits.,
Reconnect.,
Show your understanding.,
Be cautious in negotiations.,
Don’t mock them.,
Realize that you’re in charge.,
Make some house rules.,
Have clear expectations.,
Be consistent.,
Unite with your partner.,
Handle behavior outbursts.,
Reward positive behaviors.",How to Respond when Your Kid Bosses You Around," Tell your child that disrespect out out-of-bounds, especially with you. Tell them what kind words they can use and what words are not okay. Treating you with disrespect is not okay.Say, “It’s not okay to talk to me that way, it’s disrespectful. Would you like to try again?”
You can also say, “It’s not okay to make demands of me. You can ask me a question, though.”;
, Often, young children use defiance or bossiness as a way to reconnect. Offer your toddler a hug or reconnect to your preschooler through play.Empathize with their feelings and find a way to meaningfully connect.


For example, start a tickle war or get on your child’s level and give them a hug.
You can also look for some small ways that your child can be in charge. For example, you could put your child in charge of a task, such as letting them choose what to have for dinner from a list of options or asking them to remind you when it is time to leave for their dance class.

, Express to your child that you hear their demand. You can affirm their words or their feelings. This helps to show your child that you are listening and aware of what they want. It’s important for children to feel heard, even when they do not get their way. However, you have the final say in what happens.For example, say, “I hear you saying you want to stay home, but it’s time to go to the dentist now.”
You can also say, “I see that you’re upset that you’re not getting dessert. But you’ve said you don’t want to eat your food.”
If your child is making a demand, say, “I hear that you want that toy. However, we are not buying that, even if you scream and shout and kick. I can see that makes you sad and upset.”
After letting your child know that their bossiness is not appropriate, you may also consider offering them a set of options to choose from and feel in control of the situation. For example, if your child is being bossy when you are getting them ready for school, then you may ask them if they would prefer to wear the blue or red sweater.

, Kids often want to negotiate their position or power. It’s important to listen to your child and give them a voice, but you have the final say in decisions as the parent. If you or your child are not calm, don’t agree to any negotiations.If your child is older than 6, then you can say, “We can talk about this in 24 hours.” That way, both of you can be calmer. If your child is younger than 6, then letting them know there will not be any negotiation and directing their attention elsewhere is a better option.If you are not willing to consider a negotiation, say, “The rules are set and we will not change them. There is no room for negotiation on this.”

, Because bossiness is often a bid for control, a mocking response can upset your child or make them feel more desperate for control. Respect your child’s emotions. Even a gentle tease can be upsetting to a child who is looking for control. Avoid any kind of put-down or bid for control through hurtful words or tone.


Mocking such as, “Here’s our little dictator who calls all the shots and thinks he runs the world” or dismissive words like, “I’m just not in the mood to deal with you right now” can be hurtful.

, Your child looks to you to guide them and support them through life. Remind yourself that your role is to raise your child and support their positive development, and you are capable of being the authority for your child. You and your child are not equals or friends. You can listen to your child’s words, but you make the decisions.Fitting in within limits is an important life skill. Children should learn to respect authority and behave appropriately, and it’s part of your responsibility to teach these skills.

, Make sure your child knows what is expected of them by having house rules. Children are inclined to push limits, however, if they know there are expectations and consequences, they begin to adjust their behavior. Call a family meeting and decide on your family rules. Let your children have a say in the rules and consider their opinions. At the end of the discussion, finalize the rules as the adult and add any rules that are important to you. Explain to your children the house rules and the expectation for everyone in the house to follow them.Some rules may be “Follow adult directions,” “Ask instead of making demands,” and “Use kind words.”
Discuss consequences for breaking rules. You may want to consider input from your children about what consequences can be for certain rule violation.

, Once you set house rules, make sure your child understands them. If your child is about to break a rule, bring their awareness to the expectations and let them know it’s a choice to break the rule.Consider putting rules somewhere in your home so that children are clear of what expectations they have and what consequences result from breaking a rule.


For example, say, “Telling me what to do is not being respectful to me. Respecting your parents is part of your rules, and if you disrespect me, you will have a consequence.”

, When you make changes, make sure the changes last. If you cave under your child’s tantrums or displeasure with these new interactions, things will go back to the way they were (or worse!). Expect your bossy child to pushback on changes you make to the power they have to control you. Make changes and stick to them, showing your child that you mean business and intend to keep these changes.If your child says, “Go get my backpack” respond with, “You’re fully capable of getting your backpack. You can get it on your own.”
Be sure to speak to your child in a calm, even voice and model good behavior for them by saying “please” and “thank you” when you ask your child to do something.

, Get on the same page about rules and consequences with your partner. Respond to bossiness in a way you both agree upon and be consistent in your use of consequences. Children often know which is the more lenient parent and will exploit this perceived weakness. Being united and consistent in your approach can help your child recognize that their parents are in control.Find time to meet with your partner and decide what behaviors need feedback and correction. For example, if a child yells at a parent, this might warrant a timeout, loss of television time, or grounding.
If you’re a single parent, have a talk with your kid. Say, “You’re a help to me, and because you help out, I let you have certain privileges. However, I am still your parent and you are the child.”

, Parents often go along with their child’s demands in order to avoid meltdowns, tantrums, or outbursts. However, this does not teach your child how to handle their emotions or disappointments, which can lead to raising a poorly behaved child. If you start to reclaim power from your child, your child may show their unhappiness with this change and have a tantrum. If this happens, validate their feelings, yet be firm. Let your child cry if they need to cry. Let them express their emotions as they need to, and say that you will discuss it once they calm down.
For example, if your child is used to deciding what’s for lunch, they may pushback when they make a request and you prepare something else. Say, “I can tell you are upset. However, I get to choose what’s for lunch now, and this is what we are eating today.”

, Look out for the positive behaviors your bossy child does and praise them. Say, “I noticed you helped your younger sister with her homework today. That was really nice of you, thanks for doing that.” Give your child as much positive attention as you can to encourage them to pursue more positive behaviors.Reward your child for kind behaviors, completed chores, and following house rules.
Catch your child doing positive things and have rewards for these moments. Have a toy chest for when you “catch” your child helping out, offering assistance, or being kind. Say, “I noticed you being kind, and that’s a value in our family that we want to reward.”

Own your mistakes as soon as possible.,
Reach out to those you hurt.,
Make amends, if you can.,
Take advantage of constructive criticism.",How to Rebuild a Good Reputation in the Community1," In order to effectively restore your image, you need to act fast. Waiting too long can lead to irreparable damage. Move quickly towards a resolution by admitting your responsibility.Depending on the level of damage, you might release a public statement for the entire community. This may be appropriate, for instance, if you own a business and did something shameful that does not reflect well on your operation.
If you have trouble with written communication, it may be wise to ask for assistance on this so that your statement strikes the right chord.;
, In addition to making a public statement, you should contact those who were directly affected by your mistake to apologize. Try to do this face-to-face as you are more likely to convey your emotion and sincerity this way. If you cannot, contact them by phone.Outline why you are reaching out and extend your apologies. For example, you were recorded saying something hurtful about a colleague. Say something along the lines of “I realize how my actions have affected you. I hate that it seems like I took my relationship with you for granted. I am deeply sorry for hurting you.”
Sending an email or letter is less personal, so only do this is in-person or telephone communication is not possible.

, It reflects best on your reputation to try and put right what you screwed up. In most cases, there won’t be any direct way to “fix” the damage, but there may be something you can do to show you are serious about making amends.Say you were arrested for drinking and driving and your ""after-work"" behavior affected the way your company is perceived by clients. Ask your boss or team how you can make it better or help reach a resolution by saying “I know I can’t make it go away, but I really want to make this right. Please tell me what I can do.”

, Whether you are apologizing for a personal or professional misstep, you can use this situation to improve in the future. Seek out the advice of a few respected members in your community. Ask them what you can do to better your image moving forward.


For instance, you might seek out higher-ups in your company, esteemed retired individuals, or members of a religious organization for counsel. Say, “I respect your opinion a great deal. Can you offer some advice about how I can prevent this from happening again? I’d appreciate any feedback you might have.”
If you ask for feedback, you must be willing to hear negative perceptions about yourself. Don’t seek out criticism if you don’t feel you can handle it. Also, don’t defend what they say. Just listen, take notes, and thank them for their time."

Clarify your goals and develop an action plan.,
Be authentic.,
Contribute to the community in a positive way.,
Extend second chances to others.,
Be mindful of your online persona.,
Have patience.",How to Rebuild a Good Reputation in the Community2," It sucks to have compromised your public image but, in situations like this, there is a bright side. If you’re at rock bottom, there’s nowhere to go but up. You can use this experience to rebrand your image so that you reflect the person you want to be.Successfully repairing your reputation involves identifying your goals and developing a long-term action plan. Take some time to brainstorm what kind of person, leader, business owner, or public figure you want to be in the future. Write down some positive qualities you’d like to possess.
Then, create an action plan to help you built these skills and repair your reputation. You might use some of the suggestions you got from others as a part of your strategy.

, Your restoration plan will only crash and burn if you come out the gate trying to be someone you’re not. Plus, when you present yourself as someone else, you only leave gaping holes for you to slip back into in the future. In fact, trying to be someone you’re not could be the reason you need to rebuild your reputation in the first place.For example, if you never went to church before, it may not appear genuine if you start trying to go after your reputation is smeared. Find gradual ways to show your remorse like speaking to religious/spiritual advisers or going to support group meetings.

, After you have caused a public fiasco, you desperately need to show that you are invested in cleaning up your act and representing the community in a positive light. Again, this should be done with sincerity, so choose causes that you truly care about.


You might dedicate some time or resources to volunteering in the community. Help organize a cleanup day. Get a team together to host a charity event. Or, donate your time to helping with teens or struggling business owners. Offer your particular set of skills to those in need., Nothing says, “I’m trying to do better” than the notion of lending a helping hand to someone else in need. When you’re caught up in your own damage control process, you might not notice others who are going through similar experiences. Demonstrate goodwill by doing what you can to help them.


A second chance might translate to giving a job to someone with a criminal history or refusing to speak ill of someone who was involved in scandal. When you forgive others, people will be more likely to forgive you.

, In today’s world, your reputation extends beyond your present environment. Thanks to social media, what you say to a friend or casual acquaintance can be misinterpreted and re-shared to people across the world. Once your online reputation take a turn for the worst, it can be hard to restore it.Be mindful of what you say online—whether through professional or personal channels. Your online activities and posting can be found by anyone and continue to reflect badly upon you for years to come. Never say anything that you don’t want millions of people to see.

, Building a positive relationship takes time. Rebuilding your image may take even longer. Some people may never truly forgive or forget your mistake. Nonetheless, you should put your best put forward and give them the time they need to heal and move on."

Remain calm.,
Tell them to stop.,
Block the child’s hand.,
Remove them from the situation.",How to React if Your Young Child Hits You1," You might be feeling a range of emotions when a child hits you, such as anger or sadness. It is important that you remain calm at all times. An explosive reaction may only teach the child that anger is the proper way to respond when someone upsets you.It is also important to remove the child from the situation or to remove yourself from the situation. If you find it difficult to calm down, excuse yourself for a minute. Tell the child calmly but firmly, “That made me very sad, and now I need a minute to myself.” Go into a bathroom or separate room to calm down.Try breathing deeply while counting to ten or squeezing a stress ball to help you calm down.
Avoid giving the child too much attention.;
, Be firm but gentle when you tell to stop. They need to know what they did was wrong, but you should not yell or scream at them. Even if the child is a toddler, you should tell them to stop.


You can say, “Do not hit me again! It hurts me.”
You might also say, “It is not right to ever hit someone, no matter how mad you are.”

, If the child tries hitting you again, block their hand with your own. If you must, gently take their hand in yours to prevent them from hitting you again. You may also want to try walking a few feet away from the child so that they cannot reach you. This helps make the point that what they did was wrong.Be gentle as you do this. Hold their hand but do not wrench it away or squeeze it.

, If the child won’t calm down, they may need to go into time-out. Remove them from the room or situation that is causing their tantrum. Let them relax in a separate area. Do not let them leave until they have calmed down."
"
Ask them why they hit you.,
Acknowledge their feelings.,
Explain why hitting is wrong.,
Avoid yelling.",How to React if Your Young Child Hits You2," It is important to ask the child why they hit you right after it happens. Let the child explain their emotional state. Ask them why they hit you, and try to get them to explain their feelings at that moment. Give them a chance to talk.You can ask, “Why did you hit me?” or “Why did you just do that?”
If your child is too young to verbalize these feelings, you might try to answer for them. Look into their eyes and say, ""You're angry right now, aren't you?"" This will teach them how to label their feelings.You can have this talk immediately after they hit or after they have calmed down.
Be aware that your child may be acting aggressively for a variety of reasons certain environmental (internal or external) stressors the child is under (could be anything), not having a routine, over stimulation, physical and/or mental exhaustion, not enough parental supervision or attention, and/or reflecting the behaviors of others (could have seen other children, family, friends, etc. hitting).

, Tell your child that you understand how they feel but that there is no reason to ever hit another person. By starting out with sympathy, you acknowledge and validate your child’s emotional state.You might say, “I know you’re angry because we didn’t make it to the park today, but it is never ok to hit someone.”
A simple way to say this to very young children is ""I know you're sad, but hitting is wrong.""

, Your child may not realize that what they are doing is wrong. They may be too mad or upset to understand their actions. Always remind them that hitting is painful and that it makes other people feel sad or upset.You can say, “Hitting hurts people.”
You might also say, “When you hit people, it hurts, and they start to feel bad.”
A simple way to tell young toddlers is to say, ""Ouch! Hitting hurts."" As you say this, you might want to cringe or scrunch your face up. This will show your child that hitting hurts other people.

, A calm voice is always best. Even if your child is crying or screaming, you can help them relax by using a softer voice. This will calm them down while teaching them that yelling is not acceptable.

Identify their trigger.,
Praise good behavior.,
Model appropriate behavior for your child.,
Avoid physical punishment.,
Be aware of your child’s limitations.,
Appreciate your child’s efforts.,
Take the child to see a behavioral specialist.",How to React if Your Young Child Hits You3," If the child has hit you several times, try to identify what might be causing this behavior. Do they always hit at a particular time or during a particular event? Has something recently changed in the family that might be making the child upset?


If the child is hitting you to get attention, try ignoring the action. This might teach them that hitting you will not get the attention that they want.
If you suspect that your child is learning this behavior from other children, you should try to remove them from that peer group. Find a different daycare or play group so that they are not influenced by this bad behavior.Some children may hit because they are frustrated that they cannot communicate properly. Try to teach your child certain phrases or actions to allow them to demonstrate what they want.Try asking yourself some questions to see if you can identify a trigger. For example, you can as yourself questions like “Why are they acting this way?” “Is there one particular person he/she is displaying this type of aggressive behavior to?” “If it is just one particular person, is it because of frustration, anger, or over excitement?” and “Are there any particular patterns or routines you've noticed before, during, or after these occurrences?”

, When your child calms down after a tantrum, acknowledge their good behavior. Make it a habit to compliment your child when they have acted correctly.For example, if your child has a problem and tells you about it, you can say, “Good job using your words.”
If your child apologizes to you for hitting you, you can say, “Thank you for saying you’re sorry. I understand how you feel, and I love you very much.”

, Children learn by example. If they see you hitting or screaming at other people, they will learn that these actions are acceptable behavior in public. Act towards other people the way you want your child to act towards you.Use a calm, even voice when disagreeing with people. This will show your child how to act during a disagreement.
If you did something wrong, apologize. Say, “I’m sorry for that. I know what I did was wrong.”

, Hitting or spanking your child will only teach them that physical violence is an appropriate way to act. It will not discourage them from hitting, and it may even influence them to become more physical as they grow older., Certain circumstances may cause your child to act aggressively, so you may need to avoid these situations. For example, if your child only acts aggressively at play groups, then it might be best to avoid taking your child to play groups. Or, if you child becomes aggressive when they watch certain tv shows or play certain video games, then it might be best to prevent your child from engaging in those activities.


Try to engage your child in low-key activities to help calm them. For example, you could sit and listen to some calming music with your child or encourage them to color.

, It may take time for your child to develop the ability to control their emotions, so it is important to acknowledge their efforts. For example, if you notice your child making an effort to control their anger, then praise them for their efforts.


Try saying something like, “I am proud of you for…”
Keep in mind that young children have a hard time controlling their emotions, so it is important to acknowledge their efforts and encourage them.

, If the child keeps hitting or starts escalating their behavior—through biting, kicking, or throwing things you may want to consult your pediatrician. They may be able to recommend a child behavioral specialist who can identify the underlying problem and help you fix it. Some things to watch out for include:


Following ongoing patterns of defiant, disobedient, or hostile behavior towards any authority figures.
Frequently or easily losing their temper.
Being deliberate with their actions or engaging in activities that annoy others.
Constantly expressing annoyance, or being chronically sensitive.
Having ongoing anger and resentment that they cannot control alone or with the help of a parent.
Constantly acting spiteful and vindictive, and is always argumentative.

Practice being gentle.,
Give your child attention.,
Encourage a healthy sense of humor and laugh with your child.,
Show unconditional love.",How to Rear a Nice Child1," How you treat your bay at the very beginning of his life matters a lot and can have a lasting effect on his development and mental health. From the very start, concentrate on loving and being very gentle with your child.


Give your baby lots of love and physical affection. The soothing warmth from a parent's touch can instill positive feelings in your child and reduce distress. Physical affection includes hugs, kisses, and snuggles.
Never be rough or scream at your child.;
, Give your baby your full attention especially during the first years. Positive and attentiveness can promote self-esteem, well-being, and positive social behaviors.Unfortunately, children that are neglected can end up with low self-esteem and depression which can also result in negative behaviors such as aggression toward others.Spend quality time with your child whenever you can. Ensure that he has his basic needs met such as enough food, physical safety, and play time.
Never ignore your child unless he is misbehaving. If your child comes up to you and wants to engage with you make sure you are available as much as you can be. If you are busy, set clear boundaries and ensure that you give appropriate attention at a later time.

, Laughter can be a powerful coping resource for dealing with stress, anxiety, and depression. This means encouraging your child to laugh at his mistakes (instead of taking them too seriously) and getting joy out of funny things like impersonations and making silly faces. Discourage an unhealthy sense of humor that involves making fun of others, or putting down others in a hurtful way.


Make sure you teach him about appropriate humor. You may find a toddler saying a ""bad"" word really funny, but many people in public would not. It is best to avoid teaching your child behaviors that could cause him trouble later, even if you personally find them humorous.Also encourage him to not use humor as a defense instead of dealing with his problems. For example, discourage him from joking around when you talk to him about negative behaviors. This type of defensive humor can keep children and adults from tackling the reality of a situation., Lack of warmth may increase a child’s aggressive behaviors.However, feelings of belonging and love can increase a child’s positive behaviors and reduce negative behaviors.Have empathy for your child’s feelings and needs. Try to put yourself in your child's shoes and mind, and experience the world from his point of view.
Hug and kiss your child often. How you model affection can have a lasting effect on your child and give him a sense of being loved.
Avoid punishment or punitive interactions. These types of behaviors can actually increase a child’s behavior problems."
"
Use an authoritative parenting style.,
Communicate assertively.,
Use positive reinforcement.,
Set clear boundaries and consequences.Be as specific as possible, and warn your child ahead of time that there are consequences for his behaviors.",How to Rear a Nice Child2," The benefits of using an authoritative parenting style are backed by plenty of empirical evidence showing that this style helps produce happy, healthy, and well-adjusted children.Authoritative parenting means setting appropriate limits, but being flexible, warm, and affectionate.


Avoid authoritarian parenting, which is associated with being controlling or having an, “It’s my way or the highway” attitude.Do not act out in anger. Give your child the freedom he needs to express himself.
Avoid permissive parenting, which means essentially letting your child control the situation and do what he wants.

, Assertive communication means asking for what you want in respectful and appropriate ways. It is the best form of communication for any situation, but especially when conversing with your child.


An example of assertiveness is using I statements such as, ""I feel disappointed when you don't put away your toys."" I statements always start with explaining how you feel before talking about the other person's behavior; this helps reduce defensiveness.
Be specific, direct, and clear with commands.Ask your child to do exactly what you want him to do in order to avoid confusion and unnecessary conflict. You can follow up an I statement with a command such as, ""Please put your toys away in your toy box now and remember to put them away in the future. Thank you.""
Don’t be passive by avoiding talking about difficult topics with your child. This can make it so that your child sees you as scared; he may not see you as the authority.
Avoid being aggressive in any way; this can include: raising your voice, putting your child down (name-calling), yelling, throwing things, threatening, spanking, and slapping.

, Rewarding positive behaviors is the best way to increase good actions in your child. A reward can be anything that the child likes or wants - a new toy, a certain food, or time to play a game.


For example, try the Premack Principle, where you make an agreement with your child that he can do something he wants to do if he first does something he doesn’t particularly like.You could make an agreement that he gets to play with his toys once he has eaten his vegetables.
Any time your child does something you like, give him a verbal reward by saying, ""Good job!""

,


If your child misbehaves mildly then punish mildly. For example, just simply tell him, ""do not do that again"" in a disappointed tone, or perhaps send him to his room.
Give your child a choice. Granting autonomy is considered a very useful approach to positive parenting.Let your child know that he has a choice to stop the behavior, or have the consequence (whatever it may be).
Be consistent and follow-through. Giving in to your child when he begs or tantrums is one of the worst things you can do because it shows him that you will give-in if he tries harder or continues doing a negative behavior.

"
"
Provide a structured schedule and ensure adequate supervision.,
Reduce family conflict.,
Be responsible.,
Teach pro-social behaviors.",How to Rear a Nice Child3," Structure is a crucial component of ensuring stability in a child's life.


Set a daily schedule for your child, but make sure you are flexible if it doesn't work out perfectly. Explain to the child what the plan is for the day. If you deviate from the plan it gives you the opportunity to discuss flexibility with your child.
Make sure your child is supervised, especially when very young, at all times. Never leave him home alone unless he is old enough (teenage years). This does not mean never give your child privacy when he needs it, but always make sure he is safe and someone is there to help him if he gets hurt.

, Conflict that is witnessed by the child (especially domestic violence) can lead to issues such as depressed mood, anxiety, and behavioral problems.Cultivate healthy relationships. If you are married, show affection and admiration for your spouse in front of your child. This can promote a sense of security, love, and respect for the whole family.
Never take out your anger on your child. Physical aggression can lead to a child displaying aggression., Remember your child copies you; if you treat the child well he will treat you well, if you treat others well the child will treat others well. Similarly, your child will learn responsibility if you display responsible behaviors in front of him.


Don’t drink excessively or use drugs in front of your child (or at all, for that matter).
Plan ahead and be prepared. If you are going on a trip, pack enough food and extra supplies.

, Pro-social behaviors, such as helping others, being part of a team, and being understanding, increase positive and healthy relationships. You can teach your child these pro-social skills through modeling.


You can model pro-social behaviors with your child through play. Try role-playing different social situations in order to teach your child how to respond.For example, you can pretend to be a child on the playground that took away your child's ball. First, notice how your child responds (he may yell and say, ""Give me back my ball!""), then you can switch roles to model the most pro-social way to deal with the situation. You might model something like saying, ""I feel sad that you took the ball I was using (instead of saying ""my ball""), could you please give it back?"" Or, you could say something like, ""How about we play with the ball together?""

Talk about the known health issues associated with smoking.,
Bring up how smoking can negatively affect your teen’s performance in school.,
Point out how smoking could negatively affect your teen’s appearance.,
Use real life examples if there are smokers in your family.,
Cut off your teen’s allowance if the money is used for cigarettes.,
Do not allow smoking in your home.,
Suggest your teen spend less time with friends who smoke.,
Encourage your teen to focus more on school and extracurricular activities.,
Ask your teen why she is smoking.,
Try to quit smoking, if you smoke.,
Get your teen professional help.",How to Punish Your Kids for Smoking," Many teens believe they are indestructible and will think very little of the long term health issues associated with smoking. But it may still be useful to start the discussion by mentioning how smoking has been known to cause serious health problems, such as cancer, heart disease and lung disease. Many adult smokers start smoking when they are very young and get addicted to years of poisoning their body through cigarettes. You may want to tell your teen that smoking is the leading cause of preventable deaths in the United States.Often, teenagers are not as concerned with long term health issues and may not view cigarettes as addicting. But it can help to mention the facts behind cigarette smoking to your teen anyway, as it could help her realize the seriousness of developing a smoking habit when she is very young.;
, Your teen may respond more to consequences that feel more immediate, such as how smoking could negatively affect her performance at school. Smoking may impair her ability to concentrate in class and make it difficult for her to hurry to and from classes. She may also start to miss classes because she cannot go without smoking during school hours, which could put her academic performance in jeopardy.You may also talk about how smoking can negatively affect your teen’s ability to do extracurricular activities, like sports. She may have difficulty breathing while she is trying to compete on track team or do her dance routines. She may also struggle with doing physical activity with friends and family as she may have lung issues due to smoking.

, You can also play on your teen’s concern for her appearance and her body image to try to convince her not to smoke. You may note that smoking causes your teeth to turn yellow and can prematurely age you, leading to wrinkles earlier in life. Smoking can also cause bad breath and make your clothing smell like an ashtray. Your teen may be more receptive to hearing about how smoking can lead to issues with her appearance, as these are likely real and immediate concerns to her.


You should also mention that smoking could make it more difficult for your teen to exercise and working out due to breathing and lung issues. This could then negatively affect her body image and her weight.

, Another way to communicate the consequences of smoking to your teen is to use a family member or a friend who smokes as an example. Real life examples can help put smoking into perspective for your teen and force her to focus on the real life consequences of cigarettes.


For example, maybe your teen’s uncle has a pack a day habit. You may note how the uncle now has breathing problems and poor health due to smoking. You may also point out that the uncle spends a lot of money every year on his habit and has been struggling to quit for years, even though he is aware his smoking is hurting his body.

, Yelling at your teen and informing her that she cannot smoke may not be the most effective solution, as this could only cause her to rebel against you more and continue smoking. Instead, think about ways where you can restrict or limit your teen’s access to cigarettes and make it more difficult for her to get her hands on a pack of smokes. This may mean cutting off your teen’s allowance so she cannot use your money to buy cigarettes. Cutting off her allowance may also make it harder for her to buy other things for herself and she may end up getting frustrated enough that she will agree to not buy cigarettes if that means she can get her allowance back.You may also try to regulate your teen’s spending so you can try to dissuade her from buying cigarettes. For example, if your teen asks you for money to spend on school books, go shopping together for the books and pay attention to how your teen is spending the money. Make sure her money goes towards healthy habits and items that will benefit her, rather than cigarettes.

, Though you may not want to dole out harsh punishment for your teen at the risk of encouraging her to smoke more, you can put controls in place at home to discourage her from smoking.You may tell her that under no circumstances is smoking allowed in your home, under your roof. You may also inform her that if you catch her smoking in her room or in the house, you are going to confiscate the smokes and adjust her curfew so she has to come home earlier on the weekends. These rules may upset her, but it is one way that you can exert your authority over the situation.
If you smoke, you should be a good role model and practice what you preach. Take your smoking habit outside or make an effort to quit. Your teen will notice if you break your own rules, so try to follow them yourself and lead by example.

, Teens often start smoking due to being around friends who also smoke. You can try to instruct your teen not to hang around friends who smoke, but this may backfire and cause your teen to only hang out with friends you do not approve of even more than she did before. Instead, you may want to suggest that your teen spend time with friends who do not smoke, or try to spend equal time with other groups of friends. This way, you can hint at this possibility and allow your teen some freedom to decide, rather than trying to force her to do what you say.You may encourage your teen to spend time with better friend groups by suggesting that she invite over friends who do not smoke and allow them to spend time in your home. You may host a bbq or a dinner for these friends and make them feel welcome. This could show your teen that you appreciate and support when she brings home friends you approve of, rather than friends who smoke.
You can take a stricter tone and forbid any friends who smoke from entering your home. This could be another way of keeping your teen away from these friends. But, this could also just lead to your teen spending time with friends who smoke outside of your home, and in turn, spending more time away from home.

, You can try to deflect your teen’s interest in smoking by encouraging her to pursue other activities that are more healthy for her. Maybe she is motivated to do well in school. You can suggest that she put her energies into getting good grades and doing her college applications, rather than her smoking habit. Try to remind her of what is important in life and how smoking could get in the way of her goals.You can also try to get her to focus more on extracurricular activities she enjoys, such as sports, dance, or acting. Encourage her to sign up for more art classes or to try out for a sports team. This could allow her to adjust her focus from smoking to other activities that are more beneficial for her.

, One way to better understand your teen’s smoking is to discuss reasons why she may be doing it. Sit down with her and ask her to reflect on why she may be smoking. Doing this may help both of you realize the motivations behind her smoking and possible get to the root cause. Determining the root cause of her smoking could then allow you to help her work on the issue and prevent her from smoking again.Have your teen write down her reasons for smoking as well as how she started smoking. Use the question, “why do you think you are smoking?” as a writing prompt. Then, have her share her thoughts with you and discuss them together.

, Some teens are motivated to smoke because they watch their parents or other authority figures light up on a regular basis. They may then take up smoking out of curiosity or out of a desire to emulate their parents. If you, as a parent, have a smoking habit, you should consider quitting. This will allow you to practice what you preach and act as a role model for your teen.Quitting smoking can be a challenge, but let your teen know that you are willing to take it on so she does not end up smoking like you. You may then ask her to support you by not smoking as well. This way, you can both be there for each other as you both attempt to quit.

, If your teen is struggling to quit smoking or if you are worried your teen will develop a full on smoking addiction, you may reach out to professionals for help. It can difficult to stop smoking once you start, especially at a young age. You should try to support and help your teen by getting her professional help so she can learn how to stop smoking.You can contact an addiction counselor through the American Lung Association or your Department of Health. You may also want to talk to your family doctor and get a referral for an addiction therapist who has worked with teens before.

Keep your cool.,
Avoid snapping back at them.,
Ask them if they understand what they said.,
Make sure that your response is age-appropriate.,
Sympathize with the child's feelings.,
State your own feelings.,
Ask them to rephrase their complaint respectfully.",How to React when Your Child Talks Back1," While you may be angry, annoyed, or upset by what the child said, try to remain calm. Speak in a firm but level voice. Do not strike or hit the child. By reacting calmly, you’re modeling good behavior for the child. They will learn that insults and yelling are not appropriate responses to frustration and anger.It is especially important to remain calm when you are interacting with a teenage child. This is because teenagers tend to explode or respond by shutting down completely if you yell at them. If you teen reacts in an inappropriate manner, just keep in mind that this is normal for the age.;
, It can be tempting to respond by talking back yourself, but this may only increase the child’s disobedience. It shows the child that what they are doing is correct behavior.Try to avoid responding with statements like:


”How dare you.”
“Don’t you talk back to me.”
”When I want to know your opinion, I’ll ask.”
“Don’t give me lip.”

, Your child might learn certain insults, curse words, and phrases from their friends. They might repeat these words even if they do not know what they mean.If your child says something like this to you, ask them if they know what it means. Then ask where they learned it from.


You can say, “Do you know what that word means?”
You should always explain that the phrase or word is mean. You can say, “Calling someone an idiot is not a nice thing to do, and you shouldn't repeat that word anymore.”
You should ask, “Where did you learn such a thing?” Your child might state that they heard it from a friend, a television show, or a family member. Try to address the source.

, It is important to respond right away when your child talks back to you. However, keep in mind that the way you speak to your child should be different depending on their age. A very young child will need to be spoken to in a way that is different than a teenager.

For example, if your child is very young, then it is important to speak to them in terms they can understand and to remain calm and pleasant while doing so.
If your child is older, then you can respond more directly and you will not need to adjust your language to their level as much. You might ask and older child or teenager to write a letter of apology for what they have done. This will provide them with an opportunity to reflect on what happened and learn from the experience.

, Acknowledge what emotions the child is feeling. As you do so, express that talking back is wrong. This shows the child that you are listening to their needs even as you tell them that their attitude is unacceptable.


You can say, “I know you don’t want to wash the dishes, but that is not a good reason to call me names. We all have our jobs in the house.”
You can also say, “I’m sorry that we can’t go outside today, but that does not mean that you can yell at me.”

, Tell the child how their backtalk makes you feel. Try to phrase it in a way that does not blame the child. To do this, you should use “I” statements like “I feel” or “I hear.”For example, you can say, “When I hear that you think I’m mean, it makes me feel bad.”

, If the child wants something or they have a complaint, you should ask your child (in a way that is appropriate for their age) to rephrase the statement in a more polite manner. This teaches children how to express their frustration in a polite way.You can say to the child, “I want you to say that in a nicer way.”

"
Take away privileges.,
Put them in time out.,
Ask your child to do something to improve their behavior.,
Seek help.",How to React when Your Child Talks Back2," If the child continues to talk back to you, you might have to take away some of their privileges. You may revoke their television for the evening or take away their video games. You can also take away dessert or make them go to bed early.


If you take away something, you must follow through on it. Do not give in and let them watch TV later if you took it away earlier in the day. This will teach your child that your discipline is not consistent.
Be reasonable with this type of discipline. Never withhold food or water from your child, and only take away something for a day., If a young (under the age of five) child is having a tantrum, then you can put them in time out. Find a chair or bed, and ask them to sit quietly for a few minutes.You can leave them in time out for one minute per year of age, or you can just have them stay there until they have calmed down.


Another option is to redirect your child to a different activity. For example, you could say something like, ""I see you’re upset. Why don't you come to the table to color and draw. You can draw me a picture showing me just how mad you are."" This will help to teach your child how to find an outlet for their emotions, which is a valuable skill for them to have.

, One way to help your child learn from the experience is to assign them a task that may help them to see things differently and learn from the experience. This will help them to grow from the experience rather than just punishing them for their actions.


For example, you could ask your child to read a book about being polite or controlling emotions. Or, you could ask them to think about how talking to you in the way that they did might have made you feel and draw or write about it.

, If your child shows a consistent pattern of talking back or if their disobedience occurs both at school and at home, there may be an underlying problem. Talk to your pediatrician. They may refer you to a counselor or child behavior specialist.Take notes of your child’s behavioral patterns so that you can show the doctor.
You might say to the pediatrician, “Billy is constantly acting out at school and at home. He keeps using curse words and talking back to me. What can we do?”

"
"
Determine why the child is talking back.,
Compliment them.,
Give them choices.,
Let them express themselves through art.",How to React when Your Child Talks Back3," Your child may have a trigger that causes them to talk back to you, or they may be learning this behavior from someone else. Try to figure out why your child is talking back to you, and confront the problem.If your child is cranky after school, give them an hour to decompress when they get home.
If your child always snaps at you when they’re tired, you may want to encourage naps or a better sleep schedule.
If your child is watching TV shows where children misbehave, you may want to choose different programming.

, Complimenting instills good behaviors more effectively than disciplining them does. Compliment your child on a daily basis as well as when they say something nice to you. It is important to let your child know that you love and appreciate them no matter what, not just when they are being good. You do not have to wait until they are doing something good to compliment your child. Sometimes it is more effective to give a compliment on a whim. Offering frequent compliments may improve your relationship with your child.For example, if your child talks about their problems in a healthy way, you can say, “It’s so good that you can talk about your feelings so clearly.” If your child compliments you, you might say, “That’s so nice of you. I love hearing compliments.”
Make a point of offering them daily reassurances of your love and appreciation of them. For example, you can say, ""I love you"", ""I appreciate you"", ""You mean the world to me"", ""You are very special"", or ""Thank you for being such an awesome kid.""

, Let your child have an opinion on what they eat, do, and wear. You can do this by offering two choices to them. This will reduce their resistance by giving them a little bit of control in their lives.At breakfast, you might ask, ""Do you want apple slices or a banana?""
When they're getting dressed, you can say, ""Do you want to wear blue or green today?""

, If the child is frustrated or unable to express their anger in a healthy way, try giving them some crayons and paper. Ask them to draw their feelings. This will let them express their emotions in a productive way."

",How to Punish Your Child if He Was Suspended from School," Ask as many questions as you can. Find out the following information:


What the child has been suspended for
What exactly happened
Why suspension has been the chosen punishment
Were other students involved in the incident, and if so, have they also been suspended; if not, why not
How long will the suspension last
What your child be expected to do during the suspension
How this will affect your child academically;
, The schools much prefer an involved parent who wants to know what is happening to their child over a disengaged one.

, Suspension is a very common punishment in some schools. It does not mean your child is being rejected.

,
Is the child old enough to understand what they have done wrong?
Was the child suspended for one-off petty offenses such as long hair or for throwing pencils at another student?
Was the child suspended also for throwing stones at students and/or teachers/faculty?
Was the behavior caused by learning disabilities and/or other disabilities or delays your child has such as ADHD, autism, learning difficulties, hearing problems, vision problems, health problems, etc. Exercise your rights under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) if this pertains.

, Consider including: a table (or portable table) set up in an isolated area away from the TV, computer, gaming consoles, and/or other fun areas. Include wide ranges of educational work appropriate for your child's grade level, and a timer that will ring at certain times of the day.

,


Tell your child to do work from the suspension kit/schoolwork.
Make sure you use an alarm to let the child know when it's time for him/her to do other work.
Get help from your spouse, a babysitter, a neighbor, or a grandparent to make sure your child's not having fun during his/her suspension.

,


If you leave your older child at home alone, take all power cords associated with withdrawn privilege(s) to prevent him from violating his/her grounding.

,


Don't allow your child to listen to music they like. If your child has crushes, don't allow your child from going out and/or being with them. Prohibit your child also from going out with friends, best friends, boyfriends, or girlfriends. Don't allow older children, also, to go to extra-curricular activities such as sporting events, and proms, too, while suspended. The punishments can also apply if the child hasn't finished his/her chores you assigned during the suspension days and/or work from the suspension kit and if there will be a break during suspension days. Your goal is to make his/her day less pleasant to make sure he/she isn't suspended in the future.
Give him/her a time out or ground your child, if he/she leave stop doing their work and/or leave their room and/or the house.
Put a password on the child's laptop or tablet (if they have one), if necessary.
Give your child some unpleasant chores.
Beware of any inclination for the child to take the suspension days as leisure away from teachers/faculty and/or class responsibilities. Example: If Grandpa or Grandma is more likely to be sympathetic to him/her and let him/her watch TV all day, that will not work.

, They may be angry, upset or emotional about what happened, or possibly even gloating about it. You will probably be angry and upset too. Talking about it straight away can lead to a pointless battle. Wait until you both calm down (perhaps the next day) to discuss the issues.

"
Take some deep breaths.,
Walk away if you need a timeout.,
Count to yourself to calm down.,
Displace your anger.,
Avoid yelling.,
Set a daily relaxation time.",How to React when Your Child Ignores You1," When your child ignores you, you might feel intensely annoyed, angry and/or stressed. If you feel this way, take some deep breaths in through the nose and exhale slowly through your mouth until you feel calm again and ready to address the situation., Sometimes, deep breaths may not be enough. If your child is safe to be alone or if they are old enough to be, get away for a moment. Go into the kitchen and run some cold water over your hands or go lie on your bed for a few minutes., If you cannot leave your child, then count to yourself or out loud until you feel calm. This can also help signify to your child that you are reaching your limits and that they need to cease ignoring you immediately., Do something else for the moment to distract yourself from reacting negatively. Sing your favorite song. Vacuum or sweep the floor. Do whatever you can to distract your attention momentarily., Don’t teach your children that they are only supposed to listen when you yell. You need them to know that your words should be respected regardless of how loud you are. You might feel the urge to yell when your child ignores you, but speak firmly and at a regular tone, instead., This will help you keep more calm overall and make you less likely to react when provoked. Spend some time daily taking a hot bath, meditating, practicing yoga, or listening to some relaxing music."
"
Let unimportant battles go.,
Set a target time for a task to be complete.,
Establish a set time for major responsibilities.",How to React when Your Child Ignores You2," Know when to engage with your child and when to refrain. Though it is never okay for your child to ignore you, know that sometimes they should get a pass. If they are crying or very upset about something, for instance, you might choose to let it go. However, in all other instances you should not tolerate being ignored and disrespected.Call attention to the behavior, give a warning, and then follow through with a punishment if they don’t listen.

, Many children respond better when there is a degree of flexibility offered. Perhaps you need your child to take out the trash or clean the bathroom. Rather than saying “Zach, clean the bathroom right now,” which might get you ignored, say “I need you to clean the bathroom before 8PM tonight.”This way, your child can finish up any tasks they are in the process of so they can devote more attention to their chores.

, Tasks like homework should be completed at a certain time of day to establish a routine. Avoid giving your child a lot of flexibility about when they will complete tasks like these. Tell them to put away the electronics while they work.You will avoid being ignored if your child knows the exact time of day that they are supposed to do something; this will prevent you from having to remind them.

Be specific with your instructions.,
Make them repeat your instructions back to you.,
Make your presence known physically.,
Set a timer.,
Give them warnings.,
Establish consequences and follow through on them.,
Avoid giving them a task when they are engaged in another.,
Praise them when they listen.,
Avoid always saying ‘no.’ Your child might ignore you because they are frustrated with you for something.,
Be present.",How to React when Your Child Ignores You3," Your child may be ignoring you because the tasks you assign to them might be too broad or intangible. Instead of saying “clean your room” to your five year old, you might say “put your toys away and put your dirty clothes in the hamper.” Children tend to respond better and more readily to details., If your child typically ignores you or if they reply with an “mmhmm” and you’re not sure that they heard you, make them repeat the instructions back to you. This will ensure both that they heard you and that they will remember what they need to do., A simple hand on shoulder can work wonders in getting your child’s attention. When they are ignoring you, simply walk over to them, put your hand on their shoulder, and then repeat what you said once they are looking you in the eye.Don’t be forceful with them. Just use physical touch as a gentle reminder that you require their attention.

, If you have a bit of flexibility with the task that you need them to complete, set a timer for your child. Let them know that by the time the timer goes off, they need to have begun completing the task that you have assigned to them.Say something like “you have 10 minutes to start folding that laundry.”

, If your child is not listening to you because they are focused on something else, then give them a warning. Perhaps they are on their cell phone or watching television; let them know that you will take their phone and TV privileges for the day if they do not respond or do as you ask.Or perhaps your toddler refuses to come to you on the playground after you called their name. Let them know that if they don’t come now, you will go get them and take them home.

, Take away privileges if they don’t do as you say within the timeframe that you asked. Go to the car without them, and leave them home if they are old enough, if they did not come after you called them several times. Honor your word so they know what to expect., If you know your child has been waiting all week to watch a new episode of their favorite show, consider avoiding having a discussion or assigning a chore during this time. Wait until the show is complete to engage with them.If they are older, you could also consider texting them what you need them to do, as teenagers tend to use their phones often.

, When your child listens to you readily, praise them for it. You can say something simple like “Thanks for getting that work done so quickly, Mariah, I appreciate it.” A simple expression of gratitude goes a long way and helps to reinforce good behavior., Perhaps, they ask to hang out with friends often and you always tell them ‘no.’ And then later, when you try to talk to your child about their friendships, they ignore you. An environment where a child is always shut down will create a child who feels frustrated, defeated, and not in control of themselves., Just as you don’t want them to ignore you, be sure that you don’t ignore them, either. Have family time at least a few times per week and stay off your phone and engage with them more. Avoid drifting off when you have conversations, and focus instead on the people in front of you.

Model good behavior.,
Give praise.,
Reward good behavior.,
Allow your child to make some decisions.",How to Punish a Child for Being Naughty," Make sure your child knows exactly what is expected of him/her, and what will happen they break the rules. You can teach your child about the consequences of their actions by explaining the connection between choices and consequences. For example, you can connect your child’s behavior to consequences by saying things such as:


“You are choosing to end your time at the park early by misbehaving.”“You lost your turn to play with the toy when you stole it from another child.”
“You made the decision to end the play date when you bit your friend.”
“By not picking up your toys you chose to lose the privilege of playing with them.”
“By not being honest, you lost the privilege of our trust.”;
, Actions have natural consequences, and places like school, church, and society all have their own expectations of your child. Sometimes your child will have to learn the hard way that it isn’t just your household that will impose rules on their behavior. Difficult as it may be, it’s important to let your child fail sometimes so that he can learn about consequences.


For example, instead of you staying up late to help the night before an assignment is due, let your child get a bad grade they didn’t do their homework. This lesson is especially important for older children to learn since they will start to expect more independence and trust from you.With young children, this lesson may take on a less severe form. For example, if your child breaks a toy on purpose, do not replace it. This will help him learn what it means to be responsible and how it feels to lose something.
Children of all ages must also learn to be respectful of others, so don’t intervene if your child didn’t get invited to a party or event because they were mean to other children., A timeout is an excellent way to allow children and parents time to calm down after an emotional situation. Select an area that is quiet and free of distractions, but not necessarily out of your sight. Ask your child to use the time to think about some solutions to the problem that resulted in the timeout.


Don’t use timeout to humiliate or punish.
For young children, especially those under three, use a timeout mat so that you can still keep an eye on him or her. The mat is also portable, and can be used for timeouts when you aren’t home.Timeout should last no longer than one minute for each year of your child’s age., Do this right after the offense, so that your child understands and connects the bad behavior with the punishment. Use this opportunity to teach your child about natural and logical consequences by matching the revoked toy or privilege with the offending behavior.


Physical items like toys will work better with younger children, while an older child may respond better to the loss of a privilege or freedom he had been granted.
Don’t give in and end the punishment early, or next time your child will know that they can control the situation.Privileges that can be taken away include watching television, playing on the computer or video games, playing with friends, trips to the park, parties or use of the family vehicle for older children.

, Corporal punishment is illegal in many countries and regions, it can negatively affect the parent-child relationship, and it can damage your child’s normal social development. Most experts agree that while physical discipline has effects on your child’s immediate behavior, it won’t teach him/her right from wrong. Instead of providing your child with the power to control his/her own emotions, corporal punishment will teach him/her that physical violence is an acceptable reaction to anger and adverse situations.Corporal punishment can lead to aggressive behavior.
There is no evidence that physical discipline is an effective means of curbing future misbehavior.
The negative effects of corporal punishment can follow children into adulthood in the form of mental health problems and substance abuse., Young children and babies are curious and it may be hard for them to understand that certain items are off-limits. An alternative option is to remove these items from your child’s view so that they will not be tempted.For example, if you do not want your child to play with your phone or another electronic item, then put it up somewhere that they cannot see or reach it.

, It’s ok to step away from a situation and give yourself time to cool off. Deferring punishment gives you time to contemplate reasonable disciplinary action, and time for your child to think about what they have done. Be clear that you need time to calm down, and that you will discuss the matter when you’re ready.


Resist the urge to be sarcastic, threaten, or criticize. This will just upset your child more, and could have lasting effects on their self-esteem.Watch for the warning signs of fight or flight mode, such as a racing heart, sweaty palms, and shakiness. This can happen when you are extremely angry, annoyed, or hurt.
Practice different relaxation techniques and find what works for you. Deep breathing, long walks, meditation, and baths are good ways to calm down. Some people even find cleaning, exercising, or reading to be excellent ways to settle down.

, It’s important that you explain why their behavior isn’t acceptable, and that he understands why they are being reprimanded. This will teach him that their actions have consequences.


Be firm, but don’t yell. If you yell to communicate your emotions, your child will learn to do the same.Remain calm and act quickly, but not out of anger.
Speak clearly and make eye contact.
For a younger child or toddler, get down to their level when you speak to him.
Provide an explanation if your child is old enough to understand. Keep it feeling based and focus on how their behavior affects and hurts other people. For a tween or teen, discuss the repercussions of their actions or decisions on a larger scale.

, If your child is acting out, getting angry or frustrated, or being disruptive, walk away from the situation with him. Provide them with a safe space to discuss their emotions and actions, and talk about how he can improve their conduct in the future. Remember that children don’t always know how to properly express themselves, and punishment isn’t always the best way to teach them.Be encouraging and reassure your child that you are there to support him.
Tell your child you love him.
Soothe him by saying you understand.
A young child will respond best to cuddles and physical closeness at this time, which will make him feel safe and loved.
An older child who is starting to push away might not want cuddles now, but reassure him that you are there to support him, and teach him ways he can sooth or calm himself. This includes deep breathing, counting, distracting himself, listening to calming music, and visualization techniques.

, Children will often be disobedient and refuse to listen if they think they can get away with it. Create a mantra that reminds the child that you are in charge. Repeat the slogan when he misbehaves. Stick to decisions that you make, otherwise your child will think he is in control. Remember that you are the parent and not a friend, and your job isn’t to be liked, but to keep your child safe and healthy, and to teach him decency and responsibility.


To establish control, try phrases like “I’m the parent,” or “I’m in charge here.”
Don’t back down, no matter what kind of tantrum he throws. Don’t give in even if they try to manipulate you (like by holding their breath).
An older child may try to challenge you on this. Encourage him to participate in discussions about decisions that affect their life, and explore how different options will impact him. Remember that ultimately, the final decision is yours, but be prepared to explain how you reached it so he can see the responsible decision making process.

, Your child needs to observe good behavior to know what it looks like. No matter how old your child is, they will notice how you respond and behave in all kinds of situations. Make sure that you are modeling the kinds of behavior that you want your child to display.For example, if you want your child to use good manners, then make sure that you model this behavior for your child. This might be as simple as saying “please” and “thank you,” or waiting patiently in line at the grocery store.

, Sometimes children act out because they know they’ll get attention, so recognize, acknowledge, and show appreciation for good behavior instead of just reacting to bad conduct. This promotes self-esteem, encourages more good behavior, and discourages acting out. Focus on your feelings and how their behavior positively affects you both, and he will learn that good behavior is its own reward.


Tell him when you are proud of a good choice he made.
Be specific when you praise him and emphasize the behavior you want to acknowledge.
Depending on their age, thank them for good listening skills, sharing, or for completing chores and tasks.
Compare past behavior with present actions and focus on how he has improved. Set realistic goals for further improvement in the future., Give your child a small prize to thank him for listening, playing nicely, completing chores, and other good behaviors. Granting a privilege can also be used as a reward, but avoid using food, as this can lead to bad eating habits. Don’t bribe your child into behaving by giving rewards beforehand.


Some families use a sticker chart to track positive changes for a younger child. Tell them what is expected of him in order to earn a sticker, and at the end of the day have a family meeting where you discuss their conduct that day and what they did to earn a sticker (or not).
Points systems can also work, where good behavior earns children points that can be redeemed for fun activities or gifts.Points systems can earn an older child privileges like use of the car or time with their friends.

, Children often act out because they feel they have no control. Grant your child the power to make some small decisions and he will feel more in control, and will act out less.Allow him to choose between a book and coloring before dinner or bedtime when he’s young.
Let him pick out their own clothes.
Give them the option of what toys to play with in the bath.
Ask them what kind of sandwich he prefers for lunch.
As they gets older, the decisions can get slightly more important. Let they choose classes if his school allows that, or let they decide what after school sports or activities to participate in.
Let them choose what snack they want at the supermarket.

"
"
Decide ahead of time what behaviors are serious enough to spank for.,
Sit down and talk with your child.,
When the child misbehaves and/or commits one of the behaviors that you deemed serious enough to possibly warrant a spanking, put the child in time-out.,
Once you are calm, think about the best consequence for the offense.,
If you decide to not spank the child, have a discussion with the child about the misbehavior and then announce what the consequence will be.,
If you decide a spanking is necessary, have a discussion with the child about the misbehavior and then announce that the consequence will be a spanking.

,
Pull down the child's pants and underwear.,
Bend your child over your knee.,
Relax your hand and all your limbs, with one firm hand on their back and one on their bottom.,
Begin spanking.,
If the child is squirming and struggling during the spanking, apply more pressure with your hand on the child's back to help hold him down.

,
Know when to stop.,
After the spanking, comfort and reassure the child that the spanking is over and that you still love them more than they could possibly imagine.,
After they calm down, have a brief talk with them.,
Hug the child more, and give them another kiss.",How to Use Spanking As a Last Resort," Think about behaviors that are absolutely unacceptable and serious in your view. Some example ideas are lying, deliberate disobedience/defiance, stealing, or violence. You can choose whatever behaviors you consider serious enough to deserve the ultimate punishment (when spanking is used as a last resort, that is how it should be viewed of, as the ultimate sanction).;
, Discuss the rules, what behaviors could result in a spanking, and how the spanking will be carried out. Be sure that the conversation is open, and the child feels free to ask any questions he/she may have, or to voice any comments.

, This should be done by having the child sit on a chair or stand in the corner facing the corner, and should be in a boring area. While the child is in time-out, take some deep breaths and ensure you are calm.

, Consider the child's age, personality, the details of the offense, and whether it is a repeat or first time offense. Remind yourself of the many alternatives to spanking, such as time-out, grounding, removal of privileges, extra chores, etc. Consider even if a scolding/lecture would suffice.

, Then enforce it.

,, A spanking should always be given on the bare bottom for several reasons; the child will feel each spank more, you can see the child's bottom as you spank, and spanking over pants, especially jeans, can just plain hurt the parent's hand more than the child's bottom! Moreover, a spanking on the bare bottom is the fairest way to spank (because there is no influence of the child's clothing), and it is also a more personal and many feel more effective method of discipline.

, Sit down on an armless chair, a couch or a bed and pull the child over your lap.

, Make sure your child isn't squirming.

, Keep your hand relaxed, especially at the wrist. There is no need to lift your arm high between each spank. A spank delivered from moderate height and with a flexible wrist will be stingy and painful without unnecessary force. Keep a safe distance from the genital area, the tailbone and the kidneys of the child.

,, During the spanking, it is important to pay attention to the child's bottom and the child's reactions. Give at least 1x the child's age in spanks. It is permissible to give at most 2-3x the child's age in spanks, except in extreme circumstances. If you give more than 1x the child's age (for more serious misbehaviours only), it can be useful to make short stops (not more than 2) with a short comment why another series of swats is given (i. e first series for lying, second for being rude). DO NOT stop spanking because the child whines/begs you to or starts crying. If you stop because of them whining and begging, it teaches them you won't follow all the way through with your word and consequences, which will be disastrous. If you stop immediately when they start crying, it teaches children that the sooner in the spanking they cry (even if it's fake crying) the less painful it will be (and the more ineffective). However, you should NEVER punish crying before, during, or after a spanking. It is completely natural.

, It is very recommendable to hug/hold the child during this time.

, Discuss why they were spanked. Tell them that you spanked because you love them and that discipline is part of that love. Emphasize that they can prevent future spankings by thinking about their actions and making good choices. Tell them that they have paid the price for their misbehavior and they are completely forgiven now,.

, Don't mention it again.

Avoid arguing with your child.Older children and teenagers are notorious for testing boundaries.",How to Punish a Child in the Right Way," It is normal for toddlers to try to assert control over their environment. However, when their desire for autonomy results in aggression, destruction, or it jeopardizes their own safety, it’s your job to intervene. Toddlers are still quite nonverbal and unable to process a lot of verbal exchange. Therefore, it’s important to stick to very brief instructions.


Typically the word no is overused and children are desensitized to it. In urgent situations such as a hot oven, use the word, ""no,"" but in other situations is it better to offer a statement of fact that also gives the child a reason why the behavior is not correct. For example, instead of ""no hitting people"" parents should say ""people are not for hitting."" Or instead of ""no throwing of toys"" parents should say ""toys are not for throwing."";
, Immediately after you give the brief verbal instruction, modify the behavior.This can be done by removing the child from the unwanted behavior or situation. For example, if the child is pushing another child, you can remove her hands from the other child by placing her arms at her sides. Alternatively, you could pick her up and place her a few feet away from the other child.


If she is trying to access something that is dangerous, take the item from her. For example, if she is holding a breakable glass, you can take the object from her.

, Toddlers have very short attention spans and can be easily distracted. Try to engage her with an alternate activity.For example, if she is being aggressive with another child on the playground because she wants to play with a ball, you could distract her by taking her to the swings. Be creative; toddlers are easily entertained.
You should continue to monitor the child to make sure that the behavior does not recur.

, Toddlers often have trouble controlling their emotions. This behavior is not always willful disobedience but usually demonstrates their low frustration tolerance.Help your child to regain control by removing her from the place of misbehavior.


You should be empathetic with the child but still establish limits. Do not yell at the child or disrespect her in anyway. The point is to help her regain emotional control, so that means that you have to remain emotional control yourself.

, When a child is having a temper tantrum, she may not willingly stay were you place her. To avoid injury to herself and to help her regain control, try gently but firmly holding her on your lap until she is calm again.Toddlers are very vulnerable to feelings of abandonment, so be sure to never leave a toddler unsupervised in a timeout situation. Always remain with her.

, Once she has regained emotional control, be sure to provide some verbal reassurance.Again, it’s important to keep the verbal exchange short so that she understands. You could say something like, “Looks like you’re feeling better” or “Kaylee is calm now.”

, Now that she is calm, redirect her to another activity.It is best to guide her toward an activity that is not near the place where the tantrum occurred. This will help to prevent the recurrence of the unwanted behavior and tantrum.

, The area should be a safe, boring place that is not entertaining for the child.Try to avoid high traffic areas and places that have distractions such as a television, toys, or other children.The timeout area should be selected in advance so that you aren’t distracted trying to find an appropriate space when misbehavior occurs.

, If your child is misbehaving, start by giving her a warning.Make sure that the warning is clear and spoken in simple and concrete language that is easily understood. Emphasize choice and responsibility when giving consequences, such as, ""Kylie, if you choose to hit your sister again, then you choose to take a timeout.""

, If the behavior continues, it is time to immediately implement the consequence. Always follow through with the timeout; this way you will avoid making empty threats. If you don’t follow through, then your child will learn to not take you seriously.


Briefly tell your child why she is being required to take a timeout. Do not spend a lot of time talking and avoid arguing altogether. A simple statement such as, “You are going to timeout because you kicked the wall” is sufficient.
Physically guide the child to a timeout area if she refuses to go on her own. Escort her gently but firmly by the arm or pick her up and take her to the timeout spot.
Remain calm when your child misbehaves. Remember, misbehavior on some level is developmentally appropriate for children. It is your responsibility to model appropriate behavior.

, Determine how long the timeout should be based upon your child’s age. Most child development experts agree that the appropriate timeframe for timeout is one minute per year of age.Require your child to stay in timeout for the designated timeframe. A timer that sounds when the time is up will help you and your child keep track of the time.


Your child may try to refuse to stay in timeout. If she tries to leave the timeout seat, gently and consistently guide her back to the chair.

, Reintroduce the child back into a positive activity when the appropriate amount of time elapses. If she is still engaging in agitated behavior when the timeout is over, it may be helpful to tell her that once she is calm that she is free to rejoin the rest of the family or her peers.


Before resuming normal activities, you may want to have a discussion about what happened.Don’t berate or lecture the child but use the experience as a learning opportunity instead. For example, you could say, “Kicking the wall can leave holes in the wall. Let’s try to use your words when you’re frustrated.""

, Make sure that all caretakers are on board with the rules. It is very important that everyone is on the same page with discipline so that the children are unable to split or undermine adults.


Try to include your children in making some of the rules. However, it’s okay to have some nonnegotiable rules on important issues like curfew, grade expectations, church attendance, or anything else that is important to your family.
Identify “off limits” behavior.Examples of off-limits behavior might include things like saying “I hate you,” engaging in aggressive behavior, calling people names, cheating, using profanity, or playing derogatory music. You choose the off-limits behavior that is the most appropriate for your lifestyle and establish rules around them.
Make sure that the rules are concrete and specific so that there is no room for misinterpretation. For example, it is better to establish the rule “You must be home by 7pm” then to say “You must be home before it gets dark.”

, Be sure to explain the consequences of any rule infractions in advance. The child or teenager should know exactly how violations will be enforced before any actual violation occurs.Consequences should be things that can be easily implemented and you should always follow through with them. Empty threats will weaken your influence and your kids will learn to not take you or the rules as seriously.
Try making a list of activities or privileges that your child enjoys. Withdrawal of these privileges can be effective consequences.
Sometimes natural consequences are more appropriate. These consequences are the direct result of the child's actions and are not inflicted upon her by the parent.For example, the natural consequence that occurs when your daughter does not put her jeans into the hamper is that the jeans are not clean for school the next day.

Natural consequences should ONLY be used if the child is not in danger of being harmed.



, Be consistent with the application of consequences so that your child or teenager will take you seriously.This means that if the rule is that your child is home by 7pm and she walks in at 7:15pm, then the consequence should be applied.


If there is no rule in place about a particular behavior when it occurs, then take time to establish the rule at that point.
Do not alter natural consequences. For example, if your daughter's jeans were not washed because they were not in the hamper, do not do a special load of laundry just to accommodate her.

, If you have made the rules clear and she has clearly violated one or more of them, then the consequence is applied. If you find yourself in a fighting match with your child, it is okay to remove yourself from the no-win argument. Keep in mind that the consequence is still valid but you have removed yourself from the argument.


It is important to empathize and recognize feeling prior to reaffirming the rule. For example, if your 13 year old is screaming, “It’s not fair, Stacey was allowed to stay out until midnight,” you could respond by saying, “I can tell you are upset and feeling let down, but this is not Stacey's family and my decision is final.""
This approach should only be used if she continues to argue with you after you’ve already reminded her of the rule and the consequence of violating it. It minimizes the power struggle and makes it clear that the rule still stands.

Social networking






Bunking classes and exams






Obsession with porn and opposite sex






Stealing money or anything else






Bad behavior and vulgar language






Obsession with your image/outlook;
, Although you may have figured out your mistakes, are you simply going to not do those and eliminate them? And what about those whom you have hurt? It's time you go to your parents and apologize.

,,


Now as you have decided on your mistakes then it’s about time we eliminate them. But these addictions can return, the only way of eliminating them is by replacing them with good ones.

Deal with Addiction to drugs & alcohol?

Replace the habit with adventure & juices respectively. Adventure will give you a pleasure of visiting the awesome nature outside and soon you will get addicted to it(Take your camera with you and archive your adventures with family and friends). Drinking juices will make you healthy and will give you the pleasure of drinking something sweet which everyone can accompany you with.


Deal with Love affairs with opposite sex?

Try to balance your relationships with opposite sex and replace the habit of having affairs with the thrill of getting to know people as complex persons. Do no use and discard people, if you don't value people you can't value yourself and you're just deluding yourself all the time. Have conversations with teachers and people you value about course subjects, stands in life, your present challenges and with elders about their past experiences to gain the pleasure of knowing the precious knowledge that is gained by your teachers and elders with a lot of hardship and you are lucky to get it , just by listening with interest and empathy.


Deal with social networking?

Well social networking is something that starts creating an illusionary world in your mind and constantly bugs you for more updates just like a virus eats away whole cell. Its recommended to delete your account immediately and replace the habit of social networking with any sports like basketball wherein you exercise both mentally and physically and your mind starts exploring real world by strategizing to win against or compete with opponents. More than that it gives you a real goal.


Deal with Bunking classes and exams?

Well bunking classes can only be replaced by going to classes.Going to classes makes sure that you don't have to study anything for first time especially when you are reading the concepts from the book.


Deal with obsession with porn and opposite sex?

This obsession can be replaced with doing exercise and praying to god. Here the trick is whenever you have an urge for any of your obsession; you simply call the name of god in your mind or do exercise. The concept is the farther you go from a certain thing the more closer you get to some other thing. When your conscience tells you you're somehow in for trouble, try to do something different that makes you focus somewhere else.


Deal with Stealing money or anything else?

This bad habit can be replaced with saving money and creating new things so that your mind diverts towards constructive things which bring you fame.


Deal with Bad behavior and vulgar language?

This thing can only be changed by being friends with those soft spoken nerds. This will improve your language and also create a competitive spirit to compete with your friends. It’s all about the environment you choose to be in.


Deal with Obsession with your image/outlook?

Well this is not a bad habit it’s just teenage nature however with self-realization of the thing that it’s not what you wear defines you but it’s your work that defines you. So replace it with creative works like drawing, photography, mechanics, handicrafts...





, Keep no room for laziness. Instead of postponing exercises and diet try postponing laziness.

, Remember for our brain becomes moldy or difficult if we don't practice regularly and later it creates havoc by moving onto things which you have practiced that's distraction. To get your brain to its senses practice meditation daily to improve your mind stability. Solve puzzles, Sudoku, anagrams, etc. Do them daily for half an hour. Challenge your brain to think everything logically and not by mere intuition.

, Meet your teachers. Don’t keep a grudge on any of them and just say one thing to them: ""I seek knowledge. Please guide me in this path, as I am ignorant."" Say this in whatever way fits you best. This will make you attentive in the class and also loyal to the subjects. If your past deeds left a hole in your knowledge, then you can ask your friends to help you and even ask your teachers for help.

, Become busy. The busier you are the more time you will get for other activities which are important for an all-round development.

, Learn daily a new activity or concept in games or studies respectively.

, In turn you too will be motivated to inspire more people just by working even more hard.

, Always try to solve everything to the maximum extent possible way so that you have no regrets.

, Be like a lion and handle everything as if you are the king. Start speaking up if something is wrong or you have a doubt. Starting will be little heart pounding but that's nothing but an experience and as you proceed you would have become one of the successful students who knows even more.

,, Make sure you study everything in advance so that in class it becomes bit easy and also becomes a revision class. Remember successful people prepare beforehand.

, Be an early-man! The early man here implies the one who does everything early like studying beforehand, waking up early, first one to ask a doubt or answer a question. Etc.

Identify the child’s need.,
Consider the child’s age and development.,
Talk to your local children’s librarian.,
Look for book lists online.,
Examine the book’s storyline.",How to Use Bibliotherapy with a Child1," Determine the behavior or situation you want to address. Try to be as specific as you can about the issue, in order to have a better chance of the book resonating with your child.


For example, say your child is having problems in school. Think about the kinds of problems your child is having: Academic problems? Problems with a particular subject? Does your child struggle to pay attention in class? Does your child have a hard time making friends in school? Narrow your focus as much as possible.;
, How old is the child? Can the child read on their own? The book you choose needs to be well-matched to the child’s age, mental and emotional development, and reading level in order for the child to follow and engage with the storyline.For example, a book geared toward a preschool child’s school day would not connect with a fourth grade child’s school day, and vice versa.
Even if a child is able to read independently, you still may wish to find a read-aloud book that you can share with them.

, They can point you in the direction of age-appropriate books pertaining to your topic.If they do not have a certain book available, many libraries will help you locate the book at another local library, or may even order it for their collection.


For example, you could ask your librarian, “My four-year-old is afraid of going to the doctor. Do you have any books that could help understand going to the doctor and help her feel better about it?”
Some libraries have kits or bags that can be checked out that pertain to a particular subject matter, like death, divorce, or moving. These kits often have books, movies, and other resources that could be helpful to your child.

, You may try searching for lists of books that pertain to your topic, like “Books on the loss of a pet for a five-year-old.” You may also try searching for book lists put together by bibliotherapists, librarians, or mental health professionals. Here are some sample lists:


Teen mental health issues: http://www.slj.com/2014/11/teens-ya/bibliotherapy-for-teens-helpful-tips-and-recommended-fiction/#_

Elementary school social concerns: http://www.gcisd-k12.org/Page/17923

Dealing with emotions for babies and toddlers: https://www.zerotothree.org/resources/7-books-about-feelings-for-babies-and-toddlers


, While you are deciding upon an appropriate book for the child, you may want to skim the book and get a sense of what happens in the book. Things you may want to consider:


The child needs to be able to identify with a character dealing with the same problems and connect with them emotionally.Therefore, if you have a choice, you may wish to choose a book with a protagonist the same gender or age as your child.
Determine if the book reflects the outcome you wish to see with the child. Look for a book with positive behavior changes, and/or evidence of the character’s growth and understanding.For example, if you are looking for a book about moving, you may want a book in which the character is sad to leave their ol home, but makes new friends at their new school.
Look for a book that appropriately expresses the emotional reality of the child. For example, while some children may be excited about moving (and some books reflect this), your child is anxious and sad. Look for a book which has a character struggling with the same emotions.
If the child is younger, examine the book’s illustrations to determine if they appropriately represent the text and the character’s emotions.
Ensure that the problem your child and the protagonist are facing is successfully resolved. For example, if you are looking for a book that addresses school performance, make sure that the character shows how their studying and paying attention in class helped them earn a good grade."
"
Consider your child’s age.,
Be aware that boys tend to be more aggressive than girls, though girls are also very capable of violent behavior.,
Understand different temperaments.,
Know that family dynamics can play a role in aggression.,
Be aware that the way that you discipline your child can affect his violent tendencies.,
Know that some physical or neurologic conditions can lead to aggressive behavior.,
Take a look at your child’s sleeping patterns.",How to Understand Violent Behavior in Children1," Younger children, generally between the ages of two and four, may have a hard time expressing their thoughts and feelings because their communications skills are not fully developed. This inability to communicate may lead to violent behavior as a means to express themselves.


This aggressive behavior will most likely decrease as your child grows older and learns how to express himself without resorting to violence.;
, Girls tend to have more of a control over their anger, while boys often express themselves physically by punching or fighting. However, verbal aggression is more common in girls.This verbal aggression comes in the forms of name-calling, teasing, or gossiping, as well as nonverbal cues like eye-rolling or ignoring someone.

, Each child differs in how he handles his temper; just as results will react differently to the same stimuli. Children’s temperaments are generally classified as either “easy” or “difficult”.


Children with “easy” temperaments tend to display positive emotions and are generally adaptable to different situations.
Children with “difficult” temperaments tend to show negative emotions and do not adapt well to new situations.

, Often, the way that a child handles a situation depends on how he has seen his family resolve a similar conflict. Because of this, it is important to take your own behavior into consideration when trying to understand your child’s aggressive behavior.


Monitoring your own behavior will be discussed more thoroughly in Method 3.

, Different forms of discipline can have different affects on children because children tend to mimic their parents or caregivers. If children are exposed to even mildly aggressive forms of discipline, they may develop these aggressive behaviors themselves.


Try to maintain a fair and consistent form of discipline that does not involve violence in any way. This will be discussed more thoroughly in Method 3.

, There are some health related problems and conditions that could affect a child and make his display aggressive behavior.For example, children with ADHD may display abrupt and aggressive behaviors

, Children who do not get enough sleep, or are having trouble sleeping at night may display more aggressive behaviors. This is because they are overtired, making them cranky and more prone to violent outbursts.

Examine the links between a situation, a thought, and a feeling.,
Recognize automatic thoughts.,
Link your automatic thoughts to your core beliefs.,
Identify cognitive distortions.",How to Use Cognitive Behavioral Therapy1," You may believe that a bad situation leads to negative feelings. The CBT approach challenges this by stating that it is the thoughts we have that lead us to have those emotions. A situation gives rise to a thought which in turn leads to a feeling or action.Here is an example of how a positive outcome is linked to thought: You went to the gym and exercised. You thought that you accomplished your fitness goal for the day. You felt satisfied and happy.
Now here is an example of a negative outcome: You went to the gym and exercised. You thought that you didn't push yourself hard enough to meet your goal. You felt disappointed or not good enough.;
, You have brief thoughts throughout the day that are triggered by a situation. You may not notice or pay attention to these thoughts, but with CBT it is important to have awareness of these quick thoughts. Pay specific attention to negative (or maladaptive) thoughts that you have when reflecting on a situation.Maladaptive automatic thoughts are distorted reflections on an event, but you may accept them as true. These maladaptive thoughts may then trigger feelings of sadness, anxiety, frustration, or hopelessness.
Here is an example of a maladaptive automatic thought--""I'm a failure, and I'll never amount to anything."" This thought is after you get a lower grade than you wanted on a class exam. You then feel hopeless and depressed.
Now here is a positive thought process--""This is just one exam, and I can continue to work hard at this to bring my grades up."" You are more likely to be hopeful with this thought.

, Underneath your automatic thoughts, you may have core beliefs that are distorted reflections of reality. These core beliefs are what drive these maladaptive thoughts. Thinking about how your core beliefs may be skewed towards negative thinking will help you to understand why maladaptive thoughts occur. Your core beliefs are related to your self-esteem or self-confidence. You may believe that you are unlovable or not-good-enough which leads to a pattern of obsessive behavior or continued feelings of anxiety or depression.
While CBT acknowledges how core beliefs impact your present problems and thoughts, the techniques of CBT do not focus primarily on the past history of one's core beliefs but instead on how to address the present problems at hand.

, There are many different ways that you may distort your thoughts which lead to negative emotions or behaviors. Notice the ways that you think or talk about a problem, and how you may be doing one or more of the following:Catastrophizing by predicting only negative outcomes in the future
Having all-or-nothing thinking
Discounting the positive
Labeling something or someone without knowing more about it or them
Rationalizing based on emotions rather than facts
Minimizing or magnifying the situation
Having ""tunnel vision"" by seeing only the negatives
Mind reading in which you believe you know what someone is thinking
Overgeneralizing by making an overall negative conclusion beyond the current situation
Personalizing the situation as something specifically wrong with you

They try to control you.,
They don’t share.,
They ignore people.,
They won’t play alone.,
You have to bribe them constantly.,
They are rude or mean to others.",How to Tell if Your Child Is Spoiled1," Spoiled children often have difficulty with positive social interactions. They will try to control you and take up all your time. If you try to leave to go on a date or out with friends, they might throw a fit to keep you home., A spoiled child finds it difficult to share with others. Notice how your child interacts on playdates and whether they share or hoard their toys. Notice if the other children share their own toys with your child., Your spoiled child has likely learned that they do not have to respond to you to get what they want. They might also know that you won’t correct them if they ignore other adults.If your child ignores you more than they speak to you, they might have a hearing issue. See how they respond to loud noises and consider getting their ears checked.

, Remember that spoiled children are attention seekers. They are often bored easily, relying on others to entertain them constantly. Spoiled children are rarely, if ever, content with playing or watching television alone. They will likely whine, cry, or throw a fit until you join them., If you have to offer your child treats, money or other rewards to make them behave, then you are spoiling the child. Notice how often your child does as they are supposed to without being told, or once instructed. If cooperation is rare and you have to bargain with them, they are probably spoiled., Observe how your child treats others. If you notice that they pick on other kids when at play, or are rude to adults, then you very likely have a brat on your hands. Think back on any rude comments that they have made to you, as well.Observe whether they are more likely to make a rude comment than a kind one.

"
"
Employ logical consequences if a child is three years or older.,
Identify the behavior that requires correction.,
Offer your child a choice.,
Apply the consequence right away and use an appropriate time frame.,
Acknowledge mutual rights and responsibilities.",How to Train Your Children to Obey Without Using Timeouts1," To use logical consequences, a child must understand the connection between his or her actions and the consequences that follow. Logical consequences will not work until children are old enough to start understanding the consequences of their actions, so do not use this method for children under the age of three., Before you start to apply logical consequences, it is important to identify the behavior that you want to correct. Take a moment to think about what exactly your child is doing that needs to stop or change. Some examples of behaviors that you may need to correct include:


not putting away toys
refusing to do homework
being rude or disrespectful

, As a disciplinary strategy, logical consequences work best when a child is aware that there will be a consequence for a particular action. This helps prevent a power struggle because the child cannot claim that she didn’t know the rules. Warnings also empower your child to correct inappropriate behavior on her own.For example, you might say something like, “You can put your bike away, or it may be stolen or damaged by the rain. That would mean you could not ride it anymore. The choice is yours.”
Try to speak clearly and calmly as you offer the choice.
Do not offer a choice that is an imposed punishment. For example, do not say something like, “If you do not put your toys away right now, then you will not get any dessert tonight!”, Timing is important when disciplining your child.If you punish your child's misbehavior the day after it happens, the logical connection between the misbehavior and the consequence may be lost on a child. On the other hand, if you confiscate a toy or revoke a privilege for a very long time – say one month – your child may forget what the initial misbehavior was, and simply become resentful.


For small children, confiscating a toy or revoking a privilege for the rest of the day should be sufficient.
As your child ages, longer time-frames become more effective. For example, if a pre-teen is playing video games instead of doing homework, it may be appropriate to revoke video game privileges for numerous days.

, In some situations, you may not need to resort to a logical consequence punishment. You may be able to correct your child while helping her see that you respect her rights. This will show that you are not just imposing your authority on her, which may make a power struggle less likely.


For example, if your child is listening to loud music while you need to make a phone call, you might acknowledge mutual rights and responsibilities by saying something like, “Can you please turn the music down or listen with your headphones for a while? I need to make a phone call. You can turn it back up when I'm through.”"
"
Read the story with the child.,
Talk about the problem through the character.,
Help the child realize they are not alone.,
Give the child activities that connect with the book.",How to Use Bibliotherapy with a Child2," Present the book to the child when they are in a good mood and seem receptive to hearing about the concern. Set aside enough time afterwards so that you are able to discuss the story with the child.Try saying, “I got this book at the library today. I thought it was neat because it was about making new friends! Do you want to read it with me?” If the child says no, put the book down in a place where they can see it and try again later. They might look at the pictures or try to read it on their own.
Do not present the story to your child at a time of stress, or immediately in the wake of the behavior you are trying to correct. The child will be less receptive.
For an older child who reads on their own, you could give them the book and say something like, “I was at the bookstore the other day and saw this book. It reminded me of what we were talking about the other day. Maybe you’d like to read it.” Follow up with the child in a few days.
Remain easygoing. Keep the mood light as you read the book. You do not want to put pressure on the child to accept the book as a prescription for their problem; rather, you want to create a sense of excitement. For example, “Wow, this character is going through the same thing you are! I wonder what he does to figure it out!”

, Kids often feel better talking about problems secondhand. It is easier to say, “Look at the problem she is having! She must be sad,” then to say, “Dealing with this problem makes me sad.” Talking about the issue through the book will help a child feel less defensive and vulnerable about their emotions.Ask questions about the character, like: Why do you think the character behaved that way? What do you think the character should do instead? How did you think the character felt when that happened?If you are reading the book to the child, you could pause throughout the book to ask questions about what is happening. This will help you gauge if the child is making connections to the text.

, Hopefully, the child will be able to make the connection between their problem and the character’s, but you can also articulate this for them. State that the child is not the only one who is dealing with the same issue, and that there are many people who have the same concerns as the child.You could say, “Do you see in this book that this boy was also afraid of going to the hospital? That’s very normal, almost everybody gets nervous about going to the hospital.”

, Help the child bring the book to life by thinking more about the book or coming up with other ways to engage with it.Don’t push it if the child doesn’t seem interested, but if the book resonated with the child, you might consider:


Suggesting that the child draw a picture about what the character does next, or what the character could have done instead in the story.
Having the child act out being the character in the book, both at the beginning of the story (the “problem” part) and the end (the resolution). This can help the child connect the book to their own behavior.
Doing an activity together that is inspired by the book. For example, maybe you read a book about the death of a grandparent, and in the book the character memorializes their grandparent by making a scrapbook filled with memories. Suggest to the child that the two of you do the same, or create another memorial the child would prefer.

"
"
Consider writing your own story.,
Develop a story.,
Keep the story light and fictional.",How to Use Bibliotherapy with a Child3," You might not be able to find a book that addresses the child’s issues, or you may not feel that the books available are appropriate to your child. You may decide to create your own story about a child facing a similar problem.


You can decide if you want to write out the story, and perhaps illustrate it, or tell the story aloud to the child.

, Think of ways the child exhibits a particular behavior or deals with a certain situation, common consequences to the child’s actions, and the outcome you would like to see.


Describe the child’s current behavior or situation at the beginning of the story. Have the child engage in this behavior and then receive consequences for their actions. Or, the child is exposed to a new situation and doesn’t know how to handle it.
Describe the character’s reaction to the situation. For example, “When Sally the Bunny was teased on the playground, her ears drooped and she got very quiet.” Or, “Even though the teacher had already told him to raise his hand, Johnny couldn’t resist shouting out the answer again. The teacher told Johnny to stay after school.” The child should be able to relate to the main character’s “crisis” in the story.Enter a character like parent, teacher, or someone older and respected. This character connects with the protagonist and helps them understand what they are feeling, giving them ways to change their behavior. Present a solution that you think your child would be willing to try.Give the character another opportunity to face the same situation, this time using the techniques they learned to successfully solve the problem. For example, “After talking to Miss Cabbage, Little Onion knew just what to say when the other kids at Vegetable School called her stinky. And she made sure to take a good bath in the sink that night.”
Your character in the story will successfully face the situation in the story using the new behavior or coping skills, and will live happily ever after!

, People like to be entertained, not preached at. Provide silly moments in the story and don’t let it get too heavy. Remember, you want to give the child tools to deal with the issue, not leave them overwhelmed or daunted by it.Don’t give the character the same name as the child. Consider making the protagonist the child’s favorite animal, or give them a silly nonsense name to make the child laugh.
Use language close enough to what your child hears to allow them to make the connection to their own life, just make sure you are changing it up enough so that it does not sound like the story is about them.For example, “Tommy, make your bed!” could become, “Silly Goose, make your nest!”
Create a fictional place for the setting. Don’t give it the same name as the child’s town or school.
While your story may need to contain consequences for the character’s behavior, do not make the consequences so dire that you will frighten the child. For example, “Robbie behaved so badly at school that he had to miss the pizza party,” would be better than, “Robbie behaved so badly that the principal locked him in the janitor’s closet for the rest of the day.”

"
Evaluate your child’s toys.,
Understand that the media may affect your child’s behavior.,
Look at your child’s social environment.,
Consider your own behavior.,
Understand that exposure to violence can affect your child’s behavior.",How to Understand Violent Behavior in Children2," The toys that your child plays with can have an influence on your child’s behavior. Some toys, like pretend guns, swords, knives, or slingshots, may cause your child to play violently, as they are violent items. When your child plays violent games, that violence may transfer to his other actions, causing him to become aggressive.


Consider giving your child education toys that encourage thinking, creativity, and problem solving. These toys may include Legos, clay, blocks, or a painting kit.

, The media includes TV shows, video games, the internet, and much more. While there are some restrictions placed on the media, there is still a relatively loose limit on the amount of violence that can be shown. When your child watches a TV show that focuses on violence, he is may begin to consider this acceptable behavior.Try to restrict the shows that your child watches, particularly if he is around the age of two.

, Children tend to look up to and mimic their peers, which means that they will accept the behaviors that their friends display as good behavior. If your child hangs out with another child who tends to make snarky remarks to the teacher, or throws temper tantrums, your child may see these behaviors as things that are fine to do.


If you have your child’s friend over and notice that he displays a lot of aggressive behavior, consider talking to his parents. If it becomes very bad, you may consider limiting the amount of time your child can spend with that friend.

, Children can be influenced by the people taking care of them. These people include parents, babysitters, older siblings, and teachers. Make sure that you model the appropriate behavior, and that others who take care of your child are also displaying decent behaviors.


A caregiver who builds a child’s self-esteem, confidence, and trust will encourage him to learn how to establish meaningful relationship with other people.

, If your child has been exposed to trauma, danger, or violence, this exposure can affect his behavior.For example, if your child witnessed abuse being done to someone else, this could affect his behavior.


Family therapy sessions may help your child to understand and deal with the trauma.

"
"
Give your child a brief time out.,
Teach your child about appropriate behaviors.,
Set clear expectations.,
Create behavioral contracts with your child.,
Talk openly with your child about his emotions.,
Use a reward system.,
Be a good role model.,
Choose the appropriate parenting style.,
Seek help from family and friends.,
Intervene as soon as possible.",How to Understand Violent Behavior in Children3," If your child has a violent outburst, give him a brief time out, rather than reacting harshly and punishing them physically. This could be sending him to the ‘time out’ chair, or simply sending him to his room. Separating him from the situation may help to calm him down, as well as give you time to calm yourself down.


To determine how long you should put your child in time out for, consider how old your child is. Use one minute per year of age to figure out how long your child should be in time out.
Make sure that the area you put your child in down not reward your child. For instance, your child may simply play with his toys if he is sent to his room, so instead you may send him to a couch in the corner where there are no toys.

, Explain to your child that his violent behaviors are ‘bad ways to behave’. Help your child to understand what ‘good ways to behave’ are. To do this:


Role play to teach your child how you would like him to react when he feels upset or is faced with a conflict. Teach him ways to solve his problems. For example, pretend you are another child who decides to play with your child’s favorite toy. Teach your child that instead of reacting aggressively, he should calmly ask the child for the toy back. If the child does not get it back, he can then inform an adult about the situation.
Teach your child that getting mad is a normal feeling, but that he should express himself with calm words rather than violent behaviors. Teach him to say “That makes me mad”.
Talk to your child about the things that make him frustrated, so that they can be avoided in the future.

, Tell your child how you would like him to behave. Give him examples of things that he is allowed to do, and things that you would rather he avoided. Explain that you do not want him to hit people or grab toys from other children, and that you expect him to avoid these behaviors.


You should also give your child alternative behaviors that you approve of, such as asking politely for a toy.

, Create a chart to monitor your child’s daily behavior.Tell him that he will get a sticker put on his chart for days when he behaves well, and that he will have a sticker taken away if he displays bad behaviors.


Consider setting a goal with your child. For example, if your child goes a whole week without having a sticker taken away, he gets a special treat on the weekend.

, Let your child know that you are there to listen to his thoughts and that he can express his feelings to you. Helping your child to express what he is feeling will help to keep him from bottling his emotions up. When your child does not express what he is feeling, he may be more likely to have a violent outburst.


If your child has a hard time expressing himself with words, consider getting flashcards that have different emotions on them, or an emotion chart. Each day, or even several times throughout the day, ask your child to select the emotion that he is feeling, and try to have him explain why he is feeling that way.

, Once you have set expectations about your child’s behavior, reward his good behaviors. Let your child know that you are proud of him when he shares his toy, or asks politely for something, rather than throwing a temper tantrum.


When you notice your child behaving appropriately, notice and commend his behavior. Tell him how proud you are. Tell your child that he should be proud of himself. This can help your child develop an internal sense of pride that will hopefully keep violent outbursts at bay.

, As mentioned above, children tend to mimic their parents or caregivers. Because of this, it is important that you model the behavior that you want your child to display. Do not ever react violently towards your child.If something frustrating or angering happens, keep your emotions in check if you are around your child, and express how the situation made you feel in a calm manner.


Consider coming up with an activity that both you and your child can do when you are stressed or angry. For example, you could put on a certain song and dance to it when you feel negative emotions.

, Try to create a fair discipline system. Stick to reasonable restrictions. If your child acts inappropriately, send him to the time out chair, rather than spanking him or yelling at him. These latter too behaviors may cause your child to act violently, as he may mimic your own actions.


Make time to spend some quality time with your child each day. A child who feels loved is often less likely to act out aggressively to get attention.
Consider trying to redirect your child’s aggression. If you see your child hitting another child, explain to him why that is bad to do. Teach him that the only thing he can hit is his ‘punching pillow’. He is not allowed to hit anything but that pillow.

, Ask others for help if you are having a hard time managing your child’s aggressive behaviors. Seek the advice of others; chances are other parents are also dealing with the same behaviors.


You can also read books dedicated to the topic of stopping aggressive behaviors in children.
Seek professional help by going to a doctor or child psychologist. A professional may recommend that you enroll your child in a course or therapy session that will teach him how to react to things that make him mad.

, If you’ve noticed that the child has violent tendencies, act on it right away. Correct it with proper parenting or consult a psychologist on how to handle the child, especially if your child has a mental disorder.

Create a thought record.,
Develop balanced thinking.,
Identify pleasant activities.,
Take action and engage in those activities.,
Monitor your mood at different times of the day.,
Replace negative thoughts with positive ones.",How to Use Cognitive Behavioral Therapy2," By putting your thoughts in writing, you will be able to see your thoughts and emotions a little differently. The thought record should include a section about the situation, the automatic thought, and the emotion, and a separate section that reflects on the pros-and-cons, and another possible way to think about the situation. Your thought record should help to answer all these questions:What actually happened? Include where, what, when, and how.
What thought went through your mind? Create rating scale of how much you believed it was true such as from 1-10 or 1-100.
What emotion did you feel? Rate the intensity using a scale.
What has happened to make you believe this thought is true?
What has happened to disprove this thought?
What is another way to look at this situation?
How would you rate your mood after reviewing all these questions? Use a scale.

, Just like when making an argument, your thinking may have pros and cons, or different ways of seeing the same thing. Think about the alternative ways of seeing a situation, or how to imagine a different approach or reaction to the situation.Open your mind up to other possible outcomes or ways of thinking.
Identify alternative ways of thinking about a situation that are possible or believable to you.
Consider asking someone you trust to identify different ways of thinking about the situation. Does that other person understand the problem or situation in a different or more positive way? Listen closely to those alternatives.

, Think about something that you enjoy or enjoyed in the past, or something that you may want to accomplish but have not done yet. Consider activities that are possible or achievable possibly in the short term. Reimagine activities as small, doable goals.Consider scheduling one pleasant activity a day. It can be a different one each day, the same, or combination of a few. Make these activities small, but something that you can look forward to doing.If you used to play music in a band and want to be a musician again, think about activities to start with, such as playing music once a week at home. Set aside time when you can play with few distractions.

, Create an action plan. Consider writing down your goal, and then writing out your small steps. Think about the steps you need to take in the next week, month, or year, and create a timeline of how each step follows the next one.Look for alternative options or behaviors to accomplish a goal if there are barriers.
For example, a successful businessman has a physical disability that makes it difficult to continue working. He may have a goal to be working again. Consider an alternative goal of being productive, and then the plan will have more options than barriers. He may be able to teach others about business, talk with students about how to be an entrepreneur, or be productive by providing advice or guidance to his family.

, Use a daily calendar to monitor your emotions throughout the day. Consider making a ""schedule for your emotions"" by writing down what you are feeling every 3-4 hours. Look at any patterns that you see over time.Do you always feel bad at the beginning of the day and then by 12 noon you're feeling good? Think about any triggers between those times.
Or vice versa, do you feel good in the morning before work, but by 2pm each day you're feeling miserable? Identify if there were specific things or events that occurred.

, Once you have learned to identify triggers that lead to negative thoughts and behaviors, you will be more self-aware about how to activate the brain. The moment you have a negative thought, use that moment to evaluate the truth behind that thought, and what may be a different way to approach it.Come up with positive and self-affirming statements that you can remember. Use these positive statements to guide you when your anxiety or depression is triggered.
Use positive affirmations about yourself, your life, and the world around you. Identify positive things, even if they are small, that can help to train your brain to think positively.

Focus on a specific problem you wish to solve.,
Open your mind to all options.,
List the pros and cons of your options.,
Rate these pros and cons.,
Take action on a specific plan to solve the problem.,
Review the outcome of this plan.",How to Use Cognitive Behavioral Therapy3," If there is a problem that you are trying to solve, use CBT techniques to help you focus your thoughts in a clear way. When you have a lot of different emotions and thoughts in your head at once, you may need to focus on only one problem at a time.Avoid attempting to solve multiple problems at once. Start small and focus on the one problem that is your primary concern.
Focus on taking an active rather than a passive role when solving problems. , Brainstorm all the possible options, whether they are bad, good, or neutral. Write down these various options. Even ideas that seem impossible at first may help to jumpstart you in the right direction. Think about solutions or advice you might give to someone else who is facing this same problem.
Consider talking with a close friend or someone you trust for additional options.

, Think about each option available to you, Stick with the most logical options first, then create pros and cons for each. Consider the pros and cons of the options that may seem very challenging last. This list will help you to see other options in a more balanced way. Make sure to look at both the positives and negatives, and not just one or the other.
Consider whether you need advice from an expert or a professional for certain pros and cons, such as a financial advisor, lawyer, or healthcare professional.

, Examine how the pros and cons stack up relative to one another. Consider creating a rank order for your options.


Talk with someone you trust about whether these rankings seem realistic. Ask them if they have any concerns about the plan you think is best.

, Find out the steps you need to take to enact the plan you have chosen. Your pros and cons list for the option you have chosen may help you to understand the steps you need to take and the ones to avoid.Create a timeline of small steps that you need to do. With organization and planning you are more likely to carry out and achieve your goals.

, Avoid being easily deterred if your plan does not go the way you wanted. Go back to the planning phases of problem solving and figure out what missteps may have been made or not addressed.If the plan led to a positive outcome, enjoy that moment. Even if the problem is not fully ""solved,"" be thankful that you are headed in the right direction.
If the plan still needs some tweaking and negative thoughts still arise, keep going and stay motivated. Most negative thoughts, feelings, and situations don't go away overnight, but that doesn't mean they are impossible to work on.

Try deep breathing.,
Use progressive muscle relaxation exercises.,
Engage in guided imagery or other visualization techniques.",How to Use Cognitive Behavioral Therapy4," Breathing exercise can help you to cope with stressors, triggers, and automatic negative thoughts. While relaxation techniques may not ""get rid of the problem,"" it is important to learn how to focus your mind and energy constructively to avoid anxious or obsessive thoughts. Consider this abdominal breathing technique:Place one hand on your chest and the other on your abdomen.
Exhale with your mouth, and take a slow deep breath in with your nose.
Inhale as deeply as you can and hold for 7 seconds.
Slowly exhale through your mouth for 8 seconds.
As you release the air with relaxation, contract gently your abdomen to remove the remaining air from your lungs.
Repeat this cycle for a total of 5 deep breaths. Try to have rate of one breath every 10 seconds. This helps both your heart rate and your mind.

, This is another relaxation technique that starts with deep breathing, but focuses your mind on how to release muscle tensions the body. This can help relieve anxiety. It can be done with the guidance of a mental health or holistic health professional.Focus on deep breaths, and notice your breathing.
Focus on tensing and releasing muscles in the body for five seconds each.
Focus your mind on your body parts, starting with the feet. The progression is feet, legs, pelvis, stomach, back, arms, neck, and face.

, These techniques can help you redirect your negative thoughts or stressors to something peaceful and safe. They can help you when triggers for maladaptive thoughts occur. You can also do these at night before bed. Your peaceful place can be somewhere you have been before, or possibly dreamed about. Visualize this way:Close your eyes, and imagine a peaceful or happy place
Notice the colors, shapes, movement, light and textures of this place
Listen to sounds around you that emerge
Notice smells in this place
Focus on any sensations of touch such as the floor or earth beneath you, the temperature, or anything you can touch.

They embarrass you in public.,
They throw tantrums almost daily.,
They display aggressive behavior.,
They begin whining once they wake up.",How to Tell if Your Child Is Spoiled2," A child that frequently does things to shame you in front of others is likely spoiled. They might call you names, yell, scream or run away from you to upset you. Spoiled children often act this way to ensure that the attention is always on them., A spoiled child tends to act out when told ‘no’, even over simple things. For instance, if you refuse their request for a sugary cereal in the grocery store, they might hit you or scream. If this kind of meltdown happens daily, then your child is probably spoiled., When a spoiled child is not getting their way or getting attention, they might lash out violently. The might hit you, grab things from your hand with force, or even throw themselves to the floor.When your child does this, try to restrain them so they don’t hurt you or others. You can grab them and hold them until they calm down.

, A spoiled child often begins displaying such behavior from the time they wake up. This whining goes beyond the normal grumpy demeanor that they might have in the mornings. They will begin whining, crying, or asking for things almost immediately."
"
Talk to them.,
Establish and enforce punishments.,
Don’t respond to whining.,
Pull them aside when they are rude to others.,
Prepare them for any changes.,
Offer rewards for good behavior, not for avoiding bad behavior.,
Maintain a life separate from them.",How to Tell if Your Child Is Spoiled3," If you determine that your child is spoiled, sit them down for a talk. Let them know that they are not being as good as they could be, and that some things will be changing in your house. Have the conversation after they have just done something bad so that it doesn’t seem random.Say something like “I know you’re angry, but this kind of behavior is unacceptable in this house. From now on, if you act like that, you will be punished every time.”
Don’t yell or curse at them. Avoid physical punishment, as well.

, Clarify the new punishments in the household to your child. You can take away certain privileges from them or put them in timeout when they act out. Do not cut them any slack on these punishments, or else they will not respect them and will continue to act spoiled.Consider taking away things like cell phones or TV privileges from children over age seven.
Use timeout for children younger than eight. Put them in timeout one minute for every year of age (e.g., three minutes for a three year old).

, When your child whines for something, do not give it to them to shut them up. Let them know that you will respond to them once they ask without crying or acting like a baby.Say something like “Josiah, as long as you are whining, I cannot understand what you’re asking for. I need you to ask me like a big boy or you are going to timeout.”

, Correct this behavior immediately and let them know that this is not okay. If you allow too much time to lapse between bad behavior and correction, they will be unclear on the severity of their actions.

Pull them aside and say “Amy, that was rude. You are not to speak to your grandmother in that way. I want you to apologize to her now.”
If they refuse to apologize, you can do so for them by saying “Mom, I’m sorry that Amy spoke to you in that way. It was rude.”

, Your child is likely accustomed to getting whatever they want, whenever they want. Begin establishing a bit more balance between wants and needs in your home. Before approaching situations where they would typically get a treat, communicate any change of plans.

Say “I know you usually get a toy when we go shopping, but today we are just getting groceries. I need you to not ask for anything in there, okay?”

, In the past, you likely offered your child a treat just to avoid a tantrum or crying spell. Abandon this practice and instead reward your child when they are good. If you come in from the store and your child helps you put away the groceries, give them your thanks. If you come home, and their room is clean without you having to tell them, make them their favorite dessert that day., Though you are probably accustomed to your child controlling all your time, begin to break that cycle. Connect with friends, go on dates with your partner, and take time to yourself each day to relax or enjoy life. Spend time with your child, but remember to maintain a relationship with yourself, as well.Even if they cry when you leave, know that they will be okay. They will probably be calm within a few minutes.

Assess the misbehavior.,
Make sure that you explain the consequences first.,
Communicate the lesson the child should learn from their mistake.",How to Train Your Children to Obey Without Using Timeouts2," Natural consequences mean refraining from intervening and letting the child face the negative consequences that stem from their misbehavior. This method works for allowing children to learn from their own mistakes, and make wiser choices through trial-and-error experience. However, this method should not be used when the natural consequences of misbehavior are very serious or dangerous.To give some examples, this approach would be inappropriate if a child was:


reaching for something hot or scalding
refusing to wear a seatbelt
crossing the road without looking
playing near electrical wires

, In order for natural consequences to be effective, it is important to explain what the consequence of a misbehavior will be first. If your child does not respond to your warning about the consequence, then allow the consequence to occur.For example, you might say, “If you go outside without your hat, then you will be cold.” Then, allow your child to go outside without a hat (as long as it is not dangerously cold).
Or, you might say, “If you leave that toy in the yard, then it will be ruined by the rain.” Then, allow the toy to remain outside and get ruined.
Or, “If you keep cheating at this game, then your sister won’t want to play anymore.” Then allow your child to keep cheating and cause your other child to stop playing.
Or, “If you spend all of your allowance today, then you will not have any money later in the week.” Then, allow your child to unwisely spend his allowance.

, Even without assistance, many children will remember the natural consequence of a misbehavior and refrain from repeating it in the future. But it helps to verbalize what you want a child to take-away from the situation. By articulating the natural consequence using, many children will remember it better. For example, try saying:


“I see you were cold without a hat. I hope you decide to wear one next time.”
“Your toy needs to be thrown away. Hopefully in the future you’ll listen when I tell you to bring it indoors.”
“Your sister doesn’t want to play this game with you anymore. Maybe you will follow the rules next time.”
“You don’t have enough allowance to visit the store. Try spending it more wisely next week.”

"
Decide on a system.,
Reward positive behavior with stickers or checks.,
Track the accumulation of rewards in a prominent place.,
Follow through with treats and rewards.",How to Train Your Children to Obey Without Using Timeouts3," Positive rewards work best when there is a clear and consistent system in place. With very young children, many parents use stickers as a reward for good behavior. For older children, some parents use tokens or check-marks. Whatever system you select, remember to use it consistently. Carefully explain the system to your child, and allow them to ask questions about it, or even offer suggestions.The more your child understands and becomes invested in the reward system, the better it will work.
Make sure that the chart identifies specific behaviors that you want your child to perform.For example, if you want your child to be more patient, then include a row for patience on the chart.
List the rewards on the chart as well. For example, earning five stickers might come with the reward of getting to rent a new movie, while 10 stickers might come with the reward of a new doll or other toy. Ask your child what would motivate him or her and try t keep the rewards somewhat small so that they are achievable., Each time that your child behaves well, make sure that you acknowledge the behavior and award your child with a sticker or check mark. Make sure that you place stickers or checks on the chart as soon as possible to help keep your child motivated and interested in the system.Don’t take away stickers or checks for bad behavior. Remember that the goal of the sticker chart is to use positive motivation to change your child’s behavior, not to punish your child., Consider erecting a poster for stickers or check-marks in the living room or kitchen. If using tokens, try placing them in a large jar on the mantle or countertop. This way a child can watch the number of stickers, check-marks, or tokens increase. Make sure to foster a sense of excitement about these increases. Over time, many children will become proud of their achievements.


You may also want to remind your child about the reward system when you are away from the house. A little reminder may be enough to get your child to engage in the desired behavior.For example, you might ask something like, “I noticed that you are only one sticker away from that new doll! Good job! Maybe you will earn it today if you practice patience while we are at grandma’s house.”

, Children will be resentful and may misbehave if they don’t get what they were promised. Make sure that you follow through with the reward when your child earns the required number of stickers or checks. Remember that treats and rewards don’t have to be lavish or expensive. For example, they could be as simple as:


Watching a favorite movie or TV show
Visiting a playground
Inviting a friend to sleep over
Having a favorite meal for dinner

Stay calm.,
Identify the main thing that you want your child to learn.,
Ask how your child is feeling.,
Try to redirect your child.,
Teach your child how to empathize with others.",How to Train Your Children to Obey Without Using Timeouts4," Before you do anything, it is important to take a moment to calm down. Disciplining your child when you are noticeably angry can frighten a child so much that the child may not understand why he or she is being punished. Take a couple of deep breaths to relax before you talk to your child., Effective discipline should teach your child something that will cause your child to say or do something different in the future. For example, you might want to teach your child that it is not okay throw food. Take a moment to identify the lesson that you would like your child to learn., If your child is angry, sad, or experiencing some other negative emotion, then connecting with your child may help you to get through to him or her. Try kneeling down so that you can make eye contact with your child or try putting your arm around your child. Then, ask your child what he or she is feeling.


For example, you could say something like, “I can tell that something is wrong. Do you want to tell me how you are feeling?”

, Redirecting can help to make your child feel better and show them what is appropriate for the situation. For example, if your child is upset because he or she wants to stay up later than usual on a school night, then you might say something like, “We can stay up late this weekend and watch a movie together, but right now you need to get some rest.”, Empathy is a valuable trait for adults and children to have. By teaching your child empathy, you may find it easier to get him or her to behave.For example, if your child takes a toy away from another child, then you might ask your child something like, “How would you feel if Billy had taken your favorite toy?” By reframing your child’s behavior in this way, you can help your child to identify and think about how their actions can hurt others.

Practice patience.,
Listen.,
Question.,
Value the output.,
Understand the culture.,
Know the laws religious and local for the place his family left.,
Procreate.,
Observe Radicalism.,
Be real.,
Learn linguistics.",How to Understanding Behaviors of Arab American Men," While you may not always see eye to eye with your Arabic American man, you can take a step back and allow them to say their piece.;
, As in any relationship, listen with your whole heart. Sometimes what is said is not what is meant. Repeat what was said to you back and ask if you understood them. Sometimes this small gesture says to them, ""I care what it is you meant to say.""

, Sometimes the more traditional men have a problem with this one. A traditional man prefers having the last word and does not care to observe the more contemporary American lifestyle. This is a choice and so is being with your Arab American man. Choose wisely. If you enjoy being in a specific role, wife/daughter/background silent supporter, or just a good neighbor, then this lifestyle choice is for you. However, not all men fit this mold. Some recognize that their family fought to gain a new life and hold in America and perhaps, as a first or second generation American, they are fully indoctrinated into the culture. Never assume, ask questions.

, Some people are so very reserved. Some cultures value that trait, holding back the smoldering fire within. Encourage talk, encourage expression, don't allow a volcano in your life, unless you like that kind of thing. Appreciate when your Arabic American man does tell you his private thoughts as this may not be his first nature. Be vocal when you have praise. Arabic American men, like all men, are not mind-readers and have the same uncertainties we all do.

, No matter what the origins of the ancestors, if you become involved with a man from any country, appreciate the local and regional values, customs, and culture soon after he or you express an interest in each other. He can always tell you some of the customs but this will always be tainted with personal family traditions as well. But if you want to get to the man, get to the root of his family's belief structure and the influences that impacted his parents/grandparents, etc. Some of them may still be in his life and the more you can relate and understand and process for yourself, the better.

, To understand an Arabic man is to understand his belief and value system but also to understand the laws and social mores that had an impact on the formation of his parents and his beliefs. If your Arabic American man was born in your country, and his parents and others are no longer alive then it is possible there is less of an influence where this is concerned. However, the more traditional aspects and the values that are indoctrinated into your AA man, the more heavily the influence is in him carrying on the same traditions and values.

, Family growth is important in the lives of Arabic men and many Arab Americans are no different. Having a legacy is an important facet in all religions. Some are happy with only one or two and, depending on the culture, the narrowing of the field allows more parental focus. However, many seek to have as many as possible because it is important to have as many people behind you as possible.

, A very small minority become radicals. People, throughout history, have felt that a bigger or more shadowy threat has loomed over them, real or imagined, and that the threat, if it were not kept at bay, would overwhelm and possibly wipe them out. So, in response, sometimes people take an extreme viewpoint of attack or be attacked. It's best to attempt to remove the threat by being as clear with your potential mate or friend what your values are and aren't. If radicalism is not something you aspire to for you or your family, state it. You may not be able to prevent it, but at least you stuck to your personal beliefs.

, An Arab American man is not an alien. He is an American who has embraced, either by birth or by choice, the American way. He is subject to the American draft and will go to war on behalf of the American dream. Do not call him anything other than what he will embrace.

, Embracing an occasional word in Arabic will help you out. For example, say (pronounced sah-hah) ""Saja"" الصحة when people sneeze. It means, more or less, health to you. Little gestures like this will help cement an appreciation.

Consider normal child development.,
Learn what causes your child to hit.,
Remember that being angry is okay.",How to Teach Your Child Not to Hit Others1," Babies naturally explore the world through biting and hitting things around them. Hands and teeth are a child's first social tools. A child learns to use them to explore the things around them as well as the reactions she gets from others when she uses them.Biting and hitting is most common between the ages of 18 months and 2 1/2 years, while language is still developing.
Biting usually stops as language develops, but hitting often continues for several years into early childhood.;
, If your child is hitting in particular environments, such as at a particular child's house or at preschool, take a look at these places to see what might be causing her behavior. Consider the behavior as a nonverbal communication, and think about what she might be trying to communicate.Most children have shorter tempers when tired. Consider whether the hitting is happening at a particular time of day or in a limited number of situations.
Consider the possibility that your child is responding to unkind behavior. Teasing and bullying often occur very subtly, in ways that your child may not be able to communicate. If this is the situation, you'll need to address those behaviors even as you teach your child alternatives to hitting.

, Teaching your child to identify her feelings is important. Anger, frustration, and jealousy are feelings, and feelings are natural and normal. Never make your child feel ashamed of having a feeling, even though you are trying to teach her alternative behaviors.Notice how you respond to your own feelings of anger. Use these moments to help teach your child alternatives to hitting. For example, if you get angry at someone, use your hand like a puppet. ""Okay, hand, you feel angry, but no hitting, okay?"" It might feel silly, but your child will get the message.
Using words to identify your feelings will help your child better connect words to his own feelings. Saying out loud when you're feeling upset, angry or frustrated can help your child learn that these feelings are normal and okay. Follow up by stating what you're going to do to help yourself feel better. For example, you might say, ""I feel angry, but I'll feel better if I take 5 big breaths.""

Explain natural consequences.,
Encourage action and consequence role play.,
Let natural consequences take their course.,
Use logical consequences when natural ones don't make sense.,
Avoid forced apologies.,
Assist with problems rather than fixing them.,
Show responsible choices.,
Make appropriate responses to blame avoidance.,
Try a chart.,
Own up to your own actions.,
Stay calm when your child owns up to something.,
Enforce the rules.",How to Teach Kids to Accept Responsibility for Their Actions," As you go through your day with your child, make sure to talk about the ways that actions lead to certain results. This advice is not about punishment. Rather, it's about discussing the ways that what a person does affects the eventual result.For example, if your child brings home a good grade, you could say, ""See, you got a good grade on this because you worked so hard.""
Your discussions don't have to center only on your child. You can discuss situations with yourself, too. For example, you could say, ""I was late to work today, so my boss was mad.""
You may have to explain how some consequences occur quickly and others occur further down the line. This will help to get them thinking about the future.;
, Another way to help your child think about how actions have natural consequences is to set up verbal scenarios for them. You propose an action or situation and ask your child what they think would happen next.When something happens and your child has to make a decision, this is a good time to have them talk through the possible options and results.


For instance, you could say, ""Say you forgot to tell me you had a club meeting after school. What would happen?"" Don't judge what they say. The point is to help them think through how an action has an effect.

, Natural consequences help children realize how their actions can affect themselves and people around them. Sometimes, you may be tempted to let children off the hook, but instead, let them experience consequences (within limits, of course).For instance, if your child leaves their homework at home, don't take it to them. They will have to live with the consequence--a bad grade--which will help them try to be more responsible in the future.

, Sometimes, a natural consequence will be too delayed to have an effect on behavior (such as cavities developing when teeth aren't brushed). Other times, safety is a concern (such as when a child wants to run into the street). In these cases, and others, natural consequences aren't a good solution. Logical consequences are ones you impose, but they fit the situation rather than seem arbitrary.For instance, if your child breaks something, have them pay for it out of their allowance or do extra chores to pay it off. That is a more logical consequence than being grounded.
When you impose a logical consequence on your child, make sure to talk to them about why you're doing it. Otherwise, they might just get upset and not understand.

, When your child does something to another person, such as making a sibling cry, your instinct may be to tell the child to apologize. However, forcing a child to apologize doesn't help them learn how to accept responsibility in the future. It just ""fixes"" the current situation. It's better to help your child come to the conclusion that they will need to repair the relationship.Using the example, forcing the child to say ""I'm sorry"" won't mean much to either the child or their sibling. However, if you talk with the child about why they made their sibling cry, helping them deal with the emotions, it will help them calm down. Be sure to use the situation as an opportunity to teach more appropriate coping skills and to encourage empathy by asking you child to remember how they felt when someone made them cry.
Pretty soon, they will realize that their sibling is mad at them, and they need to do something to repair what they've done to their relationship with their sibling. That shows them their actions have consequences that they need to do something about. You can prompt them by saying something like, ""What do you think you can do to help your sibling feel better?""
They might apologize, or they might do something else to make up for it. Either way, letting the child initiate it will help it feel better, and they'll be more likely to do something similar in the future on their own.

, If your child finds themselves in a hard situation (that they got themselves into), you may be tempted to swoop in and fix it for them. However, a better approach is letting the child try to fix it themselves, with help from you as needed.For example, say you child comes home with a bad grade. You may be tempted to lay out a plan for how your child can improve. Instead, ask the child, ""Well, you've obviously had some trouble here. What can you do to improve?""
If your child needs it, you could help them write out a plan that they can stick to. Teach them to revisit the plan regularly to see how it’s working, assess it, and make changes as needed.

, When you make a responsible choice, talk about it out loud as you do it. Otherwise, your child may not realize the responsible choices you make every day. Children need positive examples of behavior to help them learn responsibility.For example, you could say, ""I won't go over the speed limit because that's unsafe and I could cause an accident."" Alternatively, you could try, ""Let's return to the store and pay for this apple because the cashier overlooked it. We don't take things that aren't ours.""

, If your child does something against the rules, they may try to blame it on someone else, such as ""Sister made me do it!"" A typical response to this excuse is, ""If Sister jumped off a bridge, would you jump off a bridge?"" The problem with this response is that it isn't clear enough about what the problem is. Your child needs a clear explanation.Instead, say something like, ""Your sister may have influenced you, but you decided to do it yourself. You could have chosen not to follow your sister, but you didn't. Therefore, you're responsible for what you did.""
Be sure to point out times along the way that they could have made a different choice to encourage them to learn how to get out of these situations earlier.

, With some children, tracking behavior can help them adjust their thinking. One way to do this with responsibility is to start the week with a specific number of points or stickers, such as five. Every time your child tries to avoid blame, they lose a point. The goal is to still have at least one point at the end of the week (when they'll receive a small reward).You could write, ""Avoiding the Blame Game"" on the top so that your child knows what it's for. You could also title it, ""Taking Responsibility for My Actions.""
You could write out a small pledge for your child to sign so they understand. Try, ""I will not blame other people for my choices. I will own up to the things I do.""
Put the chart up where your child can see it every day, such as on the door to their bedroom. However, keep in mind that this works well for some children and not others. It is important to be flexible and try out different techniques.

, Children learn by seeing behaviors modeled (and explained). Therefore, you must model owning up to your actions to your child, as they'll be watching you to see how they should behave.For example, say you were late picking up your child from school. Instead of saying, ""I was late because there was so much traffic,"" you could say, ""I'm sorry I'm late. I should have left earlier.""
Similarly, don't make children take responsibility for the consequences you impose on them. Instead of saying, ""Because you didn't come home on time, I guess that means you want to stay home this weekend,"" say, ""Because you didn't come home on time, you're grounded. I expect you to keep up with your curfew.""

, If your child is honest with you about something you did and you blow up, they're not likely to be honest the next time. It's important to stay calm, even if you're upset about what they did. If you feel yourself getting upset, try counting to 10, or taking a few, deep calming breaths before responding.If you need to, take a short break before discussing the issue with your child. Wait until you can have a calm conversation.
Also, make sure to give your kid kudos for being honest with you.

, Your kid relies on you to set boundaries with them, which includes enforcing the rules. You can't expect your child to accept responsibility for your actions if you continually make exceptions for them. Holding them to the rules helps them realize that they must own up to things they've done.Although it is not always possible, it is ideal if the rules exist before a situation occurs and that your child has a good understanding of the rules. Do your best to avoid looking like you are making up the rules as you go.

Model non-aggressive behavior.,
Role-play alternative responses.,
Develop a plan for what to do.,
Use observation words.,
Set your child up for success.,
Prepare your child for a situation ahead of time.,
Don't give in to demands.",How to Teach Your Child Not to Hit Others2," Using non-aggressive behaviors to work through difficult situations is an important educational tool for children. If you see your child hitting toys, dolls or stuffed animals, you can redirect the child to act gently. Model non-aggressive behavior by teaching the child to ""pat the baby"" or ""hug the puppy.""If your child sees other people hitting each other, whether older children or adults, she is more likely to think of hitting as acceptable. If you want to teach her that hitting is not acceptable, you must make sure that no one in your family is hitting each other at any time, for any reason.
Grabbing is an aggressive behavior with younger children, and often leads to hitting. If a child grabs an item from another, redirect by modeling other ways of communication.

, When your child isn't upset, role-play possible responses to feeling angry. Blowing bubbles will help your child practice taking deep breaths. A red stop sign might help your child remember to stop and and think of alternatives before hitting. Provide a safe space where your child can go to calm down.There are educational children's books showing alternatives to aggressive behaviors that you and your child can read together. For example, Hands Are Not for Hitting by Martine Agassi is a book on this topic using simple words and pictures.
Practice having the child ask for a break or a physical activity that removes him from the area when he wants to hit another child. For example, if he needs more physical activity, he might take a break and run around a fenced-in area (such as the backyard or school playground) to release his excess energy, rather than hit another child.

, Involve your child in making a plan for what to do instead of hit another child. There should be a phrase that you and your child agree upon that marks the beginning of the plan, such as ""Remember, no hitting"" or ""That's enough. Let's go."" This phrase is not meant to embarrass your child, but to remind him of the plan.Don't use a lot of words when your child is upset.
Make sure you remain calm as you initiate the plan. This isn't a time for punishment, but for education.
Stick to the plan. This will reinforce your child's trust and help him feel more safe.

, Don't try to reason with your child when he's upset. Instead, stick to simple observations. ""You seem upset"" or ""You seem angry."" This will help him learn to connect these words with the feelings he's having. If he denies feeling this way, don't argue. Just wait for him to calm down, making sure he's safe.Remember that you are your child's external emotional regulatory system while he's still developing his own internal emotional regulation. Stay calm in your voice and your body.
Don't try to make him feel guilty for his feelings. Praise him for being able to refrain from hitting.

, If your child is more likely to hit when she's in crowded noisy places, try to avoid these places if at all possible. If she has a hard time attending birthday parties, consider attending for only a short time, with careful supervision.Give your child coping tools for being in difficult situations. Having a calming toy to fidget with, breathing exercises for calming down, and identifying safe spaces are all ways to help a child feel calmer.
Practice these coping tools ahead of time and make sure they're accessible to the child. After all, a fidget toy in a backpack won't help much. Find toys that will fit into the child's pocket, or jewelry that's designed especially for chewing.

, Talk through what the child can expect - who will be there, what activities they'll be likely to do. Then talk about what to do if the child feels like becoming aggressive. Make a clear plan, and then stick to it.Consider providing a positive consequence for not hitting in a high-stress situation. For instance, if birthday parties are difficult, consider providing a favorite small toy if the child successfully attends the party without hitting.
Teach good touch. Giving ""high-5""s is a good way to touch other children or adults. Practice these ahead of time.

, If your child learns that he can get his way by hitting others, he'll be more likely to continue to do this. To teach your child not to hit, the best response you can offer will be firm refusal to meet his demands after hitting. If he has hit another child because he wants a toy, for instance, do not give him the toy.Use empathetic words to share in his sadness over not having the toy. Feeling sad is okay, and understandable.
Don't use cruel or angry words if your child continues his demands. Don't cave in, but don't respond in anger either. Remember that his anger will pass.
Maintaining your boundaries provides safety and comfort for your child in the long run. If you give your child what he wants, regardless of his behavior, you're not providing him with the parental security that helps him feel safe.

Younger children will need simple, straightforward rules, while older children can begin to understand more complex rules, that may be flexible depending on the situation. The list should prioritize those rules that are based on the naughty behaviors your children is demonstrating.For example, if your child behaves aggressively when they don’t get what they want by hitting you or someone else, then you should draft a rule that makes this behavior strictly forbidden.
The list of rules should include each of the things you expect your child to do each day, which will also depend on their age. This might include brushing their teeth, washing their face, and combing their hair when they get up in the morning, making their bed, putting away their toys, etc.
Sit down and discuss this list of rules with your child so that they know what is expected of them.;
, Not only do you need to have a clear set of rules that your child can understand and follow, you should also make clear what will happen when one of the rules is broken. If a higher priority rule is broken (e.g. if your child hits you), then the consequence should be more severe than if the child breaks a less high priority rule (e.g. doesn’t make up the bed in the morning).


You should never use physical violence as a means of punishing your child. Not only does hitting or spanking your child damage your relationship with your child, it shows them that they can get smaller, weaker people to give them what they want by hitting them.Make sure to discuss each rule together with the consequence that will occur if they break the rule. This way, they understand what to expect.

, Children who are bored will find ways to entertain themselves. While it is not necessarily a bad thing for children to use their own imaginations when it comes to entertaining themselves, it can also cause them to act out and behave in ways they know they shouldn’t.For example, if your child will be home all day long, try to schedule different activities. Let them color with a coloring book and crayons for an hour while you do what you need to do. Spend some time playing together with them, ask them to help you make lunch, or do some finger painting outside together. It’s good to give them some time to play by themselves, but it is also important to spend time playing together and nurturing your relationship.

, In addition to giving your child plenty of tasks, you should have a routine that you stick to each day, especially if your child is not yet of school age. This will help them understand what to expect and when to expect it, reducing the likelihood of boredom or frustration.


For example, have them take their nap at the same time each day. Make sure to be consistent, too. Have them take their bath each day at the same time. For example, before bed, which will also signal to them that it’s time to wind down.

, Obviously, as the child grows, you will have to re-think the rules and the consequences attached to them. Therefore, it is important to remember that younger children won’t be able to process complex rules with contingencies, while older children can be given a bit more control and independence.Children between 0 and 2 will not be able to understand a set of rules. Instead, if there are certain things in the home you want them to avoid, it is best to keep those things up and out of reach of the children. If they get into something you want them to stay away from, gently but firmly tell them, “No,” and distract them with another activity. You can use timeouts of a few minutes to help them associate certain actions (such as biting or hitting) with a negative consequence. Timeouts of longer than a few minutes will not be effective for children at this young age.
Children between the ages of 3 and 5 will be able to understand connections between what they are doing and the consequence that follows. If the child misbehaves, be sure to explain to them why they should not do what they did before you give them the consequence. Explain what they did wrong, and explain what will happen if they do it again. The next time it happens, remind them of what you told them, and apply the consequence.
From ages 6 until 8, timeouts are a good way of enacting discipline. Make a designated timeout spot that will be free from any distractions (such as TV, computer, etc.) so that the child will need to think about what they did. Again, remember not to take it to the extreme. A timeout of 6 to 8 minutes should be sufficient. If the child is throwing a tantrum, tell them they will remain in the timeout until they are able to calm themselves.
Beginning at the age of 9 up until 12, you can begin to use natural punishments, in addition to enacted discipline, such as grounding them for a week if they break a rule. For example, if your child failed to do his homework for bed, you should let him learn what happens when he returns to school without doing his homework before intervening. Beginning at this age, children should begin to learn for themselves what happens when they don’t do what is asked of them.
If your child is a teenager, you will need to re-establish the rules so that they can exercise their own control and independence, within reason. If a rule is broken, there should still be consequences, but as before, it is important to explain to them why they should stick to the rules. For example, if they come home past curfew without calling, explain why that is very worrisome for you.

, If your child is throwing a big tantrum (e.g. yelling, screaming, crying, banging fists, etc.) the best thing you can do is remove the audience that they are performing for. This may only be you, but it may also be your other children, friends of your child, grandparents, etc. If you are at home, and your child is not in danger of hurting themselves, then suggest that everyone go do something else in a different room for awhile.If you are not at home, then remove your child from the public place as quickly as possible. For example, if you are at the grocery store, take the child to the car.

, If your child is under four years old, you can let them have their tantrum alone, in a safe place. Check on them every few minutes, and tell them that you are aware that they are upset, and that you can talk with them about why they are upset when they are finished with the tantrum.If the child younger than four reacts violently to you, either by hitting, kicking, scratching, or biting you, you should immediately put them in a time out. Tell them very clearly, that such behavior will absolutely not be tolerated.
Once the child has calmed down, and you are able to talk with them, listen to what they have to say, and tell them that throwing a tantrum is not the best way to deal with their problem. However, don’t fixate on this point. Explain a better way to deal with it, and move on.

, If the child is over four, and they are throwing a tantrum, gently remind them of the rules. Explain to them that they have two options: they can either choose to stop the behavior, and do something that is within the rules, and that they would like to do, or they can continue with their behavior, and not have enough time to do something they would enjoy.Once they have calmed down, discuss better ways that they can express their feelings in the future. Ask them to make suggestions about how they think they could have reacted better.

, Sometimes tantrums can be so severe that no amount of reasoning seems to do any good. In this case, you can try to distract them with a favorite book, or pacifier, if they use one.However, when the tantrum is over, it is still important to discuss better ways of dealing with problems in the future.

, Especially when a child throws a tantrum in a public place, such as the grocery store, it may seem that the best thing to do is to simply give them what they want so they will stop embarrassing you. However, this is a bad idea, and will only reinforce that throwing a tantrum will get them what they want. It may seem like a good idea at the time, but you will be sorry you did it the next time they throw a tantrum in the exact same situation., When a child is having a tantrum, and you are getting frustrated with them, it can be very tempting to yell at them to knock it off. However, at this point, yelling is unlikely to help the situation, and will likely only increase the stress levels of the child, and of yourself.Instead, keep the tone of your voice calm and even. If you feel like you are going to yell if you open your mouth, then don’t say anything at all. If you are losing your temper, it may be best to walk away from the situation for a few minutes, provided your child is not in danger of harming themselves.

, When the child has calmed down, you should remove the item that caused the tantrum, and replace it with something quiet and relaxing for the child to focus on.For example, if your child was upset because they wanted a candy bar, move the child away from the candy section, and let them look through a magazine while you finish the shopping.

, Tell the child that while you didn’t love their behavior, you do love them, and that you always will. It is important for a child to understand that your love for them is not reliant upon their good behavior.For example, you should say, “That tantrum back there was pretty bad, I hope you understand that I don't enjoy it when you yell and scream like that, but I do love you very much, even when you throw tantrums.” Don’t say, “You were a very bad kid back there. Sometimes, it’s hard to love you when you act like that.”

, If your child is behaving badly or has done something you don’t want them to do, don’t simply say, “Stop that!” Instead, tell them what you would like them to do, and what the reward will be for engaging in this different behavior.For example, if they have yelled at their younger sibling, say, “Remember that we have a rule about yelling. If you’re feeling upset by your sister, I would like to see you walk away from her instead of yelling. When I see you do this, I will take you to see that movie you’ve been asking to see.”
You can also give the child a chance to tell you what is going on in their minds. For example, you could say, “What is your sister doing that is making you feel like you want to yell at her?” This will give them a chance to feel understood instead of just redirecting their behavior without acknowledging that they are upset.

, If your child is doing something that is against the rules, remind them of that rule, and the consequence for breaking it. Explain to them that if they continue with the rule-breaking behavior, that you will be forced to enact the consequence.At this point, you can give them a choice. Explain to them that they can either stop the behavior, not receive the consequence of that behavior, and do something else, or they can continue with the behavior and deal with consequence of that behavior.

, Sometimes enforcing the consequences of rule-breaking can be a hassle. However, if the child has broken a rule it is important that you follow through with what you said, and that you do so in a timely manner. If you don’t, the child may learn that you don’t stick to the rules yourself, so why should they?If for some reason, you can’t immediately enact the consequence, explain to the child that you will still follow through, but that it will have to be at a later time. Explain the reason for the delay so that they understand that they aren’t getting away with their bad behavior.

, This can be very frustrating, especially because it may mean dealing with the same behavior several times before it stops, but it is important that your child understand that there will be consequences every time a rule is broken. Make sure to follow through by explaining what the rule is, how the child broke it, and what the consequence now is.


For example, if the child hits another child, immediately place them in time out where they will not be able to play for 5 minutes. If the behavior is repeated, repeat the consequence. Do this as often as necessary so that your child understands that bad behavior always has a consequence., You can sit down with them, and write down several different things they’d like to do, meals they’d like to eat, and places they’d like to visit. Have them tell you which things they really, really would like, and rank them from highest priority to lowest priority.When your child does something really great, you can reward them with their top reward. For example, if their teacher reports that they have behaved very well all month at school, you could take them to the zoo, if that was the thing they most wanted. You can use the other rewards to reward them for other good behavior, such as making up the bed each day for a week without being asked.

, If you notice your child behaving particularly well, tell them so. Thank them for behaving so nicely, and give them a hug. Reward them with something from the list, too.


If you never reward them for their good behavior unless they remind you of your agreements, it may demonstrate to them that you aren’t really paying any attention.

, Most children really enjoy doing things with parents and caregivers. If your child is behaving well, show them that you appreciate it by doing things together with them. Allow them to take more responsibility with tasks. This will show them that you notice their good behavior, and are rewarding it.


For example, if your child is behaving very well, ask them to come plant some flowers in the garden with you. Then, let them take charge (within reason). Let them choose where to plant the flowers, let them place the seeds into the hole, and cover it up.

, It is important that you discuss how the child should be disciplined if the rules are broken with the parents of the child. Ask them how they discipline the child, and what their expectations are when it comes to you taking care of the child and applying discipline if the rules are not followed.It is important to discuss this with the parents so that there are not any misunderstandings. If you don’t discuss this, you may use different discipline techniques than the parents. Not only will this cause confusion and stress for the child, but it may also cause tension in your relationship with the parents.

, In all likelihood, the rules you use with the child will be the same as the ones the parents use. However, you might ask the parents to include one or two new rules to the list that relate specifically to how the child is expected to behave when you are the caretaker.For example, you might include a rule that explicitly states that when you are taking care of the child, you are in charge, and the child is expected to do as you say.
It is probably also a good idea to sit down with the child (if they are old enough to understand), with the parents, in order to go over all of the rules (including any new rules). This will help the child understand that the rules apply in your presence, and will let them know that you are well aware of the rules, too.

, This is perhaps the most important thing to remember. Sometimes it will be easier to just let the child do what they want. However, it is important that you also follow all the rules, and apply consequences for the rule if it is broken.This is important because if the child knows you don’t follow the rules rigidly, then they are more likely to misbehave in your presence. Additionally, it is also likely that they will begin to question the authority of their parents.

, If you find that there are certain rules that aren’t working, or if you have suggestions for new rules that you think could help a naughty child learn to behave, then talk with the parents about it. When doing so, be respectful. Don’t tell them, “You’re doing this, and it’s dumb. It’s not working, you should do this.” Instead, if you find a rule isn’t working and want to suggest a new idea, say, “I’ve been working with about not breaking this rule, but he seems to be having trouble with it. What would you think about trying out this approach…?”You don’t want to make the parent feel as though you are insulting their parenting. Rather, you want to show that you are interested in helping improve, if their is a way to do so, but without treading on their authority.

, When you are finished with your caregiving duties, you should briefly chat with the parent about how the child behaved, and if any disciplinary action was needed.


This will help the parents understand what is working and what isn’t, and will also allow you a chance to suggest any ideas you may have.

, Just as you should never hit your own children as a means of discipline, you should certainly never use physical violence to discipline children you are taking care of.If the parents suggest using violence as a means of discipline, politely explain to them the problem with this type of discipline. Respectfully explain that you will not engage in this type of discipline, and suggest an alternative. If they insist, you should probably consider backing out of the agreement.
If you are worried for the safety of the child, contact the authorities. Unfortunately, it is legal to hit children in all US states, but the law varies from state to state about what is legal and what isn't.If you are concerned, it is better to contact the authorities than to stand aside and let a child endure abuse.

This will work particularly well if your child is younger and does not require a computer to do their homework, but can also be used for older children if their addiction is particularly bad.;
, You might be concerned that your child will use the computer while you are out of the house. However, you can set parental controls on the computer limiting what websites they can access. You can edit these control settings on your router, Windows, or via a third party website like Norton., Teach your child to prioritize by requiring them to complete chores and homework before using the computer for leisure. Make a checklist of all chores/tasks to be completed each day and post them on your refrigerator. Treat computer time as a privilege, not a right.Tell your child that everything on the list must be done before they use the computer for leisure.

This will help you to get acquainted with how the site works, the kind of content available and the possible interactions among users.
By doing this, you can give better guidance to your child on the do’s and don’t’s when using these sites.;
, There are lots of online articles discussing different issues involving the internet and communications technology, especially as it relates to children and teenagers.


Familiarize yourself with the relevant laws in your area regarding with the rights and protection of minor mobile and internet users.
There are also resources you can view or download such as pamphlets, videos, infographics, and interactive games which you can use to teach proper online behavior at home.

, For example, Google has a family safety channel on Youtube with videos discussing online child safety and other similar issues. The Facebook Family Safety Center page is also loaded with tools that deal with social media etiquette.


NetSmartz has cool interactive and engaging videos for parents, teachers and children of every age, that cover a wide range of topics on online behavior.
Instead of plain old boring lectures, take advantage of these free resources to make learning fun for both you and your kids.

, You may also sign yourself up for online parenting groups and forums that teach proper digital behavior and lots of other modern-day parenting challenges.


Remember that you are not alone in your quest to raise responsible kids both in the real and virtual world. You can always take a cue from strategies used by other parents as to what works and what doesn’t.
Engaging in parenting groups and forums will also give you an idea of what issues you might be faced with, especially if you are just starting to introduce your kids to mobile phones, tablets and computers.

, Ask your internet service provider if they can set up parental controls and content filter on your home router. Also, before giving out electronic gadgets to your kids, ask the tech guy from the store to set up child control features on these devices. This will keep your child protected even when he is connected to wifi or mobile data networks outside your home.


Basically, these controls and filters allow you to block websites or programs that contain inappropriate themes such as mature content, pornography, hate speech, crime, violence, alcohol, tobacco, drugs, and the like.
The features and set-up process are different depending on the brand of your router, device or operating system, so it is best to discuss this option with your seller or provider.

, Impress upon your child the importance of never sharing their passwords with anyone, not even with their most trusted friends.


Look up cases of account hacking on the internet and show your child how things can get really out of hand when another person gets access to their accounts. Identity theft is no laughing matter.
Likewise, teach your kids never to give out information such as the name of their school, home address, and phone number.
Tell them how this seemingly innocent sharing of personal information online can lead to actual stalking, kidnapping and harassment in real life.

, Most netiquette (internet etiquette) resources on the internet summarize the essence of online behavior in this catchy mnemonic: T.H.I.N.K. before you post.


When posting status updates, photos, videos or other content and even when typing in comments or replies, ask these simple questions: Is it True, Helpful, Inspiring, Necessary, and Kind?
These are good guidelines to teach your kids and the helpful acronym T.H.I.N.K. will make them very easy to remember.

, ""Don’t talk to strangers,” is something everyone tells their kids when they're little. Now as they start exploring the bounds of the virtual world, remind them that this holds true online as much as anywhere else.


Make it very clear that they should never agree to meet up with someone they just met online. Don’t spare them the gory details of the possible things that could happen to them when trusting someone they do not actually know:
Robbery and extortion, rape, and human trafficking just to name a few. In this particular situation, using scare tactics is the way to go.

, Almost every kid from this generation turns to the internet instead of using books for their homework and other school assignments.


With the vast amount of information available, the internet is indeed a powerful educational medium. However, it is important to teach your kids the importance of giving credit to their sources when citing information or works that they got on the internet.
Copying text or other content and making it appear as your own is nothing more than stealing someone else’s ideas, a.k.a. plagiarism.

, If your kids are ever in doubt about whether something is right or not, teach them the “real-life test”.


Teach them to ask themselves questions like ""Is this something I would say to the person face to face?"" and ""If someone said or did this to me, would I be happy or would I feel hurt?
More importantly, remind your kids that they can always come to you and ask you for advice anytime they are unsure about something online.

, Make it a point to spend some time during the week exploring the internet with your child. Not only will this count as quality bonding time, it will also give you an opportunity to assess first-hand how your child fares in the netiquette department and to give him personal guidance on what he could improve on.

, Finally, remember that your actions speak louder than your words. Never contradict what you have taught your children by displaying poor internet etiquette yourself. Use the internet responsibly and they will surely follow your lead.

, Cyberbullying can go two ways: either your child gets bullied or becomes the bully. Neither one is better than the other. The key to preventing this is to build a strong psychological and emotional foundation for your child in the offline world, even long before you allow them to use electronic devices.


Teach your toddlers and preschoolers how to deal with anger, resentment and other strong negative emotions. Tell them that they should never do or say anything in the heat of the moment, as it could hurt someone else and cause them to regret their actions later.
If your child is able to control his negative emotions in real life and express them in a healthy way, chances are that this behavior will extend to his online interactions as well.

, When they start grade school, most kids will have a better grasp of the concept of bullying in general, as they may have already experienced or witnessed it to some extent in their real-world interactions at school.


Parents can simply extend the concept of bullying and explain how it applies to the online world. Give your child scenarios and ask them how they would react to each, reinforcing their answers where necessary.
For high schoolers, the basic principles remain the same but become more complex as they are exposed to concepts such as sexuality and racism, and as they develop different forms and levels of friendship and enmity, including romantic relationships.

, Be clear when explaining the consequences of cyberbullying: including the psychological, emotional and social impact on the victim and his family, as well as the penalty for the perpetrator, which may include expulsion from school and even criminal prosecution and arrest.


Give a stern reminder to your children, whatever age they may be, that when they receive any form of threats or harassment online, they should never respond to them but instead, report the matter immediately to you.
If your child opens up about someone bullying them online, never dismiss it or take it lightly. Cyberbullying can potentially have long-term negative effects on your child and should therefore be taken seriously.

Teach self-monitoring.,
Show them how to count to calm.,
Practice deep breathing.,
Teach redirection.,
Talk about time-outs.,
Coach them in self-confidence.",How to Teach Children Impulse Control1," Unless children are aware of their thoughts, feelings, and actions, it will be difficult for them to practice impulse control. Young children, in particular, may not have a grasp on impulse control because they don’t have experience monitoring their impulses. Even older children may need to be taught to be self-aware. You can teach children impulse control by also teaching them to constantly monitor themselves.Once children are able to identify and acknowledge what is going on inside them, they will have an easier time controlling it.
Try practicing mindfulness activities with them. By learning to focus on how they feel they will be able to recognize when they are being impulsive.
Teach them how to use self-talk. For example, teach them how to say to themselves, “I really want that and it’s making me excited. I need to calm down a little.”;
, Teaching children how to count as a relaxation technique is one easy way you can start to teach them impulse control. Counting can serve a number of purposes when children need to calm down. With younger children it’s a way to reinforce learning their numbers and give them a concrete way to calm down. With children that are older, it can distract them for a moment and help physically relax them. It’s also a strategy that all children can use on their own, in a variety of situations, throughout their life.


This is good strategy to use when children are in situations of conflict. Counting gives them a few moments to calm down and think about what they’re doing.
Counting can also help children when they are faced with temptation. It’s a way for them to catch themselves before they act on impulse.

, Deep breathing is an easy way to relax yourself and calm down.We often tell preschoolers and older children to “Just take a few deep breaths” but we don’t always teach them how to do this. When you are teaching children impulse control, take some time to show them how to use breathing techniques as a way to calm themselves down.


Teach them finger breathing. Inhale while you trace up the thumb of one hand with the index finger of your other hand. Hold at the tip, then trace down your finger as you exhale. Repeat with each finger.
They can use deep breathing techniques to calm themselves down when they are upset. For example, teach them to take some deep breaths to calm down when someone makes them angry.
Or, for instance, show them how to take a few deep breaths when they are at the amusement park so they don’t get overexcited and run off.

, When children are young, we use redirection as a way to channel their energy away from something harmful (or irritating) towards something positive and constructive. As children get older, you can teach them to redirect themselves as a way of teaching them impulse control.For instance, if they’re feeling the impulse to jump, show them how to do other things to release the energy like tap their toes, shrug their shoulders.
They can also use redirection when they need to be patient. For example, have them think about what else they can do while waiting to go skating.

, Depending on their upbringing, children may consider the term ‘time-out’ synonymous with punishment or discipline. You can teach children impulse control by changing this perspective. Explain to both older and younger children that a ‘time-out’ is a way to take a break from something or someone that is causing them to get upset. Teach them that is something they can do on their own to control their impulses.


Tell children to use a personal time-out when someone has made them angry. For example, you could say, “If Henry makes you upset again, then take a time-out. It’ll help you calm down and figure out how to handle it.”
They can also use time-out to restrain themselves when something they shouldn’t do is tempting them. For instance, tell them to try walking out of the room to resist eating the rest of the cookies.

, No matter the age, when children have difficulty with impulse control, they may find themselves in trouble frequently. As a result, they may begin to develop a negative self-image. They may begin to see themselves as the kid who can’t control their impulses. By teaching children to boost their self-esteem, you are also teaching them to believe that they can show impulse control.Talk to them about spending time with people that care about them and make them feel good about themselves.
Encourage them to keep a list of their accomplishments, no matter how small. For instance, tell them to write it down when they receive a smiley face in their school agenda or win a soccer match.
Remind them to give themselves a compliment every day. For example, you could tell them, “Every morning tell yourself how great you are.”

Talk with your child about their excessive computer use.,
Establish consequences.,
Follow through.,
Be a good role model.",How to Stop Your Child's Computer Addiction2," Find out if there are any specific reasons that they spend so much time on the computer. Sometimes, the computer can function as an escape from reality, especially if they are being bullied or having difficulties in school. If your child is facing problems that are causing a desire to escape, address those with them through discussions, providing advice, or getting them help when necessary..Listen to them without interrupting. There may be something that they’ve been wanting to share with you, so come to the conversation with a kind and concerned demeanor.

, After having a talk with your child and assessing what’s going on with them, lay down some basic ground rules for computer use. Let them know that there are limits, that they can only use the computer for two hours per day for non-homework related items, and that there will be consequences if they do not follow the rules.For instance, if they are caught using the computer for longer than allowed, take away the computer for one day. Let them rely on their textbooks when completing any homework.

, When they do break one of your computer rules, punish them immediately. Delaying punishment often results in bad behavior being repeated. If they overuse the computer or use it for anything other than school during homework time, take it away from them then and there. If they are caught doing this a second time, take the computer away for two days instead of one.If they feel that their bad behavior will not be punished it, then they will not care about the consequences and may lose respect for you.

, Don’t spend a lot of time using the computer around your child. This might make them feel a bit resentful of you if they see you doing the things that you have banned them from doing. Instead, be present when you are with them and work on spending more time together."
"
Suggest alternative activities.,
Spend time as a family without computers or phones.,
Sign them up for an after school sports team.,
Encourage them to join clubs or organizations.,
Get professional help when necessary.",How to Stop Your Child's Computer Addiction3," Play board games with them, take them to the library or get them together with friends to hang out. Addictions are hard to break, but they are even harder when your child has nothing to do.Allow your child to pick the game or see if they have any ideas about activities they’d like to do.

, Spend time each day as a family completely unplugged. This includes phones, computers, and the television. Have family dinner together regularly so that you can check-in on each other, connect, and laugh.Plan a vacation that will be completely technology-free.

, Find out from your child if they are interested in playing any sports. If they are lonely and are using the computer as a substitute for friends, this will be a great way for them to connect with others. Allow them to choose the sport, but don’t push them if they’d rather not play anything., Find out from them what clubs or organizations are offered at their school. This will provide them with another way of meeting others and developing new hobbies and interests.You might say “So, you mentioned there was an art club on campus and I know you look up artwork online a lot. Have you thought about joining that? I wouldn’t mind picking you up later on the days that they meet.”

, If your child cannot seem to shake the addiction or reacts very aggressively or emotionally to these new rules, then seek professional help for them. There are many therapists who specialize in helping overcome addictions, so research some in your area."
"
Create situations of delayed gratification.,
Play memory games.,
Practice visualization.",How to Teach Children Impulse Control2," You can use natural situations with older children or make a game of teaching younger children to wait and be patient for things that they want.Introducing them to fun and controlled situations where they have to control their impulses gives them practice in doing so.


For example, place a cookie or some candy on the table in front of a toddler or preschooler and see who can go the longest without eating it.
Create a situation where you older children will have to wait to get what they want. For instance, order something for them online and don’t select express shipping.

, Some research indicates that improving a child’s memory can help improve their impulse control.Regardless of age, it’s much easier for children to control their impulses when they remember how they are supposed to behave. Using games is a great way to teach children impulse control by improving their memory.


Play games like concentration. Children not only have to remember where the matches are, but they also have to patiently wait their turn, and handle it if they don’t get the match.
Try games like Simon where children have to remember and recreate a pattern of lights and sounds.
Use online memory games like those at http://www.kidsmemory.com/ or http://www.memozor.com/memory-game-online-free/for-kids.

, It can be useful for younger children like toddlers and preschoolers to use mental imagery to help them improve their impulse control.Visualizing objects and words that represent the need to slow down, wait, or stop can help children remember to control their urges.


For instance, have children picture a music player. Tell them to press ‘pause’ or ‘stop’ when they notice that they are feeling impulsive.
Or, children might visualize a stop light. When they are calm, the light’s green and they continue what they are doing. When they feel begin to get excited or upset they can visualize the light as yellow and start doing things to calm down. When they notice that they are excited, impatient, or upset, the light is red and they need to take a time-out.

"
"
Set clear behavior expectations.,
Establish reasonable consequences.,
Provide praise and encouragement.,
Be consistent.",How to Teach Children Impulse Control3," It is much easier for children of all ages to learn impulse control when they know what is expected of them.This way they know what is acceptable and what isn’t and can work on controlling their inappropriate behavior.


Make sure your expectations are age appropriate. For example, asking a three year-old to sit still for a two hour talk is unrealistic.
Tell the children what your expectations are upfront. For instance, you might say, “I expect you to follow my directions and be respectful while we are here.”

, Part of developing impulse control is accepting that there are consequences for our behavior.You can teach younger and older children impulse control by giving immediate consequences for their impulsive behavior.


For example, it might be unreasonable to tell a toddler to clean up a spilled drink without any help as a consequence for pouring it on the floor. They’d probably try, but you’d most likely still need to clean up after them.
Your consequences should be age appropriate just like your expectations. For instance, time-out could be an appropriate consequence for a pre-schooler that is using toys inappropriately.
Explain the consequences of their behavior in advance so children can think through the cause-and-effect of their actions. For instance, tell them, “If you start yelling we will have to leave so we don’t disturb other people.”

, Just as children need clear expectations and consequences to learn impulse control, they also need positive support.No matter what age they are, acknowledging it when children are successful at controlling their impulses reinforces their good behavior and can make them want to act that way again.


Give them specific positive feedback. For example, “I’m proud of how you patiently waited for your turn. I know you really wanted to ride the pony.”
Praise them frequently and for large and small things. For instance, praise them for sharing their toys at the play date and for their good sportsmanship award.

, When you are teaching children impulse control you should make sure that you are consistently providing consequences and praise. This gives children of any age a sense of security because they know what is expected of them and what to expect in most circumstances. Consequences should be immediately implemented each time the inappropriate behavior occurs. Don’t discipline the children some times, but let it go at other times.

"
"
Monitor yourself.,
Talk about it.,
Make a point of using relaxation techniques.,
Be positive.",How to Teach Children Impulse Control4," Children pay attention to everything adults do and say. They also imitate and repeat it, especially when we don’t want them to. When you are teaching children impulse control you should provide an example with your own behavior.Pay attention to what you do and say to make sure you are being a good role model.


Take particular care when you are in tense or stressful situations and children are around. Remind yourself that you are being a role model.
Don’t assume that because a child is young that they are listening to everything you say and watching everything you do.

, Without doubt, you will find yourself with the children in a situation where you have to use self-control. Use it as an opportunity to model appropriate behavior and teach impulse control. Talk to the children about what is happening, how you feel about it, and what you are doing to control your impulses.


For example, if you are waiting in a long line, you might say, “This line is moving slowly and it’s frustrating me. I’m tired and ready to go. I want to scream, but I’m going to control myself.”
Or, for instance, you might say, “I really want that new jacket. I can’t afford it though and it’s disappointing me. I think I need to do something I can afford in order to lift my spirits.”

, Explicitly doing things like breathing, taking a time-out, and counting when you are upset provides children of all ages with an example of how to control their impulses.Even if you don’t necessarily need to do them, walking through the steps of calming yourself out-loud in tense situations provides a good model of impulse control for children.


For instance, you could say, “I’m going to put myself in time-out right now because I can tell I’m getting really angry with my friend.”
Or, for example, you might tell them, “I need to calm down. I’m going to do some deep breathing for a moment to relax myself before I get upset.”

, It can be frustrating to try to teach children impulse control regardless of whether they are toddlers, preschoolers, school-age, or teens. But you will all be less stressed and they will learn how to control their impulses better if you maintain a good attitude.Try to find the positive side of all situations. For example, if a child is upset because they spilled their milk, you might say, “Don’t cry over your milk. After we clean it up, we can get you some more.”
Keep a good attitude when interacting with the children. Even though they may be impulsive, treat them with respect and caring.

Understand why the compulsion to chew has arisen.,
Know what not to do.,
Try to identify the cause of concern.,
Be discreet.",How to Stop Your Child from Collar Chewing," Chewing a collar is a reaction to a stressor in your child's life. It is often used as a means by which a child can relieve unpleasant emotions, such as shyness, frustration, worry, discomfort, etc. These emotions can arise for a variety of reasons such as being bullied at school, changing schools, moving house, losing a friend, family troubles, etc.;
, Do not harass your child about the chewing. Much of it is akin to a reflex action and your child is resorting to it without being that conscious that they're doing it. Constantly nagging your child to stop chewing, yelling at him about it, or worst still, punishing him for it, will not help relieve it. Rather, such behaviour will become an additional pressure weighing on your child.

, It is far better to find out what is driving your child's insecurities and to alleviate these as best you can. Some life-changing situations, such as moving house, cannot be helped but you can do your very best to be a reassuring pillar of rock for your child, explaining everything that is happening and how very soon things will be back to normal. If the chewing seems to be a reaction to being afraid of situations, help your child to build up his self-confidence by talking through situations, perhaps enrolling your child in karate or some other sport that combines mind and body thinking.

, You can also develop a very discrete gesture to help trigger a reminder for your child that he is chewing his collar again. Nothing loud, bossy or intrusive, just a little ""code"" between the two of you. It could be tapping his shoulder or pulling at your own collar as a visual cue to stop. No need to make it anything more than this.

Mail the check to avoid it being misplaced at the wedding.,
Take travel into account.,
Give a gift card instead of a check.",How to Write a Check As a Wedding Gift1," Unlike a set of towels, a cutlery collection, or a kitchen appliance, checks are small and lightweight, and consequently easy to misplace. If the wedding couple opens their gifts (or their cards) during the reception, your check could easily be lost or misplaced. To avoid this confusion, mail the check, either before or after the wedding.Concerning wedding etiquette, it’s appropriate to mail a check any time before the wedding, or shortly after the wedding. Do not wait more than three months post-wedding to mail the check.If you mail the check, address it to a permanent address where you know one or both members of the couple will receive the check.;
, If you’re flying or driving across the country—or even across the state line—to attend this wedding, it may be impractical and expensive to bring a large, bulky gift with you.In instances like this, a check is the more convenient and practical option.


If you’re traveling to a destination wedding, giving a check can solve much of the hassle associated with bringing a gift to a distant location.

, Consider giving the couple a gift card to a place that has personal meaning to one or both of them. The gift card could be to one of their favorite stores or restaurants. Gift cards do not need to be physically taken to the bank and cashed, which makes them much more convenient for the recipient.


If you know where the couple has registered—for example, Target or Bed Bath and Beyond—you can purchase a gift card to that location, so the couple can purchase items on their registry if they choose to.

Put the check in a greeting card.,
Make out the check to only one of the individuals getting married.,
Consider gift-wrapping the check.",How to Write a Check As a Wedding Gift2," Do not simply sticking a check in an envelope and mail it. This will come across as impersonal, and even lazy. Instead, enclose the check in a nice greeting card, and handwrite a personal message inside.


Address the card to both bride and groom, and congratulate them on their wedding. Include a personal statement, such as addressing a shared memory.

, That way, the couple does not have to wait for a joint bank account to get setup before one of them can deposit the check. For example, so that the check may be endorsed and cashed by either individual, do not make it payable to John AND Jane, but to John OR Jane.This will be especially helpful if the couple has not yet set up their joint bank accounts. The individual that you wrote the check to will be able to cash or deposit the money, without having to wait for a new bank account to be created.
If either member of the couple is changing their last name, address the check to the individual using their maiden name.Otherwise, they’ll have to wait for the legal name change to go through before they can cash the check, which could take months.

, If you’d like to opt for a fancier presentation, rather than enclosing the check in an envelope, you can gift-wrap it. Find a small box, put the check inside, and wrap the box in nice paper with a ribbon around it.


Envelopes containing greeting cards can be mislaid or accidentally thrown away. A box with some size and weight is much less likely to be lost.
Even if you gift-wrap the check, still include a note card with a personal message.

"
"
Give an amount that has meaning to both you and the couple.,
Consider what your budget can handle.,
Consult the traditional etiquette scale.",How to Write a Check As a Wedding Gift3," Rather than writing a check for a generic amount of money—$15, $25, $50—you can give the couple a more specific amount. This will show that you’ve put thought into the gift, and that you’re not simply writing them a check out of convenience.


For example, if you have gone out to dinner with the couple in the past, give them enough money to have dinner again at your favorite restaurant. Make it clear that the money is for this purpose in your note in the card.

, Don’t put a strain on your budget just to make a show of generosity to the couple getting married. Decide how much you can afford to give, think about how much the couple might like to receive (for example, are they planning to make a down payment on a house in the near future?), and make your decision from there.When considering how much to give, take your relationship with the couple into account. If you’re intimate friends or a close family member, it would be appropriate to give a larger sum than if you’re only distant acquaintances.

, Of course, you should take your own budget into account, or evaluate how much you would have spent on a tangible gift. But if you’re utterly at a loss when deciding how much money to make the check out for, consider the guidelines proposed by wedding-etiquette experts.If you’re a co-worker or distant family friend or relative: $50–75.
If you’re a relative or friend: $75–100.
If you’re a close relative or a close friend: $100–150.

Notice the accumulation of material things.,
Watch for resistance when asked to throw away objects.,
Check for an emotional investment in objects.,
Identify common areas for placing objects.",How to Stop Your Child from Hoarding1," A characteristic of hoarding behavior is holding on to objects. These objects might be toys, clothes, or random objects. Because of the age of the child, they often hoard items that they can get for free or without the help of an adult. This might include empty boxes, papers, and things you might consider trash.Broken toys, school papers, old clothes, objects from outside, wrappers, and similar items are often among a child’s hoard.
Some of these objects may have sentimental value, but most of these objects are random.;
, Another characteristic of hoarding behavior is an unnatural attachment to the material objects. The child will continue collecting objects, even if they never use them. If they are asked to throw away the object, they get upset and resist.The child may throw a fit if asked to get rid of some of their stuff. They may start screaming, crying, or yelling when told to throw away something.
The child may become violent, especially if an object was thrown away when they were not there.

, Children often become emotionally attached to the objects they hoard. They will check on the objects often to make sure they are there, and they may even worry about them when not around them.This attachment may disrupt their daily lives.

, Unlike adult hoarders, child hoarders may not display the same obvious clutter in their rooms. Instead, they may keep their hoarded objects in very specific places. Common places to find a child’s hoard are under their bed, in their closet, or in a specific corner of their bedroom.Sometimes, this looks like normal child messiness. If you notice disorganization in your child’s room, look for other symptoms.

"
"
Use a reward system.,
Limit space for objects.,
Use the ""get one-toss one"" rule.,
Try providing priority boxes.,
Model the desired behavior.",How to Stop Your Child from Hoarding2," Reward systems for getting rid of objects can be effective with children. Since the child has an emotional attachment to the objects, they need motivation to get rid of them. Reward them for positive behavior, such as throwing away or donating possessions. Make sure the rewards are not more objects, since this goes against the what you are trying to do. Instead, make rewards activities.For example, when your child throws away an item, you can let them choose whatever they want for dinner. If they go all week without bringing new items home, let them do something special that weekend, like go to a movie or do a favorite activity.

, To help reduce how many material items your child accumulates, consider reducing the space in which they can place material objects. Assess where your child stores objects. Slowly narrow that space and discard items that do not fit into that area.For example, if your child has items stuffed under the bed, in a corner, and in the closet, start by saying the child cannot place items under the bed. Also, add the rule that they cannot increase how many items are in the corner or in the closet. Giving your child limits on the spaces helps them to not just stack things from under the bed and in the closet.
Continue narrowing the areas and discarding toys.
You may want to start by telling your child they can only display items on their bookshelf and desk. Make sure to place limits on how much they can display so they don’t stuff clutter into those spaces.

, To help keep your child from accumulating too many new items, set up a rule that helps keep items from increasing. Each time your child gets a new object, they must throw away an object. This allows your child to acquire new items, but they must throw away something to keep it.This technique helps your child learn skills to assess what is worth keeping.
They also get practice with getting rid of items, which is important to combat hoarding behavior.

, Try giving your child a say in what they keep and what they throw away. Set up three boxes. Label them with the words “trash” “keep” and “charity.” Help your child place objects in the three boxes. Once the keep box is full, they have to place stuff into the other boxes. The keep box cannot overflow.The trash box should be for broken and random items. Keep should be things your child cannot get rid of. At first, the choices may not make sense to you, but let them choose what they want to keep. Objects in the charity box should be things that are in good enough shape to donate.

, If you want your child to stop collecting random objects, model positive behavior. You should make an effort to keep your home uncluttered. This helps show your child the desired behavior.


Make it a point to toss out unneeded things in your home every month or two. Make it obvious. You may want to say, ""Today we are going through the kitchen to toss any unneeded dishes,"" ""I'm going to get rid of old magazines and junk mail today,"" or ""This weekend, I'm going to go through my unused clothes and donate them to charity.""
Include your child in these activities. For example, you may say, ""We're going to go through the shelves in the living room. Help me decide what books and DVDs we should get rid of.""
You can even set limits. Tell your child, ""We must get rid of five dishes"" or ""We must get rid of seven pieces of clothing.""

Take your child to a therapist.,
Try cognitive behavioral therapy.,
Consider medication.",How to Stop Your Child from Hoarding3," Hoarding behavior in children is very significant. Though there are things you can do at home to help your child, it is essential to seek help for your child from a mental health professional. Hoarding generally stems from deeper anxiety and stress-related problems. If you address the hoarding behavior early, your child can get help before the behavior becomes more severe.Make sure you choose a therapist who has experience with hoarding.
You can ask your pediatrician for referrals to a child therapist. You also can search online for therapists in your area.

, Cognitive behavioral therapy is a common treatment for older children with hoarding tendencies. CBT works to change the hoarding behavior. This type of therapy should be done with a therapist who has experience with treating hoarding.In CBT, the child will explore why they feel the need to hoard.
CBT helps the child figure out ways to assess which objects they should keep and which they should give away. They will also work on ways to modify their behavior so they can get rid of objects without too much distress.

, Medication is another treatment option for children who hoard. The most common medication prescribed for this condition are SSRIs. These medications are commonly prescribed for obsessive-compulsive behaviors.Medication does not always help with hoarding behavior. You may consider behavioral therapy before medication.

Know when you’re expect to deliver the speech.,
Practice, practice, practice.,
Bring your notes with you.,

Keep it short and sweet.,
Be sincere.,
Finish with a toast.",How to Write a Wedding Speech," Start by letting everyone in the bridal party and crowd know who you are. Tell them your name, role in the wedding and relation to the people getting married. Not everyone will have met you, and they’ll want to know how you’re connected with the bride or groom and why you’ve been asked to give a speech.The best man and maid of honor are usually each asked to make a short speech on behalf of the wedding party. After that, the microphone is sometimes turned over to whoever would like to say a few words.
Saying your name and briefly summarizing your history with the bride or groom will be enough. Don’t talk about yourself too much. Remember, the focus of your speech is the married couple.

, Start by telling a joke or recalling a humorous anecdote to loosen up the crowd (and yourself. Humor is very disarming, so getting everyone laughing right off the bat can help dispel some of the nerves of giving a speech. It will also get everyone to like you and make your speech more memorable if everyone is having fun.Use jokes judiciously to break the initial tension and keep the crowd relaxed. Try not to let your speech turn into a stand up comedy routine.
Keep your humorous stories and remarks appropriate. There will be people of all ages in your audience, including children.
Funny stories might include a funny story about the bride and groom's meeting, or an anecdote about one of them as a child.

, Recall some of your fondest experiences with the couple of the hour. If you’ve been chosen as the best man or maid of honor, chances are you have a long history with the bride or groom. Relating a special memory or inside joke will spark an emotional resonance that touches everyone listening.Sharing unique memories or stories is much more effective than simply complimenting the bride or groom because it is a more personal touch.

, Shift the focus of the speech to the newlyweds and their future together. Address the bride and groom directly. Wish them health, happiness, and prosperity. If you want, you can include a short parable or quote to help illustrate the piece of wisdom you’re giving.If you decide to use a quote for this segment of the speech, make sure it is short, relevant and not a cliche.

, Bring the speech to a close by thanking the bride and groom, their parents, friends and family, everyone in attendance and even the staff setting up and catering the reception. Be gracious and make everyone feel like they’re part of a wonderfully special occasion. Ask that everyone enjoy themselves and share in the bliss of the new bride and groom.Acknowledging the people who helped make the wedding festivities possible will make you appear humble, as well as making them feel appreciated.
Express your gratitude in a couple sentences. There’s no need to go on and on thanking every person individually by name.

, Make sure your speech is written out and ready to be memorized two to three weeks ahead of the time you’re expected to deliver it. Being asked to give a wedding speech is being entrusted with a big responsibility, so you should take it seriously. The sooner you get the speech written, the more time you’ll have to study it so that when the times comes reciting it will feel like second nature.Treat your speech like you would a school assignment. Compose several drafts, check it for errors and have a friend proofread it to make sure it sounds good.

, Check with the wedding planner or master of ceremonies to find out when you’ll be giving your speech. Typically, speeches and toasts are reserved for the reception once everyone is seated and has begun eating and drinking, but weddings can follow very different formats. Be clear about your entrance cues and proper use of the sound and projection equipment on hand. Not knowing for certain when you’re going on can make your nerves much worse.Familiarize yourself with the order of presentation if multiple speeches are to be given.
Don’t spend the entire ceremony fretting over your speech. If you’re sufficiently prepared, you won’t need to give it a second thought until it’s time for you to deliver it.

, After your speech is written, recite it off the page. Then, try to recite it without looking. Then, recite it from memory while you’re showering, driving or doing your laundry. Practice your speech until you couldn’t forget it if you tried. That way, if you find yourself overwhelmed by anxiety once you’re in front of an audience, you’ll have your reflexive memory to fall back on.Know your speech word for word, but try not to sound like you’re simply reciting it from memory. Pace yourself and give every passage emphasis, emotion and clarity.

, Even though you should aim to commit your speech to memory entirely, it’s still a good idea to bring your notes with you to the stage. If you have a lapse and get stuck, your notes can help you get back on track smoothly. If you don’t end up using them, you’ll at least have all your bases covered. Better safe than sorry.Put your entire speech on a couple note cards rather than a several large sheets of paper. Not only will this look better, it will help you keep your speech at the appropriate length.
Only look at your notes if you draw a blank or forget the next part. This will allow you to keep your eyes up and engage your audience. Even the most riveting speech will be a bore if the person giving it is reading off a note card the whole time.

, Do your best to keep your cool once the MC invites you to give your speech. Public speaking is a little awkward for everybody, but if you’re well prepared and stick to what you’ve rehearsed, you’ll be just fine. Remember, you’re surrounded by friends and family, and they all want to have a good time and see you succeed.Take a few slow, deep breaths. Think about what you’re saying and shut out all other distractions. Imagine that you’re giving your speech to one person instead of a room full of people.
Have a drink or two if it helps your nerves. Just don’t have too many—you want to be focused and clear-headed when it’s time for you to take the floor.

, Try to limit your speech to somewhere between 2-5 minutes. While there is no mandatory length for a wedding speech, it’s best not to ramble on and on. Your speech should be long enough to draw your listeners in and get them emotionally invested, but not so lengthy that they start to get bored. Hit the high points and let the crowd get back to socializing.It’s perfectly okay to give a short speech. Simply say a few kind words, raise a toast and hand back the microphone.
Speak slowly and deliberately. It’s easy to start chattering too fast when you’re nervous. By talking slower than you feel like you need to, you’ll probably be going at just the right speed.
People who are underprepared or extremely anxious tend to talk aimlessly. Avoid this by sticking to what you’ve written and look to the crowd for cues about when their attention is evaporating.

, Speak from the heart. Let everyone around you know that you mean what you say, and emphasize how much your relationship with the bride or groom means to you. This is your chance to pay tribute to your friendship and show your gratitude for being asked to take part in the ceremonies. Allow your emotion to guide your words, not your desire to get the speech over with as quickly as possible.Take a moment to speak to the bride and/or groom directly.
It’s normal to get a little choked up! As long as you can finish your speech, there’s no need to worry. It may even be flattering, as it will show the people you’re talking about how much you truly care.

, When you’ve concluded your speech, ask everyone to raise a glass to honor the newlyweds. Say a few quick words wishing them the best in the future. Have everyone drink, then invite them to stick around and have fun celebrating together. Most importantly, have fun yourself!It’s customary for the best man or groomsmen to toast the bride, and the maid of honor to toast the groom.

State what the person means to you.,
Say other things you like about the person.,
Make it personal.,
Remember you are making a pact.,

Make promises about acceptance and love.",How to Write Same Sex Marriage Vows1," Some couples write their vows together, with the intention of keeping them similar. Other couples write vows separately, with each person deciding what they want to say to the other person. Sometimes, the second kind of vows are kept secret until the wedding, though sometimes, you may also want to write different vows together. That way, they are unique, but you can still have vows that go together., Even if you're writing separately, you may decide together that you want to keep your vows more formal or informal. What that means will vary by couple, but making a joint decision about it is a good way to keep from catching someone off-guard.

, That is, you may want to make personal promises to each other, but you may also want to include some more classic lines. Take some time to look at opposite-sex vows, particularly ones related to your faith if you're religious. Decide what you'd like to use from those traditions. It's fine to mix and match, as long as you agree (and the officiant is okay with it).You should also consider including something about children, if you or your partner already has children. You also might want to include a promise about parenting and committing to parent your partner's child or children.

, Begin with a declaration about what the person means to you. It's a great way to open because it establishes the other person's worth to you right from the outset, which is partially what you want to establish in your wedding vows.It could be something like ""Karen, you are the light of my life,"" or ""Joe, you mean everything to me.""
You could also try something like, ""Rachel, I'm so thankful to have met you.""

, Spend some time expanding on what the person means to you. Make some heartfelt statements about the person's value. Don't forget to tell the person how much you love and cherish them.Think about why you wanted to marry the person in the first place. What makes you smile every time she does it? Does your heart burst when he walks into the room?
What are your favorite little quirks?

, Platitudes are great, especially if they come from your heart, but statements that are unique to the person will mean so much more. In other words, get as specific as possible when writing how much you love the person.""I love you to the end of the earth,"" is sweet, but ""I love the way you smile when you first wake up, the sun creeping across your sleepy face"" is much more personal.

, The heart of the vow is what you promise to each other. You are making a pact to be together, and your vows should reflect that pact. In other words, before writing, think about what you bring to the relationship, and how you will uphold the other person.As a same-sex couple, it's still a perilous privilege to legally marry your spouse, and your vows could reflect that, too, such as ""I promise to defend you when other people try to bring us down.""

, When making promises, you don't want to just repeat other people's words without thinking about them first. You want to make sure what you're saying is what you will do. For instance, maybe you want to talk about creating a home together or a family. Maybe you want to talk about growing old together. Maybe you want to make promises about the life you want to create together.For example, you could say, ""I promise to join my life with yours in a world that sometimes tells us we shouldn't have a life together, so that we can create a happy, bright home together.""
You could also say, ""I promise to always help you find the beauty in life and to always take you up on your offer to watch a sunset.""

, Part of the promises you make usually include a section about how you accept the other person, and how you plan to love them. You can define these promises by length of time (life) or the specific times you will love them through (i.e. sickness and health).For example, you could say something like, ""I accept you just as you are, with all your best and worst qualities, and I promise that I will love you through all the good times and the bad times.""
Alternatively, you could say something like, ""I cherish who you are as a person, and I promise to love that person all our lives.""
