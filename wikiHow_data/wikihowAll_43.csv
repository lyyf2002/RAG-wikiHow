Don't be afraid to go back to classic vows.,
Substitute in the appropriate gender.,
Decide how much religion you want to include.,
Consider adding a line about your struggle.",How to Write Same Sex Marriage Vows2," If you're stressing about your vows, it's fine to take opposite-sex vows and adapt them to your needs. You can still modify them to fit the occasion, and you won't work yourself into a tizzy trying to write something beautiful and romantic., For same-sex wedding vows, all you need to do to adapt classic vows is to sub in ""wife/woman and wife/woman"" or ""husband/man and husband/man"" for ""wife/woman and husband/man.""Classic Presbyterian vows are as follows:
""(Name), wilt thou have this woman/man to be thy wife/husband, and wilt thou pledge thy faith to him/her, in all love and honor, in all duty and service, in all faith and tenderness, to live with her/him, and cherish her/him, according to the ordinance of God, in the holy bond of marriage?""
""I, (Name), take you, (Name), to be my wedded wife/husband, and I do promise and covenant, before God and these witnesses, to be your loving and faithful husband/wife, in plenty and want, in joy and in sorrow, in sickness and in health, as long as we both shall live.""
As you can see, these vows are already fairly gender-neutral, so you just need to sub in the correct words. Most contemporary religions have gender-neutral vows, so all you really need to do is sub in the appropriate genders and names.

, If you're having a religious ceremony, you probably want to include ""God"" in your vows, as most classic vows do. However, if you're not having a religious ceremony, but you still want to use classic vows, you may have to adjust the wording.For example, if you want to use the classic Methodist vows, they are as follows:
""Will you have this woman/man to be your wife/husband, to live together in holy marriage? Will you love her/him, comfort her/him, honor, and keep her/him in sickness and in health, and forsaking all others, be faithful to her/him as long as you both shall live?""
""In the name of God, I, (Name), take you, (name), to be my wife/husband, to have and to hold from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, until we are parted by death. This is my solemn vow.""
In this case, you may want to take out ""holy"" or replace ""In the name of God"" with ""As witnessed by the universe.""

, Because same-sex marriage is still gaining acceptance, despite being legal, it may be appropriate to include a line about supporting each other through the struggles of being a same-sex couple.


For example, you could use the following Catholic vows, and add a line as you see fit:
""I, (Name), take you, (Name), for my lawful wife/husband, to have and to hold from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and health, until death do us part.""
""I, (Name), take you, (Name), to be my husband/wife. I promise to be true to you in good times and in bad, in sickness and in health. I will love and honor you all the days of my life.""
Before the last sentence in the second vow, you could add the line, ""I promise to stand with you through all the struggles our relationship faces, from internal and external forces.""

"
"
Don't be afraid to get a little silly.,
Don't wait until the night before.,
Have a backup.",How to Write Same Sex Marriage Vows3," Of course, your wedding is an important day, and you're making an important promise. However, it's okay to make your vows personal, even a little silly, to help you let the other person know how much you care about them.For example, you can promise that ""I'll always walk in the rain and splash in puddles with you.""
You could also say that ""I promise I'll always ask you to dance when our favorite song comes on the radio, even in the middle of a restaurant.""

, Marriage vows take time. They come from the heart, and sometimes figuring out exactly what you want to say to the person you love on your wedding day is a daunting task. If you start the night before the wedding, you won't have time to really figure out what you want to say.Start writing your vows at least a month in advance and have a solid draft at least 2 weeks before the wedding. That way, you'll have time to make tweaks.
Practice saying your vows to friends and family to ease the stress during the ceremony. You'll feel more confident and less nervous if you've practiced them beforehand.

, You probably want to memorize your vows, but it's okay to have a backup in case you forget. Give a copy to one of your wedding attendants, so they can have it ready in case you stumble. It's a big day, and you're sure to be a big bundle of nerves. It's okay if you forget a little, as long as the sentiment is there."

, Knowing how many pictures are left will help you to try only for the best shots, so as to not waste any., No doubt the couple have paid a fortune to hire an official photographer for their wedding. The single use cameras left on the tables can be used for less formal images and spontaneous moments.

"
Check to see if the coast is clear.,
Talk to the bride.,
Choose a location.,
Decide on a date.,
Compile the guest list.",How to Throw a Wedding Shower1," No, you're not sneaking out of the house; you're checking with the bride's friends and family to see if a shower is already planned. It isn't a good idea to throw two parties if the same people will be at both! Consider these possibilities:


If you are the bride-to-be's co-worker and would like to throw an office bridal shower, you're less likely to run into interference.
If you're the bride's mother, feel free to plan a shower for your daughter; however, be aware that in some parts of the world it is considered to be general wedding etiquette that the bride's mother does not plan a bridal shower as it is thought better left to others to plan and that it lacks taste to have the mother doing this. Note, however, that more people are ignoring this little ""rule"" and doing it anyway. It's up to your discretion.;
, That is, if you don't want a shower that's a complete surprise. With all the general fuss of a wedding, it may be best to talk to the bride, though. You want to avoid inviting people to the shower who aren't invited to the reception and you want to make sure the shower is in line with the bride-to-be's wishes. Does she want a co-ed shower? What dates and times are best for her? Where would she want it at?


If you like the idea of the bride being minimally involved, just ask about the guest list and date -- she probably figures she's having a shower anyway. The theme and details can be up to you and the rest of the bridesmaids or close family.

, Now comes the best part! Whether it's the beach, a restaurant, or fancy hotel, the location of the shower can change everything. If you do decide to go with a specific theme, your location should reflect this.


You probably wouldn't want to bring the bride's elderly aunts to a smoke-filled bar and grill. Sometimes the shower is held at a relatives' home, or the maid of honor's, or even the bride's place. Consider a nice picnic area, a yacht, or a bonfire/cookout in the backyard. Your location should match both the bride's personality and your budget.

, Traditionally, the wedding shower isn't held until a month before the wedding, but these days people are less inclined to follow this norm and choose a date to suit their own needs. Just be sure that the couple has had the opportunity to tell everyone about the wedding first. You don't want to step on anyone's toes!


Make sure that all the necessary people will be available for this day. Once you have found a day that works for everyone, call the venue, if you're not having it at someone's home, to make reservations.

, Ask for some names from the bride herself, as well as from the mother of the bride. If another shower is being planned, try not to invite those same people to yours. It's ridiculous to expect someone to buy two -— and sometimes even three -— gifts for one person!


Also, beware of inviting those who aren't also invited to the wedding itself. Just because you thought the bride was still friends with Laura from second grade, does not mean that she is. You will only offend people if you're not careful.

"
"
Send a preliminary ""save the date"" email and/or call important guests.,
Pick a theme.,
Set a budget.,
Purchase the invitations and order special menu items, if applicable.",How to Throw a Wedding Shower2," This does not serve as the invitation -- it just lets everyone know the plan well ahead of time (those coming from distant lands will appreciate it). Contact guests you know the bride needs there -- her best friend for college, favorite extended family, and females from the groom's side to see if they all can make your date.


As you're doing this, compile a list of addresses to send the real invitations out to. In your email, request their information if you don't already have it.

, It will help direct both the mood of the shower party and can even impact the gifts.


Consider a classic ""Round the Clock"" shower, where every guest gets a certain time of day to buy their gift for. Those with 7 a.m. could give the bride breakfast items, whereas those with 6 p.m. may gift the couple with dinner plates and napkins.
Another idea is to have a location theme: Hawaiian, French, Chinese, or Spanish works well. Or, tailor your theme to the location: if the shower is at the beach, an obvious choice is to have a luau or Hawaiian theme.
Choose a charity theme. Ask that guests not bring gifts but donate money to charity instead. This in consideration of the reality that you will receive wedding gifts anyway and a shower seeking gifts is akin to double dipping and can irritate potential wedding guests.

, Bridal showers can run from the very inexpensive to the extremely pricey, depending on your location and number of guests. Enlist a few of the bride's friends to help plan (and pay!) for the shower. Be sensible, however, as most of the money should go to the wedding and reception and not be eaten up by a wedding shower party. If you're a bridesmaid or maid of honor, consider asking all the girls to pitch in. A group effort will not only lessen the limits of your purse strings, but it will also help the shower itself run much more smoothly.


Get together with the girls to decide on the decorations, menu, party favors, flowers, activities and the like. Give each person a specific to-do list to make all the duties manageable. If any of the team has connections (or is particularly crafty), the details can be sorted out. You don't necessarily need a theme now, but knowing what is and is not reasonable will help lessen the burden on your shoulders.

, The invitations do not have to be store-bought or otherwise ordered -- you can make them yourself! wikiHow has a plethora of sources for this! Often personalized, hand-made invites are even more meaningful.


Once you've gotten the invitations taken care of, think about special items you'd like for the shower. Do you have to rent any equipment? Get anything intricately designed? Some companies may ask you give them 8 weeks to complete your order.

"
"
Assemble, address, and mail the invitations.,
Shop for decorations, dining ware, and other party necessities.,
Decide on a menu.,
Plan some games.,
Pick up some favors.",How to Throw a Wedding Shower3," Include information about the couple's registries and, if it's a theme party, make sure to provide proper gift-giving instructions. Give your contact information for those that have questions.


You may want to include an ending time. Some people will be more won't to come if they know their entire day won't be taken up by watching an old acquaintance open gift after gift after gift.

, After all, what's a theme without decorations? If you're throwing a beach-themed shower, pick up some tiki torches, palm trees, and grass skirts. Balloons, crepe paper streamers, banners, table centerpieces, plates -- the list of available items goes on and on.


Abandoning the feel of the shower entirely is also a legitimate option. If you know the bride would be totally turned off by an hour of opening presents and drowning in crepe paper, dedicate the afternoon to a wine tasting or a spa treatment. As long as friends are relaxing and having a good time, success will be had.

, Bridal showers have been known to produce quite a few tears as well as laughter, both of which make for some hungry tummies. Keep the time of your party in mind when creating your menu; a morning shower would be perfect for a brunch.


Some food ideas for your shower: finger sandwiches, cookies, cold salads, veggies and dip, chili, crackers and cheese, etc.

If guests have offered to bring desserts and other treats, call to confirm what they plan to bring -- adjust your recipe plans accordingly.



, Silly games are essential to any good, traditional shower. The naughtier, the better! Try one of these:



Stuff It: Before the party, sit down with the groom and ask him a list of questions, preferably ones the bride may not know. Then, at the party, pass the questions around the room, having each guest ask the bride one. If she gets it wrong, she must stuff a piece of bubble gum in her mouth. Her answers will become so messy, you'll have the whole room laughing.

If the mother of the bride or groom is present, take caution (depending on her personality).



Stud Muffin: Before the party, obtain a picture of the groom. Buy balloons. Also gather photos of sexy, hunky men. Roll the pictures up tight and tie with a ribbon or rubber band. Stuff one into each balloon and blow up. At the party, each woman has to grab a balloon and pop it. Whoever gets the real hunk—the groom—wins a prize!

Don't go into overkill. The gals (and maybe guys?) will be totally content eating, drinking, and being merry.



, Speaking of bridal shower games, you may want to reward your loyal jesters with a gift. Make up little gift bags and place small trinkets inside. Shop the dollar stores if you have to: photo albums, picture frames, fancy pens, coffee mugs, dish towel sets, candles, and nail polish will all do the trick.


It’s the hostess’s job to send all the party-goers home with a little favor. Make sure your favor is small but meaningful and tie it in with the theme of your party as best you can.

"
"
Take care of the basic details.,
Buy your gift for the bride.,
Pick out your outfit.",How to Throw a Wedding Shower4," Place your flower order (if desired) and pick up any goods friends or neighbors have offered to lend -- CDs? Baskets? Cake dishes or punch bowls? Tea trays? Sound equipment? A pre-rolled red carpet?


Make a grocery list for the food and drinks. Buy any hard-to-find ingredients now in case you foresee having any trouble. Grab the alcohol now, too, if you're having cocktails.

, As long as it's meaningful, it doesn't have to be large -- especially since you're throwing her the dang party!


If she's a bit on the OCD side, ask the other bridesmaids and attendants what they've gotten her. They may have valuable input or you could join forces to purchase a larger gift.
You could always offer to pay for part of the honeymoon! Hey, that's one less gift to open in the stream of gifts that will dominate (and possibly put the snooze button on) the party.

, Finally, a moment for you! Since you're the hostess, you have to look good, too! Here's the excuse to buy that new dress you've been looking at.

"
"
Confirm, confirm, confirm.,
Create a mental floor plan.,
Buy any last-minute groceries and do the prep work.,
Set up the equipment and decorations, and assemble the favors.",How to Throw a Wedding Shower5," Hope you can take a break from your day job, because you'll need to spend a hefty amount of time making phone calls. But once it's done, it's done! Lock yourself in the living room with a list of phone numbers and get on it.


Confirm reservations. If you're not using an outside venue, skip this.
Confirm orders and delivery times. This goes for flowers, friends taking care of pick-ups, food, and equipment.
Confirm RSVPs. This is possibly the most important. Call the guest list to make sure your numbers are correct and the bodies you have to help this go off without a hitch.

, You may think one table is enough for gifts, but 28 blender-sized boxes ends up taking a large amount of room. Consider the guests, the space needed for activities, and how to arrange the flowers, decorations and food.


Have the games fully prepared before you go about designating space for them.

, If you can prepare anything beforehand, do so. You'll need to allot your time masterfully. As the clock ticks, get the other bridesmaids or family members to help you get going.

, Set up the tables and chairs according to your floor plan. Have everything as ready as possible before the actual time. Once you do, breathe. Is there anything you've forgotten?


Take these last hours to run any errands. Has anyone forgotten to bring or pick up anything that they said they would? If a friend is free, can they run the errands for you?

"
"
Stay organized.,
Think of the outside.,
Be a good assistant.,
Help clean up.",How to Throw a Wedding Shower6," The day of the party, keep a checklist in hand and designate others to help. If you have extensive decorating to do, arrive at your location bright and early. Remember all your items and remember to pick up your balloons and the cake as well.


Keep your phone on you! Businesses or friends may be calling for directions or other questions.

, If people are coming to an area you are unfamiliar with, you may want to put balloons on the mailbox or little arrows along a walk. Or you may have to end up sending someone outside to flag wanderers down!


If you're doing it at a public place, ask what signage you can post and where to assist your guests in finding the appropriate area.

, When the bride opens her gifts, have a pen and paper handy. Sit next to her and write the name of the person who gives her each gift. This will be a huge help to the bride when she writes her ""thank you"" notes. In fact, many brides can't thank anyone without this list!

, Don't leave your location dirty after the party. Even if the party was thrown at the beach or a picnic area, you still need to pick up your mess. Send the bride home with the leftover cake and be sure the women have their favors. Hopefully a few other people will be kind enough to help.

Have the dress cleaned after your wedding.,
Take photos of the dress.,
Set a fair price.,
Sell it as quickly as possible.",How to Sell Your Wedding Gown1," The delicate fabric can hold onto white wine, champagne, and even perspiration stains that, while not immediately visible, may appear months after your wedding. A dress that has been properly cleaned is much more marketable.Even if you think you didn't get anything on the dress, it’s best to have it cleaned right after the wedding. Old stains are more difficult, and sometimes impossible, to remove without damaging the dress.
Take the dress to a specialist in cleaning wedding gowns and formal wear. If there isn't one in your area, ask your neighborhood dry cleaner about their expertise and even ask for references before leaving your dress with them. Paying a little more for a specialist is well worth the cost to know that it's done right.;
, Whether you plan to sell your dress directly or use an online service, it helps to have several clear, well-lit pictures of the dress to entice potential buyers. Make sure to take photos from both the front and back, so buyers can see what the entire dress looks like.When you’re taking the photos, it's better to place the dress on a hanger rather than lay it on a flat surface.
Take close-up photos of any detail work, such as beading, sequins, or lace.
If there is any damage to your dress, make sure to include photos of it. It’s better to let buyers know ahead of time, so they can decide if they’re still serious about buying the dress.

, Asking the right amount for your dress can help increase your chances of selling it. In most cases, you can expect to sell a used dress that’s in good condition and less than two and a half years old for half the retail price. You may want to start off asking slightly more than that, though, so you have some room to negotiate.You can often resell dresses made by well known designers, such as Vera Wang, Carolina Herrera, or Monique Lhuillier, for 60 to 70 percent of the price that you paid it.

, You’re usually going to get the best price for your dress if you sell it within two and a half years of purchasing it because the style will probably still be on trend. If you know that you want to sell your dress, don’t waste time after the wedding -- the sooner you sell it, the more value it will have.While you’re probably going to get more money for a newer dress, that doesn’t mean you can’t make money on a vintage dress. Even ‘80s and ‘90s styles can be popular these days.
In terms of timing, you’re better off selling your dress in February and March because those are the peak months for wedding dress sales. The holiday period between Thanksgiving and New Year’s is the worst time to sell."

Visit a local consignment or resale shop.,
Sell it to a dress rental company.,
Contact wedding-related businesses.",How to Sell Your Wedding Gown2," These types of stores will either buy the dress directly from you, or sell it for you and keep some of the profit. Make sure to ask about their selling policy, so you understand exactly how much of the final price of the dress you can expect to pocket.You may want to contact the bridal boutique where you purchased the dress too. While they’re in the business of selling new dresses, the owner or manager may consider working out a deal to either purchase the dress for resale or sell it for you, provided they keep a percentage of the sale price.

, You may have boutiques in your area that rent wedding dresses, and they’re often looking for new styles to add to their inventory.

They can pass it onto interested brides, or hang it up where potential buyers can see it.

Write an online description.,
Offer it on eBay.,
List it on Craigslist.,
Sell it on a wedding specialty site.",How to Sell Your Wedding Gown3," Because prospective buyers aren't able to see the dress in person, you'll want to include as detailed a description as possible. Make sure to include the designer, size, and original price, and describe the style, including any embellishments, such as pearls, sequins, or beading.If you’re having trouble coming up with a description, try to find the designer’s description to help you along.
Certain keywords can help draw a prospective buyer's attention. Words like ""Plus-Size,"" ""Vintage,"" or ""Lace"" should go in the listing's title, along with the designer's name. For example, you might write ""Plus-Size Short Sleeve Vera Wang Wedding Dress With Lace Details"" or ""Vintage Alfred Angelo Wedding Dress With Pearl Beading Size 8.""
Prospective buyers will want to know if the dress is exactly as the designer intended, so be sure to mention any alterations that have been made and whether they can be reversed or not.

, It’s probably the most widely known e-commerce website, so you may already have experience with the company. While they don’t specialize in wedding dresses, they do sell 1000 to 2000 a week, so there’s definitely a market. Keep in mind that eBay charges listing and sales fees, so you won’t receive the full price that you sell the dress for.Make sure to include photos of the dress in your listing to catch the eye of potential buyers.
You can sell your dress on eBay via an auction style listing that allows interested parties to bid on it, which can sometimes help drive up the price.

, It’s a good option if you don’t want to deal with shipping your dress off to a buyer because the site is divided by locations. That allows you to sell the dress to someone in your area, and arrange an in-person pickup. There are also no fees to sell items on Craigslist, so you can expect to keep the entire sale price.Just as with eBay, make sure to include photos in your Craigslist ad. Buyers don’t want to take your word that the dress is in good condition. They want to see what it looks like with their own eyes.
Most of the shoppers on Craigslist are hunting for bargains, so keep that in mind when you price the dress.

, These days, there are a variety of companies, including PreownedWeddingDresses.com, StillWhite.com, NearlyNewlywed.com, OnceWed.com, and Tradesy.com, that are dedicated to reselling bridal items. Each site has different requirements for their listings and charge different fees, so you should do some research to find the best fit for your needs.While you’ll want to include detailed specs and photos of the dress as you would on other online commerce sites, you may also want to include a photo of the dress at your wedding on a bridal-focused site.

Match your gloves to your sleeves.,
Choose appropriate gloves for a ball gown.,
Pair opera gloves with simple gowns.,
Select fitting gloves for an empire dress.,
Choose classic gloves for an A-line dress.,
Decide on the length you want.,
Select the right fabric.,
Opt for embellishments.,
Pick a vibrant color.",How to Wear Wedding Gloves1," Sleeve length can help you narrow down the type of gloves that work best for your dress. Different length sleeves call for shorter or longer gloves.For a sleeveless dress, opt for shorter sleeved gloves or gloves with a classic sleeve length.
For longer sleeves, gloves may not be the best option. However, wrist-length gloves can be appropriate here.;
, If you're wearing a ball gown style veil, long gloves can work well. This goes well with the elegance and formality of a ball gown dress. However, if your ball gown has long-illusion sleeves, it's best to forego gloves as they weigh down the look., Opera gloves are very dressy and make for a bold look. They should be the primary focus of your outfit. If you have a simpler gown, opera gloves work great as they add some embellishment.For a more modern simple gown, black opera gloves can be worn instead of white ones.

, An empire dress with puffed sleeves pairs well with shorter, daintier gloves. This works best for a summer wedding. For a formal wedding that takes place in the winter, opera gloves are sometimes appropriate with a short sleeved empire dress., For a sleeveless a-line dress, go for classic six-button gloves that are short or mid-length. For a three-quarter sleeve, gloves should be around wrist length. However, if your sleeves are very ornate, it may be best to opt out of gloves altogether to avoid taking attention away from your sleeves., There are no hard and fast rules about glove lengths. However, certain lengths give off a different style and pair well with different dresses.Shorter gloves generally work better with longer sleeves. The shortest types of gloves fall just at the base of the palm and can work well for a very long-sleeved dress.
Medium length gloves sometimes fall near the wrist or a little above the wrist. They can pair well with a dress with shorter sleeves or no sleeves.
The longest types of gloves reach the elbow or a little past the elbow. These work best with plainer dresses with very short sleeves or no sleeves.

, If you're adhering to tradition, strive to match the fabric of your wedding dress. If a dress is satin, for example, opt for satin gloves. While this is tradition, remember you can make your own rules regarding wedding gloves. If you have your heart set on, say, lace gloves, do not hesitate to go with your first choice simply because it does not match the dress. All types of wedding gloves are sold in multiple fabric types. Choose the type of fabric that matches your vision for your wedding day.If you decide on a glove type, explore different fabric options. At a wedding boutique, for example, request to see a pair of opera gloves in a range of fabrics to decide which style you like best.

, If your dress is on the plain side, think about going for embellished gloves. Many wedding gloves come with detailed lace, bows, sequins, and other embellishments to add a little variety to your dress.Instead of buttons, get a glove with a bow adorning the wrist.
Look for gloves with detailed lace, especially if your dress is solid colored without embellishments.
Some gloves come adorned with sparkles of sequins. If you want your wedding to have a fairy tale feel, think about choosing these types of gloves.

, Wedding gloves do not have to match the wedding dress. Many brides pick gloves in a color they love instead of going with traditional white gloves. This can work for a modern wedding where you're not following tradition. For example, if your favorite color is pink, wear pink wedding gloves over white ones.If you're trying to get your ""something blue"" in, wear blue wedding gloves.

Opt for fingerless gloves for a modern feel.,
Go for vintage gloves for an old fashioned wedding.,
Get the right size.",How to Wear Wedding Gloves2," One downside to gloves is that taking them on and off during the ceremony can be cumbersome. If you're having a more modern wedding, fingerless gloves can fit into the look and solve this problem. Fingerless gloves come in a variety of fashions and styles, just like regular gloves, but do not have fingers.Some gloves have a slit in the ring finger designed for the ring ceremony. If you do not want to have to take your gloves off during the ceremony, but do not want fingerless gloves, consider this option.

, If you're having a wedding with a vintage feel, buy a pair of vintage gloves to match. Stop by a local vintage shop and look for gloves from another era for your big day.If you're trying to incorporate something borrowed, ask an older relative for their wedding gloves.
Vintage glove styles include things like heavily buttoned gloves, old-fashioned driving gloves, winter gloves, and gauntlet gloves., You do not want to end up wearing gloves that are too tight. Get your hands measured at a bridal shop to make sure you order gloves in the right size. American sizes generally run from small to extra large, while European sizes run from sizes 7 to 10."

Keep your gloves on during the ceremony.,
Remove your gloves during the ring ceremony.,
Decide whether or not to keep your gloves on after the ceremony.,
Take your gloves off when eating or drinking.,
Bend the rules based on your preferences.",How to Wear Wedding Gloves3," If you're wearing gloves, keep them on during the ceremony. As you walk down the aisle and say your vows, your gloves should remain in place. If bridesmaids are wearing matching gloves, they should also keep their gloves on during the ceremony., When exchanging rings, you can remove your gloves. Have a plan of where to set them. Some brides may hand their gloves to the maid of honor, for example. With longer gloves, consider having a slit in the ring finger instead of removing the gloves. Removing something like opera length gloves can be awkward.If you're wearing fingerless gloves, you can keep these on during the ceremony.

, During the greeting line after the ceremony, some brides opt to keep their gloves on. However, there is no strict etiquette regarding greeting others with your gloves. Gloves are also optional during the reception. It's a matter of personal preference, so decide how much wearing gloves after the ceremony matters to you., If you're going to be eating or drinking, it's customary to remove your gloves. This will protect them from damage. If you opt to keep your gloves on at the reception, remove them when having a drink or food.However, for very small bites or drinks, it's okay to keep your gloves on.

, While there was once strict etiquette regarding gloves during a wedding ceremony, a lot of tradition has faded with time. It's okay to make your own rules based on your personal preferences. It is your wedding, so you should wear gloves however you choose. It's okay to alter rules to suit the needs of your ceremony."

Line the ceremonial aisle with baby’s breath.,
Decorate the ceremony arch.,
Make wreaths and garlands.,
Adorn the wedding cake with baby’s breath.",How to Use Baby's Breath in Your Wedding1," For a vintage, rustic look, tie fluffy sprigs of baby’s breath to the chairs on both sides of the main aisle. Affix the sprigs with strips of lace, rustic twine or pastel ribbons to complete the look. If you’re going for drama and elegance, use this affordable flower to create lush potted arrangements and place them along the aisle.Choose the pots based on your wedding theme – for example, you could place the baby’s breath in wooden buckets for a rustic or outdoor wedding.
For a more sophisticated look, put the flowers in ornate planters or vases.;
, Baby’s breath is extremely affordable and its fullness can take up lots of space, making it ideal when you need to keep your floral costs low. The plant is quite sturdy, so it will hold up well under the construction of the ceremony arch. If your wedding is outdoors, baby’s breath is hardy enough to withstand the elements in most climates.


If your budget is tight but you want an elegant wedding look, baby’s breath can be used to create an elaborate wedding arch at a relatively low cost.
Depending on your wedding theme, you can choose to decorate the arch with only baby’s breath or use it more as a floral accent and filler. Speak to your florist about possibilities., Baby’s breath wreaths can create a whimsical, romantic atmosphere and they tend to look lovely anywhere you decide to hang them. Place the wreaths on doors, walls and even on the back of the getaway car.Lush garlands can be easily constructed with baby’s breath for additional décor. Hang these garlands over windows, along tables and around the main entryway.For a quaint yet elegant look, hang unconnected bunches of baby’s breath over the windows, rather than stringing the flowers together to create traditional garlands.To save money, try making your own wreaths and garlands. Baby’s breath is easy to experiment with and costs very little, making it a great choice for DIYers.

, Encircle the base of your wedding cake with baby’s breath for a simple and classic look. Mix it with other flowers or use large bunches of it by itself to create an ethereal, airy vibe. If you want to use even more baby's breath, encircle the base of each layer of the wedding cake, or place sprigs of it on top of each tier.


Place a frothy bundle of it on the top layer of the cake instead of a more traditional topper.
Accent the dessert table with more baby’s breath to tie the whole look together."

Celebrate at your reception.",How to Renew Your Wedding Vows," Any married couple can renew their vows any time they want, but having a reason for doing so can make the occasion feel more special. Maybe you got married in a courthouse and never got to have your loved ones there to witness your big day. Maybe you couldn't afford a big wedding the first time around but are ready to throw a huge gala now. Maybe you or your partner have overcome a major life difficulty, such as an illness or a career crisis, and you want to show that your love is stronger than ever. Maybe you've patched things up after one of you strayed and want to reaffirm your commitment to each other.


Though these reasons, as well as special anniversaries, are excellent for renewing your vows, you should do it whenever you feel that you both want to do it. There's no cookie-cutter way to make this decision.;
, Determine if you want a big ceremony with plenty of fanfare or an intimate gathering of just close family and friends. Maybe you want to throw a huge party to see many people you haven't seen in years, or just because you've been married for 25 years and feel like celebrating your love. But maybe you want to do something small and intimate, and to have the people who have meant the most to you close at hand. You and your spouse should be in agreement about what kind of a celebration you want before you begin.

, A vow renewal ceremony can cost just as much as the first wedding, if not more, depending on its extravagance. Much of the cost will be from the food and alcohol served at the reception, if you choose to have one, so keep this in mind when planning. You should not only decide how much you'll spend, but what kind of an affair it'll be. You can invite a ton of guests to a big backyard gathering, or to an elegant evening in a reception hall. You can splurge on fancy cocktails and nice attire, or you can keep things a bit more casual. You can also fall somewhere in between.

, Pick a place that's large enough to hold your guests and which gives off the impression you are going for. If you plan on a large celebration, then you should plan for it at least a year to six months in advance, so that everyone you want to be there has time to make travel arrangements and does not make conflicting plans. This will also give you more freedom to select a venue, as many venues get booked fast.


If you only plan on having a smaller celebration, however, you might be able to book your venue less than six months in advance. An earlier reservation will always be your safest bet, though.
Don't limit yourself to traditional venues if you're not a traditional couple. In addition to churches and reception halls, you can also renew your vows on a beach or on a mountain top -- anywhere that is special for you and your spouse. Pick out a location that means something to the both of you and try to go from there.
When picking your venue, also keep your guests in mind. If an exotic destination is more important to you than the number of guests showing up, it might work out--but generally, if you want plenty of people to come, you'll need to choose a venue a bit closer to home.

, Depending upon how formal your vow renewal will be, a woman may want a traditional wedding dress. You could also opt for a party dress in one of your wedding colors. Since this is not your first wedding, etiquette dictates that you don't have to wear white if you don't want to--some even believe that you should avoid a pure white gown altogether. The veil is also optional.


You can even consider wearing your original wedding dress, if it still fits.
Since many men rent their tuxedos instead of buying them, the groom probably won't have the option of wearing his original ensemble. He could rent a similar style of tuxedo if you're planning a ceremony similar to your first, or he could rent a lower-key suit instead. If your husband is in the military, he can wear his uniform.
You can also give each other gifts, such as jewelry or cufflinks, to wear on the big day.

, Now that you've secured your date, you should let your close friends and family members know when it is before you send out the invites. Then, you've to plan all of the little things. Get quotes from vendors and start putting down deposits. You may need a caterer, bartender, musicians, a DJ, flower arrangements, decorations, a photographer, favors, a cake and invitations.


You'll need an officiant of some sort, but since you are already married, you don't need to find someone legally permitted to perform a wedding. You may choose to have your clergyman do the ceremony, or a close friend or family member. You can even have someone from the original bridal party do it. If you have grown children, having one of them officiate the wedding can add a nice touch.
You can decide whether you want a tiered cake. Some people think this isn't necessary for a renewal of vows, but if you have your heart set on it, don't that stop you. If you didn't get to have a tiered cake the first time around, that gives you all the more reason to have one now!
Though it would be a nice touch to have some of the same things at your renewal as you had in your wedding, such as a similar floral arrangement or having your first dance to the same song, make sure that you find a way to make your renewal different from your ceremony. After all, you and your spouse are in a different stage of life, and it's important to commemorate that.

, This could be as short or long as you would like, taking your budget into consideration. You'll also need to make a list of who you would like in your wedding party, if you will have one. Some couples choose to walk down the aisle together and not have a wedding party, while others want their original bridesmaids and groomsmen to be involved. Many people choose to incorporate their kids or grandchildren into the ceremony as well.


Remember that, the first time around, if you had bridesmaids and groomsmen, that they were officially there to serve as witnesses. You don't need them this time around because the ceremony isn't an official or legal matter, and you don't need more witnesses. However, you can have them up there with you, or just invite them, to show that they have been and still are an important part of your lives and your relationship.

, Your invitations should make it clear that you're having a renewal/reaffirmation ceremony. While your original ceremony might have been hosted by your parents, this time, your parents' names should not appear on the invitation. You should host your own party, or have it hosted by your children. Make sure to send the invites at least two months in advance, so your guests have time to respond and make travel arrangements. Here are some examples of what your invitations can say:


If you're hosting it yourself, you can say something like, ""The honor of your presence is requested at the reaffirmation of the wedding vows of Mr. and Mrs. Steven Jones ."" You can follow this by specific information about the party.
If your children are hosting the renewal, then you can say, ""The children of Mr. and Mrs. Jonathan Smith request the honor of your presence at the reaffirmation ceremony of their parents,"" followed by more information about the affair.

, This time around, you should host your own reception and ceremony. While in the past, your parents or close loved ones might have given you financial backing, you'll have to fend for yourselves, for the most part. However, there can be exceptions made if you're having your vow renewals close to your original wedding date and never got to have a party.

, Most people believe you shouldn't have a gift registry when you renew your vows. The first time around, your guests could have helped you get a new set of dishware, pay for your honeymoon, or just to have some money to start your new lives together. This time, it can be considered tacky to ask your guests for gifts when you're already an established married couple. But again, if your renewal date is close to your wedding date, then you can consider having a registry if you really need one.

The same goes for a bridal shower -- since you're already married, this is generally not thought to be appropriate.

, Many men and women who have a vow renewal close to their wedding date who never got to have a bachelorette party want to have one. However, many people don't consider this a good idea because these parties are supposed to be your ""last night out as a single person."" Since you're already married, you may have missed the boat for this one. You can still celebrate with a group of your friends, but hold off on the more risque aspects of a traditional bachelor/bachelorette celebration.

On a similar note, skip the garter toss and the bouquet toss at your reception since these traditions are heavily associated with the idea of recently ending your time as single people. Instead, consider leading the guests in a variety of fun dances to remove some of the formality.

, You don't have to do this but this is a vow renewal ceremony, with the focus on your continued love for your spouse, so writing your own vows is a nice touch. If your officiant is a clergyman, ask if you can write something to say in addition to the traditional ceremony readings. If your officiant is a friend or family member, you will need to figure out what he will say as well, since he will have no experience in leading this kind of ceremony.


You can say anything at all in your vows, but you should focus on the positives and the future ahead, instead of bringing up the hardships you've overcome. You can touch on those, but it's best to keep things positive.
You also don't have to write your own. You can have the officiant say whatever you want him to say, and to reaffirm your love that way. He can ask questions like, ""Steve, will you continue to have Amy as your wife and to continue your happy and loving marriage?"" You and your spouse will answer, ""I will,"" and that will already reaffirm your commitment to one another.

, You have several options since this is not a regular wedding service. You could both walk down the aisle with your children in tow, or the wife could walk to her husband alone, putting all the attention on her. You can exchange new rings or give each other your old rings to symbolize a renewed faith in your marriage. Family members may do some readings in your honor. Many people don't think anyone should walk down the aisle alone; walking with your husband or children can add a special touch to the ceremony.


You can also use this as an excuse to update your wedding bands. Maybe you've wanted to get new ones, or nicer ones for a long time, and this can be the perfect occasion. If you don't want new bands and love them the way they are, then you can engrave something special on them, if you like.
Though you don't need witnesses this time around, you can have your original bridal party standing up there with you for sentimental reasons.

, This could be a small gathering at someone's home or a large party in a reception hall. You have many options here as well. Have a first dance between you and your spouse to your favorite song and don't make a big deal out of the father-daughter dance. You don't have to have an elaborate cake cutting ritual but serve cupcakes instead; you could also have on display a cake modeled after your original one. Ask a couple of people to have toasts prepared in honor of your lasting love but give a toast or two yourself.


You can also bring your original wedding album or have photos of your original wedding available so that your guests can reminisce about your wedding. If you were married not long before the renewal, you can have some photographs that commemorated the event handy.
Give toasts to the important guests and tell everyone how much they have meant to you over the years. You will get toasted to many times in return!
Though everyone has an opinion about how your wedding renewal ceremony and reception should be done, at the end of the day, you should remember that it's your party and your day, and that you shouldn't let other people discourage you from celebrating your love the way you want to celebrate it.

, If the couple enjoys travel, you may throw them a bon voyage themed shower. This may be a good option if the couple has a honeymoon planned in a far away destination.

You can also have them bring a light beverage or drink for the party that everyone can sip while they play garden themed games.

, You may work with the bride and groom to create the guest list or make the guest list on your own. Make sure you invite everyone in the bridal party on both sides of the aisle as well as the friends and family of the bride and groom.You may have a limit on the number of people you invite, based on the size of the space available for the shower. Start with a long list and cut the list down until you hit the maximum number of guests you can accommodate.

, To ensure you can afford the shower, make a budget. Determine if you will be paying for the shower on your own or as part of the overall wedding budget. You may pool your money with the bridal party to pay for the shower. Often, bridal showers are low key and do not cost nearly as much as the actual wedding.


You may factor in the rental of the shower space, if applicable, as well as the shower supplies, such as decorations and food costs.
You may have a cap on how much you can spend on the couples shower and work to fall within your budget when shopping for the supplies for the shower.

, Make a list of items you will need to decorate the space for the shower. This may include decorations for the walls or for the guest tables as well as seating and tables for the guest.

Then, determine how much you can afford to spend on the supplies based on your budget and cut down the list as needed.

, Send out invitations for the shower at least two to three weeks before the shower date. The earlier you can send out the invitations, the better, especially if you have a lot of people on the guest list for the shower. Try to send invitations to guests who are out of town or who may have to fly into to attend the shower, as they may need more notice to plan their travels.


You may create the shower invitations online using an online shower design site, or make them on your home computer.
You can also order invitations through an online service.

, To ensure the shower runs smoothly, draw up a rough schedule for the shower so you are organized. Break down the shower by hour and block off time for each activity. Keep the schedule on hand during the shower so you stay organized and the shower runs smoothly.


For example, you may start the shower with a get to know you activity, followed by toasts for the bride and groom, and then the opening of the shower gifts. You may then end the shower with a final activity and the distribution of the goodie bags.

, Reduce stress on shower day by setting up the space early. Ask people in the wedding party to help you set up. Delegate tasks to others so the space is ready for the shower before the guests arrive.For example, you may have a few people tackle putting up the decorations while someone else prepares the snacks and drinks.

, It is traditional that the host or hostess gives a toast during the shower. You may have one toast for the groom and one toast for the bride, or do a couples toast. You can also do a roast of the bride and the groom as part of the toast, especially if they are fun-loving and good humored.You may also ask certain guests to give toasts during the shower, such as short anecdotes about the bride or the groom.
The shower is also a good opportunity for those who are not doing toasts at the rehearsal dinner or the wedding to get their moment at the podium during the shower.

, Have games ready so everyone has something to do and can interact with each other. You may set up a games area outdoors so everyone can try different games. Or you may announce games time during the shower and instruct everyone on which games will be played.Easy, fun games like charades are often fun. You may organize teams based on the bride’s side and the groom’s side of the wedding party.
You can also organize games that fit the theme of the shower, such as lawn bowling for a garden party theme or a sports trivia guessing game for a sports theme.

, Usually at bridal showers, there is time set aside for opening gifts. Have the couple open the shower gifts together as part of the shower. Arrange a table and chairs for the bride and groom so they can open each gift in front of everyone.You may organize the gifts based on whether they are for the bride or the groom. Or you may put joint gifts together so the couple can open them together.

, Often at the end of bridal showers, it is tradition to hand out keepsakes or goodie bags. You may create keepsakes that recognize the couple and that include both the bride and the groom. Or you may make goodie bags to reflect the couple, rather than just the bride or the groom.For example, you may get custom sugar cookies made with the names of the bride and groom for the goodie bags. Or you may design t-shirts or mugs with the couples’ faces on them as keepsakes from the shower for the guests.

, Butterflies are sold by the dozen and a good release usually consists of between 3-6 dozen. Monarchs are the most-requested butterfly, but other species are available at different times of the year.

, There are two ways to release butterflies: (1) individually, where the butterflies are packed securely in small glassine envelopes, and are distributed to your guests. At the appropriate time, the envelopes are opened and the butterflies fly out. (2) in a mass release cage, where the butterflies are transferred into a see-through container, where they flit and flutter before the couple removes the top and the butterflies fly out. Instructions are included for how to transfer the butterflies from their envelopes to the cage. *It's not difficult!

, Someone needs to be at home when the package arrives. All that is needed is for you to open the Styrofoam cooler and replace the cold pack at the bottom with another frozen one that you already have. You may also use a box of frozen vegetables. Butterflies need heat and light to fly, so while they are in the cooler they are inactive and resting. One and one-half hours before the release, remove the butterfly envelopes and allow them to warm up at room temperature. This ensures that they will be ready to take flight and put on a fantastic show.

Shop around for a good deal.,
Purchase your cake from an amateur baker.,
Bake your own cake.",How to Save Money on Your Wedding Cake1," Don't just settle with the first cake or bakery you see. Have a look at different places locally or online. After all, there could be an equally good or even better bakery just around the corner for a cheaper price. Remember, more expensive doesn't necessarily mean better.


Don't be afraid to try somewhere new that you don't know. Newer bakeries usually have good offers as they are trying to attract more customers.

, Instead of going to a bakery, purchase your wedding cake from someone who bakes cake as a hobby. They are equally talented and will charge less than a fancier bakery.You can also use a baker who does not necessarily specialize in wedding cakes. Visit your local bakery and ask if the baker makes wedding cakes.Keep in mind that you may have fewer design options when using an amateur baker or a baker that does not typically make wedding cakes.
You can also ask your caterer if a cake can be included in your package. The cost may be lower than ordering your cake through a separate bakery.

, If you, your family, or your friends are good at baking, consider baking the cake on your own. If you are baking the cake yourself, look for recipes that freeze well so you can bake the cake ahead of time.If a friend or family member is baking the cake, ask them to make your cake at a discount or even better, it could be their wedding gift to you.


It is a risk using an inexperienced baker. You should do a trial run before the wedding. The test cake should be the exactly like your real wedding cake.If you go the do-it-yourself route, have a backup plan just in case.

Consider the bridesmaids’ perspectives.,
Ask a neutral bridesmaid for help.,
Don’t talk negatively about the bridesmaid in question.",How to Stop One Bridesmaid from Stressing Out the Others1," Present the issue to them individually and ask each one how they feel about the situation privately. Each bridesmaid will have a different perspective. The different perspectives will help you see the issue more clearly and may help you decide how to resolve the dilemma.For example, say, “It has been brought to my attention that some bridesmaids are having issues with one of the bridesmaid. How do you feel about the situation? Are you having issues with any bridesmaids? If not, what do you think the best solution would be?”
Or, ""One bridesmaid has been complaining about the dress and how expensive it is. I have no problem changing the dress, but I wanted to get everyone's opinion first before I make a decision. How do you feel about the dress?"";
, This could be your maid of honor or a bridesmaid that stands neutral on the issue. Ask the neutral person to step in whenever they see a situation escalating into a problem. Tell her to remind them that the wedding is not about them but the bride.You can say, for example, ""You have been such a great sport throughout this whole process! However, some bridesmaids are still having issues with the decision making process. Would it be too much trouble if I asked you to step in if a situation becomes too tense? I would really appreciate it! Just remind them to put their differences aside and to focus on the task at hand.""

, Always talk about your bridesmaids in a positive manner. Even if one of them comes to you with a problem about another, try to remind her that you chose all of your bridesmaids for a reason: because they are your closest friends.For example, say, “I know that Tiffany can be a little controlling at times, but just like you, she is a really close friend. I will talk with her and hopefully we can work something out. And thank you for coming to me about the problem. I really appreciate it and I am grateful that you are a part of my bridal party.”
You could also say, ""I know that Jessica can be hard to get a long with, but she is one of my close friends, just like you are. Can you try to put your differences aside until the wedding is over? I would really appreciate it. I will talk to her, too.""

Acrylic photo frames for photo booth pictures
Magnets or coasters with your engagement photo
Customized golf balls
Small plant
Jar or popcorn or candy with a ribbonMini champagne or wine bottles
Birdseed feeder;
, Baked goods and sweets are a very personal way to let guests remember your wedding. They also won’t break your budget because you can buy inexpensive ingredients in bulk. Use old family recipes or try something that reflects the backgrounds of you and your fiancé(e). Decorate your sweets with your initials or in your wedding colors for some extra flair. Some budget-friendly, easy sweets you can make for your guests include:Cookies
Pastries
Mini cakes or breadsCaramel applesChocolates

, Use your wedding location or where you and your fiancé(e) are from for inspiration. Give guests a small sample of regional foods or other local products. Ask if companies have or will make smaller or sample sizes of products to help you stay within your budget. Remember even something like a couple of hand-made local chocolates can have a big impact. Some other examples of budget-friendly local gifts you could give include:Spice mixes
Jams, jellies, or sauces
Locally brewed beer or coffee
Pottery
Small book of local recipes

, Gift your guests with a votive and candle combination. Select color combinations or designs that reflect your wedding themes, location, or personalities. Keep the candles as simple as possible to keep costs down.

It will also last for a long time.Personalize the candles with handwritten tags or ribbons. These are inexpensive ways to jazz up a candle even more.

, Put together a CD of your wedding or favorite songs.

Easy ways to inexpensively personalize the packaging of your favors include:Colorful boxes or cellophane wrapping
Ribbons
Hand-written tags

, Look at the budget for the total cost of your wedding. Set aside about 2-3% of this total for favors. Use a portion of any “just-in-case” fund if you need more favors or run into trouble.Budget for individual items if you are not purchasing pre-made favors. Remember that these costs can add up quickly. For example, for a jazzy jar of popcorn, you may need popcorn seeds, jars, lids, ribbon and tags for the special message.
Adjust your budget as needed. A formal wedding may require favors that are more elaborate and expensive.

, Look at your total numbers on your guest list. Separate the totals into local and out of town guests. Expect that about 85% of local guests will attend, while 55% of out-of-towners will come.Include guests’ plus-ones or children in your guest tally.

If you are giving favors that have breakable pieces, recognize that some of these may break in transport, too., Before you order or make your favors, review your RSVP list. This can help you figure out if you need to adjust your original calculations. Make sure to add a few extra “just-in-case” favors to your final total.Calculate 10 extra favors per 100 guests., Many couples have a special theme for their weddings such as rustic country, city glam, or beach. Consider your themes and personalities when deciding on your guests’ favors. Giving favors in your colors is another option if you don’t have a theme., Online retailers or wholesalers may have lower price points than stores you can visit. They may also have more of a selection. Talk to different distributors and/or review online prices for potential favors. Seeing the various prices can help you to narrow down what favors work best with your budget.Talk to a sales representative when comparing prices. Explain that you are buying a larger quantity of favors for your wedding. The vendor might be willing to work with you and offer special pricing. Consider local businesses, which may also give you special prices. Say that you’d like to keep your business local by purchasing favors from them instead of a larger retailer.
Buy items you know will always be in stock or you can get quickly. For example, small jars are something most stores sell, but it may be more difficult to order personalized magnets on time., Give yourself a week or two to decide on which favors you like best and fit within your budget. This can minimize the risk of a rash decision that you might regret by the time of your wedding. It can also help you from giving favors that aren’t budget-friendly.Remember that your favors should reflect you and your wedding., If you can’t decide on just one favor, consider giving several different types that reflect your wedding. This can ensure that every guest gets something they like.For example, you could offer three different types of candy in small jars. Let guests choose between a small jar of popcorn or a small succulent plant.
Keep your overall favor total in mind. Figure out how many options you would like to give and then divide this number by the total. This way, you don’t order too many favors and stay within your budget.

, Order one or two of the favors you plan to give before you buy them in bulk. This can ensure that your favors are exactly what you want and minimizes the risk of things such spelling mistakes. It also helps you determine how easily you can assemble favors. Trying out favors can also keep you on budget by identifying potential problem spots or extras you may need to order.Check the store’s policies to ensure that you can return damaged or otherwise problematic merchandise.

, After you’ve had a chance to figure out what budget-friendly favors will work best for your wedding, place your order. Do this at least four weeks ahead of your wedding. This gives you time to correct any issues or assemble the favors yourself.It can also minimize the stress or added cost of unavailable, undelivered, or unassembled wedding favors., If you choose to assemble your own favors, opt for a simple project.

Spice blends in a small tin
S’mores or hot chocolate mix in a jar
Candy bar with different types of sweets

Jordan almonds wrapped in tulle with a pretty ribbonJar of local syrup, sauce, or oil with a personalized sticker of your names and wedding dateBalsam pine sachet

, One you’ve figured out what favor you would like to make, assemble one or two of your intended favors. This gives you an idea of how long it takes to assemble them and how easy it is. A test run can also help you figure out what changes you may need to make to your planned favor to keep it within your budget.Talk to your fiancé(e) about the favors to make sure you both like the assembled product.

, It can be time consuming and stressful to assemble favors. Turn it into a fun event by having an assembly party with your family or bridal party members. This can minimize your stress and help you save time before your big day. Make sure to offer your party guests food and beverages for helping you.Gather enough supplies so everyone can participate. These might include: scissors, hole punches, rulers, ribbons, and tags.

Bring the issue to her attention.,
Be assertive when expressing your feelings.,
Listen to her perspective.,
Give her a way out.",How to Stop One Bridesmaid from Stressing Out the Others2," Find a good time to bring up the issue. Ask the bridesmaid to get a cup of coffee with you, or to meet you at the park. When discussing the issue, use “I” statements instead of “you” statements. Also, try to be as positive as you can.For example, “One of the reasons why I wanted to meet with you is to discuss a small issue that has come up with the other bridesmaids. Although your input is invaluable, I think that including the opinions of the other bridesmaids a little bit more would help to reduce any tension between you and the other bridesmaids.”

, Don't be afraid to let the bridesmaid know that the issue is affecting you and the rest of the bridal party. Let her know that as a bridesmaid and as a friend, you expect her to put her personal issues aside.You can tell her, ""You are a great party planner. It's one of the reasons why I picked you to be a part of my bridal party. However some of the bridesmaids have complained that they don't feel like their opinions are being heard. If you could include their opinions more, I would really appreciate it! This way, I can focus more on wedding planning and less on trying to resolve bridesmaid issues.""

, After stating the issue, ask her about her perspective. She could be oblivious to the problem, or there may be another issue that is causing her behavior. Whatever the problem is, listen to what she has to say and try to fully understand her perspective as well. If she has any issues of her own, let her know that you will talk with the other bridesmaids about it.For example, “I totally understand where you are coming from. I will talk with the other bridesmaids about the issue. In the mean time, I just want you to relax and I want you to know that I am grateful that you are a part of my bridal party.”

, If you see that the responsibilities that come with being a bridesmaid are weighing on your friend, let her know that it is ok if she needs to step down. Let her know that stepping down won’t change anything about your friendship and how you feel about her as a friend.You can say, for example, “I know that being a bridesmaid comes with a lot of responsibility, and I understand if you do not have the time to deal with it. It is completely ok with me if you decide to step down. It won’t change anything about our friendship.”

Schedule a wine tasting at a local winery.,
Have a movie night.",How to Stop One Bridesmaid from Stressing Out the Others3," This is a great way to introduce your bridesmaids to each other if they are not all friends.

Avoid stimulants like caffeine.,
Eat fewer sugary foods.,
Eat foods without artificial coloring and additives.,
Consume foods high in omega-3 fatty acids.,
Stop smoking.,
Talk to a nutritionist.",How to Stop Being Hyper1," If you find that you have too much energy during the day, you may be consuming some form of a stimulant.


Try to reduce your coffee intake. This is the most popular stimulant used by adults. You may think that you need your morning coffee in order to power through the day. Chances are, if you feel really hyper throughout the day, you may be overloading. Try cutting back on your coffee. Go from 3 to 2 cups a day and see if there is a change. If you are more of a tea drinker, do the same for tea.Caffeinated sodas can also be the culprit. Reduce the amount of soda you drink in a day. Drink water instead.
Eat less chocolate. Just like with coffees, teas, and sodas, chocolate won’t necessarily lead to hyperactivity, but it can certainly give you a rush of energy that may be interpreted as such. ;
, The primary concern with sugars is that they get into your bloodstream quickly. So if you eat a lot of sugary foods, you are constantly feeding your body a source of quick-burning energy. If you normally get really hyper after lunch, reduce the amount of sugar you take in at lunch. See if this helps., Many parents and medical practitioners agree that lab created colors and additives may lead to slightly higher levels of hyperactivity in children.


There is no definitive study that points to artificial coloring or additives as a cause of hyperactivity. Studies that do exist rely on subjective findings, in part, because they have to rely on parents to describe the changes in their own children. Other opponents point to the fact that most food items with artificial ingredients are also loaded down with sugar. The stimulant sugar may be the cause of the increased hyperactivity., Eat a lot of fish, like salmon and tuna. Many leafy green vegetables also contain fatty acids.These fatty acids facilitate the transfer of neurotransmitters in the brain. When your neurotransmitters function improperly, it can cause hyperactivity and loss of concentration. Oftentimes, omega-3 fatty acid deficiency and ADHD are mistaken for one another. Since your body cannot create these fatty acids, it is necessary for you to include them in your diet. , Since nicotine is a stimulant, you may be getting an unneeded energy boost during your smoke breaks. Try skipping cigarette breaks at points in the day when you might otherwise feel hyper., If the above steps don’t help to alleviate hyperactivity, see a nutritionist. They can examine your particular diet and then suggest specific alterations to help your hyperactivity, energy crises.

Get active and exercise.,
Fidget.,
Take up hobbies that require movement.,
Exercise your brain.",How to Stop Being Hyper2," Hyperactivity comes from an excess amount of energy. Put that energy to good use by exercising. You don’t need to go to the gym.


Make exercise a part of your everyday routine. Join a gym. Get out and run in your neighborhood. Or even just incorporate walks into your daily routine. If you live close enough to work, try walking instead of driving. If you take the necessary steps to burn excess energy on a regular basis, you won't have to worry about bouts of hyperactivity.
If you feel yourself getting hyper before a big meeting, try running in place for a minute — long enough to use up some energy, but not long enough to look sweaty.
Watch less TV. Most of the time, hyperactivity can be the result of too much downtime. Sitting and watching TV for extended periods of time means that your body is not burning very much energy. If you find that you feel hyper after watching TV, try reducing the time you watch or watch TV is short bursts rather than long stretches of time., Most often fidgeting appears as a sign of hyperactivity, but it is actually just the body trying to burn off excess energy. Since fidgeting is often involuntary, try to find a voluntary and fun way of fidgeting. Many people like to drum with their hands and feet. Try repeating small, nearly unnoticeable movements at home or at work, when you are feeling hyper.Whether you are and adult or a child, strategic ""fidgeting"" is a great way to burn energy.

, There are many hobbies that you might try. Play sports. Learn any dance that requires you to move a lot. Alternatively, you might learn a craft or a trade. Work with wood, brick, or some other building material that requires you to lift heavy materials. They key is to burn energy. If you learn something or are left with a product afterwards, you’ll be more likely to stick with it.

, You can burn off excess energy with your brain too. Try activities that strain your brain like puzzles. Plan out your weekend in great detail. Focus on complex problems. Know that sometimes hyperactivity is just a sign of boredom.

Introduce relaxing elements into your home or work space.,
Meditate to reduce stress.,
Go outside.,
Reduce distractions.",How to Stop Being Hyper3," Many people think that hyperactivity is caused by the busy and stressful spaces.


If you can, include calming colors in your home or workspace. Paint walls serene blues, violets, and greens. Avoid harsh colors like reds, oranges, and yellows., If hyperactivity is partly the result of stress, there is no better way to reduce stress than through meditation. Take a moment to just sit in one place. Don't think about your problems or goals for the day. Just take a moment for yourself. Meditation has been proven to reduce blood pressure, which can reduce your hyperactivity., Sometimes hyperactivity can be the result of anxiety. Maybe you’ve been in the same room for too long. Going outside for just 20 minutes is enough to rejuvenate you., Hyperactivity is often the result of visual or auditory distractions. You may seem to be hyper, but it is just your brain jumping from stimuli to stimuli.


Visual stimulation can exacerbate hyperactivity and concentration as well. Try placing your body in positions that reduce visual stimuli. Organize your workspace in a way that reduces your line of sight. Face the wall.Use large dividers to block your sight, almost like a jockey uses blinders on a horse to keep them from becoming distracted during a race.
Sounds can be very distracting. Maybe coworkers chatting next to a water cooler catches your attention and then it is difficult to return to the task at hand. Find ways of reducing noise distractions like using noise canceling headphones. If you can control what produces the sound (i.e. like your cellphone, speakers, …etc.), turn them off ahead of time.
You may consider using relaxing sounds to replace more distracting ones. Play soft music, like classical in the background. Keep in mind that calming music might not be the kind of music you prefer normally. A lot of music is designed for movement like dancing. You want music that will encourage you to stay still, calm, and relaxed.

Determine whether or not you should see a professional.,
Consider seeing a counselor or therapist.,
See a doctor.",How to Stop Being Hyper4," If nothing seems to help with your hyperactivity, you might consider seeing a doctor.


If you suspect that you have ADHD, bipolar disorder, or something else more complex than just hyperactivity, speak to a specialist.

, Sometimes, it helps to talk about your hyperactivity. People trained in the treatment of hyperactivity will be able to advise you further.


They may suggest stress reducing techniques like: counting from 1 to 10, ""silent screaming"", or other activities that help reduce anxiety when hyperactivity gets in the way of daily life.
Counselors or therapists will also be able to advise you on whether or not to seek prescription help for you hyperactivity., If nothing else is helping enough, it's time to see a medical doctor. See a doctor, especially, if you have trouble concentrating at work, can't keep schedules, constantly forget things, and/or if the stress caused by these issues starts to feel difficult to deal with.


There is no verified test that proves whether you have ADHD or not. The doctor will most likely have you fill out surveys that will examine your behavior in the past and the present, identify situations where you felt too hyper, and take into account how your hyperactivity affects others.
Doctors will most likely advise sufferers to follow a ""multimodal"" plan. These plans use a variety of techniques to curb your hyperactivity. This includes various prescriptions for hyperactivity. The most common medication is Adderall. Doctors will most likely encourage you to seek out behavioral therapy as well."

Look into companies that offer wedding loans.",How to Split Your Child's Wedding Costs with Your Ex‐Spouse," The first time you contact your ex-spouse about this will set the tone for the entire conversation. Since you want this conversation to go well, keep all communication respectful and neutral. If you feel comfortable reaching out by phone, do it. Send them an email beforehand letting them know. Tell them the day and time you want to call and ask if that works for them. If you’re uncomfortable or unsure about a phone call, contact them by email first and go from there.


Your initial email can say something like, “I would really like to speak to you about Daniel’s wedding. I was thinking of calling you on Tuesday evening at 8pm. Does that work for you? If not, please suggest another time.""
For good measure you could also add, ""If you prefer to communicate by email, I completely understand. I am open to your preference.”;
, Once the conversation begins, stay focused. Money is a sensitive issue, so keep your tone neutral and polite. Start off by saying how happy you are about your child’s wedding. Find a way to then tactfully ask your ex-spouse if they can contribute. Avoid making any demands.Phrase it as a question.


You could start off by saying, “I’m so thrilled that our child is getting married. I really want to give Sally the best wedding I can. I know you love her just as much as I do and you want her big day to be special, too.”
Then get right to the point by asking, “If you are open to it, I would really like to have a conversation about her wedding costs. Would you be able to contribute?”

, Dragging out your old issues will only serve to ruin a conversation that should be about your child.Do not bring up your past issues at all. If your ex tries to instigate an argument, do not react or take the bait – this is what your ex wants you to do.Instead, remind them in a neutral tone that the topic is your child’s wedding. Get back to the point immediately.


If things begin to escalate emotionally, step away from the computer to calm down. Don’t reply in anger.
If you’re on the phone and this happens, explain that you will contact your ex at another time. Conduct all future exchanges about the topic via email.

, If the conversation begins to derail, steer it immediately back to the real issue at hand – your child’s happiness. This is something that is important to both of you and it should come first. Remind your ex of this fact as calmly and often as necessary. A bitter conversation with your ex about their wedding will deeply affect your child when they find out about it.


You could say something like, ""This conversation is about Kelly and her wedding. It's not about us. I think it's important that we put our differences aside and focus on our child's happiness, don't you?""
For the sake of your child’s happiness, work hard to be patient with one another. Do your best to avoid creating any kind of negativity in connection with their wedding day., Talk to your child about their wedding plans before you speak to your ex. Get an idea of the total cost of the wedding – a ballpark figure is fine at this stage. Have a list of expenses that you can provide your former spouse, so that they can look it over themselves. Provide the total estimated amount to your ex and explain that, as of now, this is the figure you were given and that’s your goal.


Avoid immediately requesting a contribution amount – instead, get the other person involved. Make this a team effort.
You could start off by saying, ""I have a list of expenses for you to look at, along with an estimated total cost. What do you think of these numbers? Do you have any suggestions? Your input is important to me.""

, How you decide to split things up should be proportionate to your situations. For instance, if one of you is a doctor and the other an elementary school teacher, it’s unrealistic and unfair to expect both parties to contribute the same amount.


You don’t have to divulge your current financial situations to each other – that’s private information. Say something like, ""You don't have to tell me any details about your current financial situation, but please let me know if you're struggling in some way. We can figure this out together.""
Have your ex consider their situation and provide you with an estimated contribution amount. You will need to come up with your contribution amount, as well.

, After you’ve both put forward an amount that can be contributed, evaluate the situation as it currently stands. Do both contributions cover the full cost of the wedding? If you’re short of the goal, how short are you? Keep in mind that your child’s wedding should not put either of you at risk financially.If the amount is significant, there are additional options to consider to help cover the remainder. Let your ex know, ""We can make this work. Let's look at additional options together. I have a few ideas in mind. If you have any, please let me know.""
The process for covering wedding costs isn’t as rigid or traditional as it once was. Don't be afraid to explore other options.

, If your ex-spouse refuses to help, or if your combined efforts still don’t provide enough money to cover the wedding costs, you shouldn’t feel bad. Weddings are expensive and it’s rare to have one or two people covering the entire cost of a wedding these days. Contact the family of your child’s fiancé. Find out if they are able to help you close the gap.


Offer a few suggestions. You could say, ""My goal is to give the kids a wedding to remember. Here is the estimated cost so far. Can we explore ways to make this happen for them? I was thinking maybe the parents on both sides could split the expenses evenly. Do you have any thoughts or suggestions?""
Another option is suggesting that each family covers the cost for the amount of guests they plan to invite., Sit the couple down and explain to them what your combined contribution amount for the wedding is. You’ll need to assess how far from the original goal you are and have a serious discussion about ways to make the wedding more affordable. Say to the couple, “We both want to help you pay for your wedding. Combined we can contribute $XX,XXX to a wedding fund to help you cover the costs. Can we make this budget work?”Offer suggestions for scaling back costs. The number of guests can be limited, for instance. Even decreasing the guest list by 50 can help.
You could also make the reception less traditional. Instead of having a formal dinner, you could have a gorgeous brunch spread outdoors, for example. Limiting alcohol will also cut costs significantly., It’s not uncommon these days for the bride and groom to help cover wedding costs. Sit down with both of them and explain where you are with the financial situation. Discuss possibly dividing the expenses up evenly between the couple, the bride's family, and the groom's family. If that’s not possible, find out if they can make any contribution and, if so, what the amount would be.Sit your child down and say, ""We are exploring all options to cover your wedding costs. We have a lot of it covered already, but we haven't met the total goal. Can the two of you contribute anything?""
You could add, ""If you can't contribute much, that's ok. We are looking into other options. If you can contribute anything, let us know now so we'll know exactly how close to the goal we are.""

, If you decide there’s no way to cut back on costs, research wedding loans. There are companies that provide these loans services so that your child can have the wedding of their dreams. However, examine everything closely and read the fine print. Often these companies will charge an extremely high interest rate on the loan."

Follow the three-second rule.,
Stay focused on something else.,
Make eye contact.",How to Stop Ogling1," It’s natural to glance at people as they walk by you, and a quick glance is usually okay. But if you find yourself looking for longer than 3 seconds, you’re ogling. If you have to, time yourself in your head. If you get to three, you’ve looked too long., Not everyone who ogles stares too long. If you know that you can check people out just with a quick flick of your eyes toward them, the three-second rule won’t work for you. Instead, try focusing on something else when you’re out. It could be the face of the person you’re with, your shoes, or even something that you wear on your wrist just so you can stare at it., If you feel your eyes beginning to wander and you know you're about to ogle, make eye contact with the person instead. This is a much more common, and less uncomfortable, occurrence. If they look back, simply give them a small smile. It will make you seem friendly, instead of predatory."
"
Avoid hurting the feelings of people you love.,
Be more considerate of those around you.,
Take the feelings of the person you're ogling into account.",How to Stop Ogling2," Ogling other people can be very hurtful to your romantic partner. It can make them feel inadequate or insecure about your relationship. It can also make them feel as you don't love them. If you feel yourself beginning to ogle someone, consider how your partner will feel, whether they're there or not., Ogling can be embarrassing and hurtful not only to your romantic partner, but to other people around you, especially if your ogling is noticeable. If you find it hard to stop ogling for yourself, try doing it for the people around you who might feel uncomfortable about it., To you, the people you ogle might just seem like something to look at, but they're real people with feelings. Being ogled by you can make them feel objectified and therefore uncomfortable or even unsafe. If you begin to ogle someone, consider how it makes them feel."
"
Make an if-then plan.,
Ask someone to hold you accountable.,
Consider seeing a counselor.",How to Stop Ogling3," An ""if-then"" plan means using an ""if-then"" phrase to help you break a bad habit. Someone who drinks too much when out with friends might say ""If my friends ask me if I want a drink, then I'll say I'm only drinking water."" Make your own ""if-then"" plan for ogling, deciding ahead of time what you'll do if you realize you're ogling people as they walk by.For example, you might decide that if you start to ogle, then you'll get out your phone instead. Or if you start to ogle, then you'll strike up a conversation with the person with you.

, Ogling can be a hard habit to break because it's easy to do without anyone noticing. Ask someone you spend a lot of time with to hold you accountable. They can watch you to see if you're ogling and point it out when you are. Having someone else hold you accountable can help you recognize the habit and break it.You might want to come up with a code word or signal for when your friend needs to point out your ogling. Just saying, ""Stop ogling that person!"" can be embarrassing in public. Instead, agree on a phrase that's code for ""Stop ogling,"" like, ""There's going to be rain later.""

, This can be really helpful if you really can’t stop ogling other people no matter how hard you try. A counselor can help you the underlying issues that are causing you to ogle.To find a counselor, check your insurance company’s website – you should be able to find doctors listed there who are covered by your insurance.
If you don’t have insurance, your city or county might have free clinics. If you’re a university student, the use of their counseling services are usually included in the tuition and fees you pay.

Recognize that it’s a habit.,
Stop habits that feed into ogling.,
Be patient.",How to Stop Ogling4," The urge to ogle isn’t a force of nature you can’t fight. It can feel that way because the invitation to look at other people is so ingrained in the movies, tv shows, and magazines that are available. But the sooner you acknowledge that ogling is something you can stop doing, the sooner you can work to not do it!, This includes looking at magazines, watching movies and TV shows, etc, for the sole purpose of ogling the people you see there. If you’re doing it at home/from afar, you’re more likely to do it in person, too., Breaking bad habits can take up to 28 days. If you falter while you're trying to break the habit, don't get too down on yourself. Keep trying, and you just might be able to break the habit."

Give your child affection as a reward.,
Spend extra, quality time with your child.,
Reward your child with a special outing or activity.,
Allow your child to spend time with their friends as a reward.",How to Reward Your Child for Good Behavior1," Using affection as a reward can be an effective way to let your child know you approve of their behavior. You may give your child a high five, a pat on the back, arm or shoulder, or a big smile. You can also display other forms of affection, like hugs or kisses.The benefit of using affection as a reward is that it is free and immediate, so you can use it as a reward as soon as your child does something good. Displaying affection toward your child can also help them get used to displaying affection in public and get comfortable with being social and affectionate with others.;
, You can also reward you child’s good behavior by spending extra time with your child. This could be an additional five to ten minutes of reading time before bed or extra time together after school doing an activity your child enjoys, such as playing a certain board game. Using quality time as a form of reward can also allow you to create stronger social bonds with your child.For example, your child may love to spend time with you in the kitchen. You may then reward their good behavior by allowing them to help you prepare a batch of cookies or add decorations to a cake. This will allow you both to spend quality time together and create something you can both enjoy.

, Maybe your child enjoys going to a park near your home or maybe your child can not get enough of a play zone at the mall. If you child is on good behavior, you may reward them with a special outing to their favorite place or the opportunity to do a favorite activity.For example, maybe your child enjoys going to the movies. You may then reward their good behavior by taking them to the latest movie for kids, a movie date for just the two of you.

, Your child may also respond well to getting free time as a reward, where they can hang out with their friends. This is a good reward for older children, as it will allow your child to connect socially with others.You may set a time limit for this reward, such as giving your child one extra hour of play time at a friend’s house or allow your child to sleep over for one night at a friend’s house. This way, you still have control of the reward but your child is still able to benefit from it.

Remain calm.,
Respond quickly and simply.,
Acknowledge your child’s feelings.,
Back up your words with actions.",How to Stop Aggressive Toddler Behavior1," If your child is acting out in an aggressive way, stay calm. Don’t get angry, yell, or act in an aggressive way to the child. Remaining calm will help your child calm more quickly. If you get upset, that will feed your child’s aggression and make things worse.Your child relies on you for stability, especially when they are upset. Often, the child is aggressive because they are upset or feel out of control. Staying calm will help communicate to your child everything is okay.
To stay calm, take a few deep breaths. Inhale and count to 10 before responding. Remind yourself that your child is learning how to control their emotions.;
, When your child acts out, don’t respond in a dramatic or over-the-top way. Don’t give your child too much attention when they act aggressively.This may feed into your child’s aggression and emotions. Instead, respond quickly and efficiently. Keep your words straight to the point, and try to redirect your child’s actions. If that doesn’t work, take them away from the situation.Trying to talk to your child and giving them a lot of attention if they are aggressive or throwing a tantrum may reinforce negative behavior.
For example, if your child is biting another child, say in a firm tone, “No, you don’t bite people. Biting hurts.”
Toddlers will probably hit, bite, or act out multiple times, so remember to repeat your point over and over until they understand.
To redirect your child, after you have corrected the behavior, try saying, ""Why don't we go down the slide?"" or, ""Pick up your doll and let's continue playing.""

, Your child acts in an aggressive way because they are angry or upset about something. When they act in this manner, acknowledge their feelings; however, you should follow this up with how aggressive behavior is not an appropriate response to their feelings.For example, if your toddler gets angry, you can say, “I understand that you are angry because the other kid took your toy, but hitting someone is not okay;” or, “I know you are upset because we have to leave when you want to play, but you cannot kick and scream.”

, When you correct your toddler’s aggressive behavior, use an authoritative, strong tone. Sometimes, words may not be enough with a toddler. Use actions along with your words to get your point across.For example, when you tell your toddler to stop hitting or snatching, hold their arm in place to emphasize they aren’t supposed to use their hands.
Make sure to be firm and authoritative, but not angry or aggressive.
This may take many repetitions before your child corrects the behavior.

Allow your child to choose a special meal.,
Give your child useful items as rewards.,
Reward your child with items that relate to their favorite hobby or activity.,
Consider giving your child an allowance for good behavior.",How to Reward Your Child for Good Behavior2," You can reward your child using a material reward like food. But, rather than simply give your child their favorite food, you may give them the opportunity to choose a special meal that you can enjoy together. This could be a favorite meal of homemade spaghetti or a takeout meal. Your child will enjoy the feeling of responsibility that comes with choosing a special meal.Keep in mind there is some debate around using food as a form of material praise. Some child specialist argue that using food to praise your child can lead to an unhealthy relationship with food in the future and undermine your child’s healthy eating habits. Allowing your child to have a special, unhealthy meal can lead to confusion around when eating unhealthy food is appropriate. Your child may associate unhealthy food with good behavior and positive self-esteem.Though you can use food as a form of reward, try to use it sparingly. Often, social rewards and verbal praise can be more effective and healthy for your child than material rewards, like food.

, Material items can be used as rewards but you should be careful not to simply give your child toys. Instead, you may go for practical items like school supplies or items for your child's room. This way, your child can still reap the satisfaction of a material reward and get use out of it.


You may give your child pencils, pens, and notepads that they can use in school. Or, you may give your child stickers to decorate their notebooks and their lunch box. Your child may also have specific school supplies in mind, which you can then buy for them as a reward for good behavior.

, You should also try to go for material items that feel specific to your child’s interests. Think about material items that complement your child’s favorite activity or hobby. This will ensure your child gets use out of the material item and does not see it as just another toy or material item.For example, maybe your child is really into a certain video game. You may then get your child a video game made by the same company or designer, or a doll version of their favorite video game hero. If your child is into other hobbies, like painting, you may get them a set of paint brushes or a new canvas.

, An allowance is a good option for children once they reach four or five, as at this age children tend to be more aware of wants and needs. Giving your child an allowance is a good way to teach your child the value of money and how be responsible with money.You may start the allowance by giving your child a small amount of money based on how old they are, such as $1 for each year old. So, a seven year old would get $7 in allowance. The idea is to give your child enough allowance to get one or two things they want but not too much, as you want your child to decide what to spend their money on and to spend it wisely.
Start by giving your child real cash so they can hold the physical money and learn how to count it. Then, as they get older and hit adolescence, you can give them virtual money, which they can manage through an allowance App on their phone or on the computer. Once your child is a teenager, they may be ready for getting their allowance through a bank account.

Encourage your child to self-evaluate and self-assess.,
Use “I” statements when you praise your child.,
Focus on praising the behavior, not the child.",How to Reward Your Child for Good Behavior3," Rather than use standard words of praise like “Great job!”, “Good boy/good girl!” or “That’s right!”, you should try to get your child to evaluate themselves and their skills when you praise them. You may say, “You look like you enjoyed that!”, “I’m happy you did that, you look pleased with yourself!” or, “Did it feel good to do that?” Doing this will encourage your child to think about their own actions and decisions, rather than constantly seek your approval or validation. This will allow your child to feel empowered and see good behavior as a positive way to act.You may also ask your child questions as a form of praise to get them to self-evaluate. For example, you may ask, “How do you like your painting?” or “Are you happy with how that piece fits into the game?”
You should also try to encourage your child to reflect on their decisions and choices. You may ask, “How do you feel about the picture you drew?” or “Did you enjoy telling that story in class?” This will help to build your child’s self-esteem and strengthen your relationship with them.

, You should also try to always use “I” statements when you give your child verbal praise, as this will show your child you appreciate their actions. It will also make your praise specific and singular to your child. Your child can model their behavior on yours and also learn how to use “I” statements for themselves.For example, you may complement your child’s behavior by saying, “I love the colors you picked!” or “I really enjoyed how you performed that dance!”. Do this instead of saying “what a good dancer you are!” or “gosh, you’re a great dancer”. “I” statements will make your praise more specific to your child and show your child how you express your feelings and thoughts in a positive way.
You should also avoid generalizing statements like, “Good girl for sharing your pencils!” or “You are a good boy for staying quiet in class today.” Instead, you can say, “Thanks for sharing with your friend today, I think he appreciated it.”

, You should never say your child is “bad” or “good”, only that their behavior is “bad” or “good”. This will ensure your child does not associate your praise with themselves overall, and only to their behavior. Be specific and tell your child exactly how and why her behavior was good.For example, your child may have made you a birthday card. Rather than say, “What a great card you have made me!”, you should be specific and tell your child what elements you liked in the card. Maybe you complement their choice of color, their penmanship, or their sweet message inside the card.

Use a rewards chart.,
Use different forms of praise.,
Give younger children more immediate rewards.,
Set realistic, specific behavioral goals for your child.",How to Reward Your Child for Good Behavior4," Many parents use a rewards chart to let their child know how well they are behaving. Check off good behavior with smiley faces or plus signs. You may use stickers to track your child’s behavior, with gold stars for good behavior. Or, you may allow your child to create their own chart to then post on the refrigerator or the wall. This will allow your child to judge their own behavior on a daily basis.There has been some criticism of the use of a rewards chart to track a child’s behavior. Some studies have shown that offering up tangible rewards for behavior can actually make your child view good behavior as transactional. Your child may only be motivated to do well for a reward and get upset when they are not rewarded every time they act., You should try to use a variety of rewards for your child’s behavior, as kids get bored easily. If you use the same rewards every time, the reward may lose its power over time. You may give your child verbal praise for small acts of good behavior and then social or material rewards for larger acts of good behavior.If you have multiple children in one household, you should also use different rewards for each child. No two children are alike and each child may respond differently to different rewards. Try to fit the reward to the child’s personality and demeanor.

, Younger children respond well to smaller, more immediate rewards, such as verbal praise or a small material item, like a sticker or a small toy. Many children can start to understand the power of rewards by the age of three. You should focus on smaller, immediate rewards first and then shift your approach as your child gets older.Older children may respond better to more accumulative rewards, such as an allowance or extra time doing something they enjoy. Adolescents and teenagers also start to see the value in social rewards, such as quality time with friends or quality time with parents.

, You should also encourage your child to continue to display good behavior by establishing behavioral goals that are realistic and specific to your child. This will help your child to learn the value of good behavior and feel as though they can meet your expectations.For example, maybe you expect your child to help set the table for dinner every night. You may model this behavior by helping them set the table at first and then over time, give them the responsibility to do it on their own. You should then praise your child when they set the table without you asking, reinforcing their good behavior. This will allow you to set your child up to succeed and then praise them when they fulfill your reasonable expectations.

"
"
Set consistent consequences.,
Teach your child how to let out their feelings.,
Distract your child.,
Teach your child to use their words.,
Seek medical help.",How to Stop Aggressive Toddler Behavior2," One way to discourage aggressive behavior is to have clear, consistent consequences for aggressive actions. This helps the child learn that there are negative consequences if they do something. By not giving in to tantrums or negative behavior, you are not rewarding this destructive behavior.For example, if your child starts hitting you because you want to leave the park, don’t let them stay at the park to avoid a tantrum. Instead, take them home and take away a toy or give them another consequence. This will help them realize that throwing a tantrum and hitting doesn’t get them what they want.

, Aggressive behavior usually stems from a child’s inability to deal with their strong feelings and their lack of control. You can teach your child how to manage these emotions in a more constructive, healthy, non-aggressive way.For example, you can teach your child to punch a stuffed animal or bean bag instead of hitting a person when they are mad. You can tell them to rip paper or jump around. You may also tell them to go to their special place alone.

, One way to help manage aggressive behavior or a tantrum is to distract your child. When you distract your child, you interrupt their aggression with a completely different train of thought. This can help break the cycle of aggressive emotion.For example, you may start talking to your toddler about something they enjoy, suggest that you play a game, or give them a kiss.

, Many times, aggressive behavior in toddlers occurs because they are unable to communicate their frustration or anger. Help your children learn how to use their words. It may be something as simple as the word “no!” instead of hitting.Tell your child to say “no!” instead of hitting, biting, or yelling. You can also teach them to say things like, “Stop!”; or, “That hurts!”; or, “That’s mine!”

, If your child is extremely aggressive, you may need to take them to the pediatrician or a pediatric psychologist. This may happen if the aggression happens multiple times a day or every day, or if it lasts for multiple weeks. You may also consider it if none of the strategies you’ve used have helped.You may want to seek help if your child is causing physical harm to themselves or others, attacks you, other children, or other adults, or if you fear for others’ safety.

"
"
Try to anticipate the aggressive behavior.,
Prepare your child for change.,
Watch out for aggressive playing.,
Limit exposure to violence.",How to Stop Aggressive Toddler Behavior3," If you know what situations cause aggressive behavior in your child, you can be proactive in preventing the behavior. You can try to prepare the child for a new situation or let others around you know not to startle or upset your child until they are used to the situation.For example, if you are going to take your child to a group gathering, you may want to play pretend to help them get used to the group situation. Place a bunch of dolls or stuffed animals around and lead your toddler around as you introduce them to your child. Have your child pack a bag and pretend to be going away to grandma's for the weekend to get used to the idea of being away from you.
You may want to explain to the people at the gathering that they shouldn’t try to hug or touch your child until the child is familiar with them.

, If your child feels aggressive when their daily situations change, you should let them know the change is coming so it won’t be out of the blue. This helps mentally prepare the child for what is coming and reduce the aggressive behavior.If you know that you are going to have to go to the store soon and your child will have to stop playing, you should let them know. For example, you can say, “You can play for 10 more minutes, then we have to get ready to leave.”

, You should watch your child as they play for any aggressive behavior. Your child may be playing in an aggressive way, which may eventually become physical aggression. Tell your child not to play that way so that they know aggressive actions are not tolerated.For example, if your child has their dolls hitting each other, you may say, “Your dolls don’t hit each other. It’s not good to hit others.”
You may try suggesting a non-violent alternative. Say, “Dolls love and hug each other.”

, Letting your toddler witness violence may make them think it’s okay to be aggressive. This may be a problem if you have older children who watch certain movies or television shows or play video games. Be careful what toys you let your children play with. Consider limiting the amount of violent toys you let them have.Be careful which programs are on the television when your child is around. This includes movies, television shows, and even the news. Some cartoons are violent, so monitor what your child watches.
This includes violence between other members of the household. Seek help if you are concerned about violence in your home.

Figure out where the aggressive behavior occurs.,
Examine when the behavior happens.,
Decide if there is another factor.",How to Stop Aggressive Toddler Behavior4," If your toddler is acting aggressively, you should try to figure out where that behavior is happening. Make a mental list of where your child displays aggressive behavior. Does it happen in one setting or many settings?If the behavior is only happening in one place, like a store, try to figure out what triggers that behavior. There is something in the environment, like the noise, the amount of people, or even the lighting, that is causing the behavior.

, In addition to figuring out where it happens, think about when your toddler is aggressive. Certain times of the day or stressors may trigger aggressive behavior. Think about specific events that happen prior to the behavior. This may help you figure out what is causing the aggressive behavior.The behavior may happen when your child is tired, so right before nap time. It may happen during transition periods.
Your child may be aggressive right after someone does something they don't like, like you tell them to stop playing or someone takes something from them.
Being overstimulated is a common trigger for aggressive behavior or tantrums.

, There may be other reasons your child acts in an aggressive way. Maybe your child has experienced a major change that has upset them. The behavior may also be geared towards just one person or a group of people. Singling out the factors that are causing the aggression can help you deal with it.For example, your child may be upset because you just started back to work, their grandmother has moved away, or they’ve switched daycares. The child may be aggressive towards a particular person, like a person at daycare or a family member, or everyone.

Monitor the use of electronic devices.,
Learn about social media.,
Join their social networks.",How to Stop Your Child from Being a Cyberbully1," It is much easier to be a cyberbully if you know that no one is monitoring what sites you are on or what you are posting online. One way that you can stop your child from being a cyberbully is by limiting access to computers, tablets, phones, and other electronic devices.Have your kids use their devices when they are in common areas like the family room or around responsible adults.
Although your child may still be able to sneak and post a mean comment when your back is turned, they may be less likely to try cyberbullying if they know you can walk in and see what they are posting at any time.;
, The more you know about the various social networking sites and apps, the better you can monitor your child online.Having a general knowledge of how the sites work can help you stop your child from being a cyberbully.


Facebook allows users to post text comments, pictures, and videos. People can comment on the posts, indicate how they feel about the post using stickers, share them, or leave new posts on other’s pages.
On Twitter, users post text comments that are less than 140 characters. They can also post links to pictures and other media. You can like, comment on, or ‘retweet’ a tweet that you like.
Instagram is primarily image and video based. Users can like and comment on the content posted on Instagram.
Snapchat allows users to text and video message one another as well as post pictures and videos. The messages and posts only last for a set amount of time. Snapchat can also be used for making video and audio calls.
Texting and email also offer opportunities for cyberbullying. Kids can send hurtful messages, harmful photos, and other bullying messages via text or email.

, You can stop your child from being a cyberbully by friending, following, and liking them online. Your child may be less likely to engage in cyberbullying if they know that you can see what they are posting.


Connect with them on some of the more popular social networking sites like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, SnapChat, and Tumblr.
Ask your child if you can ‘friend’ them. If they don’t want to give you’re their profile information, they may have something to hide.
You don’t have to troll their online profiles, but every now and then you can check their page to see what they have been posting lately.

Save all of your receipts.",How to Stop Impulse Buying," It is important to understand the difference between compulsive buying and impulsive buying. The distinction between the two depends on the person’s motivation, or intent for making the purchase.


Someone who is a compulsive buyer is more likely to have financial issues than an impulsive buyer. They might also have relationship distress with family and friends, and emotional confusion. A compulsive buyer is at higher risk of addictive behaviors. These addictive behaviors include the motive to shop to soothe uncomfortable internal emotional feelings, stress, and anxiety.
An impulsive buyer is usually someone who buys things on a whim typically as a reaction to an external trigger. For example, you may see a desired item in a store window, and without thinking about your budget, you purchase it.;
, If you find something you want to buy in the moment, ask yourself some questions before you make the purchase. Taking some time before you run to the register can help you decide on whether you need that item or not.


Ask yourself, “Is this a want or a need? Can I afford it without any debt? Can it wait a month? Will it go on sale? Can I live without it? How will it affect my life?”, It’s easy to swipe a credit card, but parting with cash is a bit more difficult. People who pay in cash tend to spend less than those who use a credit card. Consider putting your credit cards away and moving to a cash-only system.Have cash budgets for each area you need like transportation, entertainment, and food. Put each week’s allotment in an envelope.
If you’re buying things online, use a debit card instead of a credit card.

, Create a mandatory waiting period before you make a purchase. Many stores will put items on hold so that you can go home and come back another day if you still want it. You may really like an item now, but not feel so strongly about it a different day. Creating a waiting period can help you decide whether you really need it or not.Some people choose to wait a week before going back and purchasing an item. If you choose to wait this long, it’s unlikely you will have the same feelings about the item that you did at first., If you’re quick to pick something off the shelf because it’s on sale, recognize that this is where most impulse shopping happens.If you’re enamored by a sale item, ask yourself what makes you want it. Is it because you actually want or need the item, or are you drawn in by the price or potential savings? Do you like the feeling of getting a bargain, even if you don’t need the item?


Sales don’t usually last only a day. Come back and buy the item a different day if you really want it.

, Know when to avoid going to the store or logging on to online shopping sites. If you’re feeling hungry, angry, lonely, or tired, don’t let yourself be tempted to shop. Recognize that you’re most vulnerable in these states and put the credit card away. If you get the sudden urge to shop, ask yourself if you’re feeling one of these things.Deal with these states instead of going shopping.
Remember these vulnerabilities by remembering the acronym HALT (hunger, anger, lonely, tired).

, If you go into a store knowing what you need, it’s easier to navigate your way around and stay on task. Before you head out to purchase items, take a moment and decide what you need. Write down the stores you need to go to and what you need in each store. When you’re in the store, stay focused on only getting the items on your list.Whether you’re buying lots of things or just a few, a list will help you know what you’re looking for.
If you get distracted by something that’s not on your list, write it down and save it for the next shopping trip.

, Plan your grocery shopping after you eat, not before. Plan a weekly (or bi-weekly) shopping trip so that you can anticipate going food shopping. If you can anticipate when you will shop for food, you can prepare ahead of time by eating and creating a shopping list Stay away from groceries and food when you’re hungry, as you’re more likely to spend more money when you are hungry.If you need to buy groceries and you’re hungry, stop and get a snack or a meal first.

, If you find yourself turning to shopping when you’re feeling emotional or having a bad day, recognize that there are other ways to deal with these emotions. Shopping is not the only thing that can lift your spirits or help you feel better. Emotional spending is often a culprit for impulse buys. If you feel like you want to buy something, do another calming or stress-relieving activity instead.For example, take a walk, take some deep breaths, meditate, listen to music, or write in a journal.

, Some online retailers allow you to keep your credit card information and address on file so that check-out is easy and streamlined. Don’t keep this information on file and make yourself manually enter it in. Getting up and punching in the numbers to your credit card may give you enough time to realize you don’t actually want or need the item.Opt out of keeping your information on file. Some retailers keep this information on file if you sign up as a member, so use the “guest” option instead.
Disable the “Autofill” option in your browser so that your address or other personal information does not automatically pop up.

, Just like you can put items on hold in a store, use your wish list the same way. Keep the items you like but are not ready to buy on a wish list. Unlike retail stores, online retailers often have more stock, so the fear of the item being gone is less likely.Go back onto your wish list later and clean out the items you no longer want. If something still catches your eye, decide whether it’s a worthwhile buy.

, If the website allows for one-click buying, disable this feature. Put all of your items into the cart before purchasing them. That way, you will see what the total amount is altogether and decide whether it’s in your budget. You might get to check-out and realize you’re spending much more than you want to, then remove some items from your cart.


If a website is making the checkout process faster, beware that this can increase your impulse buys.

, Recognize the signs that your impulse buying may be turning into an addictive behavior. Like any other addictive behavior (alcohol, drugs, gambling, sex, etc.), people can become addicted to shopping. A chemical response in the body occurs while endorphins and dopamine are released in the brain. Just like other addictions, this creates a pleasurable feeling motivating the person to complete the task again to recreate and feel the same response again. Pay attention to the following signs:


Being secretive that you are shopping, and withholding how much you spent on your purchases from others.
Spending more than you're able to afford, and maxing out your credit cards.
Shopping with the motive to self soothe uncomfortable feelings and emotions, such as fear, grief, anger, hurt, resentment, anxiety, depression, and so on.
Your shopping is affecting your relationships with your friends and family. They may be concerned that you are spending too much.
You go on frequent and intense shopping sprees, which also cause you to neglect other responsibilities at home or at work.

, If you notice that your shopping is disrupting your normal daily functioning at work or at home, and you’ve been neglecting your tasks, then you should seek professional help. If your shopping is a way for you to self soothe your internal emotions, then you should also seek professional help to address your concerns. Therapists use multidisciplinary approaches to help you gain more control over your spending and help you to improve your finances and relationships.

, If shopping is your hobby, consider finding some new ones. Window shopping can be a source of impulse buying, so try to avoid this activity altogether. If you insist on going window shopping, don’t bring your wallet with you.Spend some time enjoying nature and go on a walk or a hike instead.

, If you love to buy random things, try to anticipate these expenses instead of completely cutting them out. It can be nice to find an item of clothing you love or gift you know someone will appreciate. Instead of forbidding yourself from buying these things, plan some money each month especially for these items.If this spending is way over what you can afford, take $50 or $100 each month for these kinds of purchases. If possible, take it out and cash so that when it runs out, that’s it for the month.

, If you want something new, go home and donate a similar item before buying a new one. For example, if you want a new shirt, pick one shirt from home you’re willing to donate. If you cannot find one you’re willing to give away or donate, then you cannot add to your collection.Having to part with something first can give you time to think about how much you want that new item.

, If you make a purchase, make sure you keep the receipt. Look at the store’s return policy and do not buy something that cannot be returned. Only buy things you know you can return. If you do have buyer’s remorse, it will be fairly simple to make a return.Keep all of your receipts together. Consider having a receipt envelope where all of your receipts go after you make a purchase.

Take control if your child is cyberbullying.,
Explore why your child is bullying.,
Seek help.,
Discuss how cyberbullying affects others.,
Explain how cyberbullying impacts your child.,
Delete any mean comments.,
Apologize.,
Take a cyber-break.",How to Stop Your Child from Being a Cyberbully2," The first step after catching your child cyberbullying should be a complete shutdown of your child's social media accounts. Ban your child from social media as part of a ""grounding"" period. When you are ready to let them rejoin social media, make a rule that you will have their log in information for a period of time so that you can monitor their activities. Once you are sure that they are able to responsibly use their accounts, allow them to have a private log in. Continue to monitor their actions as a friend or a follower.

Your child should earn back their social media privileges with time and good behavior.
Remind your child of the consequences of cyberbullying, and that you are doing this to help them as well as their victim.

, Bullying of any type is often a learned behavior to handle stress and usually indicates that something else is going on with your child.One key to stop your child from being a cyberbully is to identify why they are doing it in the first place.


In some cases children begin to cyberbully because they want to be popular, feel powerful, or because they want attention. This may suggest problems with self-esteem.
Some children cyberbully because they are being bullied or because they are the victim of abuse or trauma. Ask your child, “Is someone bothering you or is something going on we should talk about?”
Sometimes children cyberbully because they don’t know how to express themselves appropriately or realize the consequences of their actions. They may not understand that what they are doing is hurtful.
In some cases, cyberbullying results from modeling similar behavior. Consider how the members of your household relate to each other, or if you may have unknowingly modeled gossiping negatively about others. For example, you may say things like, ""She's too fat to be wearing that,"" ""I don't know what he's thinking with that haircut,"" or ""I can't believe they thought their kids would make the all-star team."" These kinds of statements can make children think it's okay to talk negatively to others.

, You can stop your child from being a cyberbully by addressing any problems they may be having. Talking to a teacher, counselor, or their pediatrician can help your child manage negative feelings they may be having. It can also help them deal with the underlying reasons for bullying and teach them better ways to express feelings.Talk to your child’s teacher about anti-bullying resources available through the school. You might say, “We’re having a problem with Sandy being a cyberbully. Can you suggest any resources?”
Consider speaking to your religious leader if you are involved in a religious community.
Ask your pediatrician for a referral to a counselor or therapist that can help you address any problems.

, Talking to your child about how their posts, messages, and comments may negatively impact the target of their cyberbullying is one way to stop your child from being a cyberbully. Explain to your child how their behavior may make the target feel and the possible consequences of their cyberbullying.


One way to do this is to identify a few unkind statements that someone has made or could make about your child. Ask your child to come up with the examples. Talk to your child about how those statements make them feel.
Tell your child to think about how the person feels when they see mean things about them on the internet. You could say, “It probably hurts Donnie’s feelings and makes him feel bad to see your comments.”
Talk to your child about the impact their actions can have on the target of their bullying.
For instance, you could say, “About 1/3 of people that are bullied start engaging in self-harm like cutting themselves.”Or you might explain that most youth suicides are because of bullying., Some children, especially those that are fairly young, may not understand that cyberbullying hurts the people being bullied and the person doing the bullying. You can stop your child from being a cyberbully by talking to them about the consequences it can have on their life.


Tell your child that cyberbullying can cause them to lose friends. You might say, “People might not want to be friends with you if they see that you post mean comments and hurtful pictures.”
Explain that cyberbullying can get your child in trouble or their account deactivated if their cyberbullying is reported. Try saying, “Your comments could make you lose your account.”
Talk about the fact that some children who bully have problems later on in their adult life.Be as specific as possible because children often have problems envisioning their life as an adult. Say, ""If you've been a bully, others are less likely to trust or respect you. They won't want to open up to you. That means it will be harder for you to have friends.""

, Once a post or comment is posted, it is usually there until the person that posts it removes it, or the site administrators do so. You can stop your child from being a cyberbully by making them delete any inappropriate posts or messages they may have made.


Most sites and apps make it easy to remove a comment that your child has posted.
If it's a Facebook comment, click the ‘X’ in the top right corner of the post and press ""Delete Post"".
SnapChat posts are automatically deleted after 24 hours and the messages are deleted immediately after the receiver views them.
Delete Instagram posts by tapping and holding your finger on the post. A menu will appear in the top right corner that you can click to delete the post.

, If your child has engaged in cyberbullying, they may need to apologize to the target and ask what they can do to make the situation better. Saying “I’m sorry” is one way to get your child to take responsibility for their actions and to let the victim know it won’t happen again.Your child may need to send the target of their cyberbullying a direct message saying something like, “I am sorry for my mean posts. I will never do anything like that again. What can I do to help you feel better?”
You may want your child to make a public apology by posting it on their page or profile. For instance, the post might say, “I recently posted mean pictures. I want to apologize to everyone I hurt by doing that. Please tell me what I can do to make it up to you.”

, If your child is a cyberbully, one way to stop the behavior is to make your child logout or deactivate their social media accounts.Staying online will make it easier for your child to post mean comments or embarrassing pictures. If necessary, you can take away your child’s electronic devices for a specific amount of time.


Consider designating a certain time each day as tech-free. For example, you may decide that the hour before dinner and during dinner is a tech-free time.
If you need to, put parental controls on your child’s electronic devices to limit their access to certain apps and social networking sites.
You can also enforce a complete cyber-break for a specified amount of time. For instance, if you find that your child is post mean comments you might limit their electronics use for a month.

Show them deep-breathing.,
Discuss using positive self-talk.,
Practice meditation together.,
Redirect their energy.",How to Stop Your Child from Being a Cyberbully3," Sometimes children cyberbully because something or someone has them upset, frustrated, or angry.Showing them stress reduction techniques like deep-breathing and muscle/body relaxation can help stop your child from being a cyberbully. It can help them calm down when they are feeling upset and give them time to think about their actions.Tell your child, “Inhale slowly through your nose. Try to feel the breath down in your belly. Hold the breath for a few seconds, then slowly let it out through your mouth.”
Model deep-breathing for child and walk them through the steps as you do it.
Remind them to log off and put their electronics away while they do their deep breathing and relaxation exercises.

, Targets of cyberbullying may begin to feel negative about themselves because of the bullying, but often the bully is also having negative thoughts and feelings about themself.Tell your child to give themselves at least one compliment a day. For example, you might say, “Every morning, before you brush your teeth, remind yourself how awesome you are.”
Suggest that your child start a list of all the positive things about them. For instance, they might list physical characteristics, personality traits, skills, awards, and more. After your child makes the list, add to it yourself. Ask everyone in the household to contribute to the list.
Encourage your child to come to you when they are having negative thoughts or feelings so that you can help them change those thoughts or feelings.

, You can stop your child from being a cyberbullying by trying meditation. Meditation is a way for your child to release tension. It can also help them become more aware and in control of their feelings. In addition, practicing together will give you time to bond and strengthen your relationship.


Show them how to sit or lie somewhere comfortable.
Tell them, “Focus your thoughts on your breathing. Try to ignore everything else.”
Try out different types of meditation until you find one that works for you and your child.

, You can help your child handle their feelings and help prevent them from cyberbullying if you give them an alternative way to express themselves. Redirect their energy towards positive activities and interactions.


Sometimes children bully because they don’t know appropriate ways to interact with other children. Sometimes it's because they may be a victim of bullying themselves. Talk to your child about forming positive, encouraging friendships.
Encourage your child to participate in sports or community activities. For example, you might sign your child up for basketball or a youth group.

Draw a plan on a piece of paper with your child's input and opinion.,
Take a walk in the garden and plot out the area that will make the faerie garden.,
Dig over the garden.,
Place a square or circle paver upon which the main feature piece will sit.,
Mark out a larger outer faerie circle which surrounds this feature piece.,
Make little faerie circles next to the large circle.,
Add extra faerie pieces.,
Follow your child's imagination to include other items in the garden.,
Remind your child to keep the flowers watered regularly.,
Have a special tea party to open the faerie garden.",How to Make a Faerie Garden with Your Child," Ask your child what shape he or she would like (or simply tell your child the shape if your garden space is limited). Using this shape, map out the sorts of things your faerie garden will contain. See ideas under ""Tips"".;
, It should be somewhere child-friendly and less accessible to dogs, puppies and cats who might mess with it. Fence it off with small garden fences if necessary (little blunt wooden picket fences are cute).

, Do this together with your child, so that the soil is ready for planting and is easy to place the faerie pieces into. Fertilize if necessary.

, A terracotta coloured cement paver is ideal. Place a statue on this square or circle, such as a mushroom, faerie, animal or other feature item that the child has chosen.

, Plant a circle of flowers chosen by the child around the inner circle. Edge this outer circle with upright border blocks (the wavy ones are the most elegant).

, Use river stones, pebbles etc. Place plants inside these circles, or little trinkets chosen by the child. You could also make other shapes with the pebbles, such as cat faces, dogs, triangles, diamonds etc.; imagination is the only limit.

, A faerie table and chairs can be made from various sizes of pavers. Purchase a small child's tea-set from a dollar store and place on the table for the faeries to have tea.

, Listen to their ideas and try to adapt to them with items on hand.

, While watering, they can check for faeries. Encourage them to leave little gifts for the faeries (small pieces of fruit, seeds, whatever they like). This will ease the transition from stubborn disinterest in gardening to enjoying it!

, Invite other family members, friends and neighbors over to marvel at the little garden and to provide the child with encouragement to tend it.

Brainstorm a list of important topics.,
Choose the most important concept.,
Link the key word to the second most important words from your list.,
Link the second key words to less important words.,
Explain the relationship between the terms.",How to Make a Concept Map1," Before you choose the subject at the top of your hierarchy map, you should write down a list of important subjects related to your project or assignment. If you know that your project should be about trees, for example, then that word would go at the top of your concept map. But if you just know that you have to write or think about objects in nature, or materials made from nature, then your task is a bit harder.First, write out all of the concepts related to your general subject:


Trees
Oxygen
Wood
Humans
Plants
Animals
Houses
Paper;
, Once you've brainstormed a list of concepts related to your project, you can choose the concept that is most essential to all of the others -- the one from which all of the others stem. This may be obvious, or it may require a little thought. Remember, if it's a hierarchical map, then the central word should be the one that connects all of the others. In this case, the word is ""Trees.""


This word will appear in a box or oval at the top of your map.
Note that in some cases, you can skip the first step. If you already know that you have to write a paper or give a presentation on ""Trees,"" for example, you can write that word at the top of the hierarchical map right away.

, Once you've found your keys word, draw arrows extending downward to the left and right that connect the word to the next two or three most important words. These next words should be able to connect to the other words you've brainstormed, which will appear below them. In this case, the hierarchical term is ""Trees,"" and it will be linked to the two next most important terms, ""Oxygen,"" and ""Wood.""

, Now that you've found your key word and the next most important words, you can write the words that relate to the second key words below these. These terms will become more specific, and should relate back to the words above them, ""Oxygen"" and ""Wood,"" as well as the most central word, ""Trees."" Here are the terms that you'll list below these more central terms:


Humans
Plants
Animals
Houses
Paper
Furniture

, Add lines to connect the terms, and explain the relationship between the terms in a word or two. The relationships can vary; one concept can be part of another, it can be crucial to another concept, it can be used to produce another concept, or there can be a variety of other relationships. Here are the relationships between the concepts on this map:


Trees give oxygen and wood
Oxygen is important to humans, plants, and animals
Wood is used to make houses, paper, furniture

Make sure your expectations are age appropriate.,
Explain to your child what is off-limits.,
Give your child some control.,
Evaluate your expectations.",How to Set Expectations for Your Children's Behavior in Public1," Children develop at their own pace. There are developmental milestones that provide a guideline for things that a child might be expected to do, but there is no guarantee that your child isn’t a little ahead or behind that guideline. Do some research to learn about these milestones, since they are not common knowledge. Before you go out, you should keep in mind the age of your child and the behaviors that they typically display, and evaluate whether your expectations are realistic. If they are not, you need to set achievable goals for your children.For example, asking a four year old to sit still for ten minutes while getting their hair cut might be reasonable. Asking the same four year old to sit still for thirty minutes while you wait on your food is probably unrealistic.
If you are going somewhere that requires a particular standard of behavior that your child is not ready to meet, you should consider getting a babysitter for the event.;
, Everything from your cat’s water bowl to the candy at the bottom of the checkout aisle appears to be fair game to your children. You can explain to them that some things aren’t for them, but keep in mind that the parts of the brain responsible for regulating emotions and impulses develop very slowly (meaning that children either don’t have them yet, or they aren’t well developed yet). Expecting a young child to consistently resist these temptations is unrealistic, but it does not mean you shouldn’t try. By trying to guide them towards impulse control, you will be helping them to develop this skill. Think ahead to what things might grab your child’s attention and try to minimize the number of times they have to resist playing with something that they shouldn’t.For example, if you are going through the grocery store checkout, it might be better to choose the self checkout lane that doesn’t have candy at your child’s eye level. This will remove the temptation for them to grab the candy.

, Children are not always capable of making decisions for themselves, so parents generally do this for them. That in mind, children also need to feel like they get to make some on their own choices. If you are not creating opportunities for them to do this when you go out, it is not realistic to expect their cooperation with your decisions. Plan for something on the trip to be left up to your child’s discretion to buy for the reasonable behavior you discussed with them.Be sure to discuss this before you leave for the trip to get them excited and give them a reason to exercise the desired behavior.


For example, if you decide that you are going to the grocery store to get milk and cereal, you could let your child pick the kind of cereal they want to have.
You can even limit some choices to let your child pick between things that you present them. In the case of cereal, you could offer to let them choose Cheerios or Raisin Bran if you wanted to avoid chocolate or fruity cereals that are packed with sugar.

, Put yourself in your child’s shoes and think about how you would feel on this trip. Are they expected to go a long time without a snack or to sit still for extended periods of time? If you find that you would be uncomfortable on the trip, your child certainly will be, too. Change any expectations that you think your child cannot meet and set them up with expectations that they can meet.

Write the main topic in the center.,
Write the subtopics around the main topic.,
Write the supporting topics around their the subtopics.,
Keep going (optional).",How to Make a Concept Map2," The spider concept map is organized with a main topic in the center, sub-topics branching from the main topic, and supporting details branching off the sub-topics. This format will actually make the map resemble a spider. This type of map is also ideal for writing an essay, because it can help you generate supporting evidence and understand the primary and secondary details of the subject.The spider concept map is also very useful for helping you see which topics are richer than others, because you'll see that you can ""branch off"" more concepts from larger topics.
Let's say the main topic is ""Health."" Write this topic in the center of a piece of paper and circle it. This circle should be larger and more prominent than the others to emphasize that this is the most important topic.

, Now that you've written your main topic, you can write down the subtopics around it. You can write them in smaller circles and connect the circles to the main topic, ""Health."" You can first brainstorm a list of subtopics before you choose a few of them -- let's say three. These subtopics should be large enough for you to write at least three supporting details about each of them.


Let's say you've brainstormed the following concepts related to health: lifestyle, relaxation, no stress, sleep, healthy relationships, happiness, diet, fruits and vegetables, exercise, avocado, massage, walking, running, stretching, bike riding, three balanced meals, and proteins.
Pick the three most important subtopics, which can encompass many of these terms and are broad enough to incorporate a number of concepts. From this list, the most productive terms are: exercise, lifestyle, and diet. Write these terms in circles around the main topic and connect them with lines. They should be somewhat evenly spaced around the central topic, ""Health.""

, Now that you've chosen three supporting topics, you can write the supporting topics around them. Just do the same thing you did in the last step: brainstorm a list of supporting topics around the subtopics. Once you've chosen your supporting topics, you can just connect them with the subtopics with a line or even draw a circle around them to connect them. They should appear smaller than the subtopics.


Around the subtopic ""exercise,"" you can write the following terms: walking, yoga, variety, how often, how much, and biking instead of driving.
Around the subtopic ""lifestyle,"" you can write the following terms: sleep, healthy relationships, relaxation, massage, routine, variety, and love.
Around the subtopic ""diet,"" you can write the following terms: fruits, vegetables, proteins, balance, carbs, and hydration.

, If you'd like to make your spider concept map really specific, then you could even take it a step further and write some supporting topics around the supporting topics. This can be useful if you're dissecting a particularly difficult topic that has many layers. It also depends on how long your paper, assignment, or project should be -- if it requires more words or time, then you can expand your concept map a bit.


Around the supporting topic ""sleep,"" you can write, ""8 hours a night,"" ""don't drink caffeine before bed,"" and ""the same amount every night""
Around the supporting topic ""yoga,"" you can write ""yoga for meditation,"" ""power yoga,"" or ""vinyasa yoga"".
Around the supporting topic ""balance,"" you can write ""three meals a day,"" ""protein with every meal"" and ""healthy snacks.""

Choose your starting point or problem.,
Write the easiest solution for the problem.,
Write the two results for this solution.,
Write the results for the next solution.",How to Make a Concept Map3," The flowchart map allows you to examine a process and see the multiple options for getting it done. The flowchart can be linear and can just flow from one concept to the next, but it can also have multiple elements for examining a variety of outcomes. The starting point can be a process or a problem that needs a solution. Let's use the starting point, ""Lamp doesn't turn on."", For the problem, ""Lamp doesn't turn on,"" the most typical solution is that the lamp is not plugged in. Just write, ""Lamp plugged in?"" and connect it with an arrow to ""Lamp doesn't turn on.""

, Write a line from ""Lamp plugged in?"" that says ""no"" and another that says ""yes."" If you follow the line that says ""no,"" then the response would be ""Plug in lamp."" Connect this response to ""no"" with a line. You've completed one flow of the concept, starting with ""Lamp doesn't turn on"" to ""Plug in lamp."" If you follow this ""flow,"" then it should solve the problem.


But if the lamp is plugged in, you'll follow ""yes"" to another option: ""Bulb burned out?"" This is the next logical solution.

, From the question, ""Bulb burned out?"" you'll need to branch out two terms: ""yes"" and ""no."" If the answer to ""Bulb burned out"" is ""yes,"" then you'll need to connect this word to the solution, ""Replace bulb."" You've completed another flow of the concept, because this should fix the broken lamp. But if it turns out that the bulb is not burned out, you'll have to follow ""no,"" to the last option: ""Repair lamp.""


You have now completed a flowchart for the problem of a broken lamp, which will lead you to one of three solutions: plugging it in, replacing the bulb, or repairing the lamp.

Discuss ways to meet your expectations.",How to Set Expectations for Your Children's Behavior in Public2," One of the best ways to set your child up for success is to talk to them on a regular basis. Let them know where you will be going, and what you plan to do there. Give them an idea of how long you will be gone, and when they can expect to play, eat, or come home.Have them repeat this back to you so that it sticks. This will give them a sense of control and something to look forward to.

, When you set expectations for children, they should be very explicit. Most children have limited vocabularies compared to adults, and have trouble interpreting abstract ideas. Tell your children exactly what you expect them to do in each situation that they are going to encounter.For example, you should tell your children something like “At the store, I expect you to use your inside voice and walk beside me,” instead of a vague statement like “I expect you to be good at the store.” You might interpret both of those sentences to mean the same thing, but your child doesn’t understand what “good” is unless you tell them how to be “good.”

, Once you tell a child exactly what you want them to do, you can give them strategies to succeed. Come up with a way that the child can gauge their own behavior to limit the amount of times that you have to intervene. Being told that they are not meeting your expectations repeatedly will frustrate children and make it even harder for them to focus on the goals that you gave them.For example, if you have set the expectation that your child will alongside you in the store, you can tell them something like “Your arm should always be able to touch me or the cart. If you can’t reach me or the cart, then you are too far away and should come closer.” This lets the child gauge their distance in a way that they can understand instead of an abstract “Stay beside me.”
You can also roleplay with your child before going somewhere. This way, they get practice meeting your expectations and feel confident when they are put in a public situation. For example, you could practice things like saying “thank you” when someone gives them something."
"
Prompt appropriate behaviors.,
Reference your earlier conversation.,
Explain the consequences for inappropriate behavior.",How to Set Expectations for Your Children's Behavior in Public3," Even the best intentioned children are prone to get distracted or sidetracked (just like adults). When you see this happening, you should prompt your child to go back to doing things they way that you discussed before coming out. This gives them a chance to get back on track before you directly point out that they aren’t meeting your expectations.For example, if your child has strayed a little too far from the cart, you could say something like “Watch me. I can touch the cart. Can you touch the cart?” This will usually prompt them to come back to where they can touch the cart.

, If prompting your child does not bring them back to meeting your expectations, bring up that you talked about the scenario before leaving. This will remind your child of the conversation and the expectations that were agreed upon. It will also remind them that they agreed to those terms before coming out with you.For example, you might say something like “Do you remember when we talked earlier? You told me you would stay close enough to touch the cart. I expect you to come back so that you can keep that promise.”

, If the behavior continues to be unacceptable, you will have to discuss consequences with your children. Pull them aside quietly and talk to them rather than embarrassing them in front of people. Be sure to kneel down when you talk with them and stay calm as you do so. Make it clear that your expectations are not being met, and that in order for you both to continue having fun they need to start doing the things that you have asked them to do.For example, you could pull your child aside to an empty aisle in the store and explain that their behavior is making it difficult to finish the grocery trip. You could say something like “You agreed to stay close enough to touch the cart while we were shopping. If you can’t do that anymore, we will have to end our trip early. This means that you will not get a chance to pick out your cereal.”

"
"
Talk to your children about the outing.,
Highlight good behaviors.,
Connect inappropriate behaviors to consequences.",How to Set Expectations for Your Children's Behavior in Public4," On your way home is a great time to discuss the outing that you had. Ask your kids what they enjoyed and what they didn’t enjoy. Use this to recap on how they did or did not meet your expectations on this trip.For example, you might ask your children questions like “What was your favorite part of the movie?” Then you can follow it up with a statement like “I was very proud that you sat quietly like we discussed.”

, Children crave attention from their caregivers. By giving them positive attention when they do the things you have asked, you fulfill that need. Also, let them hear you brag about their good behavior to your co-parent and to others. This helps to build your relationship with the child, and to reinforce the behaviors that you like to see.You could reinforce good behaviors by saying things like “I was so proud that you stayed close enough to reach the cart through the whole trip. Thank you for doing what we talked about.”

, If you need to address your child acting out, be sure to tie that to a consequence that they can understand. It helps if the consequence fits naturally with the acting out, instead of just being an assigned punishment of some kind. This will help your child understand the consequences that come with acting inappropriately in public places.A good example of this would be to say something like “I was disappointed that you weren’t able to walk beside me in the store. It’s too bad that we couldn’t stay long enough to let you choose a cereal. Maybe next time we can do better and have time to get cereal.”

Give the toddler a vegetable scrubber and tell them to gently scrub the vegetables to help remove the dirt.Make sure the vegetable scrubber is safe for children. A soft, nylon brush works well.;
, Another fun, easy kitchen task for small children is tearing up greens like lettuce or kale. Ask the toddler if they want to help you make a salad. Then demonstrate how to tear the large leaves into smaller pieces.Make sure your toddler washes their hands before handling greens, especially if they will be eaten raw.

, While it might seem questionable to hand a knife to a toddler, allowing a child to chop food with a kid-friendly knife can help them assert independence. Try giving your toddler a plastic, child-safe knife. Hold the food with your hands to stabilize it. Then ask them to chop soft items, like bananas or squash, with the knife.Try giving the child a butter knife or plastic knife designed specifically for children.
Never give a toddler a sharp or serrated knife.
Always supervise children with knives, even if they are child-safe.

, If you are making a dish that requires you to weigh ingredients, involve your toddler in the process. Let the child spoon ingredients on to the scale. This will help them become involved in the cooking process."

Ask your child to pour ingredients into a mixing bowl or pot.,
Allow the toddler to stir ingredients.,
Sprinkle ingredients with your toddler.,
Ask the toddler to set the table.,
Let the toddler wash plastic items.,
Be patient with your toddler.,
Let your toddler help pick out kitchen tasks.",How to Let Your Toddler Help in the Kitchen2," An easy, fun task for toddlers is transferring ingredients as you cook. Encourage your toddler to pour dry ingredients, like flour or sugar, into a mixing bowl. They can also help out by pouring wet ingredients, like chicken broth, into a pot or kettle., If you are making a dish with a batter that is easily stirred, like pancake batter, ask the child to stir the mixture. You can give them a large wooden spoon or even a whisk. Encourage them to stir until all the ingredients are combined., If you are cooking a dish that requires the sprinkling of flour, decorations, or sugar, hand the task over to your toddler. For example, if you make sugar cookies, ask the toddler to sprinkle the sugar on top of the cookies., Small children can help carry cups, plates, and utensils to the table. Give the child plastic, lightweight dishes and utensils. Ask the child to carry the items to the table one at a time. Then ask them to set the table with the items.Make sure you don’t ask the toddler to carry heavy or breakable items, like heavy dishes or glasses.

, You can also involve your toddler in cleanup by allowing them to help with washing the dishes. Fill the sink with warm water. Place a few plastic items, like spoons or plates, in the sink. Ask the child to wash and dry the items.Make sure the water is cool enough for your toddler to touch, by testing it yourself. This will help prevent possible scalding from water that is too hot.

, It’s important that you are patient with your toddler as they learn to help out in the kitchen. There is a good chance they will make a mess or not follow directions precisely. Let them make mistakes and allow them to try the task again., You should use your own judgment when deciding what your toddler can do in the kitchen. You should also let their experience level, eagerness, and skill level guide their kitchen activities.

For example, if your toddler has exceptional fine motor skills, they might be great at cutting fruit or cheese with a kid-friendly knife.
For another example, a child that loves pancakes might be really excited to help stir the batter.

, Yarn is easier for younger children, while line or twine may be better for older children for its sophisticated look.

, They should be at least four oz. containers and have a large lip. Wash them out and dry them thoroughly.


You can also use plastic drinking cups.

, You will want to grab a hole punch or small pointy awl for punching holes in the plastic. It is best that adults handle this single portion of the project.

, Make sure your child can reach them all.

, Hold the hanger up and show how the hanger tips from side to side when there are weights at either end. Show that you will hang items on either side to balance the scale and compare items by their weight.

, A fabric measuring tape is perfect for this use. Divide the circumference by three, since you will make three equidistant holes in each cup.


For example, if it is six inches long, you will want to mark a hole every two inches.
Try to do the sums together with your child. This is a great simple math activity for a school-aged child.

, Repeat on the other plastic cup.

Assess the situation.,
Calmly state the rule that your child has broken.,
Be clear about the potential consequence for their actions.,
Do not repeat your warning about a potential punishment.,
Send your child to their room.,
After a time out, reiterate the rule that was broken, why it exists, and that you expect them not to break this rule again.,
Model emotional intelligence.,
Demonstrate empathy.,
Don’t allow your child to hit you.,
Don’t over-react.,
Distract your child from problematic situations.,
Allow slight transgressions.,
Recognize that your child knows what they did was wrong.",How to Send a Child to Their Bedroom," If your child is misbehaving or is acting out in anger, verbally acknowledge that you understand your child is upset, and then ask them what’s wrong. Don’t immediately begin to try to explain why what they’re doing is wrong, as they won’t be able to listen if they’re still upset.


Listen, then react. If your child has calmed down, they will likely verbalize why they became upset or misbehaved.
If your child is too angry to speak or continues to misbehave by lying or refusing responsibility for their behavior, tell them that you can talk once they calm down and are ready to tell the truth.
Your child’s level of emotion will dictate whether or not a time-out is a good idea. Since productive conversation requires that you are both calm, a time-out may be good for both of you.
Recognize that some scenarios may be remedied without discipline. For instance, if your child is drawing on something they are not supposed to draw on, do not immediately discipline them. Offer them paper, and explain why they cannot draw on furniture or walls, etc. If they comply, they have stopped misbehaving and learned a lesson without discipline.;
, If your child is still acting up, clearly and calmly state that what they are doing is wrong and that they need to stop. Give them a chance to think about what they’re doing. You may have to repeat yourself several times, especially if the child is very young. Give your child the opportunity to practice learning how to be responsible by giving them a few chances to obey., Warn your child that if they continue to misbehave, there will be a consequence. Emphasize, most importantly, that they have the choice to adjust their behavior and avoid the consequence you are warning them about.


As you warn of a potential consequence, repeat the rule and continue with the warning. For instance, say something like, “Remember that the rule is ________; if you continue to __________, you will have to go to your room.”
Be specific about the amount of time they’ll be alone. A general rule is a minute per year of the child’s age. (For instance, if your child is three, three minutes is an appropriate amount of time.)
Be sure to pause a moment and consider the punishment you’re about to warn your child about. Note that sending a child to their room is a significant punishment, as it deprives them of your presence and support., If your child continues to do what you’ve told them not to (even once you’ve warned them that there would be repercussions if they continued to misbehave), you must immediately enforce the rule and levy the punishment., Again, be very clear about what is happening and why it is happening. Be calm, patient, and firm. State the rule again, remind them that you warned them what would happen if they didn’t stop, and that since they chose not to stop that they have to go to their room. Remember to also state the amount of time that they will be alone in their room.


Aside from stating these things clearly, do not try to have a conversation with your child until they’ve calmed down. (Recall the steps above about talking to your child.)
Refer to the time out as a chance to calm down.
Do not shout at your child or otherwise act of anger. This will teach them to act of anger – which is likely what you’re trying to teach them not to do.

, Walk through how to problem-solve a similar situation in the future. Be clear that they can respond differently next time.


Tell your child a story. Talk to your child only once they’ve calmed down. Stories from your life are the best way to start, as they will interest your child and convey that you understand what they’re going through. This will also help them understand themselves!

, Emotional intelligence refers to your ability to identify, regulate, and otherwise manage your emotions.In everyday life, and especially in parenting, you are frequently faced with frustrating moments that may give rise to negative emotions, including anger. Develop and demonstrate your own emotional intelligence by remaining calm and controlling your behavior.


Take a deep breath. Remind yourself that children are less able to control themselves than adults. (Remind yourself that even some adults struggle to control their anger.) Simply acknowledging the necessity of staying calm will help you do so.
Control your own behavior. Show your child how to respond to frustrating situations by keeping your own behavior in check. This includes responding to your childrens’ misbehavior calmly. Teach your child to control their anger by remaining calm when you become angry with them! Show them that they can control how they act as well., If your child’s poor behavior leads to an opportunity for them to speak with you about how they are feeling, allow the scenario to become a positive learning experience. Support your child by telling them you understand that they are angry. They will feel closer to you and be more open in telling you why they are acting out.Allow your child the space to convey the fear or frustration that caused them to act out. This alone will diminish their anger, and it will allow them to recognize that they don’t have to become angry or act out.

, Convey that you are willing to listen when they are ready. If they are attempting to hit you, tell them that is unacceptable, place them calmly in their room (alone), and carefully shut the door. Ignore their tantrum until they calm down unless you think they might accidentally hurt themselves.


Alternatively, give them a pillow to hit. (This applies to toddlers who may still need to express their anger physically. Don’t encourage hitting, but physical release of anger in appropriate ways is okay for toddlers.), Leave the over-reacting to your child; they’ll do enough of that for the both of you. Remind yourself that children experience extreme emotional fluctuations that they can’t control. When they act out, they’re venting this emotion.If they continue to be upset and refuse to calm down, they might just need to vent. In this case, sending your child to their room might be the right move.


Check out the wikiHow article on How To Discipline a Child, which includes a section on being a good disciplinarian.

, Provide an alternative activity or environment that gives your child an option to choose a situation that they will better enjoy. Structure environments to prevent frustration. This includes making sure your child is fed and well-rested.


If your child is being overly physical, they may simply need to move around. If playing inside, bring them outside, where they are more able to run around and expend some energy.
If your child is treating another child contentiously, or is becoming upset from another child’s behavior, separate them. This may provide a good opportunity to talk about behavior without being accusatory, as you can prevent frustrations from boiling over by separating the children, and then have a conversation on why that sort of behavior frustrates other people.

, Ignore behavior that is only slightly inappropriate, such as relatively quiet whining or complaining. This is the best course of action to decrease whining and complaining in the long term.If your child begs for something, but is not screaming or crying, don’t try to shush them. Instead, ignoring them sends a clear message that begging doesn’t work and reduces the likelihood that they will continue to do so.

, Make repeated misbehavior less likely by sharing how you felt about their behavior with them, and allowing them the chance to come to terms with the emotional turbulence that causes children to misbehave.Return to a more detailed conversation about behavior later in the day, perhaps even at bedtime. Your child will be more calm and more contemplative.
Hold your child during these bedtime discussions. This will make them feel comfortable and reassure them that they have your support.
Reiterate the reasons for the rules broken or discussed earlier, and ask your child if they have any questions. This will likely lead to productive conversations on all sorts of topics, including how best to treat other people.

Identify possible reasons for your toddler's early wake time.,
Understand a baby or infant's sleep cycle.,
Use a later bedtime.,
Write the number of the wake up time on the clock.,
Explain the purpose of the number on the clock.,
Be firm about enforcing the wake up time.",How to Keep Children from Waking up Too Early1," Many children wake up early in the morning due to noise, hunger, or light. Try to keep a record of your child’s sleeping habits for one to two weeks. Note what time your child goes to bed, what time she wakes up, and any naps she takes during the day. You should try to identify any patterns in your child’s sleep, and if noise, hunger, light or too many naps during the day are causing the early wake time.If you are trying to get a baby or child under 1 year old to sleep in later, you will need to establish a sleep schedule for your baby and stick to it. Babies crave routine and will fall into an established sleeping, eating, and napping routine within a few weeks of coming home from the hospital. Babies will also wake up in the night or early in the morning due to hunger, noise, or light. You should track your baby's sleeping habits for one to two weeks to check for any patterns, like waking up at the same time every night due to hunger or waking up sporadically throughout the night due to noise.;
, Babies, or any child under 1 year old, will have a sleep pattern that will change month to month. It's important that you try to adapt to your baby's changing sleep cycle so you can ensure she is getting enough sleep and is not overly tired during the day. Not all babies are alike, so use these month by month notes as guidelines for your baby's sleep cycle.By one month at home, babies will sleep about 15 hours a day, with about six of those hours during the day. Many babies will give you a cue they are ready for a nap by falling asleep after a feeding or while they are feeding.
At three months, most babies will sleep through the night. Your baby's stomach has grown, so she can eat more and sleep longer during the night, about 15 hours, with a decreased nap time of 5 hours.
At six months, your baby will need about 14 hours of sleep a day, with 4 hours of nap time during the day. However, some infants may still wake up during the night and may wake up very early in the morning.
By nine months, your baby should be able to sleep through the night on a regular schedule. She will need about 14 hours of sleep and only 3 hours of nap time during the day.
At 12 months, or 1 year old, most babies should sleep about 13 hours a day. Your baby should sleep 10-11 hours a night, and take a 2-3 hour nap during the day. Some 1 year olds may not be interested in napping, as they are too busy exploring the world and running around, but you should still try to encourage a nap time once a day. This will help your 1 year old maintain a consistent sleep cycle.

, Most toddlers between the ages of 1 and 3 years old need 12-14 hours of sleep and pre-schoolers between 3 and 5 years old need 11-13 hours, so if you establish an early bedtime, around 7 pm, your child will likely have an early wake time. Encourage a later start in the day by moving your child’s bedtime to later in the night.You need to give your child time to adjust to a new, later bedtime. Move the bedtime to later in the night in increments, about a quarter of an hour each night (15 minute intervals), until you reach the ideal bedtime. If you would like your child to sleep until 7 am, for example, your child’s bedtime should be around 8 pm. If you would like your child to sleep until 8 am, move your child’s bedtime to 9 pm.
Give your child one to two weeks to adjust her sleep rhythm to the new bedtime. It may take a couple of weeks before you see any shifts in her sleep patterns and until she adjusts fully to her new bedtime.

, If your child is old enough to read numbers, you can use a visual association on her alarm clock to help her remember her wake up time. It’s important that you transition to the new wake time gradually, so start by using a time that is a half hour or 15 minutes after her normal wake time for the first week and moving the number slowly until you reach the new wake time.Set up a digital clock in your child’s room, by her bed.
Take a piece of blank white paper and write the number of her wake time in large print. For example, if her wake time is 7 am, but she tends to get up at 5 am, write “5:30”.
Tape the piece of paper to the digital clock. Place it beside the hour and minute numbers so your child can see both set of numbers.

, Sit down with your child and explain that once the number on the clock matches the number on the piece of paper, she can come and wake you up. But she cannot wake you up any time before or after the number on the piece of paper.After several days to a week, move the number up again so it is a half hour closer to the new wake time. For example, “6”.
Continue to do this over a period of two weeks until you reach the new wake time. Once you reach the new wake time, you can keep the piece of paper on the clock, as this will now be the set wake up time for your child to follow.

, For the first few days, it may be difficult for your child to follow the new wake up time and she may come in to your room before the new wake up time. If this happens, it important that you ask her if the number on the clock matches the number on the piece of paper. If she says no, remind her she is not to come out of bed until the two numbers match.Try to be firm about sending her back to bed until the numbers match, as if you allow her to wake you up, you will be woken up the following morning too early again.

Toddlers and preschoolers can be encouraged to look at a book for a little longer or to finish coloring a picture. Praise young children when they focus well or complete a task without getting distracted.;
, Reading aloud to young children has many benefits, including the fact that it teaches listening and concentration skills. Choose books that are appropriate to the child’s age and developmental level, and try to find stories that will encourage children to pay attention – these are usually stories that entertain, excite, or fascinate (rather than basic ABC books).

, Blocks, puzzles, board games, and memory games all help children develop the ability to focus, pay attention, and see a task through to completion. And these activities are fun, so they do not feel like work to children.

, When young children spend too much time in front of televisions, computers, and video games, they often develop trouble concentrating – in part because their brains become accustomed to this particular form of entertainment (which is often passive entertainment) and struggle to focus without the mesmerizing graphics and flashing lights.


The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends avoiding screen time entirely for children under two and limiting it to no more than one to two hours per day (ideally of higher-quality content) for all children and teenagers.

, Your child should have a designated space for homework and study. A desk in his or her room might be ideal, but you can also set up a study corner in another room. Whatever location you choose, work to make it quiet, peaceful, and free from possible distractions.


You can let your child decorate this space to make it more welcoming.
Try to keep all supplies that are typically necessary for homework at or near this homework station. Every time your child has to get up to retrieve a pencil or more paper or a ruler, he or she may get distracted and lose focus.

, Homework and study should take place on a schedule. Once you establish a designated time for homework and stick to the routine for awhile, your child will be less likely to complain or resist.


Every child and every schedule is different, but ideally, you should give your child some time to decompress before doing homework. If he or she gets home from school at, say, 3:30, wait until 4:30 to begin homework. This gives your child a chance to have a snack, tell you about his or her day, and get rid of some excess energy.
At the very least, plan to let your child have a snack and a drink of water before starting his or her homework. Otherwise, hunger and thirst will be a distraction.







, If your child is getting old enough to bring home a lot of homework, it becomes very important to break this work into manageable chunks and set estimated time frames for completion. Larger projects should be worked on periodically well before their due dates. Children get easily overwhelmed when they see what looks like a mountain of work, so encourage your son or daughter to set small goals and take it one step at a time.

, If your child has a lot of homework, breaks are essential. After your child finishes a particular task or works for an hour straight (or even twenty minutes straight, for a younger child), suggest that he or she take a short break. Offer a piece of fruit and a few minutes of conversation before having your child get back to work.

, You cannot expect your child to focus with the television on and a cell phone in his or her pocket. Make his or her homework time electronics-free (unless a computer is needed for the homework itself), and insist that siblings and anyone else in the house allow your child to concentrate.

, There is no one-size-fits-all policy for focus and attention to homework. Some children work better with music playing (classical works better, since lyrics can often be distracting); others prefer silence. Some children like to talk to you as they work; others like to be alone. Let your child do whatever works best.

, If you work with children in a school setting, you will get the best results by teaching children to participate. Ask questions often. When children are involved, they are more likely to be focused and attentive.

, Children are most likely to stay focused if you speak clearly and slowly (but not too slowly!) and avoid using foreign words or vocabulary that’s too advanced for the grade level. Everyone struggles to pay attention when faced with something basically incomprehensible, and children are no exception.

, If children stop paying attention or wander off, it’s fine to raise your voice to call them back to attention. However, you don’t want to scream at children, and you don’t want to overuse the technique – children will simply tune you out.

, For young children, it can help to have a non-verbal way to call them to attention. Clapping your hands works well, as does snapping your fingers or ringing a bell.

Before starting a project, show them what they will be using and allow them to explore their materials. Let them look at and touch items that engage their senses and open up their self-expression.Have some paper, markers, crayons, paints, buttons, beads, pipe cleaners, fabric, yarn, and other craft items that are safe and engaging for your child.
Use sensory materials like clay or playdough to help them integrate their senses and create at the same time.;
, Create an area for arts and crafts that will excite your toddler. Let them sit down and create to their heart’s content! Making art accessible is a great way to get your child involved. Buy a table and chair that are size-appropriate for your toddler. Keep materials in easy reach so that they can get what they need on their own without your help. As your child gets older, add more crafts and activities.

, Grab some art supplies and have your child watch you draw or paint. Have them guess what you’re drawing. They can watch how you make marks, choose colors, and create something on the page. Ask them for ideas to draw and interpret them in silly or serious ways.Ask your child to copy what they see on their own paper.

, Finger paints are a great way for your toddler to explore creativity, color, and art without having to hold a marker or crayon. They can learn to make dots, squiggles, and lines with their fingers and then transition these skills to using a paintbrush.

Have an easel for your child to easily create art with finger paints.

, Purchase some bath crayons for your toddler. When they are very young, you can use them to draw shapes and patterns and teach colors. Once they are able to hold the crayons, have them copy your pictures or create their own art.Talk about what you’re drawing and let them explore the various elements of your picture.

, Create some fingerprint art by using multiple colored ink pads. Your child can learn about colors while making beautiful creations with their own hands and fingers. Ask your toddler what animals and objects they can make by using their colored thumbprints or fingerprints.Have them place each fingerpad onto a different color then create a rainbow.

, Introduce crayons, markers, and paints to your toddler. Let them create marks, squiggles, and other doodles so they can get used to holding a marker or paintbrush. Encourage them to cover as much of the page as possible, including the edges.Have them draw squiggles then fill in the spaces in with paint.

, Playdough is a great way to express creativity by shaping dough in many different ways. Ask your toddler to make different shapes, foods, animals, trees, etc. with their playdough. They can use cookie cutters to make shapes and build things. Playdough is a great introduction to sculpting and clay., Bring your toddler to a place with lots of art, like a museum. Play “I See...” with one piece of art at a time and notice the textures, colors, people, and objects. Notice as much as you can and share it with your child.If you have multiple children, see which one can find a detail or say what a person is doing first.

, Your community may offer children’s classes for art. Check your local community center or private art studios to see if they have classes geared toward budding artists. Your child can learn art skills and engage their creativity. Best of all, they will come home with projects and pictures for you to praise and display., Have your child’s playmates over for some fun and creation. Have the other children bring different materials and combine them together so that all the children have the opportunity to create, explore, and have fun.For example, throw an art-themed birthday party.

, Whether you see art in a museum, book, or you use your own, create some stories with your toddler. Ask, “What do you think they are doing here? Where are they going?” Discuss the actions in the art and also the feelings that may be occurring or may occur.Have your child draw something and tell you about it. For example, if they draw a monster, ask the monster’s name, favorite food, and where the monster may be going.

, Look for art everywhere you go and point it out. When out in your community, look around for art whether it be sculptures, painting, or street art and show your child. Let them interact with it and find something they appreciate in it.Show your child art books and museums, even if only for small bits of time.

, Use a book’s illustrations to teach your child to interact with pictures. Pick out books from the library that are beautifully illustrated and point out the pictures to your child. Engage with the pictures, ask how the person in the story might feel, look for details, and find ways to anticipate what happens next. If there are hidden details in the illustrations, encourage your child to find them.Stop every few pages and ask questions about the page. For example, say, “Can you find the balloon? Do you see the bunny hiding behind the rock? What can you see?“

, When your child brings home art or makes something at home, praise their work and their effort. Hang their art on the walls, refrigerator, or in their room. This shows them that their art is important.You can also place their art in a folder or cabinet and let them know that you’re saving their art.

Make sure your child eats several hours before bed.,
Minimize day naps to 10-15 minutes.,
Keep your child’s room dark and quiet.,
Let your child entertain herself in bed.,
Encourage your child to do a morning stretch before getting out of bed.",How to Keep Children from Waking up Too Early2," Some children wake up early in the morning due to hunger and have a hard time going back to sleep until they get something to eat. This can then lead to a very early breakfast for your child and for you, and throw off the rest of the day’s meals. Prevent morning hunger by ensuring your child eats a substantial dinner two to three hours before bedtime.You can also prevent an early morning breakfast by putting off breakfast in the morning. Instead of giving your child breakfast as soon as she wakes up, try to postpone giving her breakfast. Do this gradually by waiting ten minutes after your child wakes up to make breakfast. Add on ten minutes each day until you can postpone breakfast for an hour. Your child will be less likely to wake up early for breakfast if she knows she will need to wait anyway for a meal.

, Keep in mind your child only needs 10-12 hours of sleep within 24 hours, and most of those sleeping hours should be done at night. You do not want your child to fulfill her sleep requirements by napping too much during the day. Limit daytime naps so they are only 10-15 minutes at a time and occur once or twice a day.Be sure not to limit napping during the day too much, as you do not want your child to be overly tired by the end of the day.

, Many children are woken up by noise or light in the morning. Minimize the morning light in your child’s room by using thick curtains or shades and making sure they are drawn before your child goes to bed.You should also note if there are any sources of noise, like an appliance in the kitchen, or a rowdy dog sleeping in the hall, that could wake up your child early in the morning. Move the source of noise away from your child’s room so she can sleep in peace. You can also keep your child’s door closed and muffle any outside noise with heavy curtains.
Some parents put the lamp or light in their child’s room on a timer so it does not come on until the child’s wake up time. This can help your child remember when it is time to wake up and ensure she is not woken up before her wake time.

, You can do this at night and in the morning. Give your child some toys to play with or a book to read in bed. Make sure the entertainment is quiet entertainment that does not involve lots of running around or loud noise. Turn off the lights and shut the door, leaving your child to play on her own quietly until she gets tired and goes to bed.Allowing your child to play quietly in bed in the morning will also ensure she does not wake you up too early and will remember to stay in bed until her set wake up time.


Avoid using television as a source of entertainment at night or in the morning for your child. This can lead to a delayed bedtime or a very early wake time, as your child will see television as a reward for waking up very early.
It’s important that you get comfortable with keeping your child waiting in the morning. If she calls out to you, do not go to her right away. Wait five minutes to see if she goes back to sleep or resumes quiet playing on her own. Try to lengthen the wait time in increments of five minutes each morning so your child can get used to occupying herself in the early morning.

, Show your child some basic morning stretches she can do in bed on her own. This way, she can take her time getting out of bed and learn to move slowly, rather than jumping and yelling in the morning.You can make the morning stretches a game, and instruct your child she needs to do a series of stretches before she can come wake you up in the morning. This can give you more time to sleep and ensure your child stays in bed later.

Communicate through touch or cuddling.,
Keep an eye on your tone and body language.,
Try talking, even if the toddler doesn't understand.,
Play some simple games.",How to Interact with Children1," Toddlers will be unable to speak to you, but this doesn't stop them from communicating. Most communication will be done through direct touch. Whenever you notice a toddler crying or yelling, try holding or cuddling them to reassure them.Babies will communicate through their sense of touch, what they see and what they hear.
Always make sure to speak softly and move gently when holding or interacting with a toddler.
Toddlers might not like when someone they don't know well holds them. If the baby starts crying or gets uncomfortable, try handing them back to someone they are familiar with.;
, Babies will be highly receptive to both your tone and your body language. If you are acting nervous, impatient, or tense, the baby will likely pick up on that and feel uncomfortable. Always make sure you are moving or speaking in a calm and gentle manner when interacting with a toddler.Your feelings may affect your body language and tone. Make sure you're in a calm, collected and reassuring mood when holding or speaking to a toddler.
Don't shout or use sharp tones near a toddler.

, It doesn't matter if a toddler can understand the words you are saying to them. Speaking to a baby is a great way for them to begin associating emotions with words and sounds. Go ahead and talk with a baby, either in the simple noises they make or regular speech to help them feel comfortable., Toddlers will be full of energy and playing a simple game with them can be a great way to interact. There are many basic games that you can play with a toddler to help keep them engaged and entertained. Try playing some of these games with toddlers to make your time together a lot of fun:Try playing games that repeat sounds or words. Reciting a simple nursery rhyme is also a good idea.
You could both sit on the floor and roll a ball to one another.
Build something together with blocks.
Get imaginative by playing with dolls or stuffed animals.

Keep things simple.,
Ask for their help when dealing with a problem.,
Make sure you offer your full attention.,
Help kids learn from mistakes.,
Have fun with some games and activities.,
Learn how to respond to questions.",How to Interact with Children2," Whenever you are offering a choice or an explanation, you'll want to keep things easy to understand. Going into too much detail or offering too many options can both confuse or frustrate a preschooler. Always try to keep things as clear and simple as you can when speaking to a preschooler to help them understand whatever it is you're trying to convey.For example, offering a child a menu of more than three items for lunch might be too much for them. Try to keep the options simple and limited in number.
If a child asks you “Why is it raining?”, try responding with something simple like “When enough water goes into a cloud, it gets too heavy and has to fall back down.”

, Trying to understand what made a preschooler upset can be a challenge. It's easier if you involve them in the conversation and have them help you learn exactly what is causing a problem. Try to use your questions to find out what made them upset and why, before reassuring them that everything will be better. For example, if a child was stung by a bee, you might ask questions like “Did something hurt you?”, “Was it a bug or an animal?”, “Do you know what kind of bug?” and “Was it a bee?”
Asking questions is a good way to involve the child, get clear information from them and help them to understand their own situation with more clarity.

, Preschoolers are excited about the world and will often demand your attention to share something with you. To help keep them happy, it's a good idea to always take at least a moment to acknowledge something they have to say. If you can't interact with them at the time, it's okay to briefly explain why and let them know that you'll be available soon., Children are always learning. Because of this, children will also often make mistakes. These mistakes are all valuable learning opportunities, allowing a child to correct their actions and do better next time. Always try to turn any mistakes into helpful lessons when you are spending time with children.Help children discuss their feelings after an outburst, conflict or argument.
Try asking the child to calm down and use their words to describe their feelings and explain why they acted the way they did.
Let the child know that it's okay to feel upset or angry, but that their way of expressing that feeling was inappropriate.
If a child had difficulty with some activity, try showing them another way of doing it and encouraging them as they make another attempt.

, Preschoolers will love to play and having a few games ready can help make your time together a lot of fun. Keeping kids busy with a fun activity can also help them to channel their energy and keep them from causing mischief elsewhere. Check out some of these examples of activities that you can try together:Try throwing a tea party. You can invite stuffed animals or other caretakers to join in.
You can pretend to cook a meal together.
Try singing songs together or reading a book to them.
You could build a pillow or blanket fort together.
Try letting them cut out pictures they like from old magazines and making a collage. Remember to use safety scissors.

, Young children are highly inquisitive and want to learn all they can about the world around them. At this age, they will also be able to speak well enough to throw more than a few questions your way. Knowing how to answer and deal with a preschooler's questions can help you make the most of your time together.Keep your answers short and simple.
Don't get nervous if a child asks an odd or inappropriate question. Try to remain calm and answer the question as fairly and factually as you can.
Young children are often focused on physical characteristics and may make remarks about someone's appearance. Try to answer any questions of this sort as directly as you can.
For example, if a child asks “Why is your finger so crooked?”, you could reply by saying something like “I have arthritis. It's something some adults can get and it can make your joints look like mine.”
If a child keeps asking the question “Why?”, try to ask them to answer their own question. For example, if a child asks you something like “Why is the sky blue?”, you could respond with “Why do you think it's blue?”

Avoid speaking to a child as if they were a baby.,
Let them have a bit of control.,
Take their questions seriously.,
Respect each child as an individual.,
Find a fun activity or game to play.",How to Interact with Children3," School age children won't want to be treated like children. Kids in this age group will appreciate it if you speak to them in a mature way and will be excited to show off their speaking skills. Talking down to children may actually annoy them and make interacting with them more difficult. Always try speaking to school age children with mature language to help them feel respected and acknowledged. If a child doesn't understand what a word means, they will usually be happy to have it explained to them.
Scolding or nagging children this age will likely only cause trouble. Instead, simply let your expectations be known and ask them how they plan to meet them.

, School age children will want to begin exerting some of their own control in life. Allowing them some basic responsibilities or a chance to plan their schedules can be a good way to interact with school age children.You might let a child decide what time of day they sit down to do their homework.
You can try letting them decide how much help they want with their homework.
Letting a child make some of their own choices can be a good thing. However, you should be ready to say no to something if it is unreasonable.

, Children between the ages of six and eleven will want to be taken seriously by the adults around them. Even if you already know the answer to a question they might ask, it's a good idea to take a moment and appear as though you are thinking about it. Showing this consideration can help a child feel like their thoughts, questions and opinions are being considered and taken seriously.For example, a child might ask you if they can eat ice cream for breakfast. You already know they can't, but it can be a good idea to say something like “Hmmmm. No, I don't think that's the best choice. Let's think of another thing to eat.”
You can also try asking a child to repeat the question to show that you are interested in what they have to say and make them feel like they are being heard.

, Showing a child respect and giving them your full attention will help build a positive relationship. Children are individuals and want to be treated as such. Making eye contact and speaking directly with a child can help them learn how to engage with adults and will make them feel that they are being heard and addressed. Whenever you are caring for a child, try speaking with them in a way that you would want to be spoken to. Giving a child your full attention will make them feel acknowledged.
Try to let a child speak fully before speaking to them. This can be a way to model good conversational habits.

, Children of all ages love to play and school age children are no different. However, school age children generally won't like the same activities that younger children might and may want to do something more involved. Try looking over some of these example activities to help make your time together fun for both of you:You could try building a race track by laying down lines of painters tape to mark “the road”.
Play a game of animal charades and try to guess which animal the other is pretending to be.
You could both build an indoor obstacle course. Try leaping over pillows, crawling under string, balancing a ball on your head or any number of safe, homemade obstacles.
Try building something out of popsicle sticks or cardboard.
Play some simple card games or work on a puzzle together.

Offer plenty of praise and acknowledgement.,
Create a structured environment.,
Know which toys are safe.,
Model appropriate behavior.",How to Interact with Children4," Offering praise is a great way to make a child feel accomplished and rewarded for good behavior. Children are always seeking feedback regarding their actions and giving them that feedback can be a meaningful way of interacting with them. Always let children know that you are aware of the positive things they've done.For example, if a child drew an interesting picture, you could offer praise and let them know how much you enjoy the artwork.
If a child shares an interesting story with you, thank them and let them know how fascinating the story was.

, Children learn well and feel comfortable in orderly and stable environments. These structured environments will help children focus, relax, behave and learn. Try to create an organized environment and clear rules whenever you are caring for a child.If you regularly care for a child, building a schedule and sticking to it can help them feel comfortable.
Try to involve children in the creation of schedules. Ask them what activity they would like to do and when they would like to do it.
Make sure you provide any items or materials for activities you might do together.
Work with the children to create rules. This can help them feel involved and will make the rules clear.

, Not all toys will be appropriate for playtime, depending on the age of the child. For many small or young children, most toys could present a choking hazard. Always make sure that whatever toys you are playing with are age appropriate. Take a look at some of these guidelines to help you safely play with the child you're caring for:Children up to 1 year old can play with rattles, teething toys, stacking toys or picture books.
Children between 1 and 3 years old can play with simple puzzles, crayons, picture books or small wagons.
Children 3 to 5 years old might enjoy playing with puppets, storybooks or simple board games.
Children who are between 6 and 9 years old can play with bikes, sports equipment, books, crafts and more complex board games.

, Children learn by watching what others do and emulating that behavior. To help a child learn good behaviors, you'll want to model the actions you want them to copy. Whenever you are with a child, always embody the behaviors, attitudes and manners that you want the child to adopt.Modeling can show children how to do things. For example, if a child sees you stacking a pile of blocks, they may begin learning how to stack blocks on their own.
Be careful with your language. Children will often emulate the speech of the adults around them.
Modeling is the best way to teach by example.

Help your child to give their emotions a name.,
Have your toddler express himself with “I” sentences and give him cues.,
Use role play to act out various emotions and reactions.,
Play a game where you make a face and ask your toddler what you are feeling.,
Sing a song about emotions and their actions.,
Read books that help you teach emotions to your toddler.,
Help your child to recognize emotions in others.,
Deal with temper tantrums in a calm, controlled manner.,
Remove the child from the situation if he or she will not calm down.,
Have a discussion about what happened.,
Take steps to defuse tantrums before they begin.,
Ask your child what calms them down.",How to Help Your Toddler Express Their Feelings," One of the main reasons that toddlers get so upset is that they do not have a name for what they are feeling. Helping them to give their emotions a name will allow them to express themselves plus expand their growing vocabulary as well.


Knowing the names for their emotions will help toddlers become ready for the transition to preschool as well. It will be even more important for your toddler to be able to express themselves through words when they are angry or frustrated with the other children they are exposed to.
Keep the emotional names simple and direct: mad, sad and happy are good starter words for your toddler to master.;
, You can ask reflective questions to help the toddler decide the emotion he is feeling at the moment. For example:


“Are you mad because Billy has the toy you wanted? Do you feel sad that Billy had to go home?”
Once the child has figured out the correct emotion, you can discuss ways to help him feel better.

, Let your toddler come up with a specific scenario and then ask them which emotions would correspond to it.


For example, the child might suggest a scenario where he does something mean to his little brother or sister, causing the little brother or sister to be sad and mom to get angry.
This exercise not only helps to work on emotional identification skills but increases creativity and language development skills as well.

, You can also make a face and then have your toddler make the same face. As they get better at the game, you can keep a neutral face and then have your child make the face themselves, then you have to guess.

, The most common song about emotions is “If You’re Happy and You Know It”, but there are plenty of other songs that deal with different emotions, which you can find on parenting sites online. These songs allow you to go through all of the emotions and possible physical reactions.

, Reading stories is a great way to discuss the topic of emotions, and many books also have illustrations that will help the child to make a visual connection.


""Zero to Three"", a web based resource site, has a listing of books about emotions and feelings perfect for this age group.

, While you can point out emotions while you are running errands with your toddler, having them point at strangers and announce that “That man is mad!” may be embarrassing.


An even better and less public idea is to use magazine articles or online pictures showing various emotions.
Let your toddler tell you what emotion the face is conveying and then ask them questions such as “Why is the baby sad?”

, The terrible twos is so named because this is the age when tempers and angry outbursts become more common. When a child of this age is upset they may have no idea of how to express themselves and even if they do have the names for their emotions, they may not have the maturity to self-calm and then express themselves.


If a child is upset already, the littlest thing could send them over the edge into a full blown tantrum. Things like being overly tired, hungry or bored can also cause behavioral upsets and often happen at places like the grocery store.
It is important to handle the behavior with as much calm as possible without making it worse, but without ignoring it either. The worst thing you can do is give in to the behavior itself.
Never reward negative behavior just to avoid an embarrassing situation. You will only reinforce that the behavior works and that it should be repeated in the future.

, Quietly tell the child that you understand that he is upset but that you will have to remove him from the situation until he calms down.


If you whisper the child will have to stop screaming long enough to hear you. This may be enough to defuse the situation. If it does not, be prepared to carry through with your words - carry the child out of the store or wherever you are.
If the child is flailing and carrying him will be dangerous to yourself or others, give him a moment, while monitoring him closely to make sure that he is not going to harm himself or cause any damage in his anger.
Once he has tired out slightly you should be able to pick him up and remove him from the area without a problem.

, When the child has calmed down, speak to him about what happened, again, remaining as calm as possible. Use emotion words like “angry” “upset” but do not use the word “tantrum”. Do not minimize the child's feelings at all.


Talk about expectations for the next time you go out and how you can help the child to meet those expectations.

, Being two is kind of a rough deal. Not a baby but not a big kid, children in this age group can find themselves overwhelmed, especially when they are not feeling their best.


Be prepared with snacks, toys or other items to ward off any potential behavior problems.
As soon as the child starts being fussy or acting up remind them of their behavior and what your expectations are.
Give them a task to do to derail the train of thought that could take them to tantrum town.

, For some it is a favorite toy or a blanket. A teddy bear (or other stuffed animal) can be the perfect way to help a toddler learn self-calming techniques.


Tell your toddler to tell the teddy bear how he is feeling when he is angry or upset.
When you see your toddler getting emotionally worked up remind him to “talk to the teddy bear”.

Limit visits from extended family.",How to Welcome an Adopted Baby Into the Family," So you've gone through the long, drawn-out adoption process, signed all the paperwork, and now all that's left to do is wait for your baby to arrive. While you wait, there are an abundance of things to think and read about, so you can be as prepared as possible when you finally bring your new baby girl or boy home.


Get your hands on some well-respected adoption books that can walk you through the different stages of the adoption process and give you an idea of what to expect once your baby is with you.
Read about other adoptive parents' experiences on adoption blogs or forums to gain some first-hand insight into the highs and lows of raising an adopted child.
Find out as much as you possibly can about your baby's family history, background and culture (if you are adopting internationally). This will help you to understand where your child is coming from, allowing you to ease their transition into their new life.
Think about the style of parenting you're going to use and have a plan for how you are going to deal with potential complications or issues that arise as your baby develops.
Realize that no amount of reading and research will prepare you 100% for the reality of bringing your baby home. Accept that not everything will go according to plan and that you must continue to learn as you go along.;
, If you already have children -- adopted or biological -- it is vital that you prepare them for the arrival of their new little brother or sister. ""Surprising"" them with a new sibling is not recommended.


Many children can feel threatened by the sudden arrival of a new addition to the family. They may feel jealous of the attention the baby is receiving and develop hostile feelings towards him/her as a result. This is the case even when the new sibling is born biologically.
The best way to prepare for this is to educate your existing children about the adoption process and emotionally prepare them for the arrival of their new sibling. Let them know that the new baby is something they should be excited about, not something to fear or dread.
Let them know that you will still love them just as much and even though things will be a little busy from now on, you will still have plenty of time for them.
There are many great children's books out there specifically geared towards teaching kids about the adoption process and what to expect once their new sibling arrives.

, There are so many baby products on the market that it is easy to become overwhelmed. You will either end up buying everything, or putting the baby shopping off for as long as possible. Here are some guidelines on what items are absolutely essential for your baby's arrival, and what can wait til later:



Baby clothes: Obviously having a substantial stock of baby clothes is important - but let's not go too crazy - your baby will not need a princess outfit or miniature cowboy boots the second they arrive at your door. Stick with the essentials - plenty of comfy, cozy baby grows, an arsenal of bibs, some warm, cotton hats and baby booties. If the baby you are adopting has yet to be born, stick with gender-neutral colors such as yellow, red or green - the gender is never 100% certain until the baby arrives!

Feeding supplies: There are tons of different types of baby bottles on the market, each slightly different from the next. Your baby might prefer one type to the other, so choose a selection of three or four different types and buy a couple of each. You can buy more once you figure out your baby's preference. You will also need to buy baby formula. Don't waste time fretting about the different varieties, ask a pediatrician for a recommendation and just go with that. You will also need lots of burping cloths, as babies tend to spit up a lot!

Hygiene supplies: You will need diapers - and lots of them. Choose an appropriate size for the age of the baby you are adopting. If you are adopting a newborn baby, buy both preemie size and the next size up, just to be prepared. You will also need a supply of wipes or cotton wool, some baby shampoo/soap, baby lotion and a washcloth.

Equipment: The most important piece of equipment to get is a car seat, as you will need it to transport your new baby home. If you are collecting your baby from the hospital, you will not be allowed to leave the hospital without an adequate infant restraint system. You should also get a baby sling or wearable carrier - this way you can have your baby close to you at all time, but keep your hands free. You will also need a crib and blankets, which you should place in your own bedroom for the baby's arrival., If you're not bringing your baby home from the hospital yourselves, it is a good idea to make an appointment with a pediatrician for as soon after your baby arrives as possible. This way you can have your baby thoroughly checked out and ease any concerns you might have about the baby's health or development.


This is particularly important if you are adopting a baby from a foreign country, and even more important if the baby is coming from an orphanage or foster home where parasites or other illnesses are common.
Many babies are brought home with respiratory viruses or other infections. These are usually minor and can easily be treated, but it is best to consult a child specialist as quickly as possible.Aside from any obvious health issues, the doctor will be able to check the baby's weight and height (which can sometimes be lower than previously reported) to make sure he/she is developing properly.
Depending on the age of the baby, the doctor may also check the baby's cognitive development and make sure she responds normally to external stimuli.
If there are any issues, you will then be able to take medically-recommended steps to restore the baby to full health and get his/her development back on track.

, It is completely natural to be impatient for your adopted baby's arrival and to be counting down the days until you can hold her in your arms. However, it is important to be aware of the fact that your life is about to change forever and that once the baby arrives you will have very little time to yourself.


Now is the time to do things you enjoy, like going out for dinner, going to see a movie, meeting up with friends, taking a trip - basically anything that won't be an option after the baby arrives (at least for a while).
Spend some quality time with your partner - there will be a lot more pressures and responsibilities placed on you once the baby arrives, and this can put tension on even the strongest of relationships - especially if this is your first child. You and your partner need to work as a team - so make sure you are in a strong, secure, loving place before the baby arrives.
If you already have children, you should take this waiting period as an opportunity to spend more time with them and concentrate on making them feel special and loved. Despite your best intentions, you won't have as much time to spend with them once the new baby arrives, so make an effort to give them some one-on-one attention while you still can., When it comes to adopting a baby, the best policy you can follow is to prepare for the worst, hope for the best and be satisfied with anything in between. You are bound to have your ups and downs - so make sure to keep an open mind and be ready for whatever life throws at you.


Each family's adoption experience is different - so it's impossible to be 100% prepared for what's ahead. Just be mindful of the fact that there are guaranteed difficulties ahead - whether your baby has sleeping issues, you have difficulty bonding with her or you just find the whole experience overwhelming.
However, also know that there will be moments of genuine joy in the weeks, months and years ahead and that no matter what obstacles are thrown in your path, you and your new baby will overcome them together., Adopting a baby can be an overwhelming experience and many parents of newly adopted children can feel stressed out, frustrated, exhausted or even depressed.


This is normal, so don't be ashamed to give yourself a break and ask for help if you need it. Support groups that cater for the parents of adopted children can provide excellent emotional support and help you to feel less alone.
Also check for local, non-profit organisations that provide counseling and education for adoptive families.
If you feel sad, irritable or constantly tired, you may be suffering from post-adoption depression (PAD) which is common among parents of newly adopted children. See your doctor or an adoption counselor for advice., The most important thing you can do for your new baby is to be there for them whenever they need you, any time of night or day.


You need to become 100% dependable in your child's eyes, by responding to them either verbally or physically whenever they cry or call out for you.This is particularly important for older babies who have spent time in an orphanage or foster care. They may be accustomed to no one responding when they cry, so you need to earn their trust by showing them that you will always come when they need you.
It is not a good idea to let adopted babies cry when they wake at night. They need to feel loved and secure, so go to them within 15 seconds to hug and comfort them, or keep them in your bedroom until they have fully adjusted to their new surroundings.
You want your baby to take you for granted, to fully expect that you will come when they cry. This is how they will come to see you as their mother or father, and not just another caregiver., Beyond just being there for your baby when they need you, it is important that you shower the baby with affection and love, which can be achieved through physical contact.


Hold your baby as often as possible, rocking her, cuddling her, feeding her. Hold the baby in your arms whenever you can and never leave her unattended in a crib or baby seat for long periods of time.
Make eye contact with the baby while you feed her or rock her in your arms - this will help to establish a bond between the two of you.
Smile at the baby whenever she looks at you and talk to her in a soothing, loving voice. In time, she will come to associate these actions with safety and love, and will learn to respond in kind.
If you are busy, place the baby in a sling and carry her against your chest so she can hear your heartbeat and become accustomed to your scent.

, A predictable daily routine will allow your baby to feel safe and secure, while helping to minimize the stress many newly-adopted babies experience when they find themselves in a new home.


Completing certain actions, such as bottle time, nap time, bath time and play time, at the same times each day can increase your baby's confidence and help her to feel safe.
Try to narrate these activities as you do them. When she wakes up in the morning, tell her what the plan is for that day. Even if she can't understand the words, she will come to associate your voice with these nurturing, repetitive actions.
To enable this to work properly, you will need to take several weeks once the baby arrives to just stay at home and establish the routine, without any distractions or disruptions.
Keep things low-key - avoid bringing the baby around to different houses, to the shopping center or to the park, and limit the number of visitors you have at your house - at least for a few weeks. The baby needs to feel secure and home, which she will find impossible if her surroundings are constantly changing.
Despite the need for routine, it is important to remain flexible within the familiar structure. Learn to respond to your child's cues - if you hear her hungry cry, then feed her; don't wait until the assigned feeding time.

, Keep in mind that forming a deep bond with your baby will take time. Yes, you may fall in love with them instantly, but that love will continue to grow and deepen over time.


Sometimes the baby will not respond to you in the way that you'd hoped. They may refuse to make eye contact, turn their head away from you when you speak to them, or else become very clingy and upset around you.
If this happens, don't despair. Keep treating the child with love, patience and affection and they will eventually come around.
Keep in mind that you have had months, perhaps even years, to prepare for welcoming this baby into your home. You probably loved her before you ever set eyes on her. But for the baby, everything was probably very sudden and she will need time to adjust to her new home and to accept you as her parent.
Earning your adopted baby's love and trust will be one of the most rewarding experiences of your life.

, If you have prepared your other children for the arrival of the new baby, they will probably be dying to meet their little brother or sister. Make the introduction in a calm, controlled environment with just the immediate family members present.


Some kids can have unrealistic expectations about what the baby will be like - they may expect to be able to play with her and treat her like a doll.
The baby might have other ideas however, and become scared or overwhelmed by all the attention.
As a result, it is best to warn older kids that their new sibling will be shy and that they will have to be very kind and gentle towards her.

, Remember that the introduction of a new sibling can cause existing children to feel threatened or neglected. A good way to overcome this and create positive feelings between your child and new baby is to present the child with a gift ""from his little sister/brother"".


Children under four can be especially taken with this, and it can be enough to change their mind about whether the new addition is worth keeping!
If the adopted baby is from a foreign or exotic country, it can be a nice idea to choose a gift associated with that country's culture.
You can also get gifts for your existing child or children to present to the new baby, or encourage them to create a card or poster welcoming her into the family.

, It is important that your existing children don't feel left out or neglected after the arrival of the new baby. All children want to feel special and loved, and it's your job as a parent to make them feel this way.


You can do this by spending one-on-one time with each child individually, even if it's just a simple trip to the park or playing a game together. You want your older child to feel like they are still a key member of the family, worthy of your undivided attention.
Even though it's natural that you want your existing child and newly adopted child to bond, its important to realize that they do not need to spend all of their time together. Let their relationship evolve naturally., Don't worry if your older child doesn't feel an immediate bond with your new baby. This is completely normal, even with biological siblings. Bonding takes time -- it does not happen overnight.


To help the process along, let your older child spend plenty of time around the new baby, holding her and playing with her. Also be sure to emphasize the importance of his/her role as an older brother or sister.
If the adopted baby is a newborn, take comfort in the fact that she will have absolutely no awareness of any potential negative feelings coming from the older child. She will grow up loving her older brother or sister as naturally as a biological child would.
The older child may take slightly longer to adjust to his/her new sibling, but this is to be expected. Once he or she has adjusted to the new family dynamic, the sibling bond will begin to develop and any past uncertainties should disappear.

, One of the hardest, yet most important things to remember when you bring your new baby home is to limit her exposure to people outside the immediate family for the first few weeks.


Your baby needs time to accept you as a parent -- a process which requires as much physical contact and one-on-one interaction as possible. She needs to learn to recognize your smell, your voice and the feel of your arms in order to imprint on you and develop that unshakable bond between parent and baby.
In order to form this all-important parent-child bond, you will need to be the only one (along with your partner) to meet her needs -- including feeding, bathing, dressing and comforting.
If the baby is passed around from relation to relation and exposed to a barrage of new faces, voices and smells all at once, she will have difficulty in identifying you as her number-one caregiver and parent. This is particularly important for babies adopted from orphanages or foster homes who may be accustomed to receiving care from multiple people.
This can be difficult for extended family members to accept -- especially for those who may have waited with your for months or even years and are dying to meet their new niece/nephew/grandchild. Try to explain the situation to them before the baby arrives and impress on them the importance of this one-on-one bonding time with your baby. This way, even if they are not pleased, they should understand.Tell them that if they want to help out, they can help you with things like laundry, preparing meals, or babysitting your other kids. Do not be too proud to accept this help if your need it.
Once the first couple of weeks have passed and the bond with your baby has been established, you can slowly start to introduce other family member into her life.

"
"
Introduce yourself by the name you would like the child to use.,
Take the child on a tour of the house, including their new room.,
Give the child a welcome book.,
Provide a welcome basket for the child.,
Have comfort foods ready to offer the child.,
Prepare familiar meals for the child.,
Share the house rules and expectations.,
Warn the child before you enforce your expectations.,
Give the child house chores to do.,
Discuss the child’s school options.,
Ask for the child’s input in family activities and plans.,
Do not expect the child to fit in right away.,
Support the child if they are required to go to therapy.,
Focus on creating positive memories with the child.",How to Welcome a Foster Child," Your welcome begins as soon as the caseworker walks into the home with the foster child. Use a soft, friendly voice to greet the caseworker and the child. Introduce yourself by the name you would like the child to use when referring to you. Do not insist the child call you “Mom” or “Dad,” as this will be confusing to the child. Instead, add a “Miss” or “Mister” to your first name, such as “Mrs. Sandra” or “Mr. Keith.”You may also offer the child a few options on how to address you. Doing this will give the child the power to choose and make his or her own decision.
If there are other members of the household, you should introduce them as well or allow each person to introduce themselves. The child should not be expected to call other members of the household “sister” or “brother.” Instead, use first names.;
, You should then take the child on a tour of the house, from the kitchen to the living room to the upstairs bedrooms. You should also make sure the child’s new room is ready and set up. Keep their room or area of a room simple and clean, providing a bed, a bedside table, and a bureau or closet. You may also set up a desk in the room, if available.Include fresh bedding on the bed and keep the walls bare. Tell they child they can decorate the walls how they sees fit and make the room their own.
You may include a personal detail based on information you received previously about the child. Maybe the caseworker shared that the child loves a certain sports team or is a big reader. You may then include a poster of the child’s favorite sports team or a stack of books in their room.
You may also include a night light for the child, especially if the child is younger. Some foster children have a hard time sleeping in the dark in a new space.

, To really make the child feel welcome, you may create a “welcome to your new home” book. The book could include photographs of your family and brief biographical information about your family. Try to make the book feel welcoming and specific to the child by including the child’s name in the book.You may also include photographs of each room in the house, including information on what the foster child can and cannot do in each room. You can include a list of the house rules in the book so the child can read them on their own. This can be a good way to set boundaries and rules for the child early.

, Another option is to create a welcome basket for the child. The basket could be filled with new clothing, books, small toys, and photograph frames. These items could help the child to feel welcome and comfortable in your home. Giving the child a basket of items also gives them a chance to claim items that are their own in their new home. This can feel empowering for the child and give them a sense of ownership.The empty photograph frames are a good option as they give the child a chance to frame any pictures they may have of their biological family or any close friends. Over time, the child may also decide to put a photograph of you and your family in the frame.

, The smell of freshly baked cookies or pizza warming in the oven can be a real comfort for a child in a new environment. Have a tray of cookies on hand or pop pizzas in the oven while you give the child a tour so they will be ready by the time the tour is done. Comfort food can really ease the stress of being in a new environment for the child.Try to share a meal with the child and the family on the first night. Encourage everyone who lives in the house to come to the dinner or meal. This will help the child to feel comfortable and give them a sense of the routines in the house.

, Eating meals may be a big routine in your home and it can be a good way to reinforce bonding and comfort with the child. You may need to teach the child table manners and healthy eating gradually so they can adapt. Do this by first sticking to the diet the child is used to and prepare comfort foods. This may mean making fast food or processed foods for the first week so the child can feel comfortable and less nervous at the table.Over time, you can start to teach the child to choose healthier food options. You can also reinforce table manners and etiquette at the table. Do not rush and be patient, as the child may need time to get used to these expectations.

, Try to sit down with the child and establish the house rules on the first day. Lay out your top five No-No’s in your home so the child is aware of your expectations.For example, your first rule may be to give everyone in the house privacy and not touch or talk about other people’s bodies in inappropriate ways. You may also have a rule where no one hits or speaks unkindly to anyone in the house. You may say, “In this house, we talk to each other with respect and kindness. We listen and we do not interrupt.”
You may also ask the child for their own set of expectations and rules. If some of their rules do not align with yours, gently explain that in your home, this is how it is done.

, Avoid discussing consequences with the child until an incident occurs. Try to deal with the incident by reminding the child of your expectations and by giving out a warning. You may then enforce the consequences if the child disobeys you even after you have given the warning.Do not hit or spank the child, as this can be triggering for the child. Try to treat the child as you would any other children in your home. Be firm and reinforce consequences for bad behavior, but be reasonable and never be violent with the child.

, Make the child feel part of the family by giving them house chores during their first week in the home. These could be simple, easy chores like wiping the table after a meal or helping to wash the dishes. This will show the child that they have the same responsibilities as everyone else in the house and make them feel like an active member of the family.You may also ask the child if they feel comfortable doing certain house chores. Give the child options and allow them to choose from two to three chores. This will give her or him the ability to decide what they feel most comfortable doing in their new environment.

, You should also sit down with the child and discuss their schooling. Most foster children will be required to enroll in school right away as it helps them adjust. You may ask the child if they will be okay going to the same school as the other children and if they had any special interests or needs at their previous school.You may also gently let the child know that they have to attend school and work hard in school to be a member of the household. Most foster children qualify for special benefits and assistance at school, depending on the school and state or area.

, You can also make the child feel welcome by asking for input on upcoming family trips or activities. This will help them feel like they have a voice in the house.Doing this can also allow you to get to know the child better, as they may suggest a surprising and interesting family activity or plan. Get them involved in the decision making in the home so they feels their opinion matters.

, Remember that the child is likely frightened, uncomfortable, and confused when they walk into your home. They may also be angry or upset at being in a new environment. It is important that you are patient and understanding with the child. Give the child time to get used to the routines and habits of their new home. Over time, they should start to feel like they belong.As the child's new guardian, you may also need to reinforce feelings of welcome and comfort toward the child on a daily basis. You are building a relationship with the child over time, so focus on being understanding and considerate of the child’s needs.

, Most foster children will need to attend weekly therapy sessions with a therapist as part of their foster care. You may have the option of having school based therapy for the child or home based therapy. School based therapy happens at school, where the child is pulled out of class or lunch once a week for a therapy session. Home based therapy requires the therapist to visit the child once a week at home.Both options allow you to save time by not having to commute every week for the child’s sessions. It also gives you more time to spend with the child and more time for the child to spend with the family.
If home based or school based therapy is not an option, you may have to take the child to therapy sessions at a facility or a therapy office. You should make a plan with the child so the therapy day is in their schedule. Try not to miss any of these appointments and bring the child to the sessions on time, as this will show that you are supporting the child's need for therapy.

, Perhaps one of the biggest ways you can foster comfort and welcome is to focus on building memories that are positive for the child. You may take photographs of the child spending time with the family and with you. You may also document big moments in the child’s life, such as their first day at their new school or their first family outing. Doing this will help to build a long term relationship with the child that is positive and sustaining."

Familiarize yourself with the components of fitness.,
Assess your child's fitness level.,
Learn of the anatomical and physiological differences between children and adults.,
Develop a childhood fitness plan for your child.,
Set a good example.",How to Improve Your Child's Fitness," Childhood fitness is multifaceted, encompassing a number of aspects having to do with health and well-being.


Flexibility pertains to the body's range of motion. The goal of flexibility training is to have maximum range of motion without pain or stiffness.
Strength refers to the amount of weight the muscles can push, pull or support. However, strength training also strengthens the bones.
Cardiovascular endurance is the heart's ability to withstand extended periods of activity.
Muscular endurance is the amount of time the muscles can withstand pushing, pulling or supporting weight.
Body composition is the amount (or percentage) of fat versus non-fat (bone, skin, muscle, etc.) in the body.;
, This will help you identify your child's strengths and weaknesses and give you a good starting point for developing an effective child fitness plan.


Gather tools that will help you take accurate measurements of your child's current fitness level. These tools include a scale, treadmill, stopwatch, metronome, blood pressure scope, stethoscope, exercise mat, stadiometer, yardstick, anthropometric tape, skin fold caliper and a course (outlined with cones or other marking materials).
Use the tools to test your child's fitness level in each component of fitness: strength, flexibility, cardiovascular endurance, muscular endurance and body composition.
Record the measurements so that you can refer back to them as your child's fitness level progresses. This data will not only provide encouragement for your child, but it will also help you identify areas in which your child may be able to improve.
Consult with a qualified personal trainer if you need guidance for how to perform a child fitness assessment, or if you do not have all of the necessary tools.

, This is necessary to your child's safety. Keep in mind that every child is different, and that your child may be strong in some areas and weak in other areas.


Because children grow in spurts, they are always in the process of acclimation and may lack coordination. This makes them more vulnerable to injury, and any plan to improve child fitness should account for childhood growth patterns.
Children's core muscles those muscles in the hips, back and abdomen area are not fully developed and are therefore weaker than the core muscles of adults. Core muscles serve to stabilize the entire body and a lack of core strength can compromise fitness in children by making children susceptible to injury.
Children often lack flexibility, which is an integral part of fitness and a preventative factor when it comes to injury. Therefore, flexibility training should be incorporated into any childhood fitness program.

, It should be based on the dimensions of fitness, your assessment of your child's fitness level and your knowledge of the anatomical and physiological differences between adults and children.


Begin by considering hobbies and interests your child has, as well as your child's natural skills and talents. For example, if your child has an interest in the martial arts, then karate lessons may be a good idea; if your child thrives in social situations, then you might want to consider team sports.
Incorporate a variety of activities into the fitness plan. This not only keeps the routine fun and challenging for your child, but it also ensures that you are addressing each of the aspects of fitness mentioned above.
Your child fitness plan should include 60 minutes of physical activity every day, incorporating 3 total hours of strength training (for muscles and bones) per week.

, Your child will mimic your behavior; therefore, if you focus on developing good fitness habits, you will influence your child in that regard.

, You can choose to focus on domestic adoptions, international adoptions, or a combination. The costs and steps you need to establish the adoption agency will vary depending on the type of agency you set up.

, Consider the office space and supplies, computer, and Internet connection as well as necessary permits and licensing needed to become legal.


The computer and Internet connection can help you to advertise your business and to connect with families who are looking to adopt. You can also network with medical facilities and social services to locate children in need of adoption.

, You will need employees and a lawyer to help you with legal aspects. You should also have a social worker on your staff to help with other issues you may not be qualified to address on your own.

First and foremost, many hold the belief that all children are psychic-- that we are born psychic and stay that way until we are told over and over that it is all in our imagination, or to stop making things up.",How to Help Your Psychic Child Understand Their Gifts1," Then we slowly back away from our gifts that seem to make our parents/friends so nervous and angry. It is important to understand that most times it is not all in your imagination and you are not making it all up.


Parents: If your child is exhibiting any or all of the following, please don’t make light of it. Please don’t tell them they have a vivid imagination. These are only a few of the signs to watch for. These children don’t need you to “say” you believe them; they need for you to actually believe them because 9 times out of 10 they are telling the truth. What do you do about it? Well, if you yourself have experienced these things and are Psychic also, you know what your child is going through and can act accordingly. If you have not, then it’s time to get busy! Look for some of the following things:;
"
"
Learn how to enclose themselves in a safety bubble.,
Teach your child to tell the spirits to go away.,
Teach your child to talk to angels.,
Help your child get a handle on his/her gifts by practicing using them.,
Make time to listen and discuss their experiences.",How to Help Your Psychic Child Understand Their Gifts2," You need to be sure your child knows how to enclose itself in a big safety bubble. Just have them visualize (kids are real good at this) their bodies completely surrounded in a bright sunlight gold bubble.

, Your child needs to know they can come to you at any time with fears of what they are seeing/feeling/hearing. Tell them if they are afraid of the spirits, they should tell the spirits out loud and strongly to go away! Most spirits are only showing themselves to the child because they know the child can see them.

, If your child believes in the Angels, this will help immensely. Have them talk out loud to the Angels. Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, Uriel, etc. Have them talk about their feelings of fear and ask the Angels to watch over them and help them.

, a) Picture something in your mind and write it down. Tell your child to guess what it is. Do the same the other way around. b) Have your child draw who/what they see. c) Walk in a park and hug a tree with your child (sounds silly, but it really helps). Have the child ask the tree to take his/her fears away. d) Have your child try to send pictures to his/her favorite pet and see if the pet responds.

, Anytime your child wants to talk to you about something, you should remain open and available to whatever he/she needs to tell you.

"
"
Find help.",How to Help Your Psychic Child Understand Their Gifts3," These are some of the ways to help your psychic child. If you are afraid your child is having some serious problems because of his/her gifts, try to work with someone who has experience. Have them meet other psychic children. There are therapists (few and far between, but they are out there) who actually understand that this is real and won't try to drug your child into submission or tell you they are mentally ill. It's a long, hard and scary road for these gifted children; please don't make it any harder? Please?

Receive an amended birth certificate.",How to Start the Adoption Process," Before you start the adoption process, you will need to think about whether adoption is right for you. Do you long to have a child in your home; do you want to raise a child as a part of your family; and do you want to help a child overcome the challenges that come with being adopted?These are all questions you should be asking yourself prior to adopting a child.


Openly and honestly discuss your thoughts with your family and your friends.Get people's feedback and listen to what others have to say.;
, Adopting a child is not necessarily as expensive as you may think.While there may be some costs associated with your home study, visits with the child, and getting your home ready to welcome a new child, costs are usually subsidized through various programs.For example, you could adopt a waiting child, which involves adopting a child who may be a little bit older and who has been waiting a while to get adopted, and therefore the costs are usually lower.Also, employers will often help subsidize the cost of an adoption; you can usually get loans and grants to help with the costs; and you can even get tax credits for adopting a child., State laws will vary regarding who can adopt a child.In general:


Prospective parents are usually between the ages of 25 and 50;
You do not have to own a home to adopt;
You do not have to have a predetermined income level;
Many states will allow gay and lesbian couples to adopt; and
People with disabilities can adopt., Before starting the process, think about what type of person you would like to adopt. Are you interested in an infant, a toddler, an older child, someone with special needs, an international child, or a foster child?Also, if you have other children already, consider how they would feel bringing another person into the family.If they are old enough, talk with them and get their input about these things as well.

, Domestic adoption agencies in the United States work with birth mothers to find adoptive parents.When it comes to adopting from a domestic agency, there are generally two paths you can take.


Open adoptions are the first option. This means that prospective parents meet and form a relationship with the birth mother (and sometimes the birth father), and often keep in touch after the baby is born.Closed adoptions are the other option. In this type of adoption, the adoptive parents have no contact with the birth mother, and the baby has no contact with the birth mother after they are adopted., Some people prefer to work with an independent lawyer to adopt a child, rather than going through an agency. Prospective parents may alert people they know that they are hoping to adopt a child, or they may ask the lawyer to conduct a search for a birth mother. Either way, the lawyer ensures that the adoption is conducted legally.


Adopting independently can give the adoptive parents greater control over the search process, rather than leaving it up to the agency to facilitate a match. The process of adopting independently is often faster than going through an agency.
The downside of adopting independently is that it is common for birth mothers to change their minds late in the process. Agencies have a process in place to eliminate this as a risk factor; if you're working independently, make sure your lawyer is highly experienced with adoptions to minimize the chance that this will happen.
Conducting your own search for a birth mother is not legal in every state. Make sure finding your own birth mother is legal where you live before pursuing this as an option., Adopting a child who has been placed in foster care is another good option to consider. State agencies list the children available for adoption in online databases that usually include photographs and profiles. You can pursue this type of adoption by finding an agency in your area and contacting them for more information.


Children in foster care are usually over one year old, and some are in their teens. Many have been waiting a long time for loving parents to bring them into their home. Some children in foster care have disabilities, illnesses, or other special needs that have caused them to have to wait longer to be adopted.
In some cases, children were placed in foster care with their siblings, and they wish to be adopted together. This is something to consider if you're open to adopting more than one child.

, Adopting a child from another country is a popular option among citizens of the United States. To pursue this route, work with a U.S. Agency that has ties with international agencies and can facilitate the process for you.


International adoption can be a longer process than domestic adoption, since you have to meet the requirements of two countries instead of one. Conduct research on the adoption policies of different countries to find the one that makes sense for your family.
International adoptions may be closed or open, depending on the country. Make sure you are aware of the birth mother's expectations and ties you'll have to the country after the adoption is complete.

, Many agencies will offer an informational session, which you can attend to learn about the home study process and why it is so important.These orientations usually do not cost anything and do not carry with them any obligations.Home studies are incredibly important as the report that is created will be your resume during the adoption process. This report will assess your ability to be an adoptive parent, and it will be disseminated to any interested children and their representatives.

, The agency that conducts your home study will usually require you to go through training during the home study process.During training, you will learn about the needs of children waiting for families, adoption issues, and adoption requirements.Going through this training will often help you decide what type of child you could parent most effectively., One or more social workers will conduct a series of interviews with you throughout the home study process.These interviews will help you build a relationship with those people responsible for finding you the perfect child.During the interviews, you will likely be asked about the following: your experiences with children; your important relationships; your approach to parenting; how you handle stress; stories of crisis or loss; and infertility issues.The people conducting the interviews will also discuss: what age of child would fit best with you and your family; whether a sibling group would work well; and other important characteristics you are looking for in a child., When professionals come in to your home, they are trying to ensure your home offers a safe environment for a child.In addition, they need to make sure your home complies with any state licensing standards, which includes working smoke alarms, safe storage of firearms, safe water, and adequate space for each child.During the home visit, the individual will need access to all areas of the home or apartment.They will be looking at how you plan to accommodate a new child.They will not be inspecting your housekeeping standards, although you should do your best to portray a comfortable, child-friendly environment., While you do not need to be rich to adopt, you will need to show that you can responsibly handle your finances.Usually, you will be required to provide paycheck stubs, W-4 forms, and income tax forms.Some agencies also ask for savings information, insurance policies, investments, and debts., You must get a physical exam and a statement from a physician that you are healthy, have a normal life expectancy, and are physically and mentally able to care for a child., In order to be approved for adoption, you must submit to a background check.They will ask you to sign a consent form that allows them to look into your background.


When the agency is completing your background check, they will look into your criminal background as well as any history of child abuse.They may also request your fingerprints., This will be the story of your life.It helps the adoptive child's representatives understand your family and your history.This process will also help you explore issues related to parenting and adoption., The agency you are working with will ask you to submit the names, addresses, and phone numbers of three or four references.References should be people who have known you for a long period of time, know how you act around children, and know about your home and professional life., Once your home study is complete, you can start looking for the perfect child to adopt.Your search will take varying routes, depending on the adoption path you chose.


If you went through an adoption agency, whether it is a domestic or international adoption, the adoption agency will have a list of children available.You will sit down with your agency and go through the list to determine which children might be the best fit.
If you are doing an independent adoption, you will work with your attorney (or another adoption professional you may have hired) to find a family looking to place their child up for adoption.Your hired help will usually have a great network already built that they can tap into.No matter what adoption path you chose, you can and should be an active member of the search.Work with the people around you to find the best child for you and your family.

, After you have found a child you think would be a good fit, you will have to exchange certain information with that child, their agency, and/or their family.The most important document you will exchange will be your home study.The child's representatives will look through your home study in order to determine if the child would be a good fit. The child's representatives may also send the child's profile to you.This process may take time and there may be a number exchanges.You should feel comfortable at this stage asking questions and requesting as much information as you think you need.

, When the exchange of information is over, the child's representatives will make and inform you of their decision.Keep in mind that you may not be the only person considering adopting this child.If you are not selected, simply go back to searching for another child. While it may be heartbreaking at first, understand that things happen for a reason and there is always another child out there waiting for you.
If you are selected, you will have an opportunity to visit with the child before finalizing the adoption.

, Once selected, you will take part in a series of visits with the child.During these visits you will have the opportunity to talk with the child and their representatives about almost anything. You should take this time to get to know the child and make sure they are the perfect addition to your family.

, After you have found a child that matches with you and your family, you will need to comply with a number of legal requirements in order to effectuate the adoption. The types of legal hoops you have to jump through will vary depending on your state's laws and the adoption path you chose. The following legal hurdles are the most universally applicable to all types of adoptions:


The first major legal hurdle involves the termination of parental rights.When parental rights are terminated, a judge permanently ends all legal parental rights of the birth parents to the child.This must occur before an adoption can be finalized.This process may be either voluntary or involuntary, and the length of this process varies from state to state.The other major legal hurdle is the adoption consent procedure. Depending on what path you chose for adoption, this may take the form of a document signed by the birth parents; a document issued by the adoption agency; or a document signed by the child themselves.When this procedure is completed, the adoption can be finalized.

, When you are ready to finalize the adoption, you will attend a court hearing where the judge will sign off on the adoption.The judge will look through all of your legal documents and ensure you have completed everything you need to. Once the judge signs off on the adoption, you will be the legal parent of your new child.

, After you adopt your new child, a new, amended, birth certificate will be issued.This new birth certificate will be similar to the child's old one, except you will be named as the parent of the child."

Plan a welcome party.,
Make a place for the teen.,
Ensure the teen knows your home is their home.,
Ask their opinions.,
Encourage emotions.,
Include them in family traditions.,
Spend time together.,
Have a family get to know you session.,
Maintain the daily routines.,
Set clear boundaries.",How to Welcome an Adopted Teenager Into Your Family1," To help make the teen feel welcome in your home, it is a good idea to plan a welcome home party, similar to how you might celebrate someone returning home after a long time away. This does not have to be a huge affair. You can simply make a special dinner and buy or make a cake. Just do something to mark the occasion and make it special.


If the teenager you are adopting has opted to change his or her name, then you might surprise him or her with a special gift with the new name on it. This could be something simple, like a backpack, a blanket, or a mug.;
, Making a place in your family for your teen is critical. You are adopting them and agreeing to make them part of your family. This means they get included in all family events or tasks. Your teen should be treated as an equal to any other children in the family.For example, you should make room on shelves for pictures and trophies of your adopted teen.
Let your adopted teen have a say in the way the house is decorated, what flowers are planted in the garden, or where you go for vacation.

, When the teen comes to your home, take them on a tour and show them where everything is. Make sure they know where to find towels, toilet paper, food, plates, and even extra blankets. Encourage them to ask questions about anything they need to know.Tell them they can use anything in the house. If there are certain things they can’t use, like products in your bathroom, let them know.

, A good way to make your adopted teen feel welcome is to listen to their opinions. Make them a member of the household by including them in decisions. If your teen doesn’t speak up at first, ask them to tell you what they think about things. Encourage them to take part in family discussions.For example, you may ask your teen, “What do you think we should have for dinner?” or “How do you feel about the new additions we want to make on the house?”

, Your teen may not feel comfortable expressing their emotion. They may be afraid to say they are upset, angry, or sad. As you integrate your adopted teen into your home, promote an environment where they can express their feelings and be heard.The teen may be feeling many different emotions due to the adoption, the move, and the change in their life situation. Let them know it is okay to feel these emotions and to express them. Help them work through the emotions if possible.
Don’t get mad if your teen has an outburst. Instead, respond calmly. Say, “I understand that you are angry. However, yelling is not a good way to deal with that feeling. Let’s talk about it and find a healthy outlet for your feelings.”

, One way to help welcome the adopted teen is to include them in any family traditions. This helps them feel like they are part of the family, and helps you and the rest of your family start to see the teen as a member of the family. This is especially important at holidays, but it should be applied to any tradition.For example, if everyone gets a homemade cake and chooses their favorite meal on their birthdays, make sure your adopted teen gets that, too. Make the teen a matching stocking and buy them a holiday ornament that goes with the rest of the family’s.
If it’s tradition that each Saturday the family rotates who gets to choose the takeout and movie choices, let your adopted teen make the next choice. If everyone buys their own breakfast food at the grocery store, let your teen do the same.

, After you adopt your teen, you should make sure that the family spends time together. This helps all of you get used to each other and start creating a bond. This also helps your adopted child feel like part of the family.


For example, you can plan small outings on the weekends, cook together, play games, go to the movies, or other activities.

, Once your adopted teen is settled, you should gather the family together and spend time getting to know one another. During this session, your family has a chance to ask questions, tell each other things, and learn more about each other. This may be general things, like what people do for a living or where they went to school. You should also talk about likes and dislikes.Ask the teen what foods they like and hate, what activities they enjoy, and what their favorite movies are. Encourage the teen to ask everyone questions.
This is a good way to introduce house rules, answer any questions, and clarify any confusion.
You may want to break this up into smaller sessions so it’s not too overwhelming for everyone.

, When your adopted child comes to live with you, try to keep the daily routines in place so they can get integrated into the family. You may have a special dinner the first night, but don’t plan fancy outings, events every night, or other things out of the ordinary.Welcoming a new family member is hard for the teen and the rest of your family. Maintaining familiarity with normal daily routines helps the teen get used to what life will be like, and helps give structure for everyone else.

, Treat your adopted teen like a member of your household by setting boundaries. Everyone in the family probably has chores they do each day, along with rules and boundaries they follow. Outline the rules of your household, explain the consequences, and insist that they adhere to your rules. However, allow them independence and choices that give them freedom to express themselves and be a teenager.Be specific with your rules and boundaries. This helps your teen know what to expect and eliminates the possibility of any confusion.
For example, you may have a rule where they can borrow the car or go out with friends, but they have a curfew of 11 p.m. You may require them to do the dishes after dinner and wash at least one load of laundry for the family each week.
There are other things you may compromise on or be more lenient about. If the teen is going to a concert with friends, you may allow them to be out later. You may tell your teen they can wear whatever type of clothes they want as long as shorts and skirts are a certain length.
Explain that you will respect their space if they respect the space of others. For example, no one will go through their things, so they shouldn’t go through other’s things.
Let them know about any rules about household things. For example, if you only allow certain snacks before dinner, make sure they know that. If you don’t allow anyone to watch television for two hours after dinner, tell them that.

Bring your teen's interests into the family.,
Encourage your child to get involved.,
Let them get a job.,
Help your child set goals.,
Allow your teen to set up their bedroom.",How to Welcome an Adopted Teenager Into Your Family2," Another way you can make your teen feel included is to incorporate their interests in your family. When you meet your teen, talk to them about their likes, dislikes, interests, favorite foods, and favorite television program. Make an effort to incorporate their interests just like you do everyone else in the family.


For example, make their favorite foods once a week like you do for everyone else in the family. Set aside a night to watch their favorite television programs as a family, and allow them to choose the movie when it's their turn.
Let your adopted teen have a turn choosing the weekend activities.
Make sure their interests are included into the family. Don't just expect your adopted teen to like and do everything your family does and give up what they like.

, One way you can help your adopted teen start to build a life and feel like they belong is to help them get involved. This may take many different forms. Finding an activity helps them meet people, have a purpose, and pursue their interests. Let them choose the activity, or let them try a few different things if they aren’t sure what they want to do.You may help your teen join a sports team, sign up for dance or karate lessons, or help them volunteer.

, Your adopted teen may want to learn independence and demonstrate mutual trust between the two of you by getting a job. This job may be a way for them to earn extra spending money or to have some structured time to themselves.Encourage your child to look for jobs in places they think they’d like to work. If possible, they can find jobs that align with their interests, like at farms or animal clinics.
Discuss transportation to the job. If your teen has a car, they can drive themselves. If they are going to borrow your car, lay down rules about using your car, such as putting gas in it and letting you know where they are taking it.

, Setting goals and making decisions are important skills for teenagers to develop. An adopted teen should feel that they can make their own decisions, while being encouraged to set goals and accomplish tasks. Help them come up with goals, but let them have the final say for the goals and make the decisions. Don’t make the goals for them.For example, suggest that your teen make goals in different categories, such as school, personal interests, and social life. Your teen may then set a goal to do better on their next history test, try a new activity each month, and spend more time with their new friends.

, When your adopted teen comes home, have a room ready for them. However, let the teen decorate it themselves. This will help them feel like the room is theirs and that they have a place that is their own now.Encourage them to choose the paint color, the bedding, and the decorations. If you can afford it, you can allow them to pick out their own furniture.
If you have to give your teen a price limit, that is okay. They can still have control over their room without spending too much money. You may say, “You can decorate however you want, but I only have this much to spend.”

Identify triggers.,
Celebrate your child's heritage.,
Focus on similarities instead of differences.,
Be positive.,
Let the teen know they can talk about their birth parents.,
Set up meetings with other adopted teens.",How to Welcome an Adopted Teenager Into Your Family3," If your adopted teen has suffered traumas in their past, there may be certain situations, places, noises, or other things that trigger them. Talk to your teen about what their triggers are so you can be aware of them. If your teen isn’t aware of their triggers, work with them to identify them so they can be safe.You may want to suggest that the teen go to therapy or trauma counseling.

, Your adopted teen may be from the same culture and ethnicity as your family. They may be from the same culture but be a different ethnicity,. They come from a completely different background, and may come from a different ethnicity, culture, or country. You should make efforts to celebrate your child's heritage in your family.To celebrate your child's uniqueness, you can incorporate cultural ideas and traditions from their heritage. If your adopted child comes from a different country, you may cook food from that country or celebrate that culture's holidays or special events. Try to find cultural events in your area, or have your family meet with other people from your adopted teen's cultural heritage.
Encourage your entire family to learn as much about the country as they can. Everyone should understand your adopted child's racial and cultural heritage.
Since your child is a teenager, talk to them about whether they have any culturally or family specific traditions.

, Your adopted teen will be different than your family. While you should celebrate your child’s uniqueness, you should also focus on the similarities you share. This will help them feel like they are part of the family because there are things that bind the family together.Don’t focus on physical traits. Your adopted teen won’t look like you and any biological children. Instead, you can focus on things you do have in common. For example, all your children love to play soccer, you all love to camp, your partner and the teen love to run, or you all love to read.
Emphasizing the similarities can help your teen feel included.

, Your adopted teen may be going through a lot. They may be grieving the loss of their birth parents, they may be confused about the transition, or they may be dealing with feelings of abandonment from being in foster care. Help your teen by being a positive influence in their life.Smile and talk to your teen often. Do things with them one-on-one as well as with the family.
When your teen does something well, tell them. Provide plenty of encouragement and positive reinforcement. Praise them when they do well, like if they bring home a good assignment from school or do well at a sports game. Give them positive reinforcement when they try new things, even if they don’t succeed.
If your child does something wrong, be gentle and loving when you discipline them. Help them understand that you won’t abandon them or give up on them if they make a mistake.

, Some adopted teens don’t feel like they can talk about the adoption process, their time in foster care, or their birth parents. They may feel guilty bringing up these topics or feel like it makes them separate from the family. Help your teen understand that their experience is valid and deserves to be discussed and shared with the family.Encourage your teen to explore their heritage. Help them discover family trees if possible, visit places where their ancestors lived, or find photos of grandparents or other relatives.
If your adopted teen is from another culture or ethnic background, encourage them to learn as much about their cultural heritage as possible. Connect them with other people of similar backgrounds and help them find events to attend.
Be honest about the birth parents, but help them be fair, too. For example, if their birth parents had a substance abuse problem, help them acknowledge that but see past it to learn more about their birth parents as people beyond the substance abuse.

, You may want to help your teen transition by putting them in contact with other teens or people in your area who are adopted. This may help them connect to others who have been through what they are going through.Connecting with other adopted teens or adults may allow them a safe place to vent their emotions to people who can provide insight into the situation.
Consider getting your teen a mentor who is an adopted adult who can help them adjust to the new situation.

Greet your child with a smile and no questions.,
Have snacks or a meal ready for them.,
Let your child have some downtime alone.,
Prepare your child for homework or dinner.",How to Prevent After‐School Meltdowns1," When your child comes home from school, avoid bombarding them with lots of questions about their day or how they feel. Save the questions for a later time when they are settled and relaxed. Instead, greet them with a smile and a “welcome home” or a “good to have you back.” Be warm and positive when they walk through the door so they start to feel more relaxed and calm.You can also try asking your child, “Do you want to talk about your day now or later?” so they have the option of telling you about their day now or at another time. This will show them that you care about their day but understand they may be overwhelmed and need some time to relax before you talk.;
, Most kids come home from school hungry, and hunger combined with irritation or tiredness can lead to a bad mood. Avoid a meltdown by offering them snacks or a small meal right when they get home. You can also put some snacks out in a bowl in the kitchen so they can get at them on their own.For example, you may prepare healthy snacks like cut up fruit or a bowl of nuts. You can also leave out crackers or chips for your child to snack on when they get home from school so they are satisfy their hunger but not ruin their appetite for dinner.

, You should also make downtime part of your child’s after-school routine, where they can unwind and have time to themselves. Giving your child an hour of downtime once they get home can help them unwind and release some of the anxiety or stress of their school day.You may give your child an hour to themselves in their room where they can go on their computer, listen to music, or read.
Your child may also prefer to be active as part of their downtime where they play a sport outside or run around in the yard for an hour after school.

, As part of your child’s after-school routine, you should also prepare your child for homework in the evening as well as dinnertime. Give them a half an hour to an hour to themselves and then remind them that they should start their homework in the next half hour to an hour. You should also let them know what time dinner will be so they can prepare for it. This way, they feel less stressed and can stick to a routine.For example, you may tell your child, “How about we do homework in 30 minutes together at the kitchen table?” or “Remember that dinner is in an hour, okay?”

Set up a calm environment for them.,
Do fun, engaging activities with your child.,
Allow them to play with siblings or friends.",How to Prevent After‐School Meltdowns2," Another way you can prevent your child from having a meltdown when they get home from school is to create a home environment that is calm and relaxing for them. Avoid having lots of clutter everywhere in your home and keep the noise level down. Tidy up the common area and set out your child’s toys so they are easy to access when they get home from school.You may also try to establish a calm environment for yourself as well, such as lighting candles, putting on soothing music, and doing a relaxing activity before your child gets home. This could then help you set a calm tone for your child when they walk through the door.

, You can also keep your child’s spirits up when they get home by offering to do some fun activities with them when they get home. Perhaps you set up a craft area where you can draw and paint together. Or maybe you bring out your child’s favorite board games and suggest you play a round together. This can help your child stay engaged and work off any negative energy they be bringing home with them.For example, you may say to your child, “How about we get creative and do some crafts before homework?” or “Do you want to play a board game before dinner?”

, You should also encourage your child to burn off any negative energy from school by playing with siblings or friends. Maybe your child has a neighborhood friend across the street that they like to run around with outside. Or perhaps your child invites a friend over to hang out in their room after school. Let them have friends over so they can destress and have fun.For example, you may say to your child, “Do you want to invite a friend over to play?” or “Would you like to go play with your friend across the street?”

Acknowledge your child’s feelings.,
Separate your child from others.,
Give your child time and space to calm down on their own.",How to Prevent After‐School Meltdowns3," If your child does have an after-school meltdown, you should be prepared for it and deal with it accordingly. Start by acknowledging your child’s feelings. They are likely feeling tired, burned out, and irritated. Reassure them that you understand they are just tired from school and lashing out because they are stressed. Doing this can help to deescalate the situation and let them know you are on their side.For example, you may say to your child, “We’re tired out from school, aren’t we?” or “You had a long day, didn’t you? You’re ready to have a snack and chill out.”

, If there are other children in your home, you should have your child move to a separate area, such as their bedroom. This will give them a space to calm down and take a few deep breaths. Have them stay in their room for five to ten minutes as this will give them a chance to calm down and be on their own.Often, some alone time in a safe space like their bedroom can help them to relax and let go of any stress from school.
This is also a good way to avoid upsetting the other children and help to maintain a calm space for everyone else in your household.

, Rather than try to solve your child’s issue for them or get angry at them, let them calm down on their own. You may leave them with their toys or books and a small snack. After a few minutes, they should calm down and become engaged in a toy or their snack.Once your child has calmed down and the meltdown has passed, you may then ask them about their day at school or ask them if they’d like to play with you. Engage with them only after they have calmed down.

Speak to younger kids in ways they understand.,
Use movies and books to help them understand.,
Assure your non-adoptive kids you won’t give them up for adoption.",How to Talk About Adoption with Your Non‐Adopted Kids1," The concept of adoption will likely be lost on a toddler. However, you can attempt to make them “get” adoption by using words and concepts that they can understand. Keep things simple, and they are more likely to grasp what you are trying to convey to them.


For instance, you could tell them that sometimes, parents aren’t able to care for their babies. When this happens, other parents are able to make them their own children and take great care of them. You could also explain how families like your own may take in these children to give them a proper home. Keeping it basic is the best way to prevent confusion and promote acceptance.It is a good idea to start having these conversations early in life, but keep in mind that it may require several conversations of increasing sophistication as the child grows.;
, A variety of books and movies cover the topic of adoption. Your children may better understand the concept when it comes from a character they really like or in a fun and entertaining way. View the movies and read the books before you introduce them to your child to ensure that you are comfortable with the way the information is presented.


Speak to a pediatrician or therapist about material that they recommend. They likely have experience in this situation and can steer you in the right direction., When children, especially those that are younger, hear about parents essentially giving their children away for others to raise them, they often start to wonder if it will happen to them. They may believe that if they are bad or if you become angry with them, you may give them away. Assure them that this situation would never happen, and help them to understand that no matter what, they will always be yours.


At the same time, tell them that the children didn’t do anything to deserve this. That the kids aren’t “bad” and the reason they were put up for adoption has to do with grown up problems, not the child at all. Doing so can help them treat any children you have adopted the same as they would their other siblings. Also, make sure to explain some of the common reasons why a parent may put their child up for adoption and that this is something that usually happens at birth.

"
"
Teach your children about blended families.,
Explain that you don’t have to be blood-related to be family.,
Emphasize that love is love, no matter what the family looks like.",How to Talk About Adoption with Your Non‐Adopted Kids2," If your family is preparing to adopt a child, your children may confused as to the reasons why, particularly if the adoptee is a different race. If they haven't encountered blended families before, they may not understand that family members can have different colored skin. Simply explain that just because an adopted child has different colored skin than their parents, they are still related because of adoption.You might say, ""Even though Sammy is a different color, she is just like any other member of our family. We will all treat her that way.""

, The whole concept of a person raising a baby who did not grow from their own body is a difficult concept to grasp for some kids. However, if you explain that two people do not have to have the same blood lines to be related, they may become more understanding of the situation. Tell your child that the parents love the child just as much as they would if they had had the baby themselves.


If you are married, you can use this situation as an example of how people can be family if they aren’t technically related. Explain how you’ve created an emotional and legal bond with your spouse, and adoption is similar., Your child may not understand how a parent can love a child that they didn’t conceive themselves. However, it is important to reassure them that their friend or new sibling who was adoptive is loved just as much as they are. Additionally, go into how their parents are their “real” parents, even though they may have not actually given birth to them.


You might say, ""Our family took in Sadie and we agreed to love her and take care of her as one of our own.""Be sure to talk about why it is so special to take in someone as part of your family and how it means that you really love them.

"
"
Talk to them about valuing others’ choice to disclose.,
Tell them never to assume the birth parents didn’t love the child.,
Teach them not to treat adoptees any differently.",How to Talk About Adoption with Your Non‐Adopted Kids3," If you are planning an adoption or your children encounter adoptive friends in school or in the community, it’s good to remind them of what not to say. Let them know that putting someone on the spot with a lot of personal questions will make them uncomfortable and could upset them. Instead, just be supportive of their friend and know that they now have a loving family who cares about them.


For example, your child may want to know what happened to the birth parents, how the adoptive parents found the child, and the like. And although these are understandable questions, they may not be ones the adoptee is ready to answer. Tell your child it’s natural to wonder, but they should only bring it up if they really feel the adoptee is ready to share.Make sure that you keep the lines of communication open and encourage your child to ask you any questions they have about adoption before bringing up those questions with the child.

, One of the first ideas that pops into a child’s head about adoption is that the child’s birth parents didn’t love them and gave them away because of it. Assure your child that this usually isn’t the case and to never say that to someone who is adopted. Explain how hurtful hearing a comment like this is, and ask them how it would make them feel if someone said that to them.


Explain to your child that sometimes, people have babies when they aren’t ready or when they are in bad situations. Tell the child that the birth parents loved the baby so much they wanted more for it and knew they couldn’t provide everything it needed, so they looked for someone who could. Explain the bravery something like this takes., Your child may want to feel sorry for someone who is adopted, or act shy around them because they don’t fully understand the situation. However, explain to your child that they should feel happy for them that they were wanted so much and chosen to be a part of someone's family. Tell your child you understand why they may feel sorry or uncomfortable, but that they shouldn’t act any differently. Assure them that adoptive children are just like they are and should be treated the same as everyone else is.


For instance, you could say, “I understand you may feel bad for your friend, but they are living a really great life and there’s no reason to feel bad for them.” You could also say, “I know you may not totally understand the situation, and may feel weird about your friend now. But there is no reason to. They are the same friend they’ve always been.”
Taking the time to validate your child’s feelings, while explaining in a friendly way that they don’t need to be any different, may help them become more comfortable with their friend. If the adopted child is a sibling, do not tolerate any suggestions about the child not being a real part of the family. If your child says this out of anger or resentment, make sure that you swiftly address it in front of both children.

Maintain daily routines.,
Prepare your child for changes.,
Be firm.,
Choose your battles.,
Give your child choices.,
Pay attention.,
Even though you want your child(ren) to control/prevent a tantrum from happening, remember that you were once a kid, too, just like them.

",How to Prevent a Child's Temper Tantrums," Toddlers and preschoolers need to feel comfortable and secure, and they do not deal well with unpredictability. Keep things predictable by setting regular bedtimes and mealtimes. Hunger and sleepiness are probably the most common triggers of tantrums, and these can largely be avoided by keeping a regular schedule. Try to wean toddlers off unscheduled naps, and minimize the occurrence of extended absences from familiar surroundings.;
, Obviously, you can’t keep the same routine forever. Make sure you give your child plenty of warning and explanation well in advance of significant changes, e.g., his first day of preschool, and prepare him for smaller changes, as well. For example, if you’ve spent the afternoon at the swimming pool, let your child know you will be leaving in 15 minutes. Soften the uncomfortable blow of abrupt changes in environment or activities by giving the child time to adjust. Also, prepare your child for difficulties before he or she tries some new activity. A child may expect be able to take on the world, but when it comes down to it, they have trouble doing most new tasks. Explain a given activity is difficult and may require many attempts, and be patient if the child becomes frustrated.

, If a child senses he can sway your decisions or coerce you with tantrums, it is reasonable for the child to use tantrums to get his way. Make sure your child knows you make the decisions, and don’t change your mind in response to bad behavior.

, Before you deny a child’s request, ask yourself whether the request may indeed be reasonable. Does your son want a pre-dinner snack if dinner’s running a little late? Why not give it to him? You may avoid a tantrum, and besides, he just may be really hungry. Don’t try to enforce rules just for the sake of rules, but analyze the situation before you make a decision. Once you make the decision don’t back down.

, Beginning in the toddler years, children seek increasing autonomy, and if they feel as though they have no control over their lives tantrums may ensue. While you can’t reasonably give young children much independence, you can offer them simple choices so they can feel more in control. For example, at breakfast, give your child a choice between oatmeal and cereal. Make sure either choice you give is acceptable to you, and avoid asking open-ended questions such as, “What would you like for breakfast?” You may get an unreasonable answer, and then be forced to deny the child his choice.

, Children need a lot of attention, and if they don’t get enough they will seek more. You’ve probably heard “even bad attention is better than no attention,” and for children this is true. Make sure to spend plenty of time with your child and to be responsive to his or her basic needs for food, shelter, and comfort. If a child tends to react to a particular item, preventing related tantrums is as easy as keeping the item out of his or her mind.

Inspire your child to read.,
Consider your child’s age when motivating your child to read.,
Let your child express what he feels.,
Set aside some time to teach your child and display your own passions.,
Follow up on what your child learns in school.,
Give your child positive feedback.,
Develop a respectful relationship with your child.,
Judge the behavior, not your child.",How to Motivate Your Child1," Let your child learn about the things happening around him. You can do this by spending time with your child as you read him books. If your child already knows how to read, you can let him read some parts of the book with you.


This will strengthen your child’s interest and appreciation while learning. As a whole, reading can answer your child’s curiosity and make him interested in exploring lots of things.
Make yourself interested in reading, too, so you can also stir your child’s interest in this activity. Your child is more likely to imitate you.
Encourage family members to read frequently and make all kinds of reading materials available in your home, for example, magazines, an encyclopedia, or newspapers.
Make a small library in your house. Fill in the bookshelf with the books your child wants to read.;
, For a younger child, you can start by showing him pictures with words describing it. Let him get familiar with different objects as he discovers them in his environment.


For an older child, you can encourage him to visit his school library and let him read there with his friends. You can also suggest that he borrow some books from the library and read them at home.
Encourage your child to learn with different learning styles by incorporating fun activities. Try providing your child with age-appropriate activity books which can enhance his creative expression and problem solving skills, for example, coloring books, connect the dots, crossword puzzles, maze, math problems, etc.

, Listening to your child’s opinion will make him feel valued and respected. Set aside time where you can listen to your child attentively. It 's helpful to always display interest and enthusiasm as your child talks. This will increase your child’s self-worth.


He will feel important and worthy of your time, attention, and love. Children who are valued in their decisions, feelings, opinions, and choices, are more likely to feel better about themselves and be motivated positively.Allow your child to make his own choices. For example, let him choose the clothes that he likes to wear or let him order the food that he wants to eat.
When your child talks and expresses what he feels, make sure that you practice all the nonverbal gestures like maintaining eye contact, using facial expressions, and effective words to convey that you understand him.

, Teaching your child new things will give him the ability to try new things resourcefully. Whenever you find information, spend time discussing it with your child. Teaching your child will motivate him to set high goals for himself, and these high goals will be accompanied by hard work in order to achieve them.


You can teach your child about things like taking care of pets, garden recycling, and home improvement. Just make sure that you talk to your child in a way that he can understand, using age-appropriate terms.
You and your child’s everyday events must be an opportunity for him to learn. It is important to let your child discover how the real world works.

, Ask about the things that he studied and the things that he learned at school, and find out how he is doing. Letting your child talk about the things he learned will help him remember his lessons.


This will enable you to find out if your child is making progress in school or if there are areas where he needs improvement and motivation. Usually, your child will give you a “yes” or “no” response with every question that you ask, so try to use open-ended questions using “what,” “where,” “when,” “why,” and “how,” to make your child speak more and express what they want to say. You can also create opportunities for your child to ask you questions. Here are some of the examples of open-ended questions:
“What happened in your school?”
”Who did you play with?”
“Where did you play with your friends?”
“What was the hardest thing that you experienced in school?”
“What is the best thing that happened to you today?”
“What are the things that you did in school?”

, Whether it is big or small, make sure that you let your child know that you appreciate his hard work. Positive reinforcement will enhance his positive behavior. This will encourage your child to be motivated in learning. When he feels appreciated, he has a tendency to exert more effort next time. You may use compliments such as:


“You did a great job!”
“I saw how you worked hard for your test and I appreciate you getting high scores.”
“Good work!”
“That was the best thing I ever saw.”

, Have a respectful and positive relationship with your kid. Always try to stay on your kid’s team and not against them. This way you can successfully play an influential role in their lives.


Punishing and threatening will fetch no results and will also damage your relationship. Your frustration and fear are normal and understandable.
Remember, your child is not behaving like this just to make your life miserable or because they are good-for-nothings. If you get negative and complain all the time about his behavior then your child might become rebellious and stubborn.

, This distinction makes it less likely that the child will confuse his accomplishments with his self-worth. Saying 'that was a great idea' may always be better than saying 'you are intelligent’.


You need to make your child feel worthy. Be it accomplishments or failures, you should not judge your child on the basis of that. Ups and downs are a part of life and sooner or later your child will understand.
By criticizing your child when it comes to failures and appreciating his work when it comes to accomplishment will confuse him of his accomplishments and self worth.

Encourage your child to develop his skills and to follow his passions.,
Help your child to determine what he likes if he is having a hard time figuring out what he wants to pursue.,
Create a reward system.,
Try to be an inspiration to your child.,
Be persistent.",How to Motivate Your Child2," Be supportive as you encourage your child to enhance and to develop his skills and talents. To develop your child’s abilities, you must know where to focus. Learn more about your child’s strengths by checking how he is doing in school. Has he been joining spelling be? Thus, it means he is good in English. Is he been getting aces in his Math? Numbers might be your child’s interest.


Give activity workbook to support your child’s interest.
If your child likes music, you can also enroll him into a music school where he can learn singing, playing the piano or guitar.
Strengthen your child’s skills by letting your child figure out what his desires and the important things for him.
You can also manage your child’s weaknesses by helping him to learn a certain skill. For example, if your child appears to have difficulty in drawing, you can teach him the basic way on how to draw and illustrate.

, Show your child how you build your confidence in what he can do by guiding him towards his skills and talents. Keep in mind that in guiding him, you can give him variety of options to choose from, for example your child has got an eye for music, ask him about the areas he likes to develop, being a singer or playing a musical instrument.


Do not nag your child for him to achieve his goal. Instead, help your child discover his own motivations by setting his own goal and desire, for example. When this happens, your child is more likely to do and achieve many things because he simply wants to do them.
Help your child instead of doing things for him, which could lead to having an overdependent child.

, Implement the “when you” rule. One of life’s lessons is that we get the reward after we complete our work. You can try saying, ‘When you finish your work, we can play your favorite video game’, Or ‘When you complete your homework, you can go outside and play with your friends’. Enforce this rule and stick to it.

, Be your child’s inspiration. Somehow, some of you have grown looking up into other people’s success. Think about it, “Who inspires you to be in the place where you are now?” It might be your dad or your mom, your boss, or your colleague. Be someone to be your child’s inspiration. Focus more on showing your child your best characteristics and be an inspiring person. Your behavior and reputation will inspire your child.


Tell your child stories about the things you did and the things you want to do. You can motivate your child through this as you show him what you are really capable of doing.
Empower your child’s character by letting him be the best. Bring out the best in your child. Trusting what your child can do can motivate him.

, Help your child be able to stay in a certain task for a long period of time by offering him tasks as he learns how to do it consistently. Your persistence to let your child do a certain task will keep him get going. For example, you wanted your child to increase his communication skills, you can give him activities which can enhance his skills in this aspect, such as letting him read picture books and answer the comprehension activity. Make sure that the level of tasks that you are going to give your child are challenging rather than overwhelming.


An important characteristic to expect when your persistence is working on your child is when he appears to finish an activity without any interruption and without asking for assistance.

"
Mend bridges.,
Try to avoid nagging your child.,
Remove pressures that are causing your child to flounder.,
Give your child simple responsibilities.",How to Motivate Your Child3," At this point, your child or teen may already be emotionally distant. Perhaps you have nagged him to often in the past, that he feels he can no longer expect emotional support from you. It’s not yet too late to mend those broken bridges. You are his only set of parents, after all. You just need to try harder in reaching out to your child.


One rule you can follow is to count the praises and encouragement you give your child as well as the criticisms. The positive should always outnumber the negative. It may be difficult and would need a significant amount of your self-control, but let petty mistakes slide once in a while.

, Consistently nagging your child could cause him to shut you off, so that your disciplining and advice will only be tuned out. Get them to listen to you again by holding back the negative comments and by being more encouraging.


Make time spent together happier by planning fun bonding activities you can do as a family. Teenagers may complain and appear bored or annoyed, but deep down they really appreciate these moments together.

, One possible reason to your child’s lack of motivation is the pressure of meeting goals they don’t feel confident enough to achieve.


It’s the “Why try in the first place, when I know I’ll fail” mindset that prevents them from exerting effort in their responsibilities. Remove this pressure by letting them know that you don’t care too much about the results.
There’s merit in constantly reminding them that what you value more is their effort in these tasks.

, Help bring back their confidence in themselves by assigning them tasks that you know they could easily accomplish. Let them rediscover that they are capable of creating their own successes. This can also help them arrive to a bigger goal by doing only one simple task at a time, without being overwhelmed.


For example, if you’re teaching a child who is a little late in learning how to read, do not go straight to teaching them words. Begin with the alphabet even though they could already recognize all of them. Don’t forget to praise if they answer correctly.
Or if you’re child needs help being encouraged to be more socially active, don’t force them to signing up to large classes or activities at once. Large groups can be overwhelming to shy teens. Instead, encourage new interactions with a few individuals at a time. Introduce them to a friend’s daughter or son that you know is friendly and share common interests with your child, or plan a visit to your sister or brother’s family, let them get to know their cousins.

Practice storing information.,
Develop a theory of mind.,
Practice.,
Incorporate observation into your daily life.,
IE.,
Next time Amy is mad, try giving her a compliment….,
If she does….,
If she didn’t take the compliment, well, you were wrong; maybe she reacts specifically to compliments from guys she likes, which means she probably doesn’t like you.,
Practice Practice Practice Practice Practice.,
Understand that humans are just like any other system in our universe.,
If you can live life like this, truly observational and neutral, you will begin to gain your internal Locus of Control.,
This is a lifestyle, live it.,
From this day on, as you find your balance between overanalyzing and being oblivious, practice.",How to Predict Behavior," Unfortunately, other people’s behavior, like your own, is learned. To understand someone’s formula will take time. You must have a collection of general behavioral archetypes stored in the back of your mind at all times and, more importantly, you must also have a Theory of Mind - the ability to see the world from another person’s perspective, understand that their history is different from yours, which means their preferences and life goals are most likely different, which means their REACTIONS won’t all be the same as your own.;
, Can you put yourself in someone else’s shoes? Not just imagine how you would react if you were in their situation. I mean to feel the air around them as if it surrounded you, to see each face from their eyes, to empathize, even plan your next move as if you were them.

, A theory of mind comes only to those who listen. Remember that your body is a system. It can only focus on either in-taking information (listening, learning) or expelling it (talking, teaching). If you are doing one, then your mind cannot not focus on the other. The first step to developing a theory of mind is silence. Disappear from the world. (not literally). Quit trying to influence your surroundings with your own opinions, ideas, and motives; that will happen on its own. Instead sit back and watch life play out. Notice what it does without your involvement. Take note of the dramas that begin to form amongst people (because you know some will). Notice that every person has a unique way of responding to the same problems. Pay attention to dominant emotions; anger, confusion, fear, apathy… whatever it may be.

, Once you are able to do this, don’t let it stop. Practice incorporating this level of observation into everyday life. (Warning: This does not mean over-analyzing situations. If you find yourself reading a lot of things negatively, sit back, relax, and start over. Remember that no situation is ever negative or positive, it simply happened and it is now time to plan how to either recover, or use it to your advantage. Getting stuck on negativity is counterproductive.) Even the most simple event can tell you a lot about a person.

, If you noticed that Amy always turns away and smiles to herself after receiving a compliment….

, Maybe she’ll react the same way…

, Success, you’ve just fount one of Amy’s “triggers”. If she is ever mad now, and you would like to shut her up, throw her a compliment and be sweet.(Add this piece of information to your collection under the name AMY. This was also a very basic example, and most things aren’t black and white.)

, Or maybe it was the compliment itself that hit a soft spot (her smile, her hair, her eyes). Whatever it is, don’t give up! But also remember…. Do not store information until you are confident it is valid. If your brain is as stubborn as mine, it’s easy to confuse false information with the truth.

, Now that you are able to keep your theory of mind from a third person perspective, exercise that thought process in daily life. Test your observations with people, without making it obvious. If you reveal to somebody that you are studying them, the test is flawed and you will never know for sure. Secrecy is your best friend. Send out triggers for different emotions you’ve already observed and practice getting the desired reactions. (Don’t piss people off, try making people happy instead or confusion is a fun one.)

, Understand this. Humans are not special. There is no divine being dedicated to watching over us. We were not meant to traverse through space for the rest of eternity. We are most likely not the dominant life form in this universe. And Earth is not our playground nor is it our project, it is our fish tank. It is a chessboard for us to plan our lives out on, but once we make a move, there is no taking it back.

, In Social Psychology, this term refers to the extent of control you feel you have with the events in your life. It is very similar to confidence, but relies more on your internal ability to adapt and execute (positive conditioning) rather than an overwhelming feeling of invincibility.

, Anyway, we have strayed from the main topic. Understand, that the world is yours to mold. Even in all of its chaos, it is a blank canvas. Your actions directly impact your environment, and because of this knowledge, you are now sitting here in front of your computer, trying to figure out how to impact it in your favor.

, These are the teachings of the monk. Do not interfere with the flow of life around you (people, arguments, and dramas included), simply remain neutral and only step in when peace is at jeopardy. Do not try to impress people with all your cool-bro ski stories of the golden years, because every story you reveal about yourself makes you that much less advantageous. Do not hold grudges and hate, because in the end it was caused by a difference in preference - which in the grand scheme of things is just another primal emotion. Evolve yourself.

Some states don't permit adoption advertisements, and some only permit adoption advertisements by licensed agencies.
The federal Children's Bureau has a fact sheet that outlines adoption advertising regulations in various states, which you can download at https://www.childwelfare.gov/pubPDFs/advertising.pdf.;
, In states that allow independent adoptions, you may be able to find a licensed adoption attorney in your area who can facilitate an identified adoption.A good place to begin your search for an adoption attorney is to visit the website of the American Academy of Adoption Attorneys. Members of this professional society have experience and specialized training in adoptions, and follow high ethical standards in their practice.
The Academy has a searchable directory available at http://www.adoptionattorneys.org/aaaa_directory that you can use to find attorneys near you.

, Public and private adoption agencies, as well as other organizations in your area, may provide groups for prospective adoptive parents that can connect parents and birth mothers.Adoptive parent support groups also can be helpful resources for prospective adoptive parents who want to better understand the process and issues they potentially will face.

, Given that you will have a continuing relationship, it's imperative that both birth mother and prospective parents feel comfortable and get along with one another.As the birth mother, you may have questions for prospective parents relating to matters such as religious or philosophical beliefs, parenting styles, and educational philosophies.
Prospective parents should be as open as possible in answering the birth mother's questions. As prospective parents, you also may have questions of your own regarding the birth mother's background, life, and health.

, If you know anyone who has recently adopted a child or put her child up for adoption, ask about the agency she used and her experience with the adoption process.Because they are people you know and trust, these recommendations can be most valuable because these people understand your needs and situations in which you are most comfortable.
At the same time, recognize that an agency that worked well for a friend or family member might not suit your needs – especially if the adoptions are taking place under vastly different circumstances or if you have a different family background or reasons for pursuing adoption.

, Most adoption agencies have an initial meeting to explain the process of adopting through that agency and the basic costs involved.Your state's child or family services department typically will have a directory on its website of licensed adoption agencies in your area. Review and choose several that work with identified adoptions.
During orientation, an agency representative will provide basic information about the application and adoption process for that agency, typically including the fees you will be charged.
The orientation meeting is your opportunity to find out all you can about an adoption agency before you commit, so come armed with a list of questions you want to ask the agency's representatives.
After each orientation meeting, take a minute to make a list of the pros and cons of the agency from your point of view. This summary will be helpful later on when you're making your final decision.

, Check with your state's licensing department to learn about each adoption agency's background and record.The state's licensing authority will be able to tell you how long the agency has been licensed and whether the license is in good standing.
Call your state's children or family services department to find out about complaints that have been filed or pending investigations against any of the agencies you're considering.
You also should call your state's attorney general's office and find out if the agency has been sued before or is involved in any pending litigation.
Ask each agency for at least three references and for the names and contact information of families with similar adoptions that the agency handled recently.

, Review the fees for each agency and factor in costs for services not included to calculate the total cost for completing an adoption through each agency.Typically, agency fees are reduced for identified adoptions because the birth mother and the adoptive parents have already connected with each other through their own efforts. This means the agency doesn't have to spend the time and effort placing a child with a family.

, Once you have thorough information about each of the adoption agencies on your list, sit down with the birth mother or adoptive parents and decide which one you all are comfortable with using.


If you are an adoptive parent, keep in mind that if you and the birth mother have differing opinions about which adoption agency is best, you probably want to go with the birth mother's choice unless that agency has serious complaints or licensing issues in its past.

, Adoption agencies require a number of meetings with both the birth mother and the adoptive parents to gather information and complete the evaluations necessary for the adoption to be legally approved.Some of these meetings may involve both the birth mother and the adoptive parents, while many involve an agency representative meeting separately with either the birth mother or the adoptive parents.
For example, information about the birth mother's health and family background typically is gathered separately. The agency also may have separate meetings with the birth mother to evaluate her understanding and level of comfort with the adoption process apart from the influence of the adoptive parents.
As adoptive parents, you can expect several meetings and interviews as the agency works through the home study process.

, Although the specifics vary among states, all prospective adoptive parents must complete training, background checks, and home evaluations to be approved for adoption.Depending on your state's requirements and the agency's waiting lists, the entire process may take between two and ten months to complete.
The home study process typically includes parenting classes or other training on health and safety.
Prospective adoptive parents will have to complete background checks and provide detailed financial information as part of the home study. The purpose of this information is to ensure you have the means to provide a safe and supportive home for a child and provide for him or her financially.
The agency representative also will evaluate the prospective adoptive parents' home and make sure you have the room for a child and can provide a safe and healthy environment to raise the child.
The process also typically includes interviews with friends and family members of the prospective adoptive parents regarding their fitness to be parents.
Keep in mind that the agency representative wants to help the adoption happen. He or she is not looking for ways to disqualify you. If you have any specific concerns or issues in your past that you think might be problematic, bring them up and talk about them with the agency representative.

, In an identified adoption, the adoptive parents typically pay to support the birth mother before the child is born and help cover her prenatal medical care.The birth mother's financial needs will vary depending on her age, her own financial situation, her health insurance, and her own medical needs.
The amount of financial assistance adoptive parents may provide the birth mother may be limited by state law. Typically the adoptive parents will pay the agreed-upon amount to the adoption agency, which will distribute the money to healthcare providers or directly to the birth mother.The birth mother and the adoptive parents also typically design a hospital birth plan, which will identify where the child will be born, whether the adoptive parents will be present for the birth, and when they can take their new child home.

, While an open adoption isn't necessarily similar to a shared custody arrangement, typically the birth mother has the ability to visit the child and receive status updates on the child's growth and progress.The degree of openness allowed also may be governed by your state's adoption laws. Your adoption agency will be able to walk you through those requirements.
Your openness agreement will establish what contact is allowed, whether the birth mother can have direct contact with the child or contact through a mediator, and how often the birth mother will receive information about or photos of the child.The openness agreement can be filed with the court along with your other paperwork to make it a legally binding contract.

, Although the process varies greatly among states, any adoption requires the completion of various legal documents to obtain court approval of the adoption and the legal parentage of the adoptive parents.Typically adoptive parents must file an application and written adoption agreement with the probate or family court located in the county where the adoptive parents reside.
Birth parents must complete and sign paperwork providing consent for the adoption.Your state may have other post-birth or post-adoption requirements, including follow-up home visits by the agency and counseling for the birth mother.
In most states, the child must live with the adoptive parents for at least six months before the court will legally finalize the adoption.

, Talk to them about what caused the bad behavior, and what better ways you and your child could deal with it in the future. Acknowledge if your behavior played a role (for example, by you not listening to them saying ""I'm tired"") and tell them that you want to do better too.

, Let your little boy try to read the difficult book on his own, or allow your disabled daughter to attempt to tie her own shoes. Watch over their efforts, and if they seem to be really struggling, ask if they would like help. If they say no, sit back and let them keep trying until they succeed or recognize that they need help and to ask for it.


Either way, they'll be working on new skills: completing the task they attempted, or learning how and when to ask for help.

, Children will behave better if they are well-fed and well-rested. Provide a balanced diet, give them plenty of downtime away from screens, promote exercise, and give them a healthy bedtime.


For downtime, children can play with toys, read, do arts and crafts, talk with family members, or snuggle.
Exercise can become a family project: go for walks, hike, play at playgrounds, go to the pool or beach, etc.
Provide healthy snacks, and place fruits and vegetables in bowls on the dinner table that your children can grab from. Try carrots with dip, berries, bananas, oranges, broccoli and cheese, yogurt, etc. Bring your child to the grocery store and let them pick out a fruit or vegetable.
Incorporate fruits into desserts: ice cream with fruit and chocolate sauce, strawberries dipped in chocolate, bananas with Nutella, mixed berries with whipped cream, etc.

, This shows to them that you care about them, and that you notice when they behave well. Consider both good effort (""I noticed how hard you worked on your math problems! Good job!"") and good results (""Wow, you did such a good job communicating your needs to me. I'm glad that you told me that you needed to leave, instead of throwing a tantrum on the floor. I'm proud of you!"")

, Example chores include making their bed, cleaning their room, doing the dishes, making lunches, feeding the cat, or taking out the trash. Consider your child's abilities when assigning chores; for example, a 5-year-old cannot wash dishes without dropping or breaking them.

, For example, if your child does the dishes after supper, she or he gets a sticker. If her chart has six stickers by the end of the week, you will pay her or him.


This teaches several skills: reliability, responsibility, and budgeting time. Your child will learn planning skills by deciding when to use the day off.
Earning an allowance teaches the child to budget and save; one day, she or he will be ready to handle a monthly salary.

, For example, pay your son $8 an hour for babysitting his little sister, or pay your teenage daughter $10 every time she mows the lawn.

, Teach them some negotiation skills, and try role-playing with them until they feel confident. Then let them negotiate for their wages.


When first assigning a duty, offer a lower pay than you want to give them. If they accept, say ""Aren't you going to negotiate?"" Then negotiate to a higher wage.
If your child is a deep thinker, give them time before putting them on the spot. For example, ""I'm going to consider raising your wages in two weeks, especially if you can tell me a good reason why."" This gives them time to research, think it over and prepare.

Look for signs or threats of self-harm.,
Listen to their verbal remarks.,
Check for acting out behaviors.,
Notice a marked change in their functioning.,
Ask other adults for their opinion.,
Connect with and talk to your child.",How to Know if Your Child Needs Therapy1," Cutting or other acts of self-harm (i.e. burning, scratching, picking at skin, etc.) are red flags that your child needs professional help. However, even if your child hasn’t actually hurt themself, stay alert for threats of them harming themself. This may be clearly spelled out, such as “I want to die” or more subtle like, “I need to punish myself.”, Statements your child makes can help clue you in that something isn't going right in their inner world. Children can't express their thoughts and feelings in the same way adults do. But, they may offer hints that they are having problems.Listen to comments that hint at anxiety or other problems, like ""I'm scared to go to sleep at night because images of the accident come into my head."" Or, ""I don't want to go to school because the other kids don't like me.""

, Common behavioral signs that your child may benefit from therapy include acting out behaviors, such as angry outbursts, uncontrollable tantrums, aggressive behaviors, or extreme crying episodes. Your child may also exhibit hitting, biting, or kicking behaviors towards you or others., Any major, yet unexplained, shift in your child’s behavior or functioning should be considered when making your decision. There are various ways underlying problems may manifest. Bedwetting, sleeping problems, sudden clinginess, eating changes, and bullying incidents may all point to a bigger issue., Before deciding to go to therapy, you may determine the extent of the problem by reaching out to others. Oftentimes, problem behaviors are not unique to the home. Your child may have declining academic or athletic performance, too. Others may also note changes in their attitude or self-esteem.You might talk to your partner or co-parent to see if they have spotted any alarming behaviors. You might also ask your child’s teachers, coaches, school counselors, or childcare professional for their honest assessment.

, Addressing your concerns about the behavioral and emotional health of your child is not always easy. It is important to address these concerns in a way that your child understands or in a way that will allow you to help your child. To better understand what is happening in your child’s world, take steps to open up the lines of communication. You can do this by:Connecting with your child before you direct them to do things and make requests of them.
Keeping your language simple and at a level that your child understands based on their developmental level.
Maintaining a positive attitude.
Showing concern for your child rather than disappointment, anger, or frustration.
Avoiding threats or judgments.
Giving your child time to finish their thoughts and sentences before you speak.
Asking open-ended questions to get your child talking more.

Decide if your child isn’t coping after a major life change or loss.,
Notice unusual sadness, fatigue or tearfulness.,
Evaluate their social life.,
Take note of unexplained physical complaints.,
Notice strain on your marriage or family.",How to Know if Your Child Needs Therapy2," Sudden life changes may disrupt your child’s mental or emotional health. Loss of a loved one, a recent move, episodes of bullying, or a parent’s divorce can negatively impact a child’s functioning. Think back to determine if any recent life changes are affecting them.Any of these experiences take some adjusting, but if your child doesn't seem to be eating, sleeping or functioning as normal after several weeks, they may not be coping well.

, If your child is generally happy and energetic and recently seems down in the dumps, overly tired or blue, they may benefit from talking to a therapist. Take note whether a shift in mood or energy happens suddenly or as a result of certain stimuli. Closely monitoring these changes can help a therapist better understand how to help your child., Children who are struggling may pull away from friends and family. If you’re your child seems to no longer want to play with or hang out with friends or siblings, pay close attention. Social isolation or withdrawal may signal an underlying problem.You might ask your child about this change by saying, “Honey, I noticed you never go outside to play with your friends anymore. Do you want to talk about that?”

, If your generally healthy child constantly whines about stomach aches, headaches, or other physical symptoms, keep track of their complaints. Unless they have an undiagnosed medical condition, these issues should be resolved by a visit to the doctor, rest, or over-the-counter meds. If nothing seems to ease these problems, the root of these physical complaints may lie in your child’s emotional functioning., You may not want to admit it, but your child’s current functioning may be taking a toll on your household. If you and your spouse are disagreeing about how to parent, or if siblings often complain that everything revolves around one child, you may need to seek professional help. Letting the problem go unaddressed may lead to irreparable damage in your home life."

Document your concerns.,
Be aware that an underlying medical condition may cause symptoms.,
Collaborate with your child’s pediatrician for appropriate treatment options.,
Find a therapist who aligns with your values and needs.,
Explain therapy to your child.",How to Know if Your Child Needs Therapy3," You can better inform your child’s doctor and therapist by collecting information. Even after you book the appointment, continue to monitor your child and document your findings. This information can help steer their healthcare team in the right direction., In addition to behavioral, social, and emotional issues, your child may have an underlying medical problem that needs to be addressed. Genetics, chemical imbalances, and damage to the central nervous system can all be part of the problem.Even something as minor as snoring may be linked with behavioral problems in children., For your child to get the help they need, they will need to be properly assessed first of all. You will need to play an active role in the process to ensure that your child gets a proper diagnosis and effective treatment recommendations. You can help facilitate the process by providing your doctor with accurate, well-documented information. This will help your doctor to make the appropriate diagnosis and treatment recommendations.


Make sure to ask questions about your child’s health and express your concerns when you have them.Keep in mind that there are a variety of treatment options available for kids with behavioral problems but getting the correct diagnosis is the key to successful treatment.
You may require a referral from your child’s pediatrician to see a specialist if treatment is required. The referral may be to a psychotherapist, psychiatrist, or other professional based on the initial assessment that was done by your child’s pediatrician.

, Even if you are being connected to a therapist through a referral, you still have a say in who your child sees. It may help to do some cursory research about different kinds of therapy and the types of therapists in your area.Look for a therapist who has special training working with children and adolescents. You may want to make sure their experience acknowledges any unique concerns regarding your child, like disabilities, culture, religion, or language barriers.
Keep in mind that not every therapist will suit your child. Give it time for them to build rapport, but be open to seeing someone else if your child doesn’t seem to connect with the new therapist.

, Once it’s been determined that your child will be seeing a therapist, you will need to break the news to them in a way they can understand. It’s helpful to acknowledge that you’ve noticed your child struggling and letting them know you want to help. Then, explain that a therapist can help address their needs.You might say, “Your dad and I have noticed that your grades have dropped a lot. You’re also skipping band and not hanging with your friends. We think it may help for you to see someone who works with kids who are struggling.”

Practice respecting others’ space.,
Encourage taking turns in activities.,
Use good table manners.,
Wait in lines.,
Practice good hygiene.",How to Practice School Manners with Your Child1," Teach children to be mindful of their own space and other children’s space. For example, teach them to keep their hands and feet to themselves and not touch other children without their permission. Some kids like to reach over and grab something off other children’s desks, so teach them to ask for what they want instead of taking it. When playing with other children, make gentle reminders to respect their space.Say, “Please put that back and ask if you may see it.”
Try to arrange playdates for your child with other children to work on manners. Make sure to let the other child’s parents know that you will be working with your child on manners during their playdate.;
, Taking turns is an important skill at school, whether it be getting food at the cafeteria or waiting to use the slide during recess. Find opportunities for your child to take turns with other children. Have them play board games, share toys, or do activities on the playground. Teach them that just as they waited to take their turn, other children are waiting to take theirs, too.Play games in your family that encourage taking turns.

, Kids should learn not to embarrass themselves or gross others out while eating lunch in the cafeteria. Enforce polite eating habits at home by reminding children not to talk with their mouths full. Children should stay seated while eating and not run around or leave the table. Once their food is finished, they can throw away any trash, put dishes in their lunch box, and clean up their space. Discourage your children from throwing food.Keep children focused on their own food. Don’t allow kids to grab food from another child’s plate or do something gross or unwanted to another child’s food.

, Waiting in line is a common part of being in school, whether it’s to wait to go to recess, being in the lunch line, or lining up to go to gym class. If your child is impatient or struggles to wait in line, practice waiting in lines together. For example, go to the grocery store and model patient waiting while people ahead of you get their groceries. Explain to your child that sometimes you’re first in line and other times you’re last in line.Say, “It’s hard to wait, but we’ll get to the front soon. We have to wait patiently until then.”
Teach your child about healthy and appropriate things they can do to pass the time, such as making small talk, looking around and taking in their surroundings, or seeing if they can be helpful to someone.

, It’s important for children to learn to cover their mouths when they sneeze and use tissues for coughs or sniffles, so as to not spread germs to their classmates and friends. Practice hygiene at home by reminding your child to cover their mouth when they cough or sneeze. Whenever your child wipes their nose, make sure their tissue goes into the trash can right away.Go over good bathroom hygiene, too. Remind them to wipe thoroughly, always flush the toilet, and wash their hands each time they use the restroom.

Encourage your child to greet people when they see them.,
Use role-playing to teach skills.,
Take turns speaking.,
Play a good-manners game.,
Ask your child to invite kids into their play.,
Teach respect of adults.,
Help your child know when to apologize.",How to Practice School Manners with Your Child2," Teaching your child to greet people will help them to manage simple encounters with acquaintances and friends. Teach them to greet people with something like a simple, “Hello! How are you today?”

, If your child is struggling with a particular set of manners, try role-playing scenarios to help them learn and practice. For example, if your child struggles to wait their turn in line or blurts out answers, practice scenarios that may involve waiting patiently in line or taking turns speaking. Ask your child what to say or do.Once they get the hang of it, practice how to work through problem situations, like someone cutting in line.
Make sure to have other adults, such as the child’s other parent or grandparent, alternate roleplaying with your child with you. This will help to expose your child to different types of personalities and behaviors.

, Many children struggle not to interrupt others when they speak. Practice at home by not interrupting your child when they speak, and gently letting them know when they interrupt you. Teach your child to listen to others when they speak and wait their turn to respond, especially when speaking to an adult.If your child really struggles to wait their turn, use a speaking object to teach them to take turns. For example, have a rubber duckie to hold when it’s your turn, then pass it to your child when they can speak.


If your child interrupts, say, “It’s rude to interrupt. I’ll let you know when it’s your turn to speak.”
Be sure to teach your child about active listening and encourage them to use it even when they are not interested in the conversation. Active listening includes making eye contact, nodding, and smiling while they wait for the person to finish speaking.

, Find a way to make practicing manners fun and competitive. For example, see which child can say “thank you” or “please” the most in one day. Children will love looking for opportunities to practice their manners while finding opportunities to be kind. Talk about when they used their words and who they spoke to.For example, if your child has problems sharing, play a game to see how many times they can ask other children if they want a turn. Have them ask, “Would you like a turn?” or, “Would you like to share my markers?”

, Teach your child to include other kids in their play, whether they’re at the park or playground, or playing a game or doing an activity. This can be especially important in including kids during recess or group activities at school. This teaches kids to include everyone and not isolate children who might struggle to fit in socially. Have your kid ask others, “Would you like to play with me?”Teach your child to be inclusive with other children, even if they’re different. If a child from a different race or ability level comes in, encourage your child to extend their invitation to them, too. Also, make sure to teach your child that it is not appropriate to comment on another person’s differences, and that they should wait for the person to bring it up if they choose to do so.

, Teaching respect can begin at toddler age simply by teaching your child to say “please,” “thank you,” and “excuse me.”Also make sure to teach them to do what people ask of them without grumbling or complaining. It’s important for children to respect their teacher, teacher aides, principal and staff at school, so have your children practice interacting respectfully with other adults in their lives such as aunts, uncles, grandparents, and other adults.Encourage polite interactions when your child orders food from a waitress, checks books out from the librarian, and greets other parents.

, Identifying when to apologize, how to apologize appropriately, what to do to make amends is a crucial skill for your child to learn. Teach them how they can determine when they are at fault and what makes a good apology. Also, make sure to teach them about how to make it up to someone they have wronged, intentionally or not.

Identify problem areas.,
Set an example.,
Praise positive behavior.,
Be consistent.",How to Practice School Manners with Your Child3," Ask your child’s classroom teacher if there are any areas your child needs to work on. If there’s a serious problem, get your child’s own feedback as well as feedback from other parents or teachers. If your child is having a hard time getting along with other students, ask them what’s going on and how they are struggling.For example, if you get a report about your child bullying others, ask them what’s happening at school and where problems are occurring.

, Use good manners when you speak to your child and to other adults. Show your children that you respect others through your words and actions no matter who they are. Watch your words and how you speak to your other children, your partner, teachers, and other parents. Set an example that you’d be proud to watch your child follow.Remember to say your own “please,” “thank you,” and “excuse me.”

, Children are more likely to repeat actions if they receive positive feedback or reward from them. Especially if your child is working on a skill (like picking up after playtime), catch them doing it and say something. Say, “It was really thoughtful of you to help Addie put away her toys. Thank you for helping.”Resist the urge to over-praise your child. While you want to encourage them to think of other children and do nice things, don’t treat every action as something special or remarkable.

, Teaching your child manners will take time and patience. Make sure to include lessons about manners in your child’s daily routine and look for opportunities to help your child work on their manners not just at school, but at home and during family outings as well. This will help your child to develop manners that they can use any time, and not just in one circumstance."

Know that biting is normal.,
Determine why your child is biting.,
Develop a response.",How to Keep Your Toddler from Biting1," Your toddler is biting to communicate with you. You must learn what your toddler is trying to say and then make adjustments. Although biting is normal, it is still not acceptable. Typical reasons for biting include:Expressing a need or feeling such as anger, frustration, joy, or excitement
Being overwhelmed by their surroundings
Tired
Teething
Experimenting
Copying other children
Seeking attention;
, Watch your child play and observe the situation when biting happens. Try to notice any patterns. You may be able to predict when your child will bite. Ask yourself some questions when your toddler bites.What happened before the bite?
Was my toddler playing alone or with other children?
Who did your child bite?
Where was your child?
What activity was your child doing?
Who was taking care of your child at the time?
Does your child bite the same person each time or someone different?

, Once you understand why your child is biting and the circumstances that typically result in biting, you can develop a strategy to prevent biting. Tailor your strategy to the underlying causes. For example, the strategy you use for a tired biter is different than a frustrated biter.If your child typically bites when tired, gradually increase their nap time by 10 or 15 minutes to see if this helps with biting.
If your child is a frustrated biter, you may say, ""I know you are frustrated because you can't reach your toy. Say ""mine"" or ""help"" when you want your toy.""

Distract your child if you notice they are about to bite.,
Remove your child from the person that was bitten.,
Give most of your attention to the child that was bitten.,
Have your child help the victim.,
Speak to your child once things have calmed down.",How to Keep Your Toddler from Biting2," If your toddler is about to bite, try to distract your child to prevent the biting. This is not always possible, but it is a strategy you can use until you can get your child to stop biting. Here are some things you can try:Give your child a toy or a book
Take a walk or have your child come look out the window
Give your child a something to bite or chew such as a snack or teether
Send your child to a quiet area to play alone and take a break

, Calmly go get your child. Tell your child, “Stop it. Biting hurts.” Show your child the effect of their biting on the other child.You may need to count to 10 or take a deep breath to keep yourself calm.


You may say, “Look at Sally. She is crying because you hurt her.”
Never bite your child back.This will not teach your child to stop biting. It actually teaches that biting is okay.
Remind your child that teeth are not for biting people, but for other things like chewing food, and smiling.

, It is natural to give most of your attention to your child. However, this signals that biting is a way to get attention. Once you remove your child, spend time comforting the other child. Apologize to the child and show empathy.By giving attention and apologizing, you are modeling appropriate behavior for your child.
You may say, “I’m sorry this happened Sally. I know biting hurts a lot.”
Do not force your child to apologize. This only gives more attention to the biter.

, If your child is 2 or older, you may allow them to help take care of the victim. Your child can help with a Band-Aid or gently rub the area where the bite happened.Use your discretion when allowing this. If the victim does not want your child around or you do not think your child can handle helping, simply remove your child and continue to help the victim.

, The heat of the moment is not the best time to teach and address the situation. Tell your child a better way to express their needs that is specific to the situation that just happened. You should also recognize your child’s feelings at this time.If your child bit because of an argument over a toy, you may say, “I know that you were frustrated because Sally didn’t want to share with you. Next time, ask if you can have the toy or ask a grown up to help you.” You could also suggest that your child go play with a different toy.

Seek medical attention.",How to Keep Your Toddler from Biting3," If you know your child is frustrated or angry, say, “I know you are frustrated, and you want that toy.” You may also say, “I know you are mad,” or “I know you are very angry.” Then show your child an appropriate action to take such as punching a pillow, jumping up and down, ripping up paper, or making an angry face. Choose a behavior that is acceptable for you.If your child is not talking yet, you can teach sign language or gestures for words like “help,” “stop,” “no, “ or “mine.” , A teething toddler may bite to relieve the pain and communicate irritation at the same time. Provide your toddler with something safe to chew on. Cold drinks and topical anaesthetics help with teething pain, too.


Let your child’s caregivers and teachers know that your child is teething.Provide snacks on a regular basis. If your child is biting to signal hunger, offer your child more snacks. Crunchy snacks such as carrots, pretzels, and crackers are ideal for teethers and hungry biters., If your child is biting for attention, do not have a big, emotional reaction. Your reaction signals that biting is successful. Instead, tell your child, “Stop. Do not bite me,” and then act disinterested. Tell your child other ways to get your attention such as:Tapping you on your shoulder
Saying “excuse me,” or “I need you”

, Biting often occurs when toddlers are playing together and do not want to share. Play with your child and show them how to take turns, ask for toys, share toys, and ask for help. Play with your child one-on-one and during playtime with other children.If your child is playing with other children, try to coach them during the session. You may say, “Sally wants to play with cars too. Let’s show Sally where the other cars are.”
If your child wants a toy that someone else has, teach your child to ask before grabbing a toy from another child.
Reinforce your child when they share or express their feelings.

, There are many children’s books about biting. Read the book with your child and discuss the different characters in the book and how they feel in certain situations. If your child is older, you can have your toddler help you read. Ask your toddler to explain what is happening in each picture.Popular books about biting are “Teeth Are Not for Biting” by Elizabeth Veridck, “No Biting” by Karen Katz, and “No Biting Louise” by Margie Palatini., Toddlers cannot change any behavior after one reminder or one day. Consistent, repeated reminders about appropriate behavior will eventually become a change in that behavior. If you change your response each time, it will be confusing for your child.It is important that all of the adults in your child’s life know that you are dealing with biting and to respond when your child bites.


Even if it does not seem like it is working at first, keep going and don’t give up.

, If your child is biting due to anxiety, a regular schedule and predictability will help your child deal with this. Children appreciate having set routines for breakfast, bedtime, nap time, and playtime. If your child knows what to expect from most of the day, they'll be more able to deal with new circumstances.If there will be changes, talk to your child about it and explain things.

, If your child continues to bite or the amount of biting increases, see your pediatrician.A pediatrician can determine if the biting is a result of a medical problem. You can also request an assessment by a child development specialist. A specialist can identify the cause of the biting and help you develop an effective strategy. Check with a pediatrician to make sure there isn't a medical problem.


Biting usually stops around 3 or 3 ½ years of age.If your child attends day care, ask if they can refer you to a professional who deals with biting issues.

Even if you didn't learn the basics of social interaction during your youth, most adults can still learn to adapt to various social settings once they determine that it's important enough to spend time and energy on.


For most people, the biggest hurdle to overcome when learning how to behave is lack of interest. Once you decide to improve, actually improving becomes much easier.
Accept responsibility for your change or lack of change. No one can teach you how to behave if you refuse to learn.;
, There's no book that will tell you how to behave in every setting, but there are books that will help you learn about different expectations for specific settings. If you know you'll need to spend time in an unfamiliar or uncomfortable setting, try reading about the proper way to behave there before the time comes.


In addition to studying books and articles, you can also take courses in communication skills or ask understanding people for advice.

, Social norms are behaviors that are expected of people in various social circumstances. These behaviors vary by role and setting, and most people will need to fulfill multiple sets of social norms.For instance, you'll need to fulfill one set of social norms at the office and a separate set of social norms when you're around friends or family. The expectations that others have of you as part of one group will vary from the expectations of the other group.
You'll need to learn how to behave and which social norms to follow for each group you find yourself involved with.

, No matter how much you learn cognitively, you won't be able to put any of it into practice if you feel anxious about the situation. Keep calm when involving yourself in social situations and try to nurture your own sense of social self-confidence.Anxiety makes it difficult the think and speak clearly. Moreover, you'll probably send nonverbal messages about your nervousness, making it harder for others to react to you in a normal, accepting manner.
There are many different approaches you can take to help calm yourself. You may want to practice positive self-talk before heading out. Including meditation and other general relaxation techniques could help, too. If you have severe social anxiety, you may even wish to seek help from professional counselors or support groups.

, The cognitive approach to learning behavior is important, but oftentimes, the best lessons will come through experience. This means spending more time around familiar and unfamiliar people across a broad range of social settings.Go to places where you can expect to find other people instead of opting for more solitary settings. Intentionally seek out others and start conversations.
Don't get discouraged if things don't immediately go well. Instead, take mental notes and analyze which aspects did go well and where things went wrong. Adjust your behavior accordingly during the next experience.

, Nonverbal body language is important in all social situations, and people will generally be more open to you if you demonstrate open, friendly body language. The basics of open body language include polite smiles and consistent eye contact.


Failing to look someone in the eye can sow seeds of distrust or frustration.
Make steady eye contact, but blink and briefly look away every now and then so that you don't accidentally end up staring the other person down. Excessive staring can be seen as a form of intimidation.
Smiles work in most social situations, but when the mood turns somber, a broad grin won't be appropriate. If you aren't sure what expression to make, glance around at others and consider mirroring the common expression.

, You'll learn more about the social norms you need to fulfill once you learn an adequate amount of information about the other people involved in any given social setting. Actively listening to other people will allow you to gain the information you need.


Additionally, demonstrating your ability to listen to others will also make people feel more open and accepting toward you.
Show that you're listening by devoting your full attention to people when they speak with you. You should also reiterate points and refer back to information spoken by others to indicate that you were actually paying attention.

, It's easier to connect with other people once you find commonalities that connect you to them. These points of common interest can be minor or major, but either way, use them to build social bridges between yourself and others.


Finding common ground usually happens naturally, but it also requires a bit of conscious effort. You don't need to drill the other person about his or her life in question-and-answer format—doing so would actually be a bad idea—but you do need to be involved enough in the conversation to identify a point or possible point when it naturally comes up.

, Learning how to behave toward others will usually happen more naturally if you genuinely come to care about others' circumstances. Actively caring about others will encourage them to care about you.


Think about things from the other person's perspective. Identify what he or she might want, then go a step further and do what you can to help that person meet his or her goal.
Even if you aren't able to help others with their concerns, forcing yourself to care for their interests will naturally cause you to focus less on yourself. As a result, you'll become less self-conscious and more comfortable, which should enable you to respond more naturally.

, Rapport is a sense of social understanding between two or more people. Even though building rapport usually happens at an unconscious level, there are actions you can consciously make to get the process going.


Practice communication traits that typically develop alongside rapport. For instance, reflect similar speech patterns, tones, and volume in the midst of a conversation. The posture and movements of those with strong rapport tend to mirror each other, too, so subtly mimicking others' movements during a conversation may also help.

, Connecting with others in both formal and casual social settings will require some willingness to disclose information about yourself. Knowing how much information to share and when to share it is crucial to your overall success, though.


Make small talk with those you don't know well and those you only know in formal or professional settings. Personal information generally won't exceed beyond weekend plans.
As your relationships deepen, you'll need to work on disclosing more intimate details about your personal life. If you aren't sure how to proceed, wait for cues from the other person. As he or she begins to open up, it should be safe for you to do likewise.

, People who know how to behave across a range of social settings tend to advance in their career more rapidly than those who lack that knowledge.People who seem to lack social and behavioral competence usually appear as though they lack competency in other areas, too. You might be more knowledgeable than other interviewees or co-workers, but if you don't know how to interact well with others, those in charge may not recognize that knowledge.
All careers will require some understanding of how to behave with people, even those that are not centered around social interaction. Even if you don't deal with customers directly, you'll still need to deal with bosses, co-workers, and subordinates.

, As you learn how to behave, you'll likely find more social opportunities opening up to you. This will allow you to meet more people, gain more experience, and enjoy a more active social life.You don't need to have a huge group of friends to be happy and successful, but meeting more people and knowing how to behave with them will usually cause more doors to open for you. For instance, if you're single but hoping to get into a romantic relationship, being sociable with more people could lead you to someone who might introduce you to the right man or woman.

, Learning how to behave will allow you to respond more appropriately to the people currently in your life. As a result, these relationships may grow and become more meaningful than before.


Even if you manage to get through life with very basic social skills, you won't be able to develop many friendships and other deep connections until you learn how to behave with different types of people.

, Once you learn how to behave around different types of people, you'll learn how to excuse yourself from the company of unpleasant people without causing a commotion.


You may dread social interactions if you believe you'll need to spend time with people you don't like or don't understand. By learning how to interact with all people, though, including those you don't care for, you'll learn more about different personality types and how to handle them. This will make it easier for you to politely excuse yourself in ways that are less likely to create anger or hostility.

, People who don't know how to behave socially are more likely to create misunderstandings. On the other hand, knowing how to behave can allow you to prevent more of those misunderstandings by avoiding the usual faux pas.If you interact with people haphazardly, you may find yourself making inappropriate jokes that others find distasteful. On the other hand, you may seem standoffish simply due to your discomfort, and others could perceive that behavior as personal insult.

, As you gain a better understanding of how to behave, you'll usually begin feeling more confident and less nervous around others.


This will make it easier to stay calm in various social situations, which will allow you to continue learning better behavioral patterns.
Becoming more socially confident can also improve your overall self-image and self-esteem.

, Those who have poor social skills are generally more isolated and may experience more mental health problems as a result. By learning how to behave, you can reduce that isolation and improve your overall psychological state.


The vast majority of people are hard-wired to need socialization. When your needs as a social creature aren't being adequately met, you're more likely to suffer from depression, anxiety, and other mood disorders. Learning how to behave can invite more people into your life, and as more people enter into your life, you may notice your feelings of loneliness weakening. Once your social and emotional needs are more thoroughly met, your overall mood and psychological state will often improve, as well.

Stay calm.,
Get everyone on board and stay consistent.,
Separate disruptive children.,
Cater to the age group.,
Know how to regain control over the kids.","How to Keep a Large Group of Kids Calm, Quiet and Respectful1"," Although it can be stressful to be in a room full of loud children, getting aggravated will only make things worse. If the children see that you are becoming annoyed or you start yelling, the situation will likely only become more loud and out of control. Always stay calm and act in control, even if you don't feel like you are., Whether you work alone or with others, you will want to keep your commands and rules consistent. Keeping things consistent can help your kids know what's expected of them and when it's expected. Whenever you are trying to keep a group of kids quiet, always use the same commands and consequences to help make your directions clear. If you work with other instructors, have them use the same commands and consequences that you do.
Avoid changing your instructions to keep quiet. Try to quiet the kids down using the same methods to make them routine and familiar.
Try to use the same methods in different situations. For example, if you have a key word that means ""be quiet"", you'll want to use it in the class room, on a field trip or any other situation you might need to.

, Often times, it's only a few children who are causing the entire group to act unruly. If you can identify and separate kids who seem to make trouble or act inappropriately when they are together, you can help control the group's behavior. Always try to separate disruptive individuals to help keep things calm., Not all methods will work as well as others, depending on the age group of the children you are working with. You'll need to use the right methods on the right age group to help keep them quiet. Always think about the ages of the kids you are trying to keep quiet and use the best methods with them.Younger kids respond well to playful ways of quieting down.
Older children seem to respond well to group rewards or consequences.

, Even though you may have some great methods that usually work to keep kids quiet, they may not always work. Maybe the day is a particularly exciting one or the kids are just not ready to quiet down. If you feel that you've lost control over your class and the usual techniques for quieting down aren't working, try some of these basic methods to help you regain control:Slowly increase the level of consequences. For example, if you are using a point system, take away more and more points for every minute the kids are too loud.
If one child is responsible for the disruption, send them out of the class and speak with them apart from the class.
Changing the activity you are doing can shift the focus onto something other than the disruptive activity they are engaged in.
Once your kids have started to quiet down, have them put their materials away and simply sit in silence. Wait for at least five minutes in silence before resuming.

"
"
Have a special noise.,
Create a “quiet spray”.,
Check out some helpful apps.,
Use a countdown.","How to Keep a Large Group of Kids Calm, Quiet and Respectful2"," It can be helpful to have a special noise that signifies it is time to be quiet. The noise itself can be anything you might like to use. You'll need to introduce the noise as being the “quiet sound” and only use it when you need your kids to settle down. Work with your kids to let them know that the quiet sound is something fun and something to pay attention to. You could try sounding a chime to indicate it's quiet time.
Practice by having your kids get noisy and then seeing how fast they can be quiet after you make the noise.

, It can be a fun idea to create a “quiet spray”, using a simple misting water bottle. Fill the bottle up with water and tell the kids that it is a “quiet spray” and that they need to be silent whenever the spray comes out. Have fun with it, giving it a sense of being magical or special, to help engage the kids and manage noise levels., There are many apps available for your phone or tablet that can be helpful when keeping a group of young kids quiet. These apps listen to noise levels in the room and emit a tone when they get too loud. This noise can be a signal to kids that they need to quiet down until the app stops making the noise., If your group of children is getting too loud, you can try counting down with them. Tell the kids that it's time to do a quiet countdown, starting at ten and getting quieter as you countdown to one. Once the countdown is over, pick up where you left off and resume your lesson."
"
Offer group rewards.,
Use a specific hand gesture.,
Have a code word.,
Play some music or sing a song.","How to Keep a Large Group of Kids Calm, Quiet and Respectful3"," It can be helpful to offer group incentives when dealing with noise issues. You might offer rewards for being quiet or penalties for being too loud. Make sure that the rewards or penalties are based on individual's actions to make all students feel responsible for the others success.For example, if one student is being too loud, you can add a negative point to the classes overall “rewards score”.
If everyone quiets down quickly after you ask them to do so, try adding points to the classes score.

, Middle school children can respond well to special hand signals when they are being too loud. Try coming up with a fun hand signal and telling the kids that it means it's time for silence or that they are being too loud. Throw up the hand signal and wait for everyone to calm down before proceeding., You can use a code word that will let the kids know when they are being too loud. The word itself can be anything you would like to use. Tell the kids that if they hear the code word, it's time to quiet down. Make sure to only use the codeword when the kids are being too loud., You can try using a short song to get some of the kid's energy focused and redirected, before having them settle down for work. Play or sing a song for a few seconds and have them sing along or listen. Tell them that by the time the song is over, they have to be quiet and ready to work."
"
Take break time away.,
Use call and response to redirect the classes attention.,
Play soft music before and during class.","How to Keep a Large Group of Kids Calm, Quiet and Respectful4"," Older students will place a high value on their free time. If a student or students are not quieting down, you can try making them stay after class or during a break. This penalty, or threat of it, should be enough to get most students to settle down and stay quiet when it's time to work., You can try implementing a call and response practice with your kids to help them quiet down. Get in some practice by being noisy, doing the call and response and then making sure that they quiet down after. Strive for complete silence while practicing. The next time your kids get too loud, issue your call and wait for their response, followed by silence.For example you might say ""What are we?"" and have your students whisper ""Quiet"".
Older kids respond better to longer responses. You might try using lines from songs or famous passages in books that your class is reading.

, Playing some quiet music during class time can be an effective way of keeping things quiet. Keep the music itself quiet and have it playing as kids walk into the room. Playing soft music can help set the tone that it's time to work quietly and focus. Some people recommend playing classical music during class.
It's best to avoid playing music too loudly or music that is too distracting.

Have realistic expectations.",How to Keep a Young Child from Messing Up the House," If you have less stuff, kids will have fewer opportunities to make a mess. Work on reducing clutter in your home. Minimizing your amount of stuff will result less mess and, in turn, less stress.Keep only what you really need in areas of your home like the kitchen, the living room, and the bedroom. Allow for some empty space. Minimize knick-knacks and decorations. If you do use them, put them out of reach of kids.
Simplify your children's toy collections. Kids can get by with only a few special toys. Try to keep only a few toys out at a time, and encourage kids to use their imagination to play.;
, It can help to have a designated play space in your house. This can help contain mess to a single room, making cleanup faster. It can also help keep kids from getting into areas of the house, like the kitchen or bathroom, where there may be hazardous materials. Have a single section of the living room as the ""play space."" If possible, use a spare room in the home as a play room.

, Keeping toys organized can help reduce mess. If kids know where to find their toys, they'll make less mess seeking out certain items. Use baskets, buckets, and cabinets to store different types of toys. You can put labels on baskets so kids know which toys are where. If your kids aren't reading age yet, use pictures as labels. For example, print out a picture of a teddy bear and tape it to the basket where you keep stuffed animals., You can help minimize mess by making sure your child only plays with one toy or set of toys at a time. Make a rule that a new toy can only be taken out when other toys are put away.Be firm about this rule. Young children may take awhile to get used to a new routine, so gently remind them about picking up their toys. Say something like, ""You know you can't get your action figures out until you put away your Legos.""
Avoid cleaning up for your child. You want to make sure a child understands responsibility. You can help a child clean, especially if he or she is very young, but make sure the child does some of the work on his or her own.
You can make exceptions to this rule in certain situations, however. If a child is working on something, like a lego statue or a drawing, consider permitting him or her to leave some of the toys out as long as they're out of the way. For example, maybe a child could push a partially made lego statue to the side of the room, and put any loose legos back in the box.
Also, keep in mind some toys may come in sets. For example, your child may have a collection of action figures he or she plays with together. If your child has sets of toys, consider allowing him or her to have one type of toy out at a time.

, A simple way to keep mess from spreading is vinyl tablecloths. These easily cleanable brands of tablecloths can be purchased at many furniture or department stores. Toys like paint, play dough, or crafts can be played with on top of a tablecloth. Wiping down a vinyl tablecloth is much easier than scrubbing mess off of a floor or the carpet.You can also have your child eat meals and snacks over a vinyl tablecloth. Young children can get messy with food, and this can help contain crumbs and spills.
Make sure you teach your kids about proper, safe use of art supplies. Make sure they know not to eat or drink craft materials. You should also make sure kids wash their hands carefully after playing with things like paint and play-dough.Supervise your kids when they're using art supplies. Toddlers may draw on walls for fun, so it may be a bad idea to leave them alone with crayons or markers.

, In addition to a vinyl tablecloth, there are other steps you can take to reduce messes from food and drinks. Young children with limited motor skills should be given bottles or cups with lids. Use placemats when eating at the table. It's a good idea to have young children place cloth napkins or dish towels on their laps when eating to catch food that may spill.

, Having a routine that your children follow can help keep the house clean. Young children thrive on following specific routines. Set rules you follow every day in regards to clean up. For example, toys always need to be put away before dinnertime. Books need to be put away before it's time for bed. Be consistent with your routine. Kids are more likely to clean up regularly if they're running on a schedule.Keep age in mind as you plan your routine. Younger children, between the ages of 24 and 36 months, can do small tasks like putting away toys. You can set a timer to help the kids understand when the chore needs to be completed.As children get older, they're able to have daily chores that should be done based on activities. For example, you can have them always put dirty clothes in the hamper and dirty dishes in the sink. You can also have them do things like fill the dog or cat's water bowl when they see it's empty., Finding ways to make cleanup fun can help give kids incentive to clean. If cleaning time feels like a game instead of a chore, kids will learn to enjoy cleanup as much as playtime.Play make believe. Kids around 5 and 6 years old may respond to make-believe. Encourage your kids to pretend while cleaning. You can have your kid, for example, pretend he or she is running a house cleaning company. Encourage your child to make up a name for his or her company.Think of fun challenges. For example, try to get your kids to pick up all the items on the floor by the end of a certain song. If you're working with more than one kid, have a clean up competition. Whoever finishes cleaning his or her room first gets a prize.
Very young children may respond well to the ""color game."" You can instruct your child to pick up all the items off the floor that are a specific color. Then, name another color. Slowly, toys will get put away.

, If you want your kids to learn to clean productively, make sure you have an understanding over what constitutes a clean room. Set rules for what a clean room looks like and stick to them. For example, you can have rules like, ""All toys must be off the floor"" and ""Clothing should be hung up or in the hamper."" You can provide kids with a checklist to complete in order to make sure their rooms are clean., Give your kids a sense of pride over how a space looks. If kids feel like a space is their own, they're more likely to feel motivated to keep that space nice.Let your children decorate their own rooms. Allow them to put up posters, stickers, and arrange furniture and toys in a way they like. If a child likes the way his or her room looks, that child will have motivation to keep that space clean.
Allow your kids to feel like the larger house is their home as well. Allow your kids to hang up their art work around the house, for example, and give them some say in decorating.
Praise kids for cleaning up. Encourage them to admire how nice a space looks when it's free of clutter, dirty clothing, and other messy items.

, Chore charts can be a fun way to organize and make sure your home is clean. Try to organize a chore chart, assigning a specific chore to each kid.Assign chores based on age. Very young children, such as preschool-aged children, may lack the motor skills to do things like make beds. Assign making the beds each morning to a child in elementary or middle school.
Try to find a way to make chores kid-friendly. Young children, around the age of 3, may struggle to figure out things like sweeping. You can purchase a child-sized broom at a department store. If your child does not understand the concept of sweeping dirt into a pile, you can place masking tape in a square on the floor. Instruct your child to sweep all the dirt into this space.You can find ways to make the chore chart fun. For example, if a child does all his or her chores for a week, you can assign a medal. Medals can be traded in for prizes like money, new toys, or trips to fun places around town.

, Staying slightly ahead of the game can help keep your house clean. Try to get up before your kids. If there's any mess or clutter that may be difficult to deal with when kids are underfoot, clean it up in the morning hours. You can run a load of laundry, throw some dishes in the dishwasher, dust the shelves, or complete any other chore that needs to be done., There are probably areas in your home where young children should not roam. Set up barriers where it's appropriate. Keeping kids out of areas where they're likely to make a mess, like a kitchen, can stop messes before they occur.


You can use wooden baby gates, which you can buy at most department stores, to block off certain areas of your home. You can put a baby gate up between the kitchen and living room, for example, to keep your kids from getting into kitchen supplies.
Use rubber bands or childproof locks to block off certain draws in your home.
Keep certain doors closed at all times. If you don't want your kids in your bedroom, for example, simply keep that door shut. Young children and toddlers are often unable to open doors on their own.

, If you're feeling overwhelmed by the mess, ask other household members for help. Ask older children, other relatives, and your partner to help you manage some of the mess. If everyone chips in, mess can stay manageable even with young children to care for.

, Try to accept that, on some days, your house will be messier than you like. Young children are unpredictable. They may have needs that needs that take priority over cleaning. Accept that, on some days, toys will remain out and dishes will remain undone. It's okay to allow for messiness on occasion."

Consult a mental health professional.",How to Know if Your Child Is a Bully," Bullies often lack empathy, which is why they are able to hurt and tease others without feeling bad about it. Children who seem to be devoid of compassion or don’t feel bad for others often tend to bully. They also have a hard time looking at situations from perspectives other than their own.If your child tells you about a child who was teased at school, you might ask, “How do you think that felt to him?” or “How did you feel when you witnessed that happening?” Their answer can help you understand their ability to relate to others.;
, Part of the appeal of bullying is a desire for increased social status. Bullies often like being popular, admired, or even feared by others, and they use their bullying as a means to get there. In fact, research shows that, as kids are climbing the social rungs of power at school, aggressive behavior increases. The more popular they become, often, the more bullying that occurs.For example, if you hear your child saying that they stopped being friends with some old friends in favor of sitting at the popular kids’ table or being accepted by a new group, this could be a clue that they are interested in popularity.
On the other hand, a mere interest in popularity doesn't denote bullying behavior. You'll want to pay attention to your child using social status in an aggressive manner. For instance, they may refuse to be seen with an old friend who is unpopular, or they might make another less popular kid do their homework or give them money.

, Do they seem proud or arrogant? Bullies are often perceived as having high self-esteem and as such, appear proud and arrogant. They usually think they can do things better than everyone else and look down on others because of it. They may also believe that everyone likes them and wants to be just like them.


If you hear your child talking to a friend about how ugly or stupid someone is and how they are so much better looking or smarter than that person, they could be bullying that person.Your child might be talking on the phone and say, ""None of the girls even like Toby. He's so weird and ugly.""

, One more subtle form of bullying, frequently exercised by females, is called relational aggression. This type of bullying may not include obvious threats like punching or name-calling. It may involve harder to pinpoint behaviors like starting rumors, backstabbing, or excluding certain students.You can spot relational aggression in your child's communication, too. A bully might be talking to one friend and say, ""I would let Samantha come to my party, but she wears old-fashioned clothes. It's embarrassing. I don't want Leslie and Raven to think I like her.""

, If you suspect that your child could be bullying kids at school, reach out to their teacher, coach, or school counselor. Often, it takes the concentrated effort of several people in a child's life to pinpoint bullying behavior and intervene. Ask these adults what their impression of your child's behavior is at school and how your child seems to get along with other students.You might say, ""Excuse me, Mr. Coffman, but I wanted to talked to you about Joseph. One of his other teachers says he acts aggressive on the playground with the other boys, even picking on one particular kid. Have you seen any examples of behavior like this?""

, Any child has the potential for over-stepping the line of aggressive behavior at school. One incident isn't usually enough to warrant a label of bullying. However, if the school is calling you on a regular basis about your child's behavior or other parents have reached out to you, you may want to take their concerns more seriously.


Your child's school likely has a policy requiring them to document any instances of bullying behavior, investigate it, and try to resolve the problem. If your child is repeatedly getting into trouble about bullying, work with the school to determine how you can help intervene., Bullies often display aggressive behavior towards others, including parents, teachers, siblings, and other adults. This aggressiveness is often in the form of yelling, making disrespectful comments, and even harming them physically. They will often show no remorse about what they’ve done, even if they hurt someone else., If your child is hot-tempered, lashes out towards others, easily frustrates, and is impulsive, they may be more inclined to display bully-type behavior. Bullies also often test limits and boundaries, and break rules. They typically either don’t care about following rules, or feel that they don’t apply to them., Does your child only play with certain kids and refuse to play with others? Bullies tend to exclude some kids from study or play, and are intolerant of children who are “different” or “weird.” Bullies often interact with children who are also aggressive and who possibly bully others., Cyberbullying is an easy way to target others. Often, children attack victims on social media sites like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. If your child seems to always spend time on the phone or computer, it could be because bullying is taking place.


Social media provides a way to behave aggressively and inappropriately behind a screen. A lot of bullying is carried out anonymously—and to the obliviousness of parents., Bullies are often able to charm themselves out of certain situations. They also typically put on a show when grown-ups are around and act extremely nice and caring. If they aren’t like this all of the time, or only when they are potentially in trouble, it could be a sign they are bullies. , Often, there are underlying causes for bullying. It could be because they see their parents exhibiting the same behavior. The bullying could also occur because of a need to be popular and they feel this is the only way to do it. Sometimes, the bullying could also take place because the child was bullied before in the past.You might say, “I saw that you are no longer playing with Charlie anymore? You want to tell me about that?” Then, depending on their response, you might go on to say, “You should know that bullying is wrong. Let’s talk about what counts as bullying so we can be sure you’re not doing that…”

, You know your child better than anyone and because of this, you know what type of punishment would likely work best. Some parents find that paying extra attention to the child combats the behavior, while others find that having the bullying apologize and feel embarrassed does the trick. Taking your child to a homeless shelter or place where there are people who are less fortunate may also teach empathy, which could make them feel remorse about the way they are acting., If you can’t seem to get through to your child, consult a therapist or counselor for help. The therapist may be able to get to the bottom of why your child is exhibiting the hateful behavior. Through sessions, the therapist may also stop the child from doing it again.Ask your child’s doctor or guidance counselor for recommendations on a therapist that can help, if you’re not sure where to look.

Be clear in your intentions and expectations.,
Assign age-appropriate responsibilities.As children grow, so too does their understanding of what needs to be done around the house and at school.,
Provide positive motivation.,
Praise good behavior.,
Establish a schedule.,
Lead by example.,
Accept only honest efforts.",How to Instill Discipline in Children1," Clearly explain to your child what you want them to do.Whether it’s a specific grade in a class or the completion of a certain chore by the end of the day, spell it out in unambiguous terms for your child. If you think your child is liable to misbehave in a certain situation, be sure to explain what you want them to do. Also, be sure that your child understands the consequences for misbehavior.


Set realistic expectations. If your child is not a math whiz, don’t pile unnecessary pressure upon them to get an “A” if they’re truly giving it their best. Familiarize yourself with your child’s temperament and disposition, and avoid overloading them with tasks and obligations.For younger children, try posting the rules in a visible location like the front of the fridge.
Always involve your child in the rule-making process as much as possible.;
, Increasing your child’s responsibilities to a level will tacitly demonstrate that you trust them.


Preschoolers and toddlers can put their toys away and put their dirty laundry in the hamper.
Kindergarteners can make the beds or feed the pets.
Elementary school students can help set the table or cook the meal.
Middle and high schoolers can take on a variety of new tasks around the house, increasing in importance each year. Teens can do grocery shopping, babysit, or do the laundry.

, Use a reward system to get kids excited about their chores and responsibilities.For instance, after the child does his or her homework completely, or makes their bed properly seven days in a row, give them a reward. Depending on the child’s age, this might be an hour of TV watching, or a few dollars for them to spend on their own.


Younger children do well with charts and graphs to illustrate how self-disciplined and responsible they are. Try using a sticker board or calendar to mark the days and times the child accomplished an assigned chore or task, and list each task in the order it ought to be completed. Seeing their progress each day will excite them.
Do not discount the utility of money as a reward for positive behavior.Some parents consider it bribery, but it can be an effective tool and give children the opportunity to practice financial discipline as well.
For young children, make it fun to build discipline. Turn chores into a game.For instance, challenge your child to pick up toys as fast as possible, or turn cleaning up into a friendly contest between two siblings.

, You do not want your child to feel as though the only attention they get from you is to deal with bad behavior. When your child completes his or her duties or demonstrates responsible behavior, let them know you are proud of them.Tell your children they did a great job on the assigned task. Say “I’m proud of you” and “Thank you for your help” where appropriate.
For younger children especially, show your appreciation with hugs, kisses, and bouncing on the knee.
Remind your child how far they have come in whatever area they struggle to exercise discipline in.

, Make sure nap times, bedtimes, and mealtimes occur at the same time every day.Communicate regularly to your child what is next on the daily agenda.Try to make sticking to the schedule a fun experience. Use a kitchen timer to mark when something happens. For instance, after setting the timer, tell your child that when it goes off, it will be time for bed, or time to eat, etc.
Older children should have a schedule too. The average teen does not get the required 8-10 hours of sleep each night. This can lead to sleep disorders as well as missed classes or appointments. Ensure your teen adheres to his or her bedtime schedule., Children learn by seeing what others do as much as by following directions. Deal fairly in all your interactions and show respect to others. If you lead a socially responsible, moral, and honest life, your children will too. Remember, as the old saying goes, “Actions speak louder than words.”


Teach your child how to clean up. After a child has finished playing with his or her toys, games, or puzzles, have them clean up and put everything away. Show them how and help them through the process. Show younger children how to clean up to your satisfaction, then slowly let them take it over on their own. Elementary school-aged children should be able to pick up their own things as well as put their dishes in the sink or dishwasher. For tweens and teens, making the bed, doing the laundry, and washing dishes can instill discipline.

, If your child has shirked his or her chores or school responsibilities, let them know you are disappointed and that you expect an improvement in the future. Do not complete or re-do a child’s unacceptable work for them. If your child has incorrectly folded the laundry or not washed the dishes well, for instance, show them how you expect them to be completed and let them know that there will be consequences if their half-hearted efforts continue.Be sure to assign age-appropriate responsibilities to your children.

Show an interest in your child.,
Encourage your child’s interests.,

Use stories to demonstrate virtuous behavior.,
Offer your child options.Don't let them run the show, but ask them, for instance, what color shirt they want to wear, or if they’d prefer carrots or broccoli with a meal.",How to Instill Discipline in Children2," Let them know they are loved. Spend time with them and ask about their feelings.When children know they are cared for, they will realize their lives and actions have value, strive to meet your expectations, and lead more disciplined lives.Ask your child to reflect on their recent successes or failures.
Encourage them in their interests and hobbies.
Express your belief that they can succeed if they try.
Show gratitude that they are in your life. Tell them directly that you love them.

, Extra-curricular activities teach valuable skills and life lessons. Sports, dance, gymnastics, karate, music lessons, hiking or mountaineering clubs – all can instill discipline through repetitive practice, following rules and patterns, and adhering to a schedule. A variety of hobbies will inculcate a strong sense of discipline in your child., Try to understand your child’s point of view.For instance, if they want to stay up late, admit that it would be fun to stay up later and watch another show, read another chapter, etc. Tell them that when you were a child, you wanted to stay up late at night as well. Draw comparisons to your life today, too. For instance, you might share that you often have responsibilities at work that keep you from doing fun things, but which are necessary so that you can provide for your family. When children feel their perspective is understood and they have been listened to, they will be more willing to comply.


Help your child see the consequences of doing what they want to do. If they express the desire to stay up later, remind them they have to wake up early tomorrow. Ask how they think they would feel if they didn’t get a good night’s sleep and they will (hopefully) realize you are looking out for their best interests.

, Reading can help kids learn lessons which they can apply to their own lives.After reading about a disciplined, responsible character, engage your child in a dialogue about the reactions, thoughts, and feelings they had when reading the book. This helps them identify with the character and understand the cause-and-effect process of logical consequences.


For instance, when reading ‘’The Ants and the Grasshopper’’, emphasize how the ants were industrious and ultimately rewarded with food for the winter, while the grasshopper was lazy and had fun, but ended up hungry.

, Instilling discipline should not come at the expense of nurturing your child’s sense of autonomy. As your child’s access to choices grows, so too will their ability to discipline themselves, resist temptations, and focus on their obligations.


Start with simple choices such as what book to read or what color socks to wear.
Only offer a choice when one really exists. Asking a child if they want to take a nap at naptime (and forcing them to do so) does not constitute an opportunity for the exercise of free will.

Stay calm.,
Follow through.,
Match the punishment to the crime.,
Apply consequences consistently.,
Evaluate the utility of punishment.",How to Instill Discipline in Children3," It is important to maintain an even tone and attitude when addressing an errant child.Instead of screaming, ""Get off the table now, or you're in big trouble!"" in a loud voice and angry tone, calmly say ""Please get off the table — you could fall and hurt yourself and I don't want that to happen.""


If the child is being rude to you, use the same strategy. Tell them calmly to stop, and explain why you disapprove. For example, ""Don't swear, it's not a nice way of talking and you sound so much nicer when you talk politely."" Let them know this is their only warning. This is often enough to deter bad behavior.
If the child continues to be disobedient, tell them their punishment and mete it out. Make sure they understand the connection between their behavior and the punishment. Maintain a calm demeanor throughout.

, Never make idle threats or you will lose all credibility with your child. Think before you threaten your child with a certain consequence. Adhere to your stated intention immediately to maximize the connection between the child’s behavior and the punishment meted out.If you show leniency on one occasion, your child may take it as an indication that the rule is not to be taken seriously.


After the child has finished their punishment, hug them or kiss them to show them you aren't mad anymore, and explain again why you don't want them to do that. Get them to repeat why you disapprove — it will make them more likely to remember. After that, say no more about the incident and move on.

, Sometimes a time-out is necessary, while other times, more severe forms of punishment (such as grounding or the elimination of certain privileges) are required. Whatever form the punishment takes, make sure it is fair.Make the punishment is age appropriate. Younger children have a much shorter attention span and will forget what they are being punished for after only a couple of minutes, so grounding them for a week is pointless; they will not understand the concept. Start with one minute in time out for each year of age and work up from there.

, Don’t punish a certain behavior one day and ignore it the next. This will confuse the child and make them unsure what constitutes acceptable behavior. Be consistent in the type of punishment, too. Apply the same punishment for the same misbehavior, every time.Consistency can be problematic when two parents or caregivers see the same behavior in different ways. For instance, a child who runs around in the backyard may be seen as playing harmlessly by one parent, but the other may worry that the child might trip or hurt themselves while running, and therefore punishes for running. Talk with your partner, caregiver, or babysitter about what you consider reasonable behavior and what actions they should in take in the event of transgression.
If you want to change the rules regarding what your child is allowed to do, let them know what your revised expectations are, as well as the punishment they can expect if they fail to comply.

, Some children are compliant, and will respond to the mere threat of punishment. Others are more rebellious and only become more resistant to your directives when punished.Think about your child’s temperament and personality to decide if punishment is a good way to instill discipline.

Pack your equipment the night before.,
Talk to the bride and groom about photo locations.,
Survey the location of the wedding beforehand.,
Dress warmly.,
Arrive at the wedding location early.",How to Photograph a Winter Wedding1," Charge all batteries, cameras, and laptops the night before the wedding. Also, bring backup equipment in case your main equipment breaks down while taking the photos. Equipment includes things like spare batteries, cameras, lenses and memory cards. Put everything in photo bags so it's ready to go in the morning.Other accessories include a flash, tripod, diffuser, and lights.;
, Have a conversation with the couple getting married so you can get a better sense of the wedding location and what they are looking for. Talk to them about your thoughts on the best locations at the wedding venue to take photos and come up with backup plans.For instance, if the bride and groom want family photos taken outdoors but the weather turns out to be bad, plan a backup location indoors that the bride and groom would be happy with.

, Going to the site of the wedding beforehand will give you insight into the best places to take photos. You can also test different camera angles and take note of how the light looks during different times of the day. Look for spaces that enhance the beauty of winter and make use of interesting architecture or beautiful, natural landscapes., The winter can be cold, and you'll need steady hands to take good photos. Make sure that you dress appropriately for the weather. It's always good to overdress rather than underdress because you can remove garments of clothing if you get too hot. Remember to wear a hat, gloves, a scarf, and heavy winter jacket if it's going to be cold outside.


Choose your outfit the night before to save time on the day of the wedding.

, Sunlight is limited during the winter, so if you want to get group or portrait photos outside, it's important that you show up early. This will also allow you the additional time to unpack your gear and get prepared and set up for the day. Do one last survey of the wedding location so you can nail down any final details of the photo shoot.

Increase your exposure to +0.3 or +0.7 to combat underexposure.,
Don't delete images in the field.,
Use artificial light when it gets dark.,
Keep your camera at a steady temperature.,
Change the shutter speed and aperture when it's snowing.,
Consider the photographs' winter composition.",How to Photograph a Winter Wedding2," Taking photographs outside when there's snow on the ground exposes your camera to extra light because it reflects off the whiteness of the snow. For this reason, it's likely that your camera will underexpose photos. Increasing the exposure can help combat this.In some cases, you won't have to change the exposure on your camera. It depends on how much light there is in the frame and what your subject is.

, If you're using a digital camera, it will be tempting to delete images when looking at the LCD screen. Because there's a lot of light and the screen has a low resolution and size, it's important that you save your evaluations for editing. Wait until you can look at the images on a computer under good lighting., During the winter, the days are shorter, and it gets dark outside sooner. To manage this, make sure that you bring artificial lights to take photos for when it gets dark outside.You can use a dedicated, through-the-lens (TTL) flash, spotlights, or clamp lights to achieve more light for your shoot. Using umbrellas and reflectors will help you control the level of light in your photos.Popular flashgun brands include Canon, Nikon, Pentax, Metz, Bower, and Vivitar.
Popular professional lighting systems include Broncolor, ProFoto, Hensel and Lumedyne.

, When you are shooting photos in cold weather it's important that you gradually heat your camera. A sudden change in temperature could fog your lens or create condensation inside of the camera which could damage important electrical parts. Refrain from things like keeping your camera under your coat then quickly exposing it to the cold air.Store your camera in a car or on a porch to allow it to gradually adjust to the temperature outside.
Keep an extra pair of camera batteries because cold drains them., If you use a tripod and set your camera to a longer shutter speed, falling snow will appear like streaks down your photo which can give it a powerful feeling. A shorter shutter speed will freeze the flakes in place which may make for a romantic and memorable photograph. Use a wide aperture if you want to vary how the snowflakes look.Test this with your camera before the wedding date to see which settings you want to use.

, When setting up a scene, use the winter weather to your advantage. Use the rule of thirds and do not center every picture if you want dynamic, interesting, and appealing wedding photos. Try to include the snowy background and beautiful scenery. Capturing snowflakes or snowy trees can also add to the whimsical feeling of your photography.Taking candid photos when people are not paying attention may help you capture genuine moments.

Ask the clients about their expectations.,
Get a schedule for their wedding day.,
Talk to them about your experience.,
Stay loose and positive.,
Stay confident.,
Have the clients sign off on their wedding package.",How to Photograph a Winter Wedding3," Talk to the client about what they are looking for and how many photos they want for their wedding. The winter season comes with its own set of potential problems, so it's good that you set realistic expectations with your clients in case of a blizzard or dangerous weather conditions. Have contingency plans for bad weather and figure out locations inside that you can take your photos.


Put everything that you talked about in writing before the day of the wedding.
Discuss pricing options and how much everything costs.
Let the couple know when they should be receiving their wedding photos., Having a schedule before the wedding will let you know what time important events like when the reception and first dance are taking place. You'll also have an idea for how much available sunlight you have to shoot photos outside. Because the winter means that the nights come earlier, you may want to plan on taking portrait or group photographs earlier in the day. Connect with the wedding planner to get details about the venue and the ceremony.


Make sure to be on time for important and memorable moments like the best man's speech and the bride and groom walking down the aisle.

, It's best to be transparent about your experience taking wedding photos, specifically during the winter. Because shooting in the winter weather takes a unique set of skills, it's important that you have expertise doing it. This will help your clients manage their expectations of your work. Show off images from other winter weddings.

, If it's cold outside and there is an outside photoshoot, it's important that you stay loose and positive. Use humor to open people up for great photos. Because most people will be cold, it's critical that you make their experience as positive as possible so that the pictures come out well.


Make yourself more relatable by saying things like, ""I know it's freezing and uncomfortable right now, but we are almost done. Let's take some really great photos for Sharon's wedding!""
You can say things like ""Awesome job. Great photo, thanks!"" to encourage people and put them at ease when you're taking their picture.

, A wedding is a significant moment in many people's lives. The couple will probably want someone who is confident in their skills because of it this. Remember to stay honest about your experience, but be confident in your abilities. Having confidence will put people at ease and help you get better photos.When speaking to the to-be-married couple, you can say something like ""While I only have three winter weddings under my belt, every client has enjoyed their photos and thanked me afterward. I have examples of my work here for you to look at.""

, Talk to the clients after the wedding and have them sign off on the design for things like their albums, cards, and prints. This will ensure that they know exactly what they are getting and can help them give you input on any last changes that they would like to make. Customize their cards and prints to fit the winter theme.

Identify your child’s triggers.If you know what is causing your child’s emotional melt-downs then you already have a critical piece of information that you can use.,
Modify difficult situations.,
Communicate with your child.,
Use distraction.",How to Keep Your Kids from Misbehaving1," For instance, if your child struggles every time you take a trip to the grocery store then you can safely assume that there’s something about those trips that is triggering the tantrum. Trying to figure out the triggers may at first be a bit of trial and error, but if you pay close attention eventually you will see a pattern emerging. Keep in mind that if you know what her triggers are in advance then you can focus on preventing the tantrum from occurring in the first place.


Try logging your child’s tantrums in a journal to get an idea of the triggers. Keep track of the time of day, who was present, where you were, and what happened before and after the tantrum. Eventually a pattern will emerge that will help you get a better understanding of the factors surrounding the tantrum.
Keep in mind that some children are more prone to tantrums than others. Children who are moody, hyperactive, or struggle with change or transitions may demonstrate tantrums more often than other children.
Fatigue, hunger, being forced to share a favorite toy, long car rides, trips to particular stores, or any other situation that your child finds difficult can trigger a tantrum.;
, Once you know what might be causing her emotional melt downs, try to modify the activity so that it is not as overwhelming for your child.Preventing a tantrum is much easier than trying to control a wailing three year old in the middle of Macy’s. Here are somethings that you could try:


Bring activities and snacks to occupy your child’s attention. Allow your child to have some control over which activities or snacks to bring.
Try to keep errands and trips to stores as short as possible, preferably under 30 minutes for toddlers. You may want to bring a prepared shopping list to help you get through the store quicker. Alternatively, you could bring an older sibling to help with the younger child. The older child can entertain the younger sibling while simultaneously experiencing a sense of pride for being able to help.
Make sure that your child is well-rested and that she is not hungry before going on errands. Schedule trips around nap time and meals.
When at home, be sure to put items that are off limits out of eye sight. For example, don’t leave potato chips lying on the counter.

, Tell her in advance what you are planning to do and try to stick to this plan as much as possible. Communication is important even when interacting with a young child. Do not underestimate your toddler’s ability to understand what you are saying; she probably comprehends more than you may think.Use simple and direct language when talking to a young child. Also, try to keep the communication short. For example, you could say to your preschooler, “We are going to the bank and then we have to do a little grocery shopping. After that we will have lunch and go to the park. Then it will be nap time.”
Be sure to give your child a ten minute warning before changing activities. This is important even for older children. Children often respond better to transition when they know that the transition is coming. So, for instance, you could say “Susie, in ten minutes we will be leaving the park.” You may want to remind her again at the five minute mark.

, Young children have a short attention span and are easy to redirect.When you notice that a tantrum may be on the way, try distracting her with another activity. For example, if you know that she is about to start wailing in the middle of the grocery store, try picking up her favorite stuffed animal and saying “Here is Mr. Piggy. Let me hear you say oink!”

"
"
Describe the behavior that you would like to see happen.,
Demonstrate what that behavior looks like for your child.,
Use role-plays to practice the desired behavior.,
Praise your child when she follows directions.,
Avoid power struggles.",How to Keep Your Kids from Misbehaving2," It’s very important that your child or teenager understands what your expectations are as well as why you are asking her to do it. Also, asking children to give input about why it’s important to follow directions is important so that they feel included. Here are some things that you could say:“Vanessa, I think that it’s important to follow directions so that everyone can stay safe. Why do you think it’s important to follow directions?” You could also ask older children and teens, ""Why do you think it's important for you to do this?""
“When I ask you to do something I want you to look at me.”
“Then I want you to say ""Okay"" so that I know that you heard me.”
“Start immediately and finish the task that I asked you to do.”
Keep in mind that the instructions may be modified based upon the age of the child or teen. For example, you might want to also practice conflict resolution with older children and teens. You could add:

""If you do not agree with me or would like to negotiate then you should say, ""Okay"" so that I know that you heard me.""
""Then you should say in a calm speaking voice, ""Mom, I have a suggestion. Can you hear me out?""



, Switch roles with the child so that you are acting as the child and she is the mother or father. Say “Give me something to do” and then allow her to give you directions to follow. Model the desired behavior for your child by looking at her, saying okay, and immediately beginning and completing the task.If you are practicing with an older child or teen be sure to model appropriate negotiation.


There can be limits on this the demonstration. For example, the child may say “Go clean my room,” which of course you would not do. You could say to her, “Cleaning your room is not my responsibility. Let’s try practicing with a different set of instructions. We could try things like putting the glass in the sink or putting away the cell phone.”
The demonstrations should be age appropriate. What you demonstrate with your preschooler will be different from what you demonstrate with a Freshman in high school.

, After you have demonstrated the desired response for your child, it’s time for her to practice. Look at your child and say, “It’s your turn. Please bring me the remote control from the coffee table.” Or you could say to an older child, ""Okay. Let's practice. Please put away your cell phone for the rest of the night."" Then let your child practice following those directions.


You can use role play for children and teens of all ages. In fact, role play is often used with adults to teach new behavior. It is a very effective way to teach children and teens a new skill.
It takes practice to master a new skill. If she doesn’t get it right immediately, use gentle reminders and correction to reinforce the behavior. Eventually she will remember on her own. A good reminder might be to say, “Remember, you’re supposed to look at me and say ""okay"" so that I know that you heard me.”You could also ask an older child, ""What can you say when you want to negotiate?""

, When it is time to actually put the skills to use, be sure to praise your child when she responds appropriately to what you asked her to doAlso be sure to praise older children when they disagree in an appropriate manner. You could say things like, “God job Vanessa for clearing the table” or “Thank you for sharing your ideas and frustrations in a calm tone.” Continue to use gentle reminders as your child masters these skills.

, Your child may try to test the new boundaries that are being implemented. Be sure that you allow your child the opportunity to ask questions if she does not understand a task and to present alternative options if she wants to negotiate; however, be sure to avoid getting into unnecessary arguments. If your decision stands and she becomes argumentative, you could say something like, “I would be glad to discuss this with you, Vanessa, after your room is clean.”

Reward positive behavior.,
Get your child’s attention.,
Establish rules.,
Explain the rules and the consequences of any rule infractions.,
Use reminders when it is appropriate.,
Enforce the rules.",How to Keep Your Kids from Misbehaving3," Your child is not born already knowing what to do so it’s up to you to train and mold her behavior. Therefore, it’s essential for you to identify what behaviors you want to see your child or teen exhibit and then reward those behaviors. Research shows that rewarding positive behavior is actually more effective than punishing negative behavior.Use praise to reward your child when she is behaving appropriately. Let her know that you are proud of her when she gets it right. In general, children and teens tend to respond well to praise.
Save larger rewards for bigger achievements and milestones. This way your child will associate good behavior with an internal sense of pride rather than an external reward.

, When giving your child instructions, be sure that you have her attention first. Sometimes parents accuse children of not listening when in fact they were so preoccupied with other external activities or internal emotions that they did not clearly hear the instruction.This is true for children and teenagers.


Get your child’s attention by calling her name. Wait until she is looking at you before you give the instruction. For example, you could say, “Sharon” and then wait until she looks at you. When she looks at you then say, “It is time to leave the store now” or ""Please take off your head phones while at the kitchen table.""
If possible, give your child the opportunity to finish doing what she is doing prior to transitioning to another activity. This is especially important for younger children but older children respond better to this approach, as well.

, Make sure that you and any co-parents in the home are in agreement with the rules so that children are unable to split or divide caretakers. You should also include your children and teenagers in the rule making process. It’s important that children feel like they are a part of family decisions. Calling a family meeting is a great way to develop the rules as a unit.


Be sure to establish “off limits” behavior.Examples of off-limits behavior might include things like saying “I hate you,” hitting others, name calling, cursing, cheating, walking out of a room during discussions, or playing derogatory music. You choose the off-limits behavior that are appropriate for your household.
Don’t be afraid to be firm about the important issues. For example, if your middle school aged child needs to be home by 8pm don’t allow her to argue her way into a 10pm curfew.
Use Do’s rather than Don’ts when developing rules. For example, it is better to say “Call me when you arrive to your friend’s house” instead of “Don’t forget to call me when you get to your friend's house.” Or you could say, ""Be home by midnight"" rather than saying, ""Don't be late coming home tonight.""

, It is important that you clearly explain what the rules are and how violations will be enforced before a violation actually occurs.Use clear concise language that is easily understood by your child and teen. This is vital so that behavioral expectations are clearly understood.


Try making a list of activities or privileges that your child enjoys and would miss if she lost. Withdrawal of these privileges could be appropriate consequences. This is especially helpful with teens.
Make sure that the rules are concrete and specific so that your child does not misinterpret what is expected. For example, it’s better to say, “Wear your white sneakers with the blue stripes to go outside and play” instead of “Wear old shoes to go outside and play.” Your idea of old shoes may be the sneakers she got at the beginning of the summer whereas her idea of old shoes may be the dress shoes that she wore last week to visit Grandma.
With a teen you could say ""Make sure that all of your chores are complete and your homework is done before you go to Megan's house"" instead of ""Make sure that you do everything that you need to do before you leave for Megan's house.""
All consequences should be things that can be easily implemented so that you avoid making empty threats. Empty threats will weaken your influence and your kids will learn to not take you or your rules as seriously.

, Under some circumstances, gentle reminders are the way to go.For example, if your preschooler is running in the house, then it’s okay to prompt her to stop running. Or if your preteen hasn't started her chores yet, you can remind her that the chores still need to be completed.


For egregious rule violations, a reminder is not necessary. For example, if your teenager is two hours late coming home from a party then no reminder is necessary. The consequence should be immediately applied.
An example of a gentle reminder is “Remember Giana, we walk in the house” or “We talk to each other respectfully, even when we disagree.” Avoid using judgmental or belittling language such as, “You don’t ever listen!”
Giving children a warning is also appropriate for less serious infractions. For example, if your children or teenagers are bickering at the table, you could say, “This is your warning about bickering at the table. If it continues then ____ will happen.” Only ONE warning should be given. If the behaviors continue, then the consequence should be applied.

, Children and teenagers will always try to test the rules so don’t take it personally when it happens. It’s developmentally appropriate as they try to experience a sense of autonomy. However, children benefit from consistency and stability. That is why it’s important to be consistent with enforcing rules as much as possible.If you only enforce rules sporadically then it can confuse your child or teenager and cause her to test limits even more.


When the rule infraction occurs, calmly remind your child or teenager of the consequence and follow through with it. For example, you could say “Please bring me the PlayStation” or “I’m sorry but you may not go to the party tonight.”
It is okay to explain why the consequence is being implemented, however children are pretty smart and probably already know what they did wrong. Be sure to avoid arguments with your child or teenager after you have already clearly articulated why the consequence is occurring. Instead, you can respond by simply saying “I understand,” “I know,” ""That is the final decision,"" or “What did I say?”

Be prepared.",How to Photograph a Wedding," Establish whether you are taking pictures in addition to a professional photographer, or if you will be relied upon to take the majority of the wedding photographs. Make sure the couple's expectations are reasonable, according to your abilities.;
, Before the wedding, check out the places where the ceremony and the reception will be held. This will give you an idea of what kind of natural lighting and backdrop are available. You can also begin to envision what kind of pictures you might want to take.


Find an aisle seat in the church that will make it easy for you to get up and down if you will be taking pictures during the ceremony.

, You will not want to miss the major parts of the wedding, such as the bride walking down the aisle, the first dance, cutting the cake and tossing the bouquet. Talk to the bride and groom about other important shots that they want photographed, including family photos, wedding party photos, and pictures taken before and after the wedding.


Look for recommended wedding shot lists in wedding magazines such as Modern Bride, and on wedding websites such as The Knot.

, Make sure you have a reliable camera that takes clear, high resolution shots. Bring a second camera if possible, and set it with a different lens to take different types of pictures.


Use a wide angle lens for candid shots and pictures taken in small spaces, such as photos of the bride and her attendants getting ready.
Bring a tripod to help you get good formal pictures, particularly group shots of family members and the wedding party.
Make sure you have all the necessary lighting and flash requirements. If the church will not allow flash photography, you will need a fast lens with wide apertures, or you will want to increase the ISO. Consider a lens with image stabilization, and use a flash diffuser when you need to soften the light.

, Find opportunities for fun candid shots. Be sure to include still portraits, as well as formal table shots.

, Anything can happen on a wedding day. Be sure you have backup plans to address bad weather, mechanical malfunctions, uncooperative guests, and last minute changes. Attend the rehearsal if it is possible, and check in advance if there are any times that photography will be forbidden, such as at the church.

He should be comfortable communicating assertively and authentically, maintaining intimacy and closeness, giving and receiving love freely, and being vulnerable., Find out for certain that your fiancé has worked through his feelings about the previous marriage before he makes a commitment to you. This can include addressing any grief, self-doubt or other negative feelings that came about from the divorce.


Discuss what things about the previous marriage he liked. Talk about similarities between your relationship and the past one, but don't mold yourself into something that you are not.
Be open about what made the previous marriage fail so that you can work around the issue or avoid making the same mistakes as were made in the previous relationship.

, Being married once before probably hasn’t killed your chances of reaching the next level in your relationship, but it does mean that he may be hesitant getting married a second time.


Bear in mind that his reluctance to get engaged or married again so quickly is not a reflection of his feelings about you. Establish a timeframe for the progression of your relationship. Give him a year, two years, or 3. Do what works for you.
If marriage is important to you, have a timeframe that supports your self-respect. If he proposes by then, you got what you wanted, but if he doesn’t propose, don’t wait years for him to make his move. Don’t sacrifice your needs to appease to your partner’s.

, Marriage is different the second time around, especially when kids are involved. Having realistic expectations will help you enjoy the wedding without feeling disappointment.


Realize that your husband-to-be's timetable may be different than a person marrying for the first time as far as setting a wedding date, taking care of pre-wedding details and making the marriage official.
Determine how you’ll feel about the different experience of a second wedding. If this is your first marriage, will wedding plans taking a backseat to kids bother you? Will it bother you that the honeymoon will literally be over after the honeymoon and that your newlywed years won’t look like the newlywed years of a never-married beau? Think about it.,


Discuss the role of this person as step-parent. Talk about rules and boundaries of the household, and don't hesitate to seek family counseling if you fear that there will be an issue with the transition.
Use your child or children as part of the wedding ceremony. This act of inclusion could create a good memory for your child.

, When people check off “irreconcilable differences” as the reason for divorce, children from the former relationship could be a part of those differences.


Give yourself time and think about what you’re about to do. Think about the role you’ve played in his kids lives while you were dating or engaged. What did that time tell you about taking the official role of their other mom?
Do you like his kids? If you have kids of your own as well, do those kids like one another? Is that a dealbreaker if they don’t?

, You will typically need to show this when applying for your marriage license. Either one of you can obtain this by filling out a Divorce Certificate Application form with your state’s Department of Health.Some of the information you’re required to have include the date of occurrence, the city or county of occurrence, a photo copy of a state issued form of identification, and the signature of your fiancé.
There will be a fee of no more than $20 that must be paid in exchange for receiving the divorce decree.

, Don’t bend to feelings of the wedding being less special because he has done it before. Walk down the aisle and join the man that you love in holy matrimony on the road to eternal love.


Have your kids participate in the wedding by establishing a ritual that involves all of them so that they feel a part of your love too.
Include them in the wedding vows and have the officiant recite vows for a blended family in addition to the traditional vows.Create a sand ceremony with the members of the blended family-to-be and have each person pour different color sand into a bigger glass vase, symbolizing the individual as they form a union through family., Prioritize the kids above all else and set a goal that aligns with that.People who want to get along typically do, so imagine yourself getting along and follow suit. As the person he intends to marry, it is your responsibility to care for his kids too in accordance with their biological mother.If you see yourself being jealous, angry, and resentful, your relationship with his ex will mirror that.

, Take an hour and genuinely connect with her by telling her you love the kids and admiring her for the role she plays in their lives.


No you don’t have to be best friends, but building a rapport that is all your own will be beneficial to retaining a healthy dialogue between the both of you.Find a common ground, which will more than likely be the kids. If that is the common ground, stick to conversation that revolves around that.

, It can be easy to feel like you should replace the children’s bio mom, especially if you feel that she is not doing an adequate job. Love her kids, but not so much that she feels insecure.Try not to take over parenting decisions like when children should go to bed, curfews, who they can and cannot hang out with, what they can and cannot eat.
Have respect for rules that are already set to avoid resentment between you and the ex wife, instead to prevent the kids from becoming anxious.

, This can be what you contribute to the kids’ lives to make them easier and thereby, the ex wife’s life easier.


If she’s good at being punctual, she might be the one who takes kids to their appointments. If you’re better at material things and appearance, you might be the one who takes them school shopping for clothes and shoes.
Refrain from stepping on one another’s toes to ensure smooth relationships on all sides.

, Avoid unnecessary anger or resentment from your partner and arguments by expressing negative emotions and opinions to someone who is not your partner.


Do not insult the ex wife in front of the kids. They will feel withdrawn from you because you are attacking their DNA by attacking their mother. They might also tell the ex wife about what you said and it can cause problems between you and her and her and your partner.If anyone vents, it should be your partner. Let him be the person who vents, not you. When you speak negatively about his ex, it is a reflection of him since marrying her was his choice, so refrain.

, Blending families for outings might not be your style, but it can be a great way to forge a union and a camaraderie between households.


Every week or two, invite the ex wife over to family game nights or out to a family bowling event.
The kids will foster a relationship with you knowing that accepting you won’t mean their mom feels loved any less.

Book red eye flights and night flights.,
Try role playing before the flight to make sure that your child understand that she needs to follow the rules.,
Try role playing to teach your child how to go to sleep on a plane.,
Check in early.",How to Help Your Child Sleep on a Plane1," Night flights are considered the last flights that leave the airport for the day; red eye flights are the flights that leave at night and do not land at their destination until the next morning. These types of flights are recommended because your child will already be sleepy and less stimulated because it is nighttime.


Pick out a window seat for your child. Your child will feel more protected because she gets to sit between you and a wall. Being in the window seat also helps because your child can place her pillow against the wall and lean on it, making her flight more comfortable.
If you are traveling with an infant, request a FAA-approved restraint call the airline and make sure that they allow car seats of your own to come on the plane (note that not all car seats are approved for airline use).;
, Some kids may operate better in structured environments and if you constantly talk to them about the upcoming flight, then you can set proper expectations.Communicate with your child and set expectations for the flight. Tell your child that you know she’s excited about her first (or second or third) ride on a plane but there are certain rules that she needs to follow. Make her understand that she needs to respect the rules, as well as the other passengers, by not being disruptive.


You can tell your child that when on a plane, it’s like living in a small “country” where the pilot is the “president” and the “flight attendants” are the cops. Tell your child that she has to follow the rules and obey you, as well as the flight attendants and pilot.

, During bedtime a few nights before the flight, play pretend with your child that you are both getting ready to go sleep on the plane. Tell your child that you expect to her to act in the same way that she would act while getting ready for bed at home.


If you do not have control over the schedule of your flight and you end up traveling in the morning or mid-morning, you can still role play with your child a few days before the trip by pretending to be on the plane during nap time in the afternoon. You can slowly, over the days, introduce an eye-cover to your child so she can use it during the flight to cover her eyes to help her to sleep.

, Getting to the airport and checking in early will allow you the time before your flight to help prepare your child for bed. This could mean changing your child’s diaper, getting her dressed in her pajamas, and getting your child a snack.


When you check in, find out if there are any extra seats on your flight. If so, you may be able to switch your seats around so that you are your child sit next to an empty seat. Your child will then be able to lie down in both her seat and the empty seat, making sleep more easily attainable.

Follow your child’s bedtime routine, even while up in the air.,
Give your child some milk before bed.,
Bring sugar-free snacks for your child.,
Make sure to bring activities for your child.,
Watch your child for signs of sleepiness.",How to Help Your Child Sleep on a Plane2," These means doing the activities that your child’s usual bedtime routine would involve, including brushing her teeth, reading bedtime stories, and getting into her pajamas. Tell your child its time to get ready for bed; take her to the washroom to brush her teeth, help her change into her pajamas, and read her a bedtime story when you both get back to your seat.


Make sure to turn off the reading light, and get rid of any other gadgets or seat back movies that might be on.

, Milk is a good source of tryptophan, a sleep-inducing substance that can help your child get a restful sleep, even on a plane.While giving your child her milk, make sure to avoid giving her a snack that contains sugar along with her milk, as sugar can give your child a boost of energy.

, Consider giving your child a sugar-free oatmeal cookie, because oatmeal is a slow release carbohydrate that will be less likely to disturb your child’s tummy.

, If your child absolutely has no desire to sleep during a plane ride, then there’s also absolutely nothing that the other passengers and flight crew can do about it – so you shouldn’t be pressured to do anything about it either. Instead, give your child quiet activities to do while on the flight. This could be:


Playing with a tablet.
Reading a book.
Walking up and down the aisles (with you of course).
Watching an inflight movie.

, If your child was not sleepy when you got on the flight, and she has now played games for awhile, watch her for signs of sleepiness. If she begins rubbing her eyes or yawning, take this moment to give her some milk and let her listen to her favorite lullabies on your Ipod.


Once she has been asleep for awhile, you can ever so cautiously play a blanket over her. Lower the window if you can to keep the light out if you are on a daytime flight.

Understand the debate regarding whether or not it is ok to give your child medications to help her sleep on planes.,
Understand what benadryl is, and how it can make your child sleepy.,
Be aware that parents are advised to stay away from giving children 6 or younger any medication that contains diphenhydramine hydrochloride.,
Consult your physician before even considering giving your child Benadryl.,
Do a test run.",How to Help Your Child Sleep on a Plane3," There is an ongoing debate among parents and experts on whether it is acceptable and safe to medicate your child (most especially babies and toddlers) to make them fall asleep when traveling by plane. Some experts quietly advise age appropriate doses of antihistamines (anti allergy) and cough medication to children.


However, the American Academy of Pediatrics’ (AAP) policy remains that oral cough and anti allergy medications should never be used for their side effects in children younger than 6 months because of adverse unwanted side effects such as confusion, difficulty urinating, dry mouth, excessive sweating, paradoxical hyperactivity, head pain, loss of appetite, nervousness, ringing in the ears (tinnitus) and stomach cramps (tummy aches)., Benadryl is made up of Diphenhydramine hydrochloride which is an antihistamine used to relieve symptoms of allergies such as rash, itching, watery eyes, itchy or runny nose, itchy throat/nose and eyes and sneezing.Benadryl has also been used to alleviate nausea and dizziness caused by motion sickness). It also helps people relax and become drowsy.

, However cough and cold medications have been shown by numerous studies to be unsafe and ineffective to children younger than 6 years old and the AAP stands by the premise that experts and parents should never give Diphenhydramine hydrochloride and drugs of the similar nature to children younger than 6 – even if it is to treat actual cough and colds and allergies, much less to use it for its drowsing side effects.


In fact, studies have also shown and experts have agreed that using Benadryl or Diphenhydramine hydrochloride, has a “paradoxical” effect on toddlers and children 6 and below. Instead of making them drowsy and sleepy, the drug acts as a “super charged energy booster” and makes children hyperactive and alert.

, If you are seriously thinking of administering Benadryl to your child (aged 6 and below), you must first consult with your pediatrician about the safety of giving your child this drug. Always follow the recommended dosage, and only use it as a last resort.


For children 2 years to 6 years old, the dosage is 6.25 mg orally every 4-6 hours, never exceeding 37.5 mg in 24 hours.For children 6 years to 12 years, the dosage is 12.5 mg to 25 mg by mouth every 4-6 hours, never exceeding 150 mg in 24 hours.For children older than 12 years, the dosage is 25-50 mg orally every 4-6 hours never exceeding 300 mg in 24 hours. The computed dosage is based on 1.25 mg of Benadryl to every kilo of your child’s weight.Make sure to consult with your pediatrician if you can administer the drug to your child because again, Diphenhydramine hydrochloride, like any other drug, has side effects and may have an adverse interaction with other drugs if your child is taking other medications already.

, If you do decide to use Benadryl, try giving your child the recommended dose one afternoon one week prior to the scheduled trip so you know exactly how it will play out. Make sure that there are no other drugs interacting with Benadryl or the cough medication during the “trial period” and during the actual flight, so you know exactly what effect Benadryl has on your child.


Make sure to document your “findings” because really, 3,000 feet (914.4 m) up in the air is not the safest and most ideal place to have an emergency or be experimenting with medicines on your kid.

Finish the album with one or two pages dedicated to the bride and groom.",How to Make a Storybook Wedding Album," Usually, you put a great deal of thought in the design and text of your wedding invitation. Therefore, it would be a shame not to include it in the album. Furthermore, it contains other memorable information, i.e. the wedding date, the location, which makes it a great item for the first page.;
, This section can be subdivided, if necessary into subsections such as “The Dress”, “The Garter”, “The Reveal”, etc.

, This can include the happy couple with their parents, the bride with her maids, the groom with his men, all family members together and so on.

, Photos could feature: the venue as a whole, the chairs for the guests, the spot where the priest will marry the couple and various bits of beautiful decoration.

, The ceremony is for most couples the most emotional and memorable part of their wedding. Therefore, one should put as many pages as necessary to do the moment justice. One should not miss: the entrance of bride and groom, the priest’s speech, the first kiss, the ring, the readers.

, The moment directly after the ceremony produces a lot of nice pictures, because everybody is still very emotional and a lot less nervous.

, The next part of the album will focus on the celebration. This, like the ceremony, usually starts with at least one page dedicated to the venue. One can show the place from the outside, the entrance, the table decoration, the buffet and always very decorative: filled glasses of Champagne. This page can be combined with pictures of the happy couple (and the guests) entering the hall.

, Be sure to include pictures of both the bride and groom giving their speeches. One can complement the page with additional photos from the various groups on their tables.

, You may want to follow it with pictures of father and daughter, mother and son, father and daughter-in-law, mother and son-in-law, etc dancing.

, This works the best if the cake is first shown intact, followed by a shot of bride and groom doing the first cut, followed by a funny sequence of photos showing bride and groom eating the first piece.

, It looks always great if there are some nice photos with the bouquet and garter in midair and the overjoyed people who caught them.

, Random photos from various stages of the wedding can be put here.

, If the groom carried his bride off in a fancy car, then that should to be shown now. Several romantic shots of the happy couple hand-in-hand (maybe with a nice sunset in the background) are also effective.

Identify your personal values.,
Be honest with yourself about your shortcomings.,
Make a relationship check-list.,
Determine that you can trust your partner.,
Communicate efficiently and effectively.,
Respect your partner.,
Try your hand at living together.,
Match up your desired life goals.,
Provide compromise.,
Go to premarital counseling.,
Don't rush your relationship.",How to Know the Right Age to Get Married," A mature individual knows herself and what she believes in. Before getting married, it's important to know what you value and if you're being completely honest with yourself.


Have a healthy self esteem. By knowing you're worthy of love, you set the bar high on how you'll be treated by your partner. When you have low self esteem, it may allow you to accept unacceptable behavior while preventing you from enjoying a healthy relationship.When you're insecure, you can be irritable, have poor communication and use impaired judgement in your work and personal life. In order to attract confident and healthy partners, you must have self-confidence.
Know what is important to you. Ask yourself what values you have. If you're a family person, you may want many children and regular family outings. Perhaps you are more career-driven so you may need to skip children all together or wait until later in life to re-evaluate if you want a family. Maybe you are quite religious and need someone of the same faith. Search within yourself and decide what makes you the person you are.;
, Self-reflection is important in all stages of personal relationships. If you are unable to be honest with yourself, you can't expect to be honest with another individual. Set aside some personal time to think. When you're alone, consider what you could work on.


Some individuals may have difficulty communicating. If this is you, think about circumstances when you were unable to effectively communicate your feelings or be honest with yourself. Try to be observant of these situations and the points in which you shut off or close down.
Negativity or being too hard on yourself can be difficult to associate with. Imagine yourself with a partner who is unable to accept praise and is generally an unhappy person. Consider why you flee to negative emotions and try to remember there is more than one perspective., After you know yourself, you can contemplate what you need out of a relationship in order to move onto marriage. Keep it simple and examine what you value in your friends, family and past relationships. Create a list of what you look for in a partner that consists of must-have, maybes, and absolutley-nots.Your list should be ever-evolving. You should always grow and change as a person, especially while young so your list should reflect that. Don't be afraid to edit your list after a poorly-ended relationship.
When listing your must-haves, look for common denominators within your life. If all your friends have a sense of humor, it may be an important thing to look for; in contrast, if you prefer to be more serious perhaps you should find a person able to hold more involved conversations. Make your list how you want it. After all, it is yours and yours alone.
When you have an easy go-to list you can easily look for a marriage-worthy partner. Knowing what you want before hand will help keep you on the right track while keeping your standards high.

, Trust is one of the foundations of a healthy relationship.It's important to trust your partner to avoid a constant feeling of paranoia. If you're always worrying about the feeling of oncoming doom then you can't focus positive energy into your relationship. In order to keep trust strong, keep your expectations clear.


Everyone is allowed their own standards. Perhaps you need your partner to check in at the end of the night. If this is the case, let them know before they make the mistake of not checking in. If you're clear with your expectations, they can be fulfilled. Learn to manage expectations as an unfulfilled expectation can be easily misread as a breach of trust.
Trust is easy to lose and difficult to regain. Once that bond is broken, it can be a long and slow road to repair. Be proactive when addressing your doubts and insecurities about your relationship.
Don't be a snoop. You are entitled to your privacy and so is he. If you're doubting your relationship it's better to communicate with him rather than spy. Snooping can reveal private conversations that can be taken the wrong way. Sarcasm and jest don't translate well over text.

, Talking to your partner inappropriately can be a kiss of death to your relationship. When communicating, speak up and tell your likes and dislikes honestly.Always treat your partner as you want to be treated. Keep calm and be civil.


If you struggle keeping your cool, remember that this is your partner and teammate, not your enemy. Your partner should always want the best for you and it can be relaxing to remember this notion in the middle of an argument.
Fight fair or not at all. Give your partner opportunities to explain themselves rather than assuming you know what they are thinking. If you receive an apology, do your best to let go of a grudge. When you're unable to let go of a situation, it's okay to talk about it repeatedly in a calm manner., You should always treat your partner as you want to be treated. Whether it's during a grumpy moment or in the middle of a fight, ensure that you choose your words carefully and keep things civil.


Be on the same page about family and friends. Flaws or cracks in the relationship will show if you're going behind each others back. This can be especially stressful when confronted with issues brought up by friends or family members that you have already discussed with each other. For example, your friend may want to stay out late drinking when you have explicitly agreed with him to be home before 10pm. It's best to check in with your partner if there is any doubt on what to do.
Have a mutual respect when disagreeing.Your partner is his own person and is allowed to have his own opinions. A sign of a healthy relationship is being able to display a mutual respect when disagreeing, rather than trying control him or force your values onto him.

, When living together, small problems can easily escalate if not properly addressed. Before taking a permanent step like marriage, work on the life you have together and discuss what hurdles you foresee and come up with a plan of attack together. A great way to explore your compatibility is by living together, sharing finances, or sticking to a budget.


Check your desired lifestyles. Many couples argue about money.First, determine how you will divide up all the bills. Next, make a mock-budget and try to stick to it. Discuss what kinds of financial goals are important. Perhaps you want to buy a house but he wants to have a nice car. It's important to identify these differences before it's too late.
Look at the levels of cleanliness you find acceptable. For example, you may rub your partner the wrong way if you're a neat freak and they can go a few days without doing the dishes. A chore chart is a convenient way to compromise if you find yourself interested in an individual with opposite living habits.
Analyze your day-to-day schedules. If your potential life partner likes to stay up late and sleep all day, ask yourself if you're okay with that. Be able to recognize you can spend time apart but, more importantly, understand how much time you need together to have a happy life.

, Before getting married, it's important to recognize what life goals you share. Talk about the timeline included with these goals such as having children, career expectations, location and if you want to have children.


Many life goals are viewed as interrelated. For example, if you have a career you love but you also want to have children, it's important to recognize the timeline you desire. Perhaps you want to keep moving forward in your career while having children in the next five years. You'd like your spouse to take paternity leave so you can miss minimal time at work. Communicating your desires and managing expectations are key.
Remember that it's okay to end a relationship if your values don't match. If you want children and your potential spouse doesn't, don't try to change his mind. Explain your point of view and if you can't agree, don't feel bad about moving on. However, don't let go of an otherwise happy relationship right away. Try to re-evaluate your stance together in six months or even a year to see if you both still feel the same. If so, move along and keep optimistic that there is someone for you.
Have a plan in place. Whether or not you want to get married right now, you'll need the bank account to do it. For example, saving up for that dream dress or expensive venue can give you the time needed to evaluate how you want to begin your lives together and how well you work together in making your plans come to fruition.

, Marriage is all about compromise; it's about the two of you. Sometimes you will have to let go of what you desire in order to satisfy your partner. If you can't do that immediately then you aren't prepared to do it for the rest of your life. Compromise is a secret to a long lasting and happy marriage.Don't be resentful about compromise. The day you are on the receiving end of the compromise you'll be glad. You won't be happy if your partner has anger and resentment towards you over it. See your compromise from all ends of the spectrum.
Listen to a different perspective. If you're ready to marry the person you're with, you'll automatically value his opinion. Being able to respectfully listen to what he says will make finding a compromise an easy process.

, Premarital counseling can help push your relationship through awkward growing pains and move ahead to a successful marriage. Carefully organized and driven, a counseling plan will help address many important aspects such as parenting, finances, religious beliefs and decision-making.Don't let any preconceived notions sully premarital counseling as only for religious couples. Many licensed and qualified therapists offer private counseling catered to your lifestyles.Talk about divorce. While often thought of as a faux pas, divorce is an important concept to discuss with your partner. For example, if your partner sees divorce as a readily-available option while you would rather exhaust all other venues, perhaps you aren't a good match. The reality is that divorce exists and discussing your feelings on it is the first step to figuring out why couples get divorced and how to avoid it.

, Marriage is not only a life-long commitment, but a joining of families, income, debt and lives. It isn't a topic to be taken lightly. If you're in a new relationship, a fresh college grad, or still learning about yourself, consider why you want to be married to your partner. It's acceptable to regularly discuss marriage as a topic with your partner to match up your beliefs, but once it's executed there is no turning back. Slow down and enjoy your lives together; you have plenty of time to get married.


Set the standard for your friends and family by not allowing yourself to be pushed into marriage. Marriage is a commitment between you and your partner. Don't allow overbearing family to strong-arm you into getting married. When you're ready, you can choose for yourself based on your partner's and your beliefs. If you feel like you're being coerced or forced into marriage, call your local police department and ask for help."

, Make sure the opening is centered on the box and wide enough for wedding guests to slip cards through. Cut the lid, but leave space around the rim so you can attach it later.

, Use a pencil and trace around the outside of the middle and top layers.

, Now with the reference line penciled in for the top box, use a sharp knife or scissors to cut the middle of the tracing out. Leave roughly 1 inch (2.5 cm) on the inside of the tracing so the top layer will be able to sit on top of the middle layer without falling through.

Check the wedding invite list.,
Invite the bride’s attendants.,
Invite the bride’s closest friends.,
Invite local relatives.,
Invite the bride.",How to Know Who to Include in a Wedding Shower1," The first thing to do when planning a bridal shower is to consult the official guest list for the wedding. One of the biggest faux pas people make when planning a bridal shower is inviting people who are not already invited to the wedding.Showers generally consist of people getting excited for the wedding, so inviting people to the shower and not the wedding will make them feel both excluded and uncomfortable.
Showers are also centered around receiving and opening gifts, so inviting guests who are not invited to the wedding sometimes comes off as a gift grab.;
, The bride’s maid of honor and bridesmaids are oftentimes some of her closest friends and relatives, so it’s important that they are included in the shower. Invite all female attendants, even the ones who live out of town.Attendants who live out of town may not be able to make it, but it’s still considered good etiquette to include them.
Make sure to include the flower girl and anyone else who might be playing a role in the ceremony. Ask the bride for a complete list of all her attendants to make sure you don’t accidentally overlook someone.

, Ask the bride to make a list of her closest friends, outside her bridal party. These are the women who should be included in the bridal shower. If the bride is having trouble narrowing this down, ask her to go through the list and point out her best friend(s) from growing up, her closest friends from college and her current group of closest friends.You should not invite every female on the wedding guest list, so feel free to be picky in selecting the friends invited to the shower.
Choose whether or not you want to invite close friends who live out of state. It’s a nice gesture to do so, but they may feel compelled to send a gift, even if they can’t attend, which might make them feel put on the spot.

, If there are any female family members who live close to where the shower is being held, feel free to invite them as well. This can include mothers and stepmothers on both sides, grandmothers on both sides and close female aunts and cousins on both sides.Do not go overboard with the relatives. Aim to keep your guest list below 35 people, tops.Don’t double up on invites. Sometimes, different groups of people throw different showers for the bride; for instance, the bride might get a family shower and a shower held by close friends. Avoid overlap between the guest lists, as this just puts more pressure on guests to spend more money and buy more gifts., Unless the shower is a surprise, make sure you invite the bride. And if the shower is a surprise, make sure you save an invitation and give it to her later; she’ll appreciate the thought and the souvenir of the special day.If the shower is a surprise, make sure that is clearly communicated on the invitations. You don’t want someone accidentally spoiling the day!
Depending on the shower and who is throwing it, you may also choose to invite the groom. If you do choose to do this, stagger the groom’s arrival so he shows up after the party is well underway."
"
Speak to the bride before you begin planning.,
Decide if a couple's shower would be more fun.,
Determine the budget for the shower to reduce any financial worries.,
Do not schedule a shower that is more than 2 hours long.,
Invite the bride's closest friends and family.,
Decorate early on the day of the event, so that you and the other helpers are not rushed.,
Decide if there will be gifts.",How to Make a Bridal Shower Fun1," Traditionally, the bride is not involved with the shower, but if she is hard to please, it will be easier to talk through any worries or ideas she might have at the beginning of the process and avoid confrontations that could ruin the day.;
, You can co-plan with the best man and reduce the formality of the event, leading to a more enjoyable time.

, Make sure that anyone who has a large say in what goes on at the shower, is also giving money toward its creation. Collect money in advance, if possible, to pay for reservations, catering or party favors.

, It is hard to keep a fun atmosphere for a long period of time.

, Make sure that everyone who is invited to the shower is also invited to the wedding. It can be a cause of resentment if people believe they are being solicited for gifts for a wedding that they won't be attending.

, Set up the shower layout to encourage mingling between friends and family of the bride.

, This is often a cause for worry. If the bride does not want gifts, be sure to say ""No gifts"" on the invitation. If the bride does want gifts, it is a good idea to create a theme around the gifts she most needs, like kitchen wares or lingerie.


The bride can also register for gifts, in which case you should include that information in the shower invitations.

Choose the flowers and plants.,
Pick out vases, jars, or holders.,
Prepare the centerpieces one day prior to the wedding day.,
Gather the containers together, as well as the cut flowers.,
Fill the clean container with room temperature water.,
Visualize the arrangement within a circle.,
Divide the circle into three equal parts.,
Strip off the lower leaves of the stems.,
Cut the ends of the stems at an angle.,
Place one stem of each floral variety into the container.,
Place the star flowers into the container.,
Add the supporting flowers.,
Finish the arrangement with fillers.",How to Make Wedding Centerpieces1," Think about which flower(s) are going to act as the star for the centerpieces, such as hydrangeas, tulips, lilies, etc, and then decide if you are going to focus on a certain color palette or mix of shades and tones to choose the complementary flowers.Purchase cut flowers from a florist with good quality flowers and lots of variety. If you are going to use a mixed variety of flowers for the arrange, collect five varieties of leaves or shapes. If you are going for a more simple arrangement, look for perhaps one star flower and one complementing flower with a different leaf shape.
Ask your wedding planner to recommend a florist or call around and compare prices for wedding arrangements from several florists.There are also online sites where you can order floral arrangements in bulk, a great option if you are creating centerpieces for a large wedding.If you decide to use silk flowers instead of fresh ones, order silk flowers online in bulk and create your own silk flower arrangements.
You may want to also consider using succulents or tropical plants to create a unique look for the centerpieces.;
, The type of container for the floral arrangements you use should complement the color or theme of the wedding, as well as the size, shape, and color of the flowers. You could use classic glass vases, mason jars, or alternative holders like wicker baskets or clay pots.Look for vessels that are one to two inches shorter than the flowers you are going to use. A wide neck on a vase or jar allows the flowers to sit higher on longer stems, which more narrow vases or jars are usually better for shorter stems.

, Because you are going to be using fresh cut flowers, avoid wilting buds or dull petals by creating the centerpieces the day before the wedding and then storing them in a cooler or refrigerator until the reception so the flowers remain fresh looking.

, You will also need a pair of scissors (or several pairs if someone is assisting you) and access to fresh water.

, Fill the container about halfway with water.

, Place the container of water in front of you and spread out your hands to make a circle over the vase. This will help you keep an invisible boundary for the arrangement., Think of the circle as a peace sign. These three equal parts will allow you to arrange the flowers in a balanced way.

, Run your hand gently along the stems in a downward motion to remove the leaves.

, Angling the cut will ensure the flowers last longer and stay fresh in the container.

, Do this by placing each stem at an angle into the three equal parts you created over the container. It’s fine if they overlap, as long as they are all facing outward, away from the center of the container.


If you are using decorative leaves in the arrangement, place these in the container first to act as a nice base for the arrangement.

, Use three stems of the star flower and place them in the three sections of the container.


Flowers with shapely bulbs like hydrangeas, lilies, and tulips all make great star flowers.

, To add some extra pops of color and texture, slide in the supporting flowers in the three sections of the container to complement the star flowers.


Flowers like roses, snap dragons, and lisianthus make great supporting flowers.

, Fillers can be flowers with wide green leaves, or thin flowers like baby’s breath or astartea.


Primp and adjust the arrangements so it looks even, balanced, and full.

Invite both the bride's and groom’s attendants.,
Invite close friends of both the bride and groom.,
Decide if you want to invite local relatives.,
Invite the bride and groom.",How to Know Who to Include in a Wedding Shower2," Couples showers are co-ed, so you’ll need to invite all the attendants across both sides of the aisle. This should include the maid of honor, best man, bridesmaids and groomsmen, flower girl and ring bearer, any readers or ushers or any additional positions that have been assigned.If the person officiating the wedding is a close friend of the bride and/or groom, invite them as well.
Feel free to invite out of town attendants, but be aware they may not come.

, Similar to a traditional bridal shower, you’ll want to invite those who are closest to the couple, without going overboard. Just because you’re celebrating both the bride and groom, doesn’t mean the shower should be twice as big.Make sure guests know ahead of time that the shower is co-ed so they aren’t caught off guard.
Do not invite the bride or groom’s work friends, unless the relationship is especially close.

, Couples showers are generally far less traditional than the typical bridal shower, and some older relatives may not be comfortable with that. Choose whether or not you want to include local relatives, but know that you are not required to do so.At the very least, invite parents and siblings on both sides.
If your list of attendants skews more towards family, you might want to err on the side of inviting more family, so no one feels excluded.

, Oftentimes, couples showers are planned by the couple themselves, but if you're planning the shower for them, don't forget to include them when you send out invitations.


Some planners prefer to use different invites for the men and women. This is not necessary, but it is a nice touch if you're so inclined.
If the shower is a surprise for the couple, do not send the invite in advance. Save it and present it to them at or after the shower as a keepsake.

Invite the bride’s friends.,
Invite the bride’s team.,
Invite the whole office.",How to Know Who to Include in a Wedding Shower3," Office showers are a little tricky because there’s no clear cut rules for whom you should invite. Depending on who is throwing the shower, you may want to keep it small and invite only the bride’s closest colleagues.If the bride has worked at the office for a long time, try reaching out to former co-workers who have already left, who the bride has strong relationships with.
If the bride has good ties to vendors or other partners of that company, consider inviting those people as well.

, If the bride’s boss or a member of her work team is throwing the shower, invite everyone else on that team as well. Make the shower into a team bonding experience and make sure everyone feels included.Make sure the team goes in on one gift, so nobody feels obligated to buy something independently.
If the shower is being held off-site, consider inviting the groom to show up half-way through the event.

, If the bride has worked at the company for a long time or holds a very visible position, consider making the invite open to everyone. This way, no one feels excluded, but no one feels coerced into attending either.If the office is springing for a gift, make sure people are aware they are not required to contribute. This can be awkward for people who don’t know the bride well.
Office showers do not need to be restricted just to people who are attending the wedding. Many co-workers will not be invited to the wedding, but should still be included on the shower guest list.

"
"
Determine a theme for the shower based on the bride's personality or lifestyle.,
Pick a fun location.",How to Make a Bridal Shower Fun2," Possible themes include a tea party, craft night, picnic, wine and cheese tasting, bowling event, dance class, cooking or canning party, a hike, spa day, in-home yoga class or tiki party. You can also theme your party around the type of gift the bride needs to receive. For example a kitchen, bar or entertainment shower.

, For most weddings, the traditional home or hotel restaurant reception may not fit the bride's preferences. Fun locations include the park, the beach, the library, a backyard barbecue, a gallery, a garden, mini-golf course, pool, museum, boat or sporting activity.

"
"
Provide plenty of snacks.,
Play background music to lighten the mood of the shower.,
Choose an icebreaker for the beginning of the event, so that friends and family will get to know each other.,
Pick games that reflect the audience that will attend the shower.,
Ask guests to sign a guestbook and include their favorite memory with the bride.

",How to Make a Bridal Shower Fun3," Guests will enjoy themselves more if there is something to munch on. If you decide to serve alcohol at the shower, the appetizers are even more important in making sure the shower doesn't get out of hand.

, Make a list of the bride's favorite songs or make a wedding playlist in the theme of the shower, like beach music.


A great wedding-themed playlist can include songs like ""Chapel of Love"" by the Dixie Cups, ""White Wedding"" by Billy Idol, ""Let's Get Married"" by the Proclaimers, ""Band of Gold"" by Freda Payne, ""With this Ring"" by the Platters, ""Not Too Young To Get Married"" by Bob E. Soxx and the The Blue Jeans, ""Wedding Bells"" by Hank Williams, ""Hotel Yorba"" by the White Stripes, ""Forever in my Life"" by Prince and ""Love and Marriage"" by Frank Sinatra.

, Using the R.S.V.Ps that you received, make bridal shower bingo. Give everyone a card that has squares referring to people the bride knows, such as a colleague, childhood friend, sister or aunt. A guest gets a bingo if she meets people from different areas of her life and fills in the names of those people.


You can also do an icebreaker in the style of a scavenger hunt. Make a list of interesting facts and give it to the guests. They have to find who traveled to Mexico with the bride in 2000 or who gave her her first hair cut.

, For example, do not play bawdy games with the bride's mother in attendance. Do not play games that make people talk about their relationship, if you have invited many single people.


If your bride does not seem like the type to enjoy indoor games, play croquet or bocce ball instead. This is a great idea if she is sporty.
Popular bridal shower games include making a wedding dress out of toilet paper for the bride or for each guest, playing trivia about the bride's life, write poetry or limericks.
Play purse bingo, where you get points for common items found in a purse, like a hairbrush, safety pin or pen. Each person allots themselves points according to what they have in their purse and the one with the highest score wins.
Make recipe cards and have each of the guests write down their idea of a recipe for a perfect relationship. Bind the cards together with pictures afterward and give them to the bride.

Choose different sized or colored candles.,
Pick out candle holders.,
Incorporate other details like mirrors, or flowers.,
Try a floating candle arrangement.",How to Make Wedding Centerpieces2," Go for a uniform look with candles that are all the same size and shape or vary the size, shape, and color of candles in a centerpiece to create a unique look for the table.


If you’re looking to save on candles, head to your local craft store and buy in bulk.
Determine if you want the candles to sit high on the tables, as you will likely purchase tall, thin candles. If you prefer the candles to sit low on the tables, go for wide and short candles.When choosing colored candles, keep in mind the overall color scheme (if there is one) for the wedding, and treat the candles almost like flowers. Think about which colors will work well together and complement each other.
Be wary when choosing colored candles if they are also scented, as certain scents do not mix well and you do not want to create an unpleasant smell at the tables during the wedding reception.

, You may prefer simple glass holders or you may be looking for something a bit more bold like sleek tapers or twisted metal holders. Consider which holders best complement the candles you have chosen, as well as the overall look of the wedding.


One interesting idea for a rustic look might be to hollow out logs of white birch and use them to hold the candles on the table.You may also want to customize the holders by wrapping them in fabrics like lace or tulle., Combining candlelight with other details like water, mirrors, or flowers creates an intimate setting for the reception and won’t break your budget.


Place mirrors underneath the candles to accentuate the glow of candlelight.
Decorate tree branches with hanging candles and use them as an eyecatching center piece.Create an arrangement of several different sizes and heights of candles and then add in cut flowers in small glass jars or simply lay them around the candles on the table.

, This type of arrangement is a great way to showcase both candles and flowers in water. If you use fresh flowers for this arrangement, assemble them on one day before the wedding or the day of the wedding to ensure the flowers stay fresh.Use any container of your choice. If you are only using one container, look for one that is wide and short so it can fit a few candles and flowers. If you are using several containers, try using ones at different heights or widths.






Fill the container or containers up with water. Leave an inch or two of space. If you’d like to add in more color, add a few drops of food coloring to the water. Add the food coloring prior to pouring the water in the containers so the colors do not leave dye marks on the flowers.






Cut the stems off of the flowers. You really want to showcase the buds of the flowers so remove the stems so there is only about an inch of stem under the buds. Flowers with shapely buds like orchids, roses, and lilies are great options.






Alternatively, you can glue the stems onto the bottom of the container with a glue gun to keep them in place. If you decide to use this method, glue the flowers down before you fill the container with water.






Place the floating candles on the surface of the water, around the flowers. Floating candles are specially made for use near or in water and can burn for several hours to ensure you have beautiful centerpieces throughout the entire reception."

Build a centerpiece based on certain style or time period.,
Create centerpieces based on your favorite book, tv show, or film.,
Create a centerpiece based on a color scheme.",How to Make Wedding Centerpieces3," From 50’s flapper glamour to refined English countryside, focusing on a certain style of time period can be a creative way to come up with the perfect centerpiece. Some ideas for a period inspired center piece might be:Hollywood Heyday: Think old Hollywood glamor, with dashes of fur to compliment the champagne and sparkles on the tables and luxe colors like gold and silver on the centerpieces.

Ready your materials and work area.,
Paint your box.,
Cut your padding and roll it into a tube.,
Wrap your rolls of padding in satin and lace.,
Insert your rolls in the box.",How to Make a Ring Bearer Box1," Clear a flat work area. Lay a cover over your work area, like newspaper, a cardboard box, or a drop cloth, to prevent paint or glue from spreading onto it. Most of the materials you’ll need, including the box, can be found at your local craft store.


Be sure the box you purchase is unfinished wood. A finished wooden box might require you to use a special paint or to remove the paint from the wood.
Check your paint before buying it. Your paint should clearly indicate on its label whether or not it’s suitable for use on wood.;
, Take a clean, dry cloth and wipe down your box to remove dust or dirtiness from it. Open your mordant and prepare it according to its directions. Dip a paintbrush into the mordant and wipe excess on the inner lip of the can. Coat the box evenly with mordant. Allow it to dry.You may need to mix your mordant or paint before applying it to the box. Always follow the usage instructions on your mordant or paint for best results.
The time it takes for your mordant or paint to dry will depend on the brand/kind you’ve used. Check the label instructions to know how long you should allow your box to dry.
If you plan on using actual paint on your box in place of mordant, use a primer before painting to ensure a smooth and even finish., Hold your Sintepon or cotton padding up to your box. Cut the padding so its width is slightly less than that of the box. Roll the length of fabric so it forms a tube. Do this for two pieces of fabric. Dot hot glue on the ends of each roll so they hold their shape.


The two rolls will be inserted in the box horizontally and the wedding rings wedged into the space between the two. Each roll should be thick enough to firmly hold each ring in place., Cut four lengths of cloth that are equal in width to your rolls. Two lengths should be of satin and two of lace. Cover the rolls in a single layer of satin, then use a dab of hot glue to hold it in place. Do the same with your lace.Give your hot glue a few seconds to cool before adding a new layer of fabric. Although hot glue cools quickly, moving on before it has cooled could result in burns.
Place a piece of cardboard or a scrap piece of paper beneath your glue gun while using it. Frequently, glue dribbles out the end. Cardboard or scrap paper will catch this., Put both of your fabric covered rolls into the box. Traditionally, rolls are oriented left-to-right. Both should fit snugly in the box. The boxes are now complete. You’re ready to exchange rings and say “I do.”"

Some brands of paint or colors may require multiple coats. Generally, multiple thin coats will be stronger and have a smoother finish., Find a small bowl or container that’s roughly the size of your box. Turn it over on top of your fabric. Trace the outline of the bowl with a pencil or piece of chalk. Cut out this circle with your scissors.The circle that you cut out doesn’t have to be perfect. The edges of it will be tucked down into the sides of the box and hidden from sight.
Depending on your box, you may need to experiment with the fabric outline. Overestimating size is easier to correct and only requires you to remove excess fabric with scissors.

, This ribbon will attach to both rings, holding them in place on the pillow. Position your ribbon left-to-right across the middle of the fabric. Thread your needle and pass it through the front of the ribbon and fabric then back again. Do this several times along the center of the ribbon. Tie off both ends with knots.


If you’re not confident in your sewing skills, you may be able to attach the ribbon to the fabric with a little bit of hot glue.
You may want to trim your ribbon down so it is more manageable. Loose ends can be tucked into the sides of the box., Insert the stuffing into your ring box and cover it with your fabric. Tuck the sides of the fabric between the stuffing and the box. Arrange the fabric so the ribbon is directly in the center of the box. Your ring bearer box is ready for the aisle.


Alternatively, you could sew a hem into your fabric and run an elastic string or band through the hem. Stuff the inside with padding and you’re done.
When the moment comes, remember to attach your rings with the ribbon and tie them in place with a bow."

Paint messages on your box.,
Decorate your box with lace.,
Add designs with beads and fake pearls.,
Get creative with the fabric inside the box.,
Use ribbons on your box.",How to Make a Ring Bearer Box3," You can use a normal kind of paint, but you might have an easier time using a fine-tipped paint marker. A paint marker can be held like a pencil and will likely be a more familiar tool for adding a message to your box. Write things like:


The names of the bride and groom.
With this ring…
Mr. & Mrs., Lace is a beautiful, delicate addition that integrates nicely with most wedding décor. Wrap the top of your box in lace and use a hot glue gun to attach it to the insides of the box. Cut strips of lace, tie them into decorative bows, and attach them to the box with hot glue.


If you plan on covering the bottom of your box in lace, you can often tuck your lace beneath the inner padding/pillow of your box., High quality beads and faux pearls can be used to make neat designs on your box. For example, you might cutout the shape of a heart on a piece of card stock and then border it with fake pearls. Attach this to your box with a suitable glue, like hot glue.Designs like these can be added freehand to your box or with a guide, like a stencil. Beads and pearls can be glued to cutouts and attached, as well.

, The fabric on the inside of your box can be whatever pattern you desire. For example, if you and your fiancé are fans of a TV show like Doctor Who, you might use Doctor Who themed fabric for your box padding. Other ideas include themed patterns representing:


Movies
Books
TV shows
Hobbies

, Much like lace, ribbons are great for tying bows. Choose a suitable length of ribbon, tie your bow, and attach it to your box with a little bit of hot glue. Be creative with your bow placement. A few small bows on the sides, for example, might be the perfect addition to your box.


Thicker ribbon will create more prominent bows. Use these for centerpieces in the box design or at anchor points, like at the corners.
Smaller bows may be hard to see from a distance, but will add a delicate aspect to the box. These work well along the sides or as an accent to more central designs."

Task your children with working together instead of competing.,
Perform or initiate activities that your children can enjoy with each other.,
Allow your children to participate in activities they each specifically enjoy.,
Show your children how to support each other's interests.,
Give each of your children time to themselves.,
Set ground rules that apply to every child in the household.,
Refrain from comparing your children to one another.,
Reward your children when they exhibit positive behavior toward one another.,
Teach your children how to listen to each other.",How to Help Your Children Get Along," This will help your children cooperate with each other in regards to working toward a particular goal. For example, state that both children will earn a treat if they help each other clean their rooms, instead of rewarding a particular child with a treat if they are the first one to finish cleaning their room.;
, Creating enjoyable moments for your children to experience with one another will help them forge a friendly bond and may cause them to initiate fights less frequently.


Play board games with your children or sports that allow them to be on the same team, allow them to watch films they all enjoy, or allow them to help you cook their favorite meals.

, For example, if one child enjoys martial arts, sign them up for karate classes; whereas if your other child wants to play a musical instrument, allow them to attend band class at school or allow them to take private lessons.

, This will encourage your children to appreciate one another despite their differences.


Encourage your children to attend concerts, sporting events, or other activities in which their siblings participate in.

, This will allow your children to perform activities they like to do alone without having to share friends, toys, or personal space with their siblings.


Allow your children to play with their friends without being required to bring along their sibling, or allow your children to play in their rooms by themselves.

, This will help your children understand that you are not playing favorites when one child seems to receive preferential treatment. For example, if you have multiple children interested in dating, set a rule that allows each child to date when they become 15 years of age. This will help prevent your 14-year old child from feeling distressed or upset when you allow your 16-year old to date.


Allow your children to develop a list of consequences that will occur when the ground rules are broken. This will help teach them that every sibling in the household is responsible for their own behavior.

, Making comparisons can generate sibling rivalry and fights because your children will try to compete for your attention and approval.

, This will encourage your children to continue to get along more often and allows them to witness your appreciation.


Thank your children for behaving nicely toward one another, or reward them with small treats or gifts when you see them getting along.

, When your children can understand why and how their actions affected the other sibling, it may help them realize why a particular action was inappropriate.


Talk with your children moments after a fight has erupted and allow them to discuss their feelings with each other. For example, if your children fought because one began cussing or making mean comments toward the other, have your child explain to the other sibling that the cussing and mean comments hurt their feelings.

Praise your child.",How to Help Your Child Prepare to Give a Speech," The best speeches are those that engage the audience with an interesting, relevant topic. Preparation will depend, to some extent, on whether your child has been assigned a specific topic or gets to choose one.


If your child has been assigned a specific topic already, ask what he or she knows about that subject. If this knowledge is lacking, point your child toward books, articles, websites, or other sources of information. Otherwise, simply talk about how your child might elaborate on the topic at hand.
If your child gets to select the subject, brainstorm together about possible topics. Decide on something appropriate to the assignment and interesting to your child.;
, Your child should pitch his or her speech to the particular audience: are they students, adults, or both? The content and tone of the speech should reflect the audience and the occasion.

, Your child’s assignment may vary, but in general, a speech should have an introduction, a developed and persuasive middle, and a conclusion. Your child should include both facts and opinions.

, After you’ve chosen a theme, your child should write a rough draft of the speech. You can then check the draft, point out any major problems, and make suggestions for improvement.

, Your child should revise his or her speech, using your suggestions for guidance. Teach your child how important this step is: the best writers and the best public speakers all draft, revise, and revise again.

, Your child’s speech will be clearer and more effective with a few pictures, diagrams, or slides. Remind your child to select these visual aids carefully, choosing relevant images that will interest the audience.


You can also point out, if your child is nervous, that good visual aids will take the audience members’ eyes off the child. They will be looking at the images instead.

, Whether or not your child uses visual aids, a few note cards can provide some security against forgetting parts of the speech. Have your child jot down the basic structure of the speech, plus any parts he or she is likely to forget.


Depending on the situation, some children (especially younger children) may be encouraged to put their entire speech on note cards and to read directly from the cards. Find out what your child is expected to do.

, If your child is unsure of what giving a speech should look like, give the speech yourself and let the child watch and ask questions.

, Let your child practice many times. If the speech is meant to be memorized, follow along on the written version and point out any parts that your child forgets.

, You can encourage your child to develop his or her performance by practicing in front of a mirror. This exercise allows the child to see and adjust his or her body language and facial expressions.

, Once your child has mastered the speech, gather friends and family members and let your child practice in front of the group. If there will be a question and answer period after the speech, have these practice audience members ask questions.


Don’t forget to applaud and praise your child after the practice speech. He or she will do better if you help build confidence beforehand.

, He or she needs to speak in a way that holds the audience’s attention.

, Many children speak much too quietly at first; you may have to encourage your child to speak in a loud, clear voice. Remind your child that he or she wants the audience to hear every word.

, Your child should speak slowly, but not so slowly that the audience gets bored. If he or she speaks too quickly, the audience will have trouble following the speech.

, Long speeches can be tiring, and if your child is nervous, he or she may be breathing too quickly and heavily. Encourage deep, slow breaths, which will calm your child down and make the speech clearer.

, If your child will be speaking for a long time, he or she will probably experience a dry mouth. Taking a drink of water periodically will help.


You can also tell your child to take sips of water strategically. If he or she momentarily forgets part of the speech, a drink of water can buy some time.

, Instruct your child to look at the audience members and connect with them. It’s much less effective to stare at some imaginary point in the distance.

, Help your child remember to stand up straight and speak calmly and loudly while looking at the audience. Hand gestures can help, but you also don’t want your child to gesture nervously and wildly.

, Your child may worry about someone in the audience behaving rudely or about not being able to keep the audience’s attention. He or she may also be concerned about making a mistake. Encourage your child to ignore any rudeness in the audience and to simply smile and fix any errors he or she makes.

, The best public speakers are confident speakers who know that they have mastered their material. Remind your child that he or she has a good speech and has practiced sufficiently to master it – he or she is prepared to succeed!

, Depending on the situation, your child may need to be dressed more or less formally. Either way, it builds confidence to put on clean, attractive clothes. Have your child choose a favorite outfit, one that he or she feels happy and secure in.

, Let your child practice the speech one last time, wearing the right clothes and using all the visual aids. Emphasize how far your child has come and how strong this performance is.

, Make sure that your child has everything he or she needs – the speech itself, visual aids, and note cards – before leaving the house.

, Tell your child that nervousness and stage fright are natural and normal, that these feelings are actually a good sign because it means that he or she is taking the speech seriously. Remind your child how hard he or she worked and how strong the speech has become.

, Tell your child before the performance that you are very proud; repeat this praise after the performance as well. Celebrate your child’s success.

Use a visual schedule to help children stay on task.",How to Help Your Child Focus," Transitions between activities can be especially challenging for children. For example, it can be hard for a child to adjust to moving from a structured school environment to the more relaxed and independent environment at home, and vice versa. Your child may act out as they struggle to adjust. Set aside 10-15 minutes during transitional moments for you and your child to take a quick break, or talk through whatever your child needs to do next.

Giving your child short transition breaks will help them learn to respect their own and others’ need to rest and have a little personal space before moving from one task, activity, or environment to another.;
, If your child feels rushed or pressured, chances are that this will negatively influence their focus. A child may be able to focus for longer periods of time if a task if fun and engaging. If the task seems dull or boring, it’s likely your child will engage for less time.Allow plenty of time for your child to work on difficult tasks.


Younger children tend to be able to focus for less time than older children. For example, a child aged 4-5 can likely maintain attention for 5-20 minutes per activity. Keep this in mind and don’t expect your child to concentrate for longer than their developmental range.

, Allow your child to run, jump, skip, and move before setting them down to work or study. If you’re having problems with your child completing homework after school, enroll your child in a sport or activity to do first. Or, if your child has difficulties once at school, encourage your child to walk or bike to school.Allow your child to run, play, do sports, and get their wiggles out so they don’t feel antsy when work needs to be done.


Find an activity that your child enjoys that includes movement. This might be dance, karate, skateboarding, hockey, or gymnastics.

, Create a workspace for your child. This can be a desk, a beanbag chair, or a corner of their room. Keep the space clean, uncluttered, and free from distraction. It should feel calming and quiet.Keep this space separate from a time-out space or other area that may be used for discipline. Enlist the help of your child to help decorate the space and make it soothing and comfortable.

, Start each task by settling down and preparing to focus. Get your child to engage in belly breathing to calm nerves, relax, and approach the task with confidence. Especially if you notice your child avoiding the task, take a pause and practice some deep breathing. This can help get them on track and feeling good.Practice with your child to start out. Begin by taking 5 big breaths. Count 5 seconds for the inhale and 5 seconds for the exhale. For more exercises, check out How to Breathe Deeply.

, Help your child use good habits to focus better. Start by encouraging your child to healthy foods and to get plenty of sleep. The foods you eat can affect your abilities to attend to and remember information.Not getting enough sleep can hinder concentration and attention, so make sure your child sleeps at night.Limit caffeine and sugar and encourage a healthy diet. Add healthy fats (like avocados and nuts) and don’t let your kid skip breakfast.It’s recommended that children ages 3-5 receive 10-13 hours, school-aged children sleep 9-11 hours, and teenagers 8-10 hours of sleep per night., Music can help to increase focus, motivation, and productivity.Music can aid in learning and create a fun environment for your child. Find music that aids in your child’s attention and doesn’t distract your child from their work.


Consider music that doesn’t include lyrics your child may find distracting. Play classical music or relaxing, ambient music.
Use headphones to help drown out other noises in the home.

, Dancing is not only fun and a great bonding opportunity for you and your child, but it can help improve your child’s focus, processing speed, planning abilities, and gross motor skills. It’s also an excellent way to incorporate exercise into your child’s routine. Do creative, free-form dancing, or play dancing games with your child.

Try traditional dance game favorites like “The Hokey Pokey” or “Ring Around the Rosie,” or try one of the ideas listed here: http://www.nhs.uk/change4life/pages/dance-steps-games.aspx


, Place clocks throughout the house to keep your child aware of the time and allow for enough time for each activity.Use timers for activity transitions or to encourage completing homework. This can help your child begin to build reference points and transition into a different mindset, from play to work or from home to school.


For example, tell your child to work on homework for 20 minutes, and when the timer goes off, they can have a break. Or, tell your child you will set the timer and when the timer goes off, they need to start their project.

, If your child struggles to focus due to feeling distracted, cut down on potential distractions. Turn the television off and keep cell phones and other screens away.Power off computers, tablets, or anything else that may distract your child.


If the television is on, keep it far from your child’s workspace. As much as possible, set a good example for your child by not playing with your phone or watching television while they are working.

, Story games can help boost your child’s concentration and working memory. They can also help develop your child’s ability to use logic, analytical skills, sense of humor, and imagination. Tell a story and read a book with your child, and then encourage them to think about and engage with the story. You might try one of the following:

Read a story with your child, then give them a “pop quiz.” What were some things that happened in the story? Who were some of the characters? What was the main message of the story?
Read a couple of pages or paragraphs, then ask your child what they think should happen next. For example, “So the wolf huffed, and puffed . . . and then what do you think happened?” Brainstorm with your child and exchange ideas, and then compare what you came up with to what happens next in the original.
After reading a book, act out the story, or parts of the story, with your child. Encourage your child to improvise and take it in their own direction.

, While it’s important to remove distractions from the external environment, children can easily become distracted by internal things as well, such as remembering a fun memory, peeling a scab, or wiggling their toes. Practice observing a single thing in the moment together by playing “I spy” or paying attention to specific sensations in the body. This will help your child to build concentration and focus on one thing.For example, take turns describing simple objects in great detail. If you notice a book, say, “This is a book. The cover is green and the pages are white. The pages are crisp and not bent. There are lots of pages, so that means it’s a long book.” Observe common objects and spend time observing them in detail.

, Sit down as a family and establish some basic expectations for what you will accomplish every day. Come up with a daily schedule and a list of responsibilities for each member of the family. When you’re done, write down your list and post it somewhere obvious (like on the fridge) as a daily reminder for everyone in the family.

For a child, daily responsibilities could include things like putting their backpacks away as soon as they get home, picking up toys when they are done, and doing their homework at a specific time each day.

, For example, you might explain to your child that they can’t watch their favorite TV show if they don’t get their homework done. Make sure everyone in the family is on the same page, and that consequences are used consistently., While multitasking is often a respected way of doing things, it isn’t good for focus. Have your child work on one task at a time. Instead of designating one hour for “homework time,” consider having 15 minutes for math, then moving onto 20 minutes for reading and so on.Focus on one thing at a time without jumping ahead.


For example, if your child has 15 math problems to complete, cover up the unfinished ones and work on one at a time.

, Children need breaks frequently and having breaks can improve concentration. Depending on your child’s age, take a 5-minute break every 10-20 minutes of work. Let your child get up, move around, grab a drink or a snack, and then get back to work.Have structured activities your child may choose from during breaks. For example, they can jump on the trampoline, play a game, or color.

, Feeling overwhelmed can inhibit focus and make your child feel like nothing can be accomplished.Work on one thing at a time to decrease these feelings. For example, if your child is learning how to draw an animal, focus on drawing the outline first, then work into more and more detailed parts.


If your child is working on a project, do one thing at a time. For example, focus on one task each day that can be realistically accomplished. If your child is writing a paper, have them write one paragraph each day for one week.

, If you’re having a hard time getting your child to meet expectations, it can be helpful to create a predictable and structured routine. Create a sense of predictability for your child by having rituals for meals, waking up in the morning, doing homework, and going to bed.Knowing what to expect can help your child transition to the next task more easily. Create a daily schedule for your child so that they know what to expect each day.


Children focus best and are better prepared to manage their lives in the long run when you help them establish a routine as early as possible.
Remember that different types and levels of structure work best for different children and families. Take your child’s individual needs and personality into account when developing your routine.
For example, if your child focuses best after dinner, set aside that time for homework.

, For example, if you want your child to focus on reading each night, have a picture of a book (or have your child draw one) to represent reading time. This will help cue your child for what comes next."

Explain that while they might start out small, the self-imposed rules can grow out of control and micromanage her entire life.


Don't push education about eating disorders too hard, especially if your daughter is skinny. She might think that you're implying something, feel insulted, and stop listening.

Expose your child to different kinds of music. Let your child decide what he or she likes and does not like. Their tastes may change over time, so continue letting them hear different types of songs and instruments.

, Your local Public Broadcasting System (PBS) station should have art-focused programs.


Answer questions and encourage discussion. If your child knows you are interested too, he or she will be more responsive and engaged in what you are watching.

, There could be an outdoor art festival, a paint your own pottery shop or a performance at your local library.

, Little children can often get in free and there should be reduced admission for school-aged kids.

Use exercise as a bonding opportunity.,

Offer to help her get involved in sports or exercise-related activities.,
Make exercise a social activity.,
Be a good role model.",How to Help Your Daughter Gain Weight2," Offer to do something together, and during that time, listen to her and invite her to share her thoughts with you. Many preteens and teenagers want to be understood, so she'll love having the opportunity to help you understand her. Here are some things you can do together:


Go for a walk
Bike
Hike on a trail
Toss around a football, or pitch a baseball for her to hit

, Tell her that you're willing to drop them off at the pool, roller skating rink, downtown shopping area, or mall (which involves quite a bit of walking). She'll love the free ride and quality time with her friends, and she'll be getting exercise while doing so.

, Decide on a reasonable wage, and ask her if she could take them for a walk or play with them at the park. Make her your accomplice and explain that you want to encourage her siblings to exercise. (This will also get her thinking about exercise, and she may suddenly decide that she wants more exercise too.)

, Try owning a variety of balls: baseballs, soccer balls, basketballs, kickballs, et cetera. Set up equipment like basketball hoops or volleyball nets in the yard. Your daughter might also like things such as scooters, jump ropes, and hula hoops.

, Ask if she'd like to join her school's volleyball or basketball team. If she doesn't like sports, she might still be interested in dance, yoga, or gymnastics.


Don't push her to sign up for something. She may resent the pressure, and want to quit as soon as possible.
Gymnastics and dance, while healthy, sometimes come with a strong cultural pressure to be skinny and lose weight. If she signs up for them, talk to her about that pressure, and make sure she has a strong support network.

, Set aside time each day or week to go outdoors with your daughter, and encourage her to engage in casual sports with her siblings or friends. This can be much more fun than jogging alone.

, As a parent, you teach not only by words, but by example. Incorporate exercise into your life. For example, if you go to the driveway and shoot hoops whenever you need to blow off steam, your daughter might notice and start doing the same thing.

Make foods that your daughter likes.,
Give her plenty of protein and dairy.Adding more of these to her diet can increase her weight.,
Stop using low-fat versions of foods.,
Incorporate calorie-dense snacks, shakes, and smoothies into her diet.",How to Help Your Daughter Gain Weight3," When people are given foods that they like, they tend to eat more than they otherwise would. This isn't limited to dessert, either: think about waffles, pancakes, soups, sandwiches, noodles, fruits, and whatever she loves to eat.


Make deals with her where she earns something extra special. For example, if she finishes a draft of her essay by Sunday at 6 pm, you'll make waffles the next day.
Offer to take her to the grocery store so she can help pick out foods she likes.

, Try peanut butter, cheese, yogurt, nuts, ice cream, milkshakes, lean meats, and red meats.

, Instead of skim milk, buy 2% milk. Get regular ice cream and yogurt instead of ""half the fat.""


If you don't want other people eating this (e.g. if she has a brother who overeats), then buy both versions. When her brother asks for ice cream, give him the lowfat version, and give her the regular version. Make sure that they aren't paying close attention when you're serving their ice cream.
Buy her favorite flavors with higher fat. For example, if she loves rocky road and her brother likes mint chocolate chip, buy the regular rocky road and the reduced fat mint. Even if she eats the mint ice cream sometimes and her brother wants rocky road once or twice, on average she'll be eating more fat.

, Using every opportunity to pack in the calories will help her weight increase. Avoid diet sodas, which are low-calorie and empty of nutrition.Snacking regularly will help her gain weight."

Take her to a doctor if she is is severely underweight, or if she has been strictly restricting her diet.",How to Help Your Daughter Gain Weight4," If your daughter sees you laughing at them, feeling disgusted by them, or treating them with pity, then she will learn that fat is something to be reviled and avoided. This will prevent her from having a healthy attitude towards her weight.Teach her that the goal of exercise is to be healthy, not to lose weight., Even if you think you're saying something positive, it's likely to make her feel more self-conscious, or start self-monitoring more carefully. Only talk to her about it if she brings it up, and if then, be honest and supportive. For example...


""I hear you. What are your ideas for how you can gain a little weight?""
""Yes, I think it might be a good idea for you to gain some weight. I think you're cute the way you are, but it's good to have some extra body fat as insurance in case you ever get sick and your weight drops.""
""Sweetie, I think you're beautiful, and it surprises me to hear you ask if you look fat. Why are you asking this?""

, Don't go on fad diets—live a healthy lifestyle without shaming yourself.Teach her that the goal of eating and exercise is health and feeling good, not weighing less. When you love yourself, you teach her to do the same.Focus on what your body can do, not what it looks like or how much it weighs. Encourage her to do the same., Listen to her, respect her, and make her feel like she matters to you. Be supportive, and offer advice when asked, but let her make her own decisions. She will come to trust you with her problems, so she'll talk to you if she thinks something is wrong.

, How is she feeling? What problems is she struggling with? Sometimes people may lose weight if they're feeling stressed about something, or if they have a mental illness. This is one reason why communicating with her is so important.

, Taking control of your daughter's life, or constantly pushing ideas at her, will only make her resent the pressure. Let her come to the idea on her own, and recognize that you can't control what she does with her body. Support her, respect her, and let her come to a decision in her own time.


Studies show that body satisfaction is an important component in health; if people feel badly about their bodies, they are less likely to take good care of them.Thus, it's important to help her feel good about her body.

, Mild intervention only works if her life and health are not at risk. You should contact a doctor if she...


Is being secretive about her eating
Often disappears into the bathroom after eating
Plays with her food and doesn't eat much of it, or practices strange eating rituals
Feels cold, lightheaded, or sore often
Expresses concern about her weight and/or symptoms, and asks to see a doctor

Take your child to the doctor.,
Consider a specialist.,
Get an evaluation from the school system.,
Enroll your child into an early intervention program.",How to Help Your Baby Reach Delayed Physical Milestones1," If you believe that your child may be experiencing developmental delays in any area, take them to the doctor immediately. Your doctor can determine if there is a delay by using strict screening guidelines.It is important that you keep up with scheduled pediatrician visits even if you haven’t seen evidence of delays. The doctor may be able to notice lags or delays that you haven’t picked up on yet.
Though there are things you can do to encourage physical development at home, you should always take your child to the doctor and get them the proper medical help for their physical delays.;
, If your doctor believes your child has developmental delays, they may refer you to a development specialist to check for any underlying causes that may be causing the delay. If you believe there may be a problem with your child’s development, you may decide to go directly to a specialist instead of going through your doctor. You can take them to a developmental and behavioral pediatrician or a pediatric neurologist.You may also need to take your child to a hearing or speech therapist.You can ask your doctor for a referral, or you can search for pediatric developmental specialists in your area. If there is a children’s hospital in a city near you, you may want to see if they have developmental specialists and take your child there.

, Even if your child is a baby, you can request an evaluation of your child from the school system. This should be given to you at no cost. An evaluation helps you determine why your child may not be developing at the rate they should be.This evaluation is done by a team of professionals. They work with your child to look for the criteria that must be met to be diagnosed with developmental delays. They also look for possible underlying reasons for the delays.

, If your child has developmental delays, you can put them into an early intervention program. This is done no matter the age of the child. Every state has one of these programs. The early intervention program will help you develop an individualized plan based on your child’s needs.Early intervention programs include physical therapy to help with physical, muscular, or movement delays, like walking. Occupational therapy helps with fine motor skills that are needed for your child to do things on their own. Speech and language therapies and behavior therapies can also be used if there are problems in those areas.
Early intervention programs should be tailored to your child’s needs. They should also include a lot of one-on-one instruction to help your child reach their developmental milestones.
You can look for early intervention programs in your area and additional information about the programs through The CDC and The Center for Parent Information and Resources.

Encourage gross motor skills.,
Help with fine motor skills.,
Develop language skills.,
Help with social skills.",How to Help Your Baby Reach Delayed Physical Milestones2," One way you can help your baby reach milestones in gross motor skills is to help them develop the muscles needed for these skills. Starting at around two months, when your child is awake, place them on their belly for ""tummy time."" This helps them develop the neck and back muscles needed for movement.Never leave a baby unattended on their belly or place a baby to sleep on their belly.
When you are just starting out with tummy time, the baby will spend just a few minutes several times a day on their belly. Over time, this can increase to about 30 – 45 minutes a day.
Make your home safe for your baby so you can place your baby on the floor and let them explore. This may include your baby just lying on their tummy and reaching out, or starting to crawl. By six months, your baby should be pushing themselves up and starting to crawl.
Older children should be encouraged to go outside so they can move around. They need to run and jump to develop their muscles, movement, and coordination.

, Babies may need a little help with the fine motor skills, like using their hands. Babies should be encouraged to grasp and use their fingers. By four months, you can start giving them toys to play with that stimulate this impulse. Different textures of the toys will help babies want to touch them with their fingers. Giving them age-appropriate toys, like puzzles, blocks, or even crayons, can help them develop fine motor skills.When your baby is old enough, you should let them feed themselves. This usually is between six to eight months. Let them pick up food with their fingers as they develop the pinching motion.

, If your baby is experiencing language delays, there are a few things you can do to help them. Talking to them and reading to them is a big help because they hear your voice. Name objects as you read or go on walks. Point to the object so your child will start to associate the object with the word.Babies start to make noises by four months. By six months, they should be making concrete sounds, and by nine months may babble as a form of communication.
To help stimulate hearing, play music for your baby. Start this when they are a newborn and continue as they grow.

, Your baby may need help with their social skills as they grow and develop. You can encourage them to interact with you by touching, laughing, and smiling at them. Your baby will respond to your voice and your facial expressions and start smiling and laughing with you.Babies should start smiling by two months. By six months, they can smile and frown, recognize their parents, and respond to their emotions.
Don’t place your baby in front of a television and leave them. Instead, play with your child. If you are able, let your child play with other babies.

Recognize common physical milestones.,
Monitor for delays.,
Look for regression.",How to Help Your Baby Reach Delayed Physical Milestones3," Though children develop at different rates, there are standard milestones children reach around the same age. Knowing the approximate time when these milestones occur can help you notice delays in your child. There may be a problem if your child is delayed beyond two months from where the milestone norm is, like if they’re seven or eight months old and haven’t smiled yet. Common milestones include:Two to four months: smiles, moves hands to mouth, looks at parents, makes sounds, turns head, follows with eyes, begins to push up onto elbows when lying on the stomach, copies movements, reaches for objects
Six to nine months: plays with others, looks at things, puts things in the mouth, moves things between hands, rolls over, sits without support, supports weight on legs or bounces when parents help them stand or they stand on their own, points, picks up food between fingers, crawls
One year: holds out limbs while getting dressed, starts saying short words, can wave good-bye, shakes or throws things, takes things out of boxes or containers, sits up without assistance, starts walking, hands things to people
Two years: copies older children and adults, repeats words, can say short sentences, finds hidden things, kicks or throws balls, stands on tiptoes, climbs, runs, uses stair with a railing, starts to use writing utensils to draw messy shapes

, During your child’s first three years, they will develop skills that affect their entire life. If not identified, delays or lags may negatively impact them later in life. Early identification is extremely important to make sure your child gets the help they need to overcome any lags or delays.For example, your child may be delayed in more than one area, such as language and motor skills.
Ignoring the problem or hoping it goes away on its own may cause permanent damage to your child’s development. It is better to be cautious and get a professional opinion if you think anything is wrong with your child than waiting for them to figure it out on their own.

, Delays may not be the only symptom that your child may have a developmental problem. Your child may also have regressions. If your child is suddenly unable to do something they were able to do before, you should get them checked out.For example, you may notice that your child could hold something in their hand but can't now. Your child may have started making sound, but now doesn't anymore.

Choose between individual or group activities.,
Find a need in the community.,
Join a group dedicated to resolving a need.,
Look for activities at community and education centers.",How to Help Your Child Help the Community1," Individual activities might involve your child selling something, like candy, to raise money for charity. You child might also collect useful articles of clothing, like jackets and shoes, for the less fortunate. These activities can often be made into a group one if there’s enough interest. Talk with other parents to get your child’s friends involved.


Some individual activities include: gathering items for donation (shoes, shirts, jackets, food, etc.), helping out at a retirement home or medical center, picking up garbage in your neighborhood, and so on.
Some group activities include: helping out at a soup kitchen, assisting with a food/clothing drive, volunteering at a charitable organization (like the Red Cross or Salvation Army), and more.;
, Where there’s a need in the community, there’s something your child can do to help. Homeless people need food and clothing, schools and classrooms need books and supplies, retirement homes need support, and even afterschool programs need volunteers.


Brainstorm ideas with your child. Choosing to help in an area they’re passionate about will make them more willing to put in work helping.
Consider activities that directly involve your child. For example, if a member of your family has battled cancer, your child might want to get involved with cancer fighting volunteer work.
There are many ways of meeting a need. When you’ve found a need your child is passionate about, work together to find ideas that can help., There are many organizations that can help your child get more involved, like Goodwill, Big Brothers and Sisters, and Meals on Wheels.You can inquire more about volunteer opportunities with these organizations on their homepage or by calling their volunteer hotline.


There may be lesser known outreach programs in your area that your child can take part in. Find these with an online keyword search for “volunteer outreach opportunities near me” or “community outreach opportunities near me.”

, Community centers and colleges frequently coordinate community betterment activities. You can often find advertisements for these on message boards at local centers or online at their homepage.


Make a quick call to your local community center or college to ask about volunteer opportunities. The operator should have information or be able to transfer you to the appropriate party.
Your child’s school, too, is likely involved in various community service activities. Inquire with your child’s teacher or call the office about volunteer work.

Visit the elderly.,
Mentor younger children.,
Join a community cleanup.,
Sign up for a race or relay.,
Volunteer at a local library.,
Plant trees on Arbor Day.",How to Help Your Child Help the Community2," Take your child and a group of their friends to sing a song or do a dance at a local senior center.Some centers have reading programs where your child can read to an elderly person. If your child is a little more competitive, have them join some elders for a game of bingo.You may have elderly neighbors who need help around their home. Go with your child to offer your services shoveling snow, gardening, raking leaves, or doing housework.Some elderly have difficulty using technology. Your child is just the person to teach an elder some basic tech skills.
Your child doesn’t only have to sing, dance, or play bingo. They could learn a useful skill, like knitting or make fun crafts., Your child might do well as a role model for younger children who need someone to look up to. This doesn’t have to be with a formal program, like Big Brothers Big Sisters. Your child could help with young ones at church, afterschool childcare, or as an unofficial sports mentor.Check in with your child about their mentoring activities. You never know when they might need some perspective or your advice.
It may be difficult for your child to think up things to do with their mentee. Offer suggestions on what you think might be fun, like seeing a movie, exploring a park, playing capture the flag, playing video games, practicing sports, and so on.

, Community associations often hold local cleanup events to keep trash from accumulating. These events frequently occur at parks, beaches, and rivers. Contact your local officials about community cleanups or search your local area for them at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) homepage.The EPA offers a lookup feature where you can input your ZIP code to find community cleanup events near you.Make sure your child is properly equipped to pick up trash. Some garbage can be dangerous. Send them to cleanups with pair of work gloves to prevent cuts.

, Charitable races and relays, like Race for the Cure or Relay for Life, are great ways of raising money for a good cause.Your child might also enjoy similar events, like a dance marathon. Get more information for these events and sign up online.


Coordinate these kinds of activities with your child's friends from school, church, and clubs. These activities are a great opportunity for your child to connect with others.
Sometimes the competitive aspect of events like these can make your child lose focus on its purpose. Remind them the goal isn’t to raise the most money or run the fastest, it’s to help others.

, Local libraries often hold events for the community, like reading to young children, craft making, book clubs, game clubs, book bingo, murder mysteries, origami, and more.Your child can take part in these activities as a helper or they can assist the librarian prepare materials and set up.


Contact your local library about helping out. For example, you might say, “Hi, I’m calling because my 12-year-old wants to volunteer and I thought he might be able to help with one of your events.”
Donating needed materials to your local library can help out, too. Books and novels your child doesn’t read anymore are prime candidates., Suitable trees can be purchased at your local nursery. When you join the Arbor Day Foundation for $10, you’ll receive 10 trees that are suitable for your region.Plant trees with your child in your yard or talk to a public or school official about planting trees on public property.While planting your tree, take this opportunity to speak with your child about the importance of taking care of natural resources.
You might explain to your child, “Trees produce oxygen, and people need oxygen to breathe. But we cut down trees to make things like paper and houses, so we need to plant new ones.”

Explain and model conservation.,
Teach compassion.,
Raise your child to be honest and fair.,
Instill sound judgement in your child.,
Demonstrate self- and community respect.,
Encourage responsibility.,
Help others in need.",How to Help Your Child Help the Community3," Using resources, like oil and coal, to create power comes at a cost. Byproducts of many kinds of energy harm the world we live in. Clean water, too, requires treatment to make it safe. Wasting these resources puts strain on the local community.Teach conservation through:


Reducing your greenhouse gas emissions
Saving water while doing dishes
Managing water usage in your laundry room
Decreasing your electricity usage

Recycling used goods, like empty cans and used paper products, Compassion is your ability to connect with another person’s feelings and identify with them. This is also called empathy. With compassion, you can better recognize the suffering of others. Compassion also helps you share in the joy and excitement of the victories of others. Teach compassion by:Assisting others in their daily life. Some examples of this might include things like taking food to a sick neighbor, helping with home projects, opening doors, lending out tools, and so on.
Discussing other points of view. You might ask your child “What do you think that person is thinking?” about TV or book characters, friends at school, people on the street, and more., To be honest, you must care more about your relationship with others than your own personal benefit. Lying can ruin trust between people and harm your relationship. Fairness requires decisions to be made on evidence, and not on personal feelings.Talk about the meaning of honesty with your child. Ask them what they think it is, and offer more explanation if necessary.
Illustrate the consequences of honesty without compassion. Telling a person you think he’s fat might be honest, but is unnecessarily cruel.
Involve your child in a conversation about fairness. You might ask questions like, “How do we show fairness at school? At home?” Explain this concept further if necessary.
Discuss your personal experiences with honesty and fairness. Talk about your struggles to show your child you understand how hard this can be. This way, your child will be more likely to come to you when they struggle., In many cases, it can be difficult for even adults to decide between right and wrong, good and bad. Teach your child to pause before making a decision and consider its consequences. Acting on impulse can lead to poor decision making.


Help your child discern between fact and feeling. Feeling strongly about something, hitting someone else, for example, does not mean it’s OK.
Tell stories from your life about situations where you had to exercise sound judgement. Point out how other people were affected by your actions so your child can learn to think in this way.
Everyone has rules they don’t like. With your child, brainstorm a list of reasons for the rules they dislike. By doing this, you’ll help them get into the habit of thinking of the reasons behind rules., One of the best ways to learn respect is being treated with it.Even if you are frustrated or tired, try to use respectful language (please, thank you, excuse me) with your child, listen attentively to them, and inquire about their thoughts, feelings, and opinions.Speak with your child about different ways of showing respect and how different people have different ideas about what is respectful. This can be especially important when showing respect to elders.
Even if your child is wrong in their thinking, you might say something like, “Thank you for sharing that, Jane. I appreciate your input, but I’ve made my decision.”, It can be difficult keeping promises and honoring commitments that have been made. Failing to do these things can create mistrust in relationships or make people think you don’t care. Accepting responsibility is an important part of being a family or community member.Follow up with your child on agreements you’ve made. Agree on consequences beforehand and be faithful to these when agreements are broken.
Be a responsibility partner with your child. When they have to take responsibility, encourage them and be supportive. Help them make plans for how to act should the situation arise again., Everyone needs a little help every now and then. Helping others could involve things like carrying groceries, offering spare change to a homeless person, doing yard work, or giving directions. Even a small gesture could have a big impact on someone’s day.By offering to help others in your daily life, you’ll be modeling this behavior for your child. Involve your child by saying something like, “Let’s go help that nice woman with her groceries.”
If you notice somebody struggling with something, you might say, “Excuse me, could I help you with that?”

Create a loving and peaceful environment.,
Provide proper nutrition.,
Ensure they exercise regularly and play.,
Do any activity the best you can.,
Play with your child.,
Do not hurry.,
Listen to your child and encourage positive beliefs.,
Respect children's imagination.,
Cultivate love of wisdom.",How to Help Children Learn," Children need to feel our love at all times. Our love gives them confidence that they are heard, that they are present, and that they matter. A warm, loving, and gentle environment is absorbed unconsciously and it gives children a wonderful start to life.


Make sure that your child feels at 'home' within your home. If we are surrounded by chaos, our mind cannot stay peaceful. If we love ourselves, we will give our-selves the gift of beauty and harmony in everything that surrounds us.
Noise is an important inhibitor to a harmonious environment. Switch off the TV, radio, and control the music within your home.;
, Children should eat lots of fresh organic fruits and vegetables and avoid at all times sugary juices, salty snacks, and fast food, additives, colors, and sweets. The proper nutrition will strengthen your child's immune system, and act as a support to your child's brain development. Fruits and vegetables provide the body with #1 source of antioxidants, vitamins and minerals.

, Children learn intuitively, perceiving the subtle inner relationships observing nature. Free creative play is an invaluable gift that children need to start properly relating to the outside world. Allow your child plenty of 'free time' to exercise and explore the world.

, Do not change an activity after a few minutes to replace it with another stimulus. The longer we stay practicing, the better we become. We enjoy the art of doing it perfectly. To experience anything fully we need mindfulness and concentration.

, Invent stories for your child, and let your child invent stories for you. Set time for stories in your day to day life. The best is to cut TV and computer time and increase 'story telling' time.


Children love learning through rhymes, they love poetry, painting, story-telling, cooking, knitting, and their thinking capability beautifully develops supported by music, arts, and sports.
The development of thoughts should go hand in hand with the development of feelings and heart.

, Children first learn through experimenting, and the fascinating world around them, of flowers, animals, stones, has so much to offer, so there is no need to rush their thinking process / development. Once the thinking starts, it should be treated as the most fascinated activity completely supported with the world of images and emotions.

, There is something your child is trying to tell you no matter how old s/he is, so listen to him or her. Core beliefs identify who we are. We are constantly bombarded by the messages of what to believe in, how to think, or what to do. Children absorb these beliefs like sponges.


A child could start believing that s/he is stupid, boring, lazy, and these core beliefs will become entrenched in their subconscious. It is important that we challenge our beliefs and that we develop alternative, balanced beliefs.
Our core beliefs are at the root of our happiness and self-esteem.

, A child's imagination is a feeling force. Respect the world of images, avoid abstract and bloodless thoughts. Sarcasm can be most hurtful and destructive force. Also, do not let your child get lost in the world of TV, computers, or games, and let him/her explore nature instead.

, At the age of 7 to 14, our children are learning to have a beautiful capacity for feelings that will give them a rich soul experiences, and they are expressing a wonderful hunger for knowledge, for Philosophy (love of wisdom). It is love and wisdom that are the two greatest gifts of mankind.

Help them find fun ways to spend time with kids their age.,
Teach them social skills.,
Be a good role model.,
Offer emotional support.,
Be on the lookout for bullying.,
Offer interaction opportunities, but don't push.",How to Help Autistic Children Socialize," This can be in the form of signing them up for clubs, finding sports teams, or helping them find groups associated with a favorite activity (e.g. dance). However, don't force these activities upon your child, because they will resent you for it.


Consider the child's special interest when choosing activities. Interaction may be easier when it centers around one of the child's passions.
Find autistic children, teens, or adults whom your child can meet and befriend. Meeting other autistic people will help build your child's self-esteem and show them that they aren't alone.
Keep the situation as enjoyable and low-stress as possible. Children learn and grow the most when they have the freedom to have fun.;
, There's no point throwing a child into a social situation when they aren't sure how to relate to others. Autistic people find socializing especially difficult, so they will need more support in this area than most children their age.


Clearly explain social skills so that your child is not confused. For example, ""It's polite to look at people when you're talking to you. If eye contact feels uncomfortable to you,you can try looking at somebody's eyebrows, mouth, hands, or general direction instead.""
Offer media that models good social skills. Many children's books will teach lessons (e.g. how to cope with a bully or how to share), and TV shows such as My Little Pony often teach constructive ways to respond to social situations. This allows children to learn in a fun, ""safe"" manner.
Older children and teens might like self-help books about social interaction. Try picking up some well-known titles at the library, such as How to Win Friends and Influence People and The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People. They may also be interested in wikiHow articles, or resources written by autistic people (such as Realsocialskills).

, Children learn by imitation, and your child will watch your actions to determine what is appropriate. Treat others with respect, ask questions, listen well, and take time to cool off if you feel angry or upset. Your child will watch you and begin doing the same.

, Respect your child's communication—verbal or nonverbal—and make time every day to talk and play together. When your child feels upset, ask them what's wrong instead of immediately punishing them, and offer to help them fix the problem and prevent it from happening again. This will help your child feel supported, and trust you enough to tell you if there are problems with friends.

, Most autistic children experience bullying in some form or another at some point because of their differences. They could be bullied by their classmates. Have regular conversations with your child, their teachers, and even the school principal to make sure that everything is okay for your child at school.

, Your child won't like socializing unless she feels that she is doing it by choice. If your child feels overwhelmed or wants quiet time, let them have quiet time. Trust that they will learn the skills to create friendships at their own pace.

Introduce bath-time as a time to feel safe in the water.,
Avoid putting your own fears of the water on the child.,
Be patient with your child's fears and concerns.",How to Get Your Child Comfortable with Water1," By making bath-time a comfortable place, water will seem less scary. Show young kids, even at age 1, how to get used to water. By starting to teach them skills even during bath-time, they'll feel more confident in when learning how to swim.Get your young child comfortable with water on their face. In the bathtub, get the baby wet, let water go over their head, and get into their ears. Keep this up, so that the baby is introduced early on.
Teach bubble blowing. This can help to teach your young child how to clear their nasal passages when they don't have their hands free. It helps to teach certain ways of breathing when around water.
Have bath toys and pool toys available to make time in the water seem more fun.
Teach them about unassisted floating in the tub. Help to hold them back in a floating position by sitting behind them at their head, and holding them underneath the arms.;
, You may not have learned to swim, or have some fears of your own about being in the water. Children will likely pick up on those fears. Make them feel safe by putting away your fears. When you're less anxious, they'll be less anxious.If you're having trouble with being in the water, consider taking swimming classes on your own to help reduce your fears.
If you're watching your child in swimming classes and have anxiety from the sidelines, pay attention to what those anxieties are actually about, or consider having another partner or caregiver present to watch over.

, Having a fear of water is a common occurrence for children. They may have experienced a time when they couldn't catch their breath in the water and panicked. It will take time for them to feel safe and secure.Take an active role in encouraging and reassuring them. Be present , if possible, to help them feel safe in the water. Get in the pool with them, and build a bond with them in the water. Say things like, ""You're doing great"" or ""Awesome job.""
Don't snap at them or make them feel like their fears are unfounded. Respect their fear as real to them. Avoid saying things like, ""You just have to get used to it. It's for your own good."" Instead, say things like, ""I understand what you're feeling. I'll be here with you the whole time.""
Gradually immerse them in the water, even if it starts with the feet, then legs, then hips, and neck. Take it slow and steady, if that's their pace.

Focus on the positives of swimming and playing in the water.,
Have the child take swim classes.,
Make swimming a part of your regular activities.,
Set up goals and a reward system.",How to Get Your Child Comfortable with Water2," Make swimming and time in the water seem like lots of fun. Introduce games and activities that help to build confidence and trust in the pool. Just make it clear that playing in the water is fun, only when supervised.


Use pool toys and other fun props to make the pool more interesting and fun.
Try games like ""red light, green light"" to help get them moving in the water. With games, their minds will be more focused on playing the game, and less on feeling uncomfortable.

, Make swimming class a priority when your child is young. Consider private or group swimming classes. While there are swimming classes available for toddlers, the recommended starting age is around age 4 for classes.Often, the earlier that you teach a child to swim, the more comfortable they will be around water as they get older.Consider finding affordable swim classes through the YMCA or similar youth organizations.
There may be ""mommy-and me"" swimming classes in your area, too. Think about these classes as a way to bond more with your child.

, Help to make swimming feel like second nature. The more often you spend time around the pool, the more likely it will feel comfortable and normal to be around water.Consider having your young child practice their swimming techniques in the bathtub.
Turn pool time into family time. Make it something that your whole family can enjoy.
The more that you and your child practice swimming, the more it will feel comforting rather than scary to be in the water.

, Create small goals at first that are attainable. Then, as they become more comfortable in the water, increase the difficulty of the goals. When they reach their goals, provide rewards and encouragement.The reward can be as simple as telling them, ""Good job"" or ""You made it this far. Great job!"" Gentle and loving words of encouragement, even for small things, can help to build confidence.
Consider providing an incentive such as a treat after swim class. You could also buy a new toy that can be used at the next swim lesson.

Never leave a child unattended near water, regardless of their swimming level.,
Practice 'touch supervision' for young or new swimmers.,
Use floatation devices and other safety measures.,
Practice pool and water safety rules in all settings, including at home.,
Learn CPR and drowning safety measures.",How to Get Your Child Comfortable with Water3," Drowning or swimming accidents are a serious matter. Without supervision, it can take just a matter of seconds for a child's safety to be in jeopardy, particularly if they are young children.Even when they become more advanced in their swimming, it's still unsafe to leave them unattended.
If your child is at a pool party, at a public pool, or swimming on a lake, make sure that there is always an adult designated to watch over the children who are playing near the water.
Make sure that access to pools is restricted when no adults are present. Consider investing in a gate if you have a home pool so that children can't get near the pool. Pool covers alone aren't safe if children start walking on them.

, Young children and new swimmers in particular need a sense of safety when at a pool or near water. This means that you need to be both present with the child, as well as within arm's reach of them.Provide a sense of security by being in the pool or water with them at all times.
Protect them by being within an arm's reach. That way, if they get into trouble, you can react quickly to assist them.
Don't rely on older siblings or other children to protect the child. Make sure it is an adult who is familiar with water safety.

, Life-jackets and floatation devices are key to safety. This is particularly true for young children, such as toddlers or new swimmers. Yet even with these measures, don't leave a young child unattended.Make sure that the flotation device fits properly. Use safe flotation devices like approved life vests and boating vests.
The following personal flotation devices should never be used to ensure a child's safety: water wings, inflatable vests, blow-up rafts, noodles, swim rings, inflatable tubes, or inflatable floats. These devices are not durable enough to be life-saving devices.If you're going on a boat or canoe trip, always make sure that the child is wearing a life-jacket -- and wear one yourself.
Get goggles for your child if they are having trouble with seeing when in the water.

, Remember that water safety rules should apply in all settings where people are in or near water. While it may seem like your pool or your neighbor's pool are safer than a public swimming pool, it's important to set clear boundaries no matter the location.Remind your children about safety around pools, particularly in home and on private property where there may not be any fencing. If you see a child who is playing dangerously near a pool, make sure to provide education about safety, and possibly take away privileges if they continue to disobey safety rules.
Consider locks or gates to prevent access to pools.
Make sure that open areas such as lakes, rivers, beaches, or natural ponds are supervised by adults when children are nearby. Stay close with your child at all times in these settings.
Make sure that your child feels safe in crowds. This is particularly true in public spaces such as water parks, beaches, and public pools. Older children may be rough-housing, causing anxiety for your child. Make sure to reassure your child by being physically present, and enforcing safety rules for all the children there.

, Be able to respond if there is a drowning emergency. Learn CPR and be aware of the warning signs that a child may be at risk of drowning.


The Red Cross and other programs offer CPR classes. Look at available classes near you for pediatric CPR: http://www.redcross.org/take-a-class/cpr

Be vigilant when you notice these warning signs of a potential drowning: head low in water/mouth at water level, eyes glassy and empty, eyes closed, hyperventilating or gasping, trying to swim in a particular direction but not making headway, trying to roll over on back, or appear to be climbing an invisible ladder.Consider having a person who is CPR-certified available, or a lifeguard, at all times when there are children near water.

Give your child a degree of financial independence.,
Guide the child in making decisions.,
Tell your child to think over his purchase before making a final decision.,
Once your child has made a decision, tell him he has to stand by it.,
Set a proper example.,
Be patient.",How to Help Children Become Financially Savvy," This means that you should allow your child to spend money by himself. However, keep in mind that the initial amount available to him/her should not be too large. The child should be old enough to understand addition and subtraction.;
, Make him aware of the consequences of his choices. For instance, if your child decides to spend all his pocket money on the first day, help him understand that his money is all gone for awhile.

, For example, tell him that spending all his money on a toy car now may mean that he will not be able to purchase a toy airplane later. If he asks for advice, give him suggestions but let him make the ultimate decision.

, This also means that you cannot give in to his demands if he changes his mind after a purchase. For instance, if after a few days your child decides he wants a new toy but has no money, you must be firm and tell him he will have to wait through a previously specified time period.

, Don't waste money on impulse purchases. Teach the value of money when you are making your own purchases. For example, you can tell the child, ""I want to buy both of these ,dresses but if I do, I won't be able to afford any shoes, so I am going to think about whether I need a second dress or a pair of shoes.""

, Your child will make mistakes and there will be tantrums, but if you are firm your child will realize that you really mean it. He will then think about his money seriously. Of course, it will take time and practice, but in a short time children can learn how to spend their money wisely, especially if their parents make the effort to teach them.

Know the purpose of scripts.,
Teach the “I don’t know” script.,
Prompt the child to give the correct response.,
Teach your child plenty of scripts.,
Teach scripts that focus on needs.",How to Help Autistic Children with Echolalia1," Autistic children may rely upon scripts to make communication easier. Many autistic children repeat words and phrases (echolalia) as a way to say, “I heard what you said and am thinking about the answer.”


Try to remain calm and patient while interacting with the child. If you think about the fact that echolalia serves a communication purpose for the child, and it’s not just way to try and frustrate people, it can help you to see it from the child’s point of view.;
, For those questions to which they do not know the answer, autistic children should be encouraged to say “I don’t know”. There is evidence to suggest that training a child to use “I don’t know” to respond to questions to which they don't know the answer helps in picking up and using this new phrase appropriately.


Try asking a series of questions to the child that you know they don't know the answer to. For example, ask ""Where are your friends?"" and prompt the answer by saying, “I don’t know.” Then, “What is the capital of Kansas?” followed by, “I don’t know.” You can write down many questions ahead of time and practice this script each time.
Another way to teach the “I don’t know” script is by having another person there who answers the unknown questions with “I don’t know.”, Children may use echolalia when they don't know how to respond, or how to turn their thoughts into appropriate words. Providing a script helps them know what to say.


For example, ask ""What is your name?"" and prompt the correct response (the child’s name). Repeat this until he has learned the right script. Try this with all questions that have the same answer. “What color is our house?” followed by “Brown.” And, “What is our dog’s name?” followed by “Spot.” It’s important that you supply the answers every time to teach the script until the child starts doing it on his own.
This approach only works for questions that always have the same answer. For example, it would not work for ""What color is your shirt?"" because the child's shirt color will change each day.

, This way, your child can successfully communicate basic things, even when feeling overwhelmed.


This gradual process can provide the tools to build confidence, vocabulary, communication and proper interaction for the child., If an autistic child cannot communicate their needs, they may become frustrated or distressed, and melt down. Scripts will help them tell you what they need, allowing you to fix the problem before they are pushed over the tipping point and start screaming or crying. Example scripts include:


I need quiet time.
I'm hungry.
That's too loud.
Please stop."
"
Use the exact words you want the child to use.,
Leave a blank in your sentences and point to the answer.,
Say statements to your child, rather than asking questions.,
Avoid saying the child’s name at the end of phrases.,
Keep teaching fun and lighthearted.",How to Help Autistic Children with Echolalia2," Modelling should include the exact words and phrases which the child can understand, pick up and reproduce. This helps them learn how to phrase the things they want to say.


For example: you already know that the child dislikes playing with a certain toy, but in order to teach them to express it verbally, you can offer the toy and then keep using phrases or words such as ""no thank you,"" or ""I don't want to.""
When the child uses the desired phrase, give the desired outcome. For example, if the child successfully says ""I want more please,"" then give them more.
If you repeat the phrase several times and the child does not respond, do the desired action. The child will start associating the phrase with the action. Then try again later. In time, the child will start using the phrase., If you intend to give your child a snack or if it is time for the child to drink the milk, then you could model by saying “I want to drink ____ (point to the milk and say “milk”). Or say, “I would like a ____” (point to the snack and say “snack”). In time, the child will fill in the blank by themselves., It is best to avoid questions such as “Do you want this?” or “Do you want help?” because they will repeat the questions. Instead, say what they should say.


For example: if you see them trying to reach something, instead of asking “Do you want me to help you?” try saying, “Help me reach my toy, please,” or “Please lift me up so I can reach my book.” Encourage them to repeat the phrase. Then, whether the child repeats it or not, help them., The child will start repeating it after you and it won’t make sense. When saying “Hi!” or “Goodnight!” simply say the word and don’t say their name after it. Or, you can say their name first and then pause and say what you intend to say last.


When the child needs to be commended for a job well done, then instead of using the name of the child, use the congratulatory word alone. Instead of “Great job Alex!” just say “Great job!” or show it through actions in the form of kisses, a pat on the back, or a hug., Choose a time when you are both relaxed, and be willing to make it silly or turn it into a game. This will help the child look forward to learning, and it will give the two of you an opportunity to connect and have fun.


Teaching should not be painful, nor should it involve a battle of the wills. If one or both of you are getting too frustrated, stop and try again later.

Learn about the purposes of echolalia in autism.,
Remember that delayed echolalia may be used outside of social interaction.,
Notice when your child uses echolalia.,
Handle any frustrations on your end.,
Stay patient and give your child time.",How to Help Autistic Children with Echolalia3," Echolalia has many uses as a form of communication. Autistic children may use it...


If they don't know the meaning of individual words or the purposes or uses of questions. In these cases, children rely on phrases that they've heard to communicate. For example, saying ""Do you want a cookie?"" instead of “Can I have a cookie?” because in the past when an adult said the first question, a cookie materialized.If they are stressed. Echolalia is easier than spontaneous speech, which makes it easier to use during stress. For example, an autistic in a crowded room might be struggling to process all the noise and movement around them, so forming complete sentences might be too much.
If they feel the same way they felt another time when a statement was used. Echolalia can communicate feelings. For example, the child may say, ""The pool is closed today"" to express any type of disappointment, because there was one time that the pool was closed and he was disappointed.If they need time to think. For example, when asked what they want for supper, an autistic person might ask themselves ""What do I want for supper?"" This shows that they heard it and gives them time to think.If they're trying to connect.Echolalia may be used as games or jokes., This can help autistic people in several ways:


Remembering things. Autistic children may have trouble keeping track of a series of steps. They may repeat the sequence to themselves as they work, to help them remember and assure themselves that they are doing it correctly. For example: ""Get a cup. Pour your juice slowly. Not too fast. Put the cap back on. Good job.""
Calming down. Repeating a reassuring phrase can help autistic children control their emotions and relax.

Stimming. Vocal stimming may help with a number of things: concentration, self-control, and elevating mood. If the child is disrupting others, you may ask for them to turn down the volume, but it's usually best to let them enjoy themselves., This will help you discern its purpose.


A child who uses echolalia before a meltdown probably is using it due to severe distress or sensory overload.
A child who repeats your question (e.g. ""Do you want a cookie?"" to express wanting a cookie) may not understand the meaning or purpose of a question.
A child who repeats phrases to themselves in a singsong voice is probably using it for concentration or enjoyment., Sometimes it may be a frustrating experience having the ends of all your statements and questions repeated. Remember that the child is trying to communicate when doing this. They simply don't have the same language skills that you do yet.


Take deep breaths. If you need to, go into a different room for a little while if you get very frustrated and take some deep breaths and collect your thoughts.
Remember that the child is probably frustrated too. (They certainly aren't having meltdowns for the fun of it.)
Take care of yourself. Parenting can be exhausting sometimes, and there’s nothing wrong with admitting that. Take baths, practice yoga, allow yourself time with other adults, and consider joining a community group of parents or caregivers of autistic/disabled children.

, If autistic children don't feel pressured to respond immediately, they can feel more relaxed and use language better.Be patient and make it clear that you're happy to hear what they have to say, no matter how long it takes for them to say it.


Allow pauses in the conversation for your child to think. Forming a coherent response may take a lot of cognitive energy for them.

Ideally, choose a time shopping when the children will be well rested, fed, and you will not be pressed for time.,
Make a shopping list.,
Make a shopping list for your child too.,
When at the store, briefly but clearly go over expected behavior and what they can do to help.Tell the children which store you are going to and that you will be buying the groceries.,
Pick a sage cart.,
Assign older children to a job you think is special enough for them to do.,
Be Efficient.,
Be Educational.,
Thank your Children.",How to Grocery Shop With Kids," A tired, hungry child will be much more difficult to work with. Shopping with young children inevitably takes longer than shopping solo, so allow for extra time if at all possible. And be sure you are well fed, rested, and in a good frame of mind, too; if you are crabby, you are also be more likely to have problems with the trip.

If possible, go on a trip to the playground beforehand. Getting physical energy out and having fun tends to make for more relaxed children.
Try to keep shopping trips short. It is sometimes tempting to try to get everything done at once, but children have short attention spans and typically do not really enjoy stores. If possible, go to one store in the morning, and then one in the afternoon rather than attempt two back-to-back trips.



 

;
, It can save time and help keep you on task so you don't forget a major item, and then have to go back again.

, With a picture-based list even a young child can stay busy checking things off. Older children can be responsible for part of the list all by themselves.

, You don't have to be overly heavy-handed about this, but a reminder helps make clear what's expected. Also remind about any potential rewards, such as making a special lunch afterwards.

, Avoid carts that have broken, or no safety straps in the seating area. Many children are seriously injured by shopping carts. If you see a broken belt, tell a manager. Some stores offer carts with special seating, cars on the front of the shopping cart or seats off of the back of the cart. The cars only fits small children and it's hard to see the child once inside.

, As you go by through the store they can be carrying out their special job and that should also make the shopping trip easier and faster for you as well. At the end of the trip praise them on how well they did their job so that they earn a sense of achievement.


Suggestions for Special Helper Jobs:






Read the list to you.






Find a bunch of five bananas






Hand your list of deli purchases to the deli worker, and bring the items back.






Get a liter of milk.






Find the cheapest paper towels.






Find a coupon for you. (Even non-readers can match pictures to products.)






Remind you to get an item (even if its on the list already).

, If you're meandering through the aisles, flirting with the cute seafood manager, and shuffling through your flier, you'll try the patience of the little ones.

, The grocery store is a real-world situation in which reading, math, problem-solving and more are easily taught.


Count the fruits and vegetables as you get them from the bin.






Have your child read the list as you walk the aisle.






Have your child find the cheapest item.






Have your older child figure which item is cheapest per unit.






Read the item's label out loud, point to the word, and put it in the cart.






Have your older child find the cereal with the most fiber, the least calories, or most Vitamin C (or whatever feature you're looking for).






Ask your young child what animal made a certain food (milk, eggs, cheese, bacon, etc.)






Point out colors of foods. Ask them if they can spot a red food, purple food, or yellow food.







, At the end of the shopping trip, thank your children for their excellent work. A reward may be in order for a successful trip. However, pick a treat that you can be consistent with week to week. It does not have to be large. Ideas include:

Stickers
A trip to the park after the groceries are put away.
A favorite song on the way home.
Avoid sugary treats. A cookie for a good shopping trip may sound like a good idea, but not when you get whining for cookies every time you set foot in the grocery store.

Teach your child to delay gratification.,
Help your child find healthy outlets for expression.,
Provide opportunities for socialization.,
Teach your child to conquer themselves.",How to Help Children Build Mental Strength1," By delaying gratification, your child will develop self-control, one of the most important qualities of the mentally tough individual. A simple way is to tell your child to wait until after they’ve eaten everything to eat dessert. As they grow, you could tell them that they must wait to receive big, expensive gifts and toys until their birthday or Christmas., A mentally tough child will be able to rebound quickly after a disappointment or setback. Encourage your child to be honest with themselves and others about what they’re feeling after a big loss. Remind them that it’s okay to be sad or angry, but that they must find ways to channel their frustration and sadness into art, music, and other positive activities.If your child plays a sport and is having a hard time coping with a painful loss, the best way for them to deal with their disappointment might be to get back on the field with renewed determination.
Discourage your child from yelling, throwing things, or engaging in destructive behaviors after suffering a setback. Tantrums are not a habit of mentally strong kids., Mental toughness requires responding to social situations – including criticism, bullying, and peer pressure – in positive ways. If your child does not encounter these situations, they will have no frame of reference to draw on as they grow, and will become mentally weak.Social opportunities provide your child with the opportunity to test their limits and exercise independence.
Through social opportunities and play, your child will be able to determine what they can do alone, and what they need help with. These social opportunities will also help them navigate the processes of negotiation and social bonding.

, Mentally strong kids know that they need to tap into their own best self before they can focus on achieving victory against anyone else. Explain to your child that they must want to constantly improve their technique or extend their knowledge if they are to build mental strength. You cannot make them do it, you can only guide the way. Tell your child:“Do your best.”
”Own yourself.”
”Take control of the moment.”
”Take risks that nobody else does.”

Keep an eye on your child’s social life.,
Be available if your child wants to talk.,
Empathize with your child.,
Avoid trying to fix the situation immediately.",How to Help Kids Cope with Being Socially Excluded1," Know who your child’s friends are, and ask about them occasionally. Notice whether your child expresses frustration or annoyance with someone in their social circle – it could be a sign that that person has hurt their feelings. Be aware of your child’s social habits, and observe whether anything changes.For instance, if your teenage daughter usually texts a friend multiple times a day, a sudden silence could mean something is amiss.;
, Let your child know that you’re always willing to listen to them. If your child comes to you with a social problem, give them your full attention. Don’t brush them off or dismiss their feelings.Wait for your child to initiate the conversation. If you try to make them talk to you before they’re ready, they will just clam up.
You can also ask open ended questions to encourage your child to open up, such as “How was your day at school?”

, Comfort your child by letting them know you understand how they’re feeling. Use active listening techniques and mirror what they are saying.For instance, if your son tells you his friends are leaving him out of games at recess, you could say, “It must make you feel really sad that your friends won’t let you play.”

, Hold off on offering any advice, and don’t say anything bad about your child’s friends. Give your child a chance to resolve the issue themselves. The problem may go away by itself in a few days."

Push your kids.,
Let your child fail.,
Ensure your child finds joy in their extracurricular activities.,
Analyze every experience.,
Permit moderate stress.",How to Help Children Build Mental Strength2," Challenge your kids to do things that are hard. You’ll have lots of opportunities to do this as your kids grow. For instance, for a younger child, they might say that it’s too hard to clean their room. In this case, say, “I know it’s hard, but sometimes in life we must do things that are difficult, even when we don’t want to.”As your child grows, you could push them to do something more legitimately difficult. For instance, if your child struggles with algebra and gives up because it’s “too hard,” sit down with them and again, remind them that they must do their homework. Encourage your child by saying, “You can do this, I believe in you.”
When your child grows tired toward the end of their task, push them to keep going. Say something like, “You’re doing great. Don’t give up now!”
If necessary, help your child with the tasks they struggle with, but never do the whole thing for them.
If your child does extracurricular sports, look for coaches who give honest feedback and ask your child to put more energy into what they’re doing.

, The sweet taste of victory is nothing unless one has also tasted the bitterness of defeat. Failure can be an important learning experience, and provide your child with a new perspective on their behavior and performance. After failing, your child will toughen up mentally and redouble their efforts the next time around to avoid the feelings of disappointment that accompany failure.For instance, if you told your child to pack their shoes and they didn’t, don’t rescue them by running home to get the shoes yourself. Let their failure serve as a lesson to help them remember to be more responsible next time.Don’t be worried that your child will suffer a self-esteem blow when they fail.
While it is important to cheer your child up, you should also provide gentle but honest feedback to your child. If you believe the reason for your child’s failure lies with them, explain yourself in terms they understand., Your child will often have to be mentally tough in the face of academic or professional situations, especially as they grow older. But developing mental toughness is best achieved by ensuring that the child has a few activities like sports or competitive video game clubs that require a real passion and love. If your child is enthusiastic about facing new challenges, they will need little encouragement from you to level up their strategy, improve their technique, and achieve a clarity of focus that builds mental strength.Encourage your child to do things they like to do and challenge themselves within those preferred arenas.
Help your child see that they can apply the same skills and attitudes that they developed in their hobbies to other areas of life to achieve success.

, Whether your child succeeds or fails after any sort of competition, talk to them about what they did right and what they did wrong. Helping them understand the outcome in an explicit way will allow your child to learn more about themselves and/or their experience, and thereby become mentally stronger.Talk to your child about what went right with their performance by asking them directly. Say, “What do you think you did well back there?” They might point to many hours of practice, a willingness to take risks, or careful planning.
You should also be direct when talking to your child about what they did wrong. Ask them, “Can you think of anything you could have improved?” They might list a lack of preparedness or underestimating the competition.
If your child doesn’t perceive factors relevant to their success or failure, help them identify those factors. Focus on the nitty-gritty details that might be harder to see.In some cases, it might help to provide your child with evidence – for instance, a recording of their game, or a direct examination of their test – to point out where they went wrong and what they did right., Too much stress can cause your child to mentally clock out and lapse into depression and apathy. But if your child has an active life where they are trying to juggle school and a social life and extracurricular obligations, they will grow mentally tough by developing habits and lifeways necessary to manage their time and energy.Encourage your child to take on additional obligations. Sign them up for one or two extracurricular activities per school year. They don’t need to be sports, either – chess club, regular volunteer positions, or school plays can all prove moderately stressful situations that will challenge your child to grow stronger mentally.
As your child grows, help them identify specific talents or interests they have, and encourage them to zero in those areas of expertise."

Ensure your child feels safe.,
Be fair when disciplining your child.,
Help your child see their self-worth is independent of their performance.,
Praise your child’s effort.,
Insist they try their best.",How to Help Children Build Mental Strength3," Let your child know that they are cared for and will always have a home with you. Be respectful to your child and don’t disparage their ideas or input. Respond to your child’s ideas and self-expression in a kind and gentle way.For instance, when your child mispronounces a word, don’t belittle them. Instead, help them re-read the word and pronounce it for them correctly.
If your child shares their hopes and dreams, encourage them by saying, “I believe you can do anything if you put your mind to it.”
Pick your child up when they’re down. For instance, after your child gets a disappointing grade on their test, say, “Don’t worry, I’m sure you’ll study hard and do better next time. Let’s go to the movie theatre and see that new animated film you wanted to see.”, Always outline your expectations and punishments for violating expectations in clear terms. Be consistent in your application of rules. Never curse or yell at your child, and do not strike your child in anger or as punishment for misbehavior.Using physical punishment will erode the bonds of trust and affection between you and your child.
Being a good role model for self-control and justice in this way will demonstrate to your child how to behave.

, Emphasize to your child that you love them no matter how well they do in their chosen arena of competition. Remind them that it is not some inherent flaw in them that caused them to lose, but rather, a flawed performance which can be corrected for in other matches.Do not get angry or become sullen with your child for losing.
Do not proffer hurtful criticism or embarrassing commentary when your child does not succeed.

, Do not essentialize your child by saying things like, “You are a great artist/athlete/dancer.” Comments to this effect will make your child believe they have already attained some level of perfection at whatever it is they’re engaged in. Instead, praise the work and actions that your child is contributing toward becoming a great artist/athlete/dancer. For example, you could say, “I’m really proud of you for putting a lot of extra time in on your art” or “All your practice will pay off soon. Keep at it.”, Parents, teachers, and coaches who are demanding and do not accept sub-par effort produce mental toughness in their kids. Your child might chafe under strict rules or schedules, but in the long run, they will appreciate this “tough love” for helping them become more focused and more capable of giving things their best shot.Insist that your child gets all their homework done before playing.
Ensure your child adjusts themselves to schedules for sports practice or for school.
Setting limits for your child demonstrates that you care about them, which in turn helps them develop habits of self-care."

Help your child understand why they might be excluded.,
Teach self-acceptance and dignity.,
Encourage your child to work on things they enjoy.,
Let your child know you’re rooting for them.,
Consider whether your child may be pushing people away.,
Limit the amount of time your child spends on social media.,
Get help for your child if they are struggling to cope.",How to Help Kids Cope with Being Socially Excluded2," Provide some perspective on the rejection. Tell your child that most people are left out of a group at some point, and it doesn’t mean anything is wrong with them. If there’s an obvious reason your child has been excluded, help them understand why.For instance, if your daughter’s friend was only allowed to invite five people to her birthday party, explain that her friend simply couldn’t invite everyone she likes.
It is common for children to blame themselves for being excluded. This can decrease their self-esteem over time, so it is important to address this and talk with them about other reasons why exclusion might happen.

, If your child has an unshakeable sense of self-worth, being excluded won’t sting so much. Help your child learn to value themselves, instead of depending entirely on other people for validation. Talk to them about how to behave with dignity after being rejected by a peer.You can help your child accept themselves by teaching them to use positive self-talk instead of beating themselves up after a setback.
Discourage your child from trying to get back at someone who rejected them.
Teach your child how to praise themselves instead of looking for praise and validation from other people. It will help them to feel more confident in the long run., Help your child get their mind off the rejection by encouraging them to pursue their individual interests. Make sure they have enough time, space, and resources to work on personal projects. If your child doesn’t have many hobbies, sign them up for a class or help them find a club to join.Developing a skill, like drawing or playing the guitar, can go a long way towards repairing a kid’s damaged self-esteem. Overcoming obstacles and accomplishing tasks helps children to build confidence and develop self-esteem.

, While your praise can’t replace validation from your child’s peers, you can still help them feel good about themselves. When they do something well, give them a high-five or offer a few words of praise.For instance, say something like, “Michael, I’m proud of you for working so hard on your English paper. You really earned that A.”
Don’t over-praise your child, or they might not take you seriously. Save your words for when you truly mean them.

, Pay attention to whether your child bosses others around, is a poor sport, or doesn’t stop when other people want them to. If so, they might be alienating their peers without realizing it. Help your child develop better social skills to improve their friendships.Role-playing or practicing different situations with your child is a good way to help them improve their social skills.
For instance, if your child is a sore loser, you could play board games with them and coach them on the appropriate way to act when they lose.
Your child may also benefit from joining an organization or club to build better cooperation and team building skills, such as the Boy Scouts or Girl Scouts of America., Social media can make kids feel like everyone else is having fun without them, and it can even lower self-esteem.Set some reasonable limits on your child’s Facebook use, so they don’t stew over feeling left out 24/7.Help your child understand that appearances on social media don’t always reflect reality.

, If your child is chronically excluded, or if they seem depressed, make them an appointment with a therapist. A professional will be able to help them deal with difficult feelings and improve their social skills, if necessary.A few signs of depression in kids include persistent sadness or crying, irritability, changes in sleeping or eating habits, and loss of interest in favorite activities.

Help your child brainstorm ways to deal with being left out.,
Help your child make new friends.,
Encourage your child to spend time with positive people.",How to Help Kids Cope with Being Socially Excluded3," Talk with your child about what makes a good friend. Tell them that someone who purposely makes them feel bad or talks about them behind their back isn’t a real friend.Make sure your child understands the importance of being a good friend themselves.

, Teach your child to be proactive instead of reactive. Help them find ways to invite other children to do things. Work together to come up with some ideas for dealing with rejection and other social problems in the future. Make a list of your ideas, so your child can refer to it later.For instance, if your shy child feels left out on the playground, maybe they could try befriending another child who is playing alone.

, Get your child involved in social activities outside school, such as a sports team, youth group, or club. Kids are less likely to feel ostracized and lonely when they have different groups of friends.Inspire your child to cast a wide net when it comes to finding friends, looking in the neighborhood, religious or spiritual groups, school, and community organizations.

, Not just any ""friend"" will do. In some cases, children may pretend to be a child's friend when they are in fact teasing or bullying them. Help your child figure out what it feels like to be in a true friendship in which they are accepted and valued.


You might discuss their friendships with several people and ask them to describe them. Highlight the ones they mention that allow them the freedom to be themselves without judgment.
Encourage your child to nurture these relationships. Being comfortable in their own skin will help them attract friends with similar interests and views.You can also show them examples of what healthy friendships look like using videos and books.

Teach your toddlers how to dress themselves.,
Show your toddler how to feed themselves.,
Make getting out of the house a game.,
Potty train your toddler.,
Reward good behavior.",How to Get Toddlers Out the Door Faster1," If you have an older toddler that's around 2 1/2 to 3 years old, they may be ready to learn how to dress themselves. Start with simple clothes that aren't hard to put on and that don't have buttons or zippers. Using buttons or zippers requires complex motor functions which may have not yet developed. Talk to your toddler and choose an outfit the night before. Set expectations and show them the basics of how to get dressed. This will cut out a significant amount of time out of your morning ritual.An example of something you may have to teach your toddler is holding their waistband when putting on their pants.;
, By 13 to 15 months your toddler should be able to feed themselves and should have the motor functionality to use utensils. Work with your child and teach them how to eat using utensils. Make sure that your child doesn't have any difficulty chewing or swallowing, as this may be a sign of delayed development. If this is the case, wait until they are older before encouraging self-feeding., The more that you force your toddler to rush, the more they are likely to resist you. Instead of getting angry and frustrated, make getting ready a game that you can both enjoy. One way to do this is to make leaving the house into a game of ""Simon Says."" Another way is to play your toddler's favorite song and challenge them to get ready and outside before it's over.You can say something like, ""Simon says find your shoes. Simon says to put on your shirt. Simon says eat your pop-tart!""

, Your child is ready for potty training when they verbalize the need to go to the bathroom. They may also show other signs that they are aware of their bodies and have to use the restroom. If they look uncomfortable or tell you that they need to use the potty, they are ready to start potty training. Keep a potty chair in the bathroom and show your children how to properly clean themselves after they go to the bathroom. Schedule regular bathroom breaks throughout the day to get your toddler on a schedule.18 months old is the average age most toddlers learn to potty train but it differs among children.Instead of getting caught up on the average age for potty training, pay attention to your child's specific needs and development.

, The more that you reward your child's autonomy, the more likely they will do things themselves and save you precious time getting ready. You can give your child a verbal reward for doing well, or give them a physical reward, like a sticker.You can say something like, ""Great job Tim, you rocked at getting ready this morning!""

Wake up earlier.,
Create a schedule so you know how much time you have.,
Give yourself extra time in the morning for every task.,
Make a gameplan if you are co-parenting.,
Shower and bathe the night before.,
Keep distractions to a minimum.",How to Get Toddlers Out the Door Faster2," The earlier that you and your toddler wake up, the more time you have to get out of the house during the day. Make sure to put your toddler to sleep early. Set your alarm an hour earlier if you've had trouble getting to appointments on time in the past., Creating a schedule for how long everything takes when you're trying to leave the house will help you gauge if you are running behind or ahead of schedule. If you have a daily routine, then most of the things that you do every day will remain the same.


Use a stopwatch or clock to get an estimate of how long tasks like waking up, getting dressed, and eating breakfast take for you and your toddler.

, When you schedule how long it takes to get your toddler out of the door, make sure to allocate additional time if something goes wrong. Delays can be caused by a toddler who's in a bad mood or having to clean up a spill or mess. Allowing yourself a buffer time will help relax you and get out of the door faster., If there is more than one parent in the house, you can create a gameplan with the other parent to help your toddler so that you can get ready faster. For example, parents can switch off on who gets ready and who takes care of the toddler in increments, so that everyone has time to get ready in the morning., Instead of bathing your toddler in the morning or when you wake up, bathe your toddler the night before. Warm water will also relax your toddler and make them sleepy, so this may be something you want to do towards the night. Bathing your toddler the day before will save you time and can help you get out of the door faster.Never leave your toddler unattended in the bath.

, Toddlers can be distracted easily, so avoid providing your toddler with a toy or the TV unless they are ready to leave. Once they are dressed and fed, however, a toy can serve as a reward for getting out of the house. Distractions can also delay how long it takes you to complete tasks, so keep them to a minimum for yourself as well.

Make lunch the night before.,
Prepare preschool supplies the night before.,
Pre-pack a diaper bag.",How to Get Toddlers Out the Door Faster3," Having to make lunch for yourself or your toddler in the morning can waste valuable time and make getting out of the door harder. Instead of rushing, prepare a bagged lunch and put it in the refrigerator the night before. This is especially helpful if your toddler attends pre-K or daycare that doesn't provide free lunch., If your toddler has preschool or daycare, it's important that you get their supplies ready the day before. Scrambling to get school supplies ready in the morning wastes valuable time. Go over the stuff in your toddler's backpack with them the night before and remember to include special items like their favorite blanket or stuffed animal., If your toddler is too young to potty train, having your diaper bag ready to go in the morning can save you precious time. Even if your toddler is already potty trained, having a diaper bag filled with essential items may be a good idea.Items in your diaper bag should include things like wipes, diapers, toys, comfort items, snacks, hats, mittens, socks, and first-aid supplies.

Do not simply return to your old ways after Easter.",How to Explain Lent to a Child," If you want your child to accept the Christian faith and its major traditions, it’s important to talk about Jesus regularly – and not just during holidays. As soon as your child is old enough to understand, start explaining who Jesus was, what he taught, and why he was so significant.;
, You do not need to dwell on the gruesome details of crucifixion, which can upset and frighten children, but you should introduce Jesus’s death. Emphasize the reasons for Jesus’s sacrifice, that he gave up his earthly life so that people could have eternal salvation.

, Tell your child that Easter is the most important Christian holiday and that it celebrates Jesus’s return from the dead. The concepts of resurrection and life after death are fundamental to the Christian faith, so introduce them early.

, Our lives with God and Jesus after death depend on how we behave now, and God expects us to be good to ourselves and others. It’s easy to forget about that, but Lent serves as a reminder. Suggest that your child think about Lent as a way to get closer to God.

, Lent begins with Ash Wednesday, which, for many believers, includes a symbolic drawing of a cross with ashes on the forehead. The ashes are meant to remind us of our mortality, but it’s not necessary to push this idea too forcefully on very young children. Be matter-of-fact about the tradition.


Some children may resist this ceremony at first, and that’s okay. Take your child to church on Ash Wednesday, but don’t force participation. Your child may need time to understand and accept the idea.

, Tell your child that Lent lasts for forty days because that’s how long Jesus wandered in the desert, fasting, when he resisted the temptation of Satan. Explain that your child has an opportunity, during the forty days of Lent, to pay tribute to Jesus while striving to become closer to God and resisting the devil’s temptations.

, Water is fundamental to our lives, but it also represents baptism and the washing away of our sins. Place a symbol, such as a bottle of water, in your home, and encourage your child to articulate its importance.

, During Lent, Christians “fast” in various ways to connect with and honor Jesus, who fasted for forty days in the desert. You don’t have to expect your child to make a huge, symbolic sacrifice for forty days, but you can certainly teach the concept and encourage your child to try it, perhaps giving up sweets or video games.


Note that during Lent, “fasting” may not always involve food. There are other ways to practice sacrifice and strive for closeness with God. Jesus did not live in luxury, and so giving up something unnecessary is another way to honor his life.
This period of fasting is also a good time to show solidarity with people who do not have enough food. Take your child with you to feed someone who is poor, making someone a meal or supplying food to a shelter or food bank.

, Teach your child that repenting for his or her sins will lead to a closer relationship with God. Children are not purposefully sinful by nature, and they may not understand at first. However, by encouraging your child to admit to and apologize for his or her mischief (fighting with another child, saying bad words, sneaking candy), you can help your child grow into a more mature person.

, Your child should understand that the last week before Easter is especially important. Begin by telling the story about the night before Jesus died, and consider making a meal (perhaps including wine and homemade bread) to correspond with it. Make sure your child knows that this last portion of Lent leads up to the celebration of Easter.

, The day that Jesus died is a sad one for Christians, but you can still make it interesting for your child. Paint eggs together, and remind your child of the importance of resurrection and life after death.

, Explain to your child that on Saturday, there is no liturgy, and Christians prepare for Easter. Talk about Easter with joy and enthusiasm, and explain the symbolism of painted eggs and the wonder of resurrection, salvation, and life with God after death.

, You don’t have to lecture your child on the subject, but definitely mention, in a natural way, that your child has certain luxuries that others do not. Remind your child that we should not take luxuries for granted.

, Respect the rules yourself and be a good role model for your child. Stick to the rituals and try to make Lent a period of closeness and reflection for the whole family.

, If you expect your child to sacrifice something meaningful, you need to do the same. For example, if he or she is giving up toys, you can give up social media and computer games.

, Read the Bible, pray, and talk about Christianity with your child. Find books about Jesus, Lent, and Easter that are written for children, and make the concepts interesting for your child – consider, for example, acting out key events.

, As a family, use your hands to craft crosses, crowns of thorns, and other symbolic projects. Paint and decorate Easter eggs together.

, Fasting does not have to mean tasteless, unappealing food. Prepare something your child likes to encourage acceptance of Lent’s symbols and rituals.

, Let your child decide on an act of kindness and who he or she would like to perform it for. Giving your child an active role will encourage acceptance.

, Don’t present Lent as a period of suffering and sacrifice and pain; emphasize that it is a time of reflection and family moments. Teach the importance of enjoying life and the miracles of resurrection and life after death.

, Offer your child a non-material reward – a special activity, a family game, or a trip to a park, for example – for meeting your expectations during Lent.

, Teach yourself and your children that Lent is supposed to be about becoming better people. These values should last after the rituals of Lent are over.

Leave more time for posed photos than you think you need.,
Keep a “to take” list with you, just in case.,
Ask people to unplug during your ceremony.",How to Plan a Photogenic Wedding," Some people will say that the photographer is the most important vendor at your wedding. While the food, music, and venue may be forgotten, those photos of your big day will last forever, so you want to make sure you get it right. That said, wedding photographers typically charge between $100-300 an hour, so you should work on making room for a professional in your budget if it’s important to you. Here are some things keep in mind when it comes to choosing your wedding photographer:


If you don’t have a huge budget, see if you can find a photographer who is still finding his footing to do it for free. These photographers will offer to take your photos for free because they’re looking to improve their portfolios. Just make sure it’s someone you can trust.
You can also ask a trusted friend or family member who is a skilled photographer to do it for you. Just make sure this person is okay with missing out on the festivities, though.
Check out photographers in your area to see their portfolios to get an idea of what kind of pictures will suit you. Some like to take more funny, coordinated, or posed photos while others stick to a more traditional style.
Start looking 6-8 months in advance at the latest. Photographers get booked up fast, so before you ask them any more questions, see if they’re even available on your wedding date.
Some photographers will let you meet for a trial session; this can give you a better idea of what the photos will look like.
See if the photographer works with partners or a partner. If it’s important for you to get shots of the venue, guests, and ceremony from multiple angles at the same time, then you may need to hire someone who comes with a team. This may be pricier, but you’ll get more of a range of photos.;
, Once you find your photographer, you should take some engagement photos with your spouse-to-be to practice posing, taking pictures, and making memories together. Many photographers offer engagement photos as part of their package, or offer them at a smaller extra charge; even if you think this is corny or not for you, it’ll be a great way to practice getting ready to be photogenic on the big day.


Take your engagement photos several months in advance, so you and your spouse have plenty of time on your hands.
Look over the photos carefully, and see if there are poses you’d like to repeat on the big day, if there are certain angles that are more flattering for you, or if you get a better idea of how to wear your hair for the big day.

, Whether you’re taking tons of photos with your family, just taking pictures with your spouse, or have intricate plans for photos with your bridal party, it’s important to talk it out with the photographer in advance so you know what to expect on the big day. Your wedding day may be a bit overwhelming, and it may be hard to remember exactly what you wanted when you’re on an adrenalin high and feeling like you’re running out of time. Here are some things to consider:


Make sure your photographer knows who will be in all the posed photos. If you want photos of just you and your siblings, or just you and your spouse’s family, make sure you make this clear so you don’t realize you forgot when it’s too late.
If you have funny, cute, or clever ideas of things to do with your bridal party, such as having all the groomsmen lift the bride, or having all the bridesmaids pointing at the groom, make sure you talk about it in advance so you don’t waste time coming up with poses on the big day.

, Many women also like to have the photographer take photos of them getting ready. If you want to do this, then you have to have a plan for exactly what you want to be captured on camera. This can be the bride in her robe, the bride getting her hair and makeup done, an image of the bride’s shoes or dress hanging on a pretty hanger, a picture of the bride and groom’s rings, and so on. Let the photographer know what you want and make sure you have everything ready for the big day.The bride will probably have her bridesmaids in the getting ready photos, too. She should make sure they know what to wear; if she has coordinated outfits for them for this day or wants them to wear the shirts from the bachelorette party, then she should let them know.
Make sure that you save plenty of time for the getting ready photos. Getting ready takes a lot longer than you think, and you want to make sure you actually have time to pose for the camera.
This may be the most nervous the bride feels all day, so it’s important to have everything figured out in advance so the shots can be as photogenic as possible.
You should also decide whether you want your photographer riding to the ceremony location with you. This can make for even more photogenic opportunities, as you await your spouse.

, Of course, your wedding photographer, whether it’s a professional or a close friend with skills, will be responsible for many of the photos at your wedding. However, it can make things more interesting to have friends taking photos with their iPhones, or having your uncle who loves taking pictures to take a few pictures during the reception, too. This can give you more angles into the party and can make for even more photogenic memories.


You can even be cute about it and leave a disposable camera at every table for your guests to play around with. Though you may mostly get selfies of your tipsy guests, you may find a few gems in there, too.
After your wedding, you can email your guests and ask them to upload their photos to a Dropbox or a wedding website, so you can see all of the photos in one place.

, Lighting is crucial for taking the most photogenic pictures possible. Make sure your venue has pretty soft lighting instead of bright, garish lights, and try to make the most of the sun if you’re taking photos outdoors. If your wedding is outdoors, try to plan it for later in the day, so all of the guests aren’t squinting into the sun in their photos. Take advantage of natural light as much as you can and leave as many windows open as possible so the light can fall in easily.


Talk to your photographer about the best lighting, too. He will have ideas about how to take advantage of it.
Have soft candles, lanterns, a fireplace, or any other cute forms of light at your wedding. You can even put little candles in glass jars or use the little fake candles if the venue does not allow them.

, Your venue will play a big role in how photogenic your wedding is. If you’re getting married in a conference hall, then you should dress it up with soft lights and other decorations that make the most of it. If your venue is outdoors, then this can add flavor and brightness to your wedding photos, as long as the weather cooperates. When you’re choosing a venue, the photogenic value should be one of the things you’re looking for.


High ceilings make a difference, too. A venue with low ceilings can make your photos a bit crowded and cramped.
Consider your expected guest count when you choose a venue, too. Though around 10-20% of your guests may not be able to make it, especially if you’re inviting a lot of people from out of town, try not to pick a venue that is barely large enough for the number of guests you expect to invite. Otherwise, your photos may look a bit busy, and it may be harder to isolate the bridge and the groom in some pictures.
Picking an outdoor venue that can give you a view of the sun setting is a big plus, too. If you pick a venue with a nice skyline or wooded background outside of it, then more guests will want to pose for photos, and the photographer can swoop in.
Consider the photogenic value of your food, too. Pick food that will look great on camera and opt for bright salads, colorful desserts, and main courses that don’t look bland or drab on camera.

, Make sure that your table settings are photo-friendly in advance. In general, try not to make everything all one color, like having white tablecloths, white napkins, white chairs, and so on. This may make everything blur together too much. Instead, pick a nice bright or royal color for your tablecloths and make sure that they match the flowers or the centerpieces that you choose for your tables. Make sure that the tables aren’t too busy, either, with name cards or party favors that are too large along with everything else. You want the tables to help the wedding look even more photogenic.


Big floral centerpieces are popular, but try not to get ones that block the view of the guests or keep them from seeing or enjoying the party. You want your photographer to catch their expressions, not the flowers that are blocking half of their faces.

, Many brides choose to have a hair and makeup trial before the big day so they can know what their look will be like and can make adjustments if they don’t like anything. This can help the bride get more comfortable in her more made-up look, learn how to move her hair, and can give her a sense of how to pose for photographs with this new look as well. Though some salons charge extra for this service, it may be worth it if you want to have the most photogenic wedding out there.


The bride should pick a hair and makeup stylist who is willing to listen and to do what she wants, instead of imposing his or her own ideas on her.
Many brides are scared off by the amount of makeup they wear on the big day. While they may not want to look too made up and prefer a natural look, it’s important to have a bit more makeup than normal so that they come out striking in photographs.
Though brides may not typically wear foundation or concealer, it’s important to wear a bit more of this makeup so their faces aren’t shiny in photos.

, Your wedding colors will have an impact on how photogenic your wedding is. Pick tasteful colors that you won’t be sick of ten years from now when you look through those wedding photo albums. While you can chose pink, purple, or any color you want, make sure that it looks nice in the table settings, as part of the bridesmaids’ outfits, and in any other part of the venue where you choose to display the colors.


Some people make a bigger deal out of wedding colors than others. There won’t be anyone forcing you to make the bridal party match or to have matching tablecloths and name cards. In the end, it’s up to you.
Pick colors that are lively and vibrant, such as teal, light green, yellow, or a muted violet. If you pick black, red, or darker colors, then the wedding may look too formal and severe.

, You may not think it matters who sits closest to the front or center of the room, but these people will end up being in more of your photographs. Their reactions will be more prominent during your first dance, your best man’s speech, and overall pictures of the dance floor, so you should think about which guests will make the wedding the most photogenic. This doesn’t mean you should put your prettiest friends in the line of fire, but rather, the ones who will have the most honest, emotional reactions to your wedding.


If you’re really serious about this, then you can place name cards on individual seats, instead of letting the guests choose their own seats at a certain table.

, If you want to have the most photogenic wedding, then you should practice smiling in advance. This can help you have the most natural smile on the big day, decide whether you want to use teeth or no teeth, and to position your face with your chin slightly down instead of up to avoid a double chin. It can just make the big day feel more natural and fun for you.


You don’t have to only smile one way. You can have a big toothy smile, or a more subtle smile, and mix it up as you see fit.

, When it comes to your big day, you may not feel like you can be very relaxed, but you’ll have to do your best to sit back and enjoy the ride if you want to have the most photogenic photos out there. If you know the photographer is taking pictures of you, try not to get self-conscious and to live in the moment, making sure to laugh, talk to your guests, dance, and have the best night of your life. Remind yourself that not every photo has to be perfect and since you’ll have so many photos to choose from, you can just relax and know that your best self will be captured.


If you try too hard to grab your new spouse and look like you’re having the time of your life, it’ll look staged.
Instead, try to get the idea of your photographer out of your head. Pretend like you’re just having the time of your life at another friend’s wedding.

, When you do take your posed photos, try to act as natural as you can with them. You don’t have to look overly eager or happy, but just work on looking like yourself. If you’re taking a silly pose, then have fun with it, and don’t feel the need to look all serious and married-like all the time. This is your day, and if you look like you’re having a good time, it’ll come through in the photos. If you try too hard with the posed photos, they’ll feel forced.


Make sure to pick poses you’re comfortable with so you don’t look too obviously out of your element. If you think the romantic photos are too mushy and not you at all, then say something.

, The first look is when the bride and groom, dressed in their wedding gear, take photos with each other before they say their “I do”s. This typically happens shortly before the ceremony and it gives the bride and groom time to see each other, to be relatively alone, and to have time for pictures before the guests arrive. This can help you take more photogenic photos because you won’t be taking these photos during the cocktail hour instead, rushing to get back to your guests, and you’ll also naturally be overwhelmed with emotion when you see your future spouse all dressed up.


Some people who are more traditional are opposed to their first look because they want to see their spouse for the first time when they’re on the altar. This can certainly make for a more emotional moment, but it may not lead to as many photogenic memories.

, You may think that you only need 30 minutes for posed photos, but you should make more time for them just in case. You never know what can happen, like if one of the bridesmaids forgot her shoes at the hotel, or your hair took an hour longer than expected, and you need to account for any wiggle room to make sure you get all of the photos you want. If you only stick to a very short time frame, then you may be rushing through the photos and you won’t have as much time as you want to make the wedding as photogenic as possible.


If you’re taking posed photos before the wedding, make sure your family, bridal party members, or anyone else who has to be there is there at least 15 minutes in advance. You don’t want to lose time because you’re waiting on a tardy groomsman.

, You don’t want to leave your wedding realizing you never took a photo with all of your friends from your sorority or high school. You may be too overwhelmed to remember which photo combos you want on the big day, so you should tell your photographer if you want to take any group photos during the actual wedding so that he keeps you in line. You can also keep a private list for yourself to glance at, just to make sure you have a photo with each of your best friends, with your cousins, or with your grandfather.


This can make your wedding as photogenic as possible because you’ll have photos with all of the combinations of people you want to be with.

, Though you may think it’s tacky, a lot of people are starting to ask their wedding guests to turn off their cell phones or to put away their cameras during the ceremony. This is because you don’t want your photographer to have photos of thirty people in the front row, acting like paparazzi while you’re trying to say your vows. Your officiant can even give people a minute to take pictures before moving the ceremony along. If you want those ceremony to be as gorgeous as possible, then you should minimize the number of amateur photographers there.


You should also decide how close you want the photographer to get during the ceremony. Having him a little further away may make the ceremony look and feel a bit more intimate.

Practice the palmar hand grasp.,
Promote object grasping.,
Encourage self-feeding.,
Help your child rake objects.",How to Encourage Your Baby to Build Finger Muscles1," From birth, your newborn will have a reflexive ability called the palmar hand reflex. This means that when you put an object into your newborn's palm, it will instinctively wrap its fingers around that object. However, after about three to four months, those reflexes go away.You can help encourage your child to develop a palmar hand grasp as the palmar reflex disappears.


Put your finger against your baby's palm. Your baby should curl their fingers around your finger.
Continue doing this on a regular basis, even as the reflex disappears.
If your baby has a hard time controlling finger grip, try gently guiding your baby's fingers with your other hand to wrap around your finger.;
, After about three months, your baby will have lost the reflexive ability to grip. You can help encourage your baby's muscle development by assisting your child in trying to pick up or hold objects.Between three and four months of age, babies will start choosing objects to pick up, though they will not yet be able to do so on their own.
Babies will typically bat at objects that they'd like to pick up. This will be your clue that your baby wants to hold a given object.
Try putting lightweight objects in your baby's hand. A rattle would be an excellent starter object.
Use gentle strokes to touch the backs of your baby's knuckles with the rattle. This should prompt your child to open their hand.Gently place the rattle in your baby's hand and see if your child can hold it for a few seconds. If your baby doesn't have the strength or coordination yet, try gently wrapping your baby's fingers around the rattle to encourage grasping.

, When your baby learns to feed himself or herself, it helps develop fine motor skills and promotes muscle development in the hands. This stage of development should not be rushed too quickly, though. It's important to remember to be patient with your baby and to show them by example if they're struggling to catch on.You can switch your baby from a bottle to a sippy cup at approximately six to nine months of age.Your baby may need you to help them grasp the cup, or you may need to dribble the contents onto their lips before your baby gets the hang of it.
Most babies learn to self-feed with their hands by around 8 to 12 months of age.
Babies can typically learn to use a spoon by 13 to 15 months of age.
Always supervise your baby at all times, especially if they are around food or utensils.

, Raking objects encourages hand use and hand-eye coordination.This task may be difficult, depending on your child's age. Babies typically learn to do this on their own between four and eight months of age, but with a little guidance, your child might be able to learn this skill a little early.


Scatter some toy blocks on the floor in front of your child. Make sure they're large enough that they will not pose a choking hazard.
Gently take your baby's hand and rake the objects towards your child.

Have babies play on their stomachs.,
Teach your baby to move each finger.,
Encourage poking holes in clay.",How to Encourage Your Baby to Build Finger Muscles2," Babies may not be able to lift themselves up yet, but it's important to encourage that skill. You can do this by having your baby spend some time playing on their stomach. You can start having your baby play on their stomach as early as zero to three months of age, though you'll still need to closely supervise your baby at all times.By having your baby play on their stomach, you'll help your child develop muscles in the hands, arms, and shoulders.
All of the muscles worked while lifting off the floor are essential muscle groups needed to develop gripping and hand use.
Once your baby is around four months old, you can begin having them play in different positions. Learning to play in different positions, like on the baby's side, helps build strength and develop motor skills.

, Operating individual fingers is a somewhat advanced skill for babies. Children under 10 months of age may not be able to move individual fingers on their own. However, you can try this activity to show your baby that each finger can move.Gather yarn in several different colors.
Tie short strands of yarn onto each finger. It should be slightly snug but not tight at all.
Make sure there are no repeat colors directly next to each other. You want your baby to be able to see that each finger is different.
Slowly and gently lift one finger after another. The goal is for your baby to see each finger move independent from the rest and understand that each finger has that ability.

, Once your baby understands that individual fingers can move independently, you can continue that muscle strength by encouraging clay play. Your baby may already have experience playing with playdough; poking holes in dough or clay will help your child learn how to operate each individual finger.Roll some clay out flat and give it to your child. You can encourage poking by gently guiding your baby's fingers to the clay.
This activity may be difficult for babies under the age of 10 months. However, you can start your baby early and teach how to poke even if your baby can't do it independently yet.

Buy a baby gym.,
Play hand games.,
Offer blocks.,
Draw with crayons.,
Provide sandbox toys.,
Use finger paint.,
Solve easy puzzles.",How to Encourage Your Baby to Build Finger Muscles3," Baby gyms are a great way to develop hand-eye coordination. The dangling toys encourage hand-eye coordination and stimulate your baby's sense of curiosity.Lay your baby under the arch of the baby gym and encourage your child to bat at the hanging toys.
If your baby has a hard time figuring out how to bat at the toys, try gently taking your baby's hand and guiding it to the toys hanging overhead.
As your baby's skills develop, you can advance to more complex toys. For example, you may want to try pegboards or stacking rings once the baby gym is no longer useful., Hand games are a great way to play with and teach your baby. Most hand games involve synchronized vocal and hand movements, which can be tremendously helpful in teaching your baby coordination and hand strength.Pat a Cake (also known as Patty Cake) is a classic hand game that develops hand-eye coordination.
Clap hands in a criss-cross motion, then teach your child to mime rolling, patting, and marking dough with your hands.You can also teach the Itsy Bitsy Spider. Children find the sing-song lyrics fun, and the hand motions that mimic a spider's movement encourage muscle growth and hand-eye coordination.

, Stacking and moving blocks can be a great muscle builder that also develops hand-eye coordination. You might need to help your baby, as your child may struggle with lifting or putting down objects at this point.Make sure the blocks are big enough that your baby will be able to grasp them.
Never give your baby small blocks. Anything small enough to fit in your baby's mouth poses a choking hazard.

, Drawing with crayons or markers helps your child develop muscle strength and learn hand-eye coordination.Most infants will only be able to grip writing/drawing instruments with their entire fist. This is normal; your baby's skills will be very clumsy at first.Buy large, thick crayons or markers for your child. Remember that your baby will only be able to grip the drawing instrument with an entire fist, so it needs to be easy to grasp.

, Playing in the sand can provide endless fun for young children. By providing simple tools like spoons, spatulas, cups, and cookie cutters, you'll be able to turn that play time into an opportunity to develop hand strength and a broader range of motion.If you don't have a sandbox at home you can bring these toys with you to the beach and have your child play on the shore.
You can also give your child natural materials to play with in the sand. These include large pieces of bark and branches that aren't sharp/pointy.

, Finger painting is a fun (though messy) activity. Kids enjoy creating colorful works of art, while the physical actions involved in finger painting help strengthen the muscles in each individual finger and promote hand-eye coordination.Be sure to provide paper for your child to paint on.
Put down plenty of newspaper to minimize the ensuing mess.
Encourage your child to paint by gently taking one hand, dipping it into a paint, and smearing it across the page. It may take some practice, but your child will eventually get the hang of it.

, Puzzles are a great way to teach your baby hand-eye coordination and spatial reasoning while also developing hand muscles. You can purchase simple, easy puzzles for infants at most toy stores or through an online retailer.Buy simple jigsaw puzzles that only have five or so large pieces.
Show your baby how to pick them up and put them into the frame.
Help your child figure out how to connect the pieces.

Present gifts to wedding attendants and family.",How to Plan a Rehearsal Dinner," The rehearsal dinner is usually held the night before the wedding. The time is dependent upon the wedding ceremony rehearsal. Most rehearsal dinners immediately follow the wedding ceremony practice, but they also may be held before the rehearsal.;
, Traditionally, the parents of the groom pay for and host the rehearsal dinner. However, like many wedding traditions, this isn't always the case. Often times, the bridal couple pays for the rehearsal dinner or the two families split the cost. The budget should include costs for the venue, food and beverages as well as decorations, flowers and place cards, as applicable.

, The rehearsal dinner is a way for the bride and groom to thank everyone who assisted with the wedding planning or wedding ceremony, so the guest list will vary. In general, the guest list for the rehearsal dinner should include the wedding party and their dates or spouses, the immediate families of the bride and groom, the officiant and his spouse, readers and musicians. If children are involved in the ceremony, they should be invited along with their parents. If there is a wedding coordinator or other people who have helped with the wedding, invite them as well. Depending on your budget, you may wish to invite extended family and out-of-town guests.

, Select a location that best suits your budget. Rehearsal dinners can be formal dinners at restaurants, or casual meals at someone's home. Be creative with your choice of venue and menu, and allow it to reflect your taste as a couple. Some ideas are a clambake on the beach, a backyard barbecue, a picnic at a park, or Chinese food at a family member's home. The rehearsal dinner could also be centered around an activity like a wine tasting, miniature golf, boat cruise or museum tour.

, Purchase invitations from a local printer, order them online or make your own invitations. Make sure the invitations reflect the style of the rehearsal dinner.

, If you would like flowers, table centerpieces or other decorations for the rehearsal dinner, order them 4 weeks before the event. Avoid selecting flowers that are the same as the wedding flowers. If budget is a concern, make decorations or use photos as table centerpieces.

, If the rehearsal dinner is a formal event, it is a good idea to have place cards at each seat. Place cards can also be helpful at casual events to encourage people to get to know one another.

, Traditionally, the father of the groom is the host of the rehearsal dinner and should offer a toast after dinner. If the rehearsal dinner is not hosted by the groom's family, the bride and groom may offer a toast to their families, friends and those who are making their wedding a special day.

, Many couples present gifts to the bridal party at the rehearsal dinner. They may also give gifts to family members or other people who were an integral part of the wedding planning.

Finalize the adoption.",How to Put a Child up for Adoption," As the birth parent of a child, you have a set of legal and moral rights. The courts have repeatedly held that it is a fundamental liberty to raise your child as you wish. You have the right to a relationship with your child and to direct her educational, moral, and religious upbringing.You have a reciprocal responsibility to provide the financial and material support your child needs to be housed, clothed, and fed. As the parent, you also have a moral responsibility to provide a safe and nurturing environment for your child.;
, Knowing your rights and responsibilities, an unplanned pregnancy or inability to care for a child is a stressful and emotional time.Before you make a decision, you should examine and consider your options. Adoption should be approached as a permanent decision and that you are doing what is best for you and your child.


Guardianship can be a temporary solution while you establish the emotional and financial resources you need to be a parent. The court awards temporary custody to a family member or other agreed party. You retain your parental rights and contribute to the child's financial support while the guardian handles the day-to-day job of child-raising. The guardianship can be dissolved by the court when you can prove yourself fit and ready to be a parent.Kinship adoption can be a permanent solution that keeps your child in the family and lets you maintain a relationship with her. Instead of a stranger, your child is adopted by the grandparents or other close relative. This type of voluntary in-family adoption can be handled by a private attorney in a very short time. Procedures, including home studies, are often less stringent or waived.Open adoptions allow the birth parents to interact with the child and adoptive family. In an open adoption, even though you surrender your legal rights, you can play a bigger part in choosing the adoptive family and express your wishes on how the child will be raised. An open adoption also lets your family have limited participation through letters, gifts, and even visits. The adoptive family must consent to an open adoption.Traditional or closed adoption. In the traditional adoption, the birth parents have little to no input or contact with the adoptive family and the records are sealed. This type of adoption offers the most privacy and can give the birth parents a sense of closure and the ability to move on after making the difficult decision., Unless the court is involved, the choice to give your baby or older child up for adoption is ultimately yours. You need to think clearly and not allow others to pressure you into a decision.


Consider speaking to a counselor to talk about your emotions surrounding the decision. Depending on your circumstances, you may want to continue with therapy after you make your choice.
Speak with other birth mothers to understand what a birth mother may experience post-placement. This will help you relax and find peace with your decision.
If you have any questions or doubts about your parental rights and responsibilities, you should have a discussion with a family law attorney.

In a court case where your child may be in foster care, you have the right to legal counsel. You can discuss the possibility of adoption with your lawyer.
The process will go smoother and faster if the other parent consents. If it is practical and safe, you should discuss your decision with the other birth parent.

, After the decision to adopt, choosing an agency is the next most important choice you will make. Like having a good lawyer or other professional in your corner, a qualified adoption agency can lessen the stress of a difficult situation. Adoption agencies vet adoptive families and match them with birth mothers and children. They handle the home studies and other legal requirements and act as the go-between with adoption attorneys and the court system. In some cases, they even arrange foster care for infants abandoned by the birth parents.


State law regulates adoption agencies. In order to be licensed, the agency must meet stringent requirements. The state will look at staff, training, programs, facilities, and insurance.Professional associations, such as the American Academy of Adoption Attorneys, and child welfare organizations maintain directories of licensed adoption agencies., You want an adoption agency that has the skills, contacts, and programs to provide the services needed to match your baby with the best possible home. Doing your research before you enter into an agreement can lessen your stress.


Check the agency's website. This will give you a snapshot of the agency's operations. The site should include contact information, licensing information, professional accreditation, mission statement information, and information for both birth parents and adoptive parents.Do an online search with the name of the agency and ""review"", ""scam"", and ""complaint."" Read the reviews and testimonials carefully. A single complaint may not disqualify an agency, but a large number or similar complaints should be a warning.
Contact a local parent or adoption support group. You can find groups through online searches, resources at your obstetrician's office, or through a professional organization such as the North American Council on Adoptable Children.Groups can range from public and private forums to groups that hold physical meetings. Find a group that gives you the information you need and meets your level of comfort and privacy.

, Some agencies may offer a phone consultation, others may insist on an in-person appointment or request that you fill out a preliminary application. Write out your questions before you have your appointment and be prepared to take notes.


Verify licensing. Ask about the agency's licensing and accreditation and that it is current.
Ask about open and closed adoptions. You want an agency that is in line with your own wishes. Even in a closed adoption, information like family medical history will be available to the adoptive parents. After that, as much or little information can be shared by agreement of the parties.
If it is important to you that your child be placed with a family of the same race or religion, now is the time to ask about the agency's philosophies on the matter.
Ask about financial support. No birth mother is allowed to ""sell"" her baby. However, state laws do provide for some financial support during the pregnancy and assistance with medical expenses. Laws vary with most states being ""reasonable and customary"" expenses. A few states put a dollar limit ranging from $1,000 to $5,000.Ask about references and testimonials. While the agency cannot reveal private information, many parents will have consented to let the agency tell their stories. While the picture will be skewed toward the positive, it can give you an indication of the kind of families the agency works with.
Ask about your right to revoke consent to the adoption. This can be as difficult a decision as choosing to put your child up for adoption. Most states have a very short window where you have a right to change your mind. Ask the agency if they have a set procedure for revocation. Laws are different in every state., After you have chosen an agency that is right for you and your baby, it is your duty to cooperate with the rules and procedures. Depending on where you are in your pregnancy or if this is an older child, the agency will set up a timeline for the adoption.


If this is to be an open adoption, you may be allowed to look over profiles of adoptive families and choose those that match your hopes and expectations for your child.
If you are pregnant, follow through with your medical care and doctor's orders. Act in the best interest of your child.

, You will have to give the agency all the information you have about your partner. Do not lie or withhold information. If you say you don't know who the father is or where the other parent is, the court may act accordingly in granting the adoption. However, if the birth parent comes forward and refutes this, the adoption could potentially be cancelled and you could be held in contempt for lying to the court.


The agency will try to get the other birth parent to consent or serve him or her with notice of the adoption hearing.
Specifically, if a birth father wants to contest the adoption, he must acknowledge paternity, prove he has (or intended to) have a relationship with the child, and be prepared to provide support. He will have to have his own attorney and your interests will be represented by the agency's attorney. Cooperate and provide any information that is requested.

, If you are pregnant, you will typically not give consent until the child has been safely delivered. Most states have a waiting period, to give you time to recover from the birth and not be under the influence of pain medication. The waiting period can be as short as 12 hours or up to 15 days. The typical waiting period is 24 to 48 hours. Consent documents will be signed in front of a notary or a judge.Even if you have been working with an agency, you have a right to consult with an independent attorney before you sign the consent forms.
Once you sign the consent forms, the decision is considered permanent unless you revoke during the very limited window or can prove your signature was obtained under fraud or duress.

, Once you sign the consent forms, your participation is complete. Stay in touch with the agency to be aware of the adoption timeline and that it was completed without incident. If the adoption is open, you can receive more detailed information about the procedure and finalization.


The agency should have after-care programs, such as counseling to help you recover for the birth and the surrender of the child. If not, consider seeking independent counseling.

Identify the appropriate agency in your state.,
Attend a free information meeting.,
Complete your initial application.,
Attend any required training courses.,
Get your home study done.,
Be prepared to wait.",How to Locate a Baby in Infant Adoption1," Your state will have a children's services or human services agency that handles foster care and adoptions. Using a state agency typically is cheaper than other methods, but may have drawbacks.For example, in many states you can only use a public agency if you are able and willing to adopt a child with special needs.
Additionally, the vast majority of children available through the state's public agency tend to be older. Typically these children become available for adoption after spending time in the foster care system.
You typically can find the name of your state's agency online. The agency's website will have information on how to become an adoptive parent, as well as agency office locations.;
, Most state agencies offer meetings that provide free information for people interested in becoming an adoptive or licensed foster parent. The date, time, and location of these meetings may be publicly available, or you may have to speak to a caseworker first.In some states, you must complete a brief form with your name and contact information. A caseworker will then contact you within a few days to assess your needs and interests.
Informational meetings typically are general purpose meetings designed to introduce both prospective adoptive and foster parents to the system.
Bring paper and a pen or pencil with you to the meeting so you can take notes. The meeting typically closes with a question-and-answer session, so if there's something you don't understand you can ask then.

, Your state child services department typically will have a written application you can fill out to start the process of applying to adopt a child. This initial application is used to determine whether you meet the basic eligibility requirements.The application typically requires information about you, your partner, and any other adults or children living in your house. If you are a single person living alone, don't worry – you're still eligible to adopt a child on your own.
You also must provide information about your household income, including your employment and job history.
The agency may require you to submit various documents, such as tax returns or paycheck stubs, that support the information you provided in your application.
You also will need to present identification and proof of your age. Every state requires adoptive parents to be at least a certain minimum age. Some states also have a maximum age for people who want to adopt infants.

, Most states require prospective adoptive parents to complete several hours of parenting classes. These classes help prepare you for raising a child as well as giving you more information about the state adoption process.Keep in mind that since most children available for adoption from a public agency come through the state foster care system, many states require you to be licensed as foster parents before you can adopt a child.
Even if you aren't required to complete the licensing program for foster care, you still should expect to complete around 20 hours of parenting training.
The courses are provided by the state, and usually are free or have a small fee associated with them.

, Your state's child services agency typically requires you to complete a home study before you are approved to adopt. During the home study, a caseworker will evaluate your home to determine whether you're ready to care for a child.Your caseworker will visit your home and interview all adults who live in your household. If you have children, your caseworker may also talk to them.
Before your home study, your caseworker typically will provide you with a list of documents you need to gather, such as marriage and birth certificates or divorce decrees.
The caseworker will conduct an in-depth evaluation of your home life and personal history, and may visit your home more than once over the course of the investigation.
It's common to get anxious about a home study – after all, it's not every day someone digs through your life and personal history. But keep in mind that caseworkers aren't trying to find reasons to eliminate you. They'll do everything they can to get you ready and help you work through any snags in the approval process.

, Infants are rarely available for adoption through state agencies, and the wait list of individuals and couples who want an infant can be lengthy. If you attempt to locate a baby to adopt solely through a state agency, you should be prepared to wait months, if not years.Expect your caseworker to be up front with you about the length of time it will take to have an infant placed in your home.
You also may want to explore whether you're open to taking older children. For example, it might be easier for you to find a child if you expanded your search to children under four rather than just infants.
Generally, the more preferences you have, the longer you can expect it to take to find your child. For example, a couple looking to adopt a Caucasian male infant may have to wait a lot longer than another couple who also wants an infant but doesn't care about the baby's race or gender.

Complete your home study and parent education.,
Receive information on possible matches.",How to Locate a Baby in Infant Adoption2," Your state's child services agencies may have a list of private agencies that are licensed with the state to handle the adoption of children and infants. You also want to check the background and reputation of any agency you plan to use.The U.S. Department of Health & Human Services has a national directory of adoption agencies online at www.childwelfare.gov/nfcad/.
Individual private agencies typically have their own websites with more information about their eligibility requirements and the process of adoption.
Rules for private agencies differ from state to state. Keep in mind that in some states, if you want to adopt an infant who has not been identified as having special needs, you may have no choice but to go through a private agency.

, Private agencies have their own eligibility requirements for adoptive parents that may differ from the state's requirements. Typically, private agencies are more selective, and may have stricter criteria.Because private agencies are more selective, they tend to have shorter wait times. However, if you want an infant you still should expect to wait several months after you've been approved.
At a minimum, the private agency will have eligibility requirements similar to the state requirements.
For example, if your state requires adoptive parents to be over the age of 25 and you are 23, you probably won't be able to adopt through a private agency in your state until you are 25.

, Adopting a child through a private agency can cost anywhere from a few thousand dollars to upwards of $10,000. Many states offer grants and other financial assistance to help prospective adoptive parents with limited funds.However, while grants and financial aid may help with the costs associated with adopting through a private agency, don't expect them to cover all or even most of your adoption expenses.
Most private agencies do have payment plans, and some have sliding-fee scales depending on your household income.
You also may be able to take out a loan to cover initial adoption-related expenses. Some employers even have programs to reimburse some of the costs associated with adoption.

, Private agencies typically hold regular informational meetings where you can learn more about the agency and its services. You'll also have the opportunity to talk to staff, as well as other adoptive parents.The meeting will explain the agency's mission and adoption procedures, as well as discussing the roles and responsibilities you will take on as adoptive parents.
In addition to staff, the agency may have parents who've adopted children through the agency give short presentations about their experiences or answer any questions.
Take notes during the presentation in case there are any questions you have. If you have extensive concerns, you may want to consider speaking to a caseworker privately after the meeting is over.

, Just as with the state agency, you must fill out a written application to initiate the process of being approved for adoption. This application typically must be accompanied by a check or money order for all or part of the agency's fees.The agency will give you forms to fill out, along with a list of any supporting documentation required.
Keep in mind that you will need to provide detailed information about yourself and your partner, as well as any adults or children who live with you (even part-time).
You don't have to be wealthy to adopt a child from a private agency, and you won't be turned away solely because you have limited income or assets.
However, the agency will want to verify that you have the financial means to take care of the people already in your household, as well as the additional expense of a new baby.

, Just as with the state agency, any private agency typically must complete a home study before you are approved to adopt. Some private agencies may accept a state home study report, if you've already had one completed.Other private agencies will want to conduct their own home study, even if you've already had one through your state agency. Some of these private agencies have more extensive requirements than state agencies.
Private agencies charge a fee for the home study, typically a few thousand dollars. The fee covers the time the caseworker spends evaluating your home, interviewing people, and conducting criminal and employment background checks.
Expect to pay fees for your training classes as well. Many private agencies offer their own classes

, If the agency approves you as a prospective adoptive family, you typically will complete a family profile that identifies characteristics of the infant you hope to adopt. When a child matching those characteristics comes through the agency, your caseworker will let you know.One of the benefits of a private agency is that they may have access to children available in other states. This broader pool can mean a shorter wait time.
The process of placing an infant may differ from that of placing an older child. Typically with an older child there will be more meetings before the child ultimately comes to live with you for good.
The process also may differ depending on whether the agency does open or closed adoptions.
With an open adoption, you get to know the child's birth family. In some instances, this may mean you have an opportunity to meet the birth mother while she is pregnant. Some agencies also give the birth mother a choice in the family that will adopt her child.

Talk to friends and family.,
Work through a religious organization.,
Place an advertisement.,
Search for an adoption facilitator.,
Consider surrogacy.",How to Locate a Baby in Infant Adoption3," To adopt a child, you don't technically have to use either a public or private agency. Tell everyone you know that you want to adopt an infant, and you may find a pregnant woman who is thinking about giving her baby up for adoption.If you know any obstetricians or pediatricians, they may know of pregnant women who are considering giving their baby up for adoption.
Adoption attorneys also can be good sources for private adoption. One benefit of an attorneys that they will be familiar with the laws in your state and can insure that the adoption is legal.
Keep in mind that there's often more to adopting a baby than simply finding a pregnant woman who wants to give her baby up for adoption.
If you happen to make a private connection directly with a birth mother, contact a licensed attorney who specializes in adoption law to find out what you need to do.

, If you are a member of a particular religion, you may be able to find adoption assistance through your church, mosque, synagogue, or temple. There also are nonprofit organizations with religious affiliations that are licensed to arrange adoptions.You may feel more comfortable adopting a child through your own church, but keep in mind that many religious organizations do not require you to be a follower of their faith to register as a prospective adoptive parent.
Religious organizations that place infants and children for adoption typically are licensed by the state and will have similar eligibility and application requirements to public and private adoption agencies.

, Some parents who want to adopt a baby find luck in posting advertisements in newspapers, magazines, or even online. By going this route, you have the utmost control over the baby you adopt for minimal costs (compared to private agency adoption). However, you may lack important legal protections.Many states do not permit adoption advertisements, and those that do may restrict the practice. Check your state's law or talk to an adoption attorney before you place an advertisement.
Arranging an adoption independently allows you to hand-select the birth mother and control all aspects of the adoption. However, it also can be just as expensive as going through a private agency.
If you are planning on adopting an infant with your partner, talk to them before you place the ad to set guidelines as a couple. You also need to look at your finances.
For example, many independent adoptions will require you to cover the mother's hospital expenses, and even some of her living expenses, while she is pregnant.

, Adoption facilitators help match prospective parents with birth mothers. Because facilitators are unlicensed and unregulated, their services are illegal in some states. However, if facilitators are permitted in your state, they can help you locate a baby.In states that allow adoption facilitators, adoption attorneys often take on this role. Hiring an attorney in this situation can work well for you because they also will complete all the necessary contracts and court papers to finalize the adoption.
If you decide to work with a facilitator, check their background thoroughly before you give them any money.
Since facilitators are not regulated by the state, you have to do a lot more work to make sure you're not just handing money to someone who is dishonest or unscrupulous.

, With surrogacy, you contract with a woman to carry a baby to term that you immediately adopt. This baby may be genetically related to you or your partner, in which case only one of you has to adopt the child.Traditionally, a surrogate carries the genetic offspring of one or both partners. However, surrogate mothers also may carry a child conceived through artificial insemination from an unrelated sperm donor.
If you're contemplating surrogacy, consult an attorney. The laws governing surrogacy are complex, and vary widely among states.

Locate the proper court.,
Get the proper forms.,
File your forms and attend a hearing if necessary.",How to Open Adoption Records in California4," You can ask a court to order the release of your original birth certificate. To do so, you must file a petition under one of two codes sections: Health and Safety Code Section 102705, or Family Code Section 9200. If you are petitioning under the Health and Safety Code, you can file your petition in the county where you live, or in the county where the adoption was finalized. If you are petitioning under the Family Code, you must file your petition in the county where the adoption was granted., Different counties in California use different forms for these types of requests. Contact your court clerk to find out exactly which forms you should use for a petition in your county. You will be required to provide identifying information about yourself and the adoption proceeding. You must also give the reasons why you are requesting the birth certificate.The court can deny your request if it determines that your interest in obtaining the birth certificate is outweighed by the privacy interests of the adoptee or the birth parents.


For example, San Mateo County uses a form called ""Adopt-10"" (https://www.sanmateocourt.org/documents/forms_and_filing/adopt-10.pdf) for Health and Safety Code requests, while Ventura County uses a form called ""VN200"" (http://www.ventura.courts.ca.gov/local_forms/VN200.pdf) for requests under the Health and Safety and Family Codes.

, Take your forms to the court clerk, who will assist you with the filing. You may be charged a filing fee. The clerk will inform you whether you will need return to court for a hearing. Otherwise, the judge will review your petition and grant or deny it. The court clerk will inform you of the court's decision.


If you cannot afford to pay the filing fee, ask the clerk for information on how to file an application for a fee waiver.

Make a written request.,
Have your signature notarized.,
Mail your request.",How to Open Adoption Records in California5," You can make a written request for certain non-identifying background information about your birth parents and the adoption. This information may include: date and place of birth, age and physical description of parents, race, ethnicity, religion, medical history, education level, occupation, and the existence of other children born to those parents.In your request, include your name, birth date, and the full names of both of your adoptive parents.Type or legibly handwrite your request.

Check national websites.,
Evaluate the available methods of adoption.,
Find an adoption agency near you.,
Review eligibility criteria.",How to Research Adoption on the Internet1," The federal government has adoption resources available, primarily through the U.S. Children's Bureau's AdoptUSKids program. On these websites, you can find detailed information about adopting a child.The AdoptUSKids website at adoptuskids.org is a good place to start if you want to research adoption on the internet. This website has national as well as state-specific information about the adoption process.
Follow links to read information from your state adoption agency as well as private adoption agencies that operate in your area.
You also can learn more about the types of children usually available to adopt, including their ages and backgrounds. Use this information to guide your considerations of the type of child you would like to adopt.
Another good website to research is adoption.com. The website has numerous guides on adoption, including international adoption. You also can look at forums where other adoptive and potential adoptive parents are discussing the adoption process.;
, Depending on where you live, there typically are numerous ways in which you can adopt a child – through a public agency, through a private agency, through a church, or even directly with the child's birth mother.Take a good luck at your family finances and determine your adoption budget. From there you should be able to identify methods that would best fit into your budget.
If there are any other concerns that affect your method of adoption, make note of those as well. For example, if it is important to you that the birth mother shares your faith, you may prefer to adopt through a church or religious organization rather than a public agency.
Different methods also have different timeframes. Consider how long you are willing to wait to finalize the adoption as you look at the methods available to you.
The relationship the birth mother has to the child is another important issue in adoption. Some states and agencies favor open adoption, in which the birth mother knows and has access to the adoptive parents, and the adopted child can contact their birth mother. Other states and agencies work under a closed system.
If you want to adopt a child directly from their birth mother, there are some states in which you are legally allowed to do this. Research the process online by looking at information on the websites of attorneys who serve as facilitators to arrange direct adoptions.

, Public and private adoption agencies typically have a website that explains more about their services and the resources they have available for prospective adoptive parents.You can find adoption agencies at adoptuskids.org or by searching for ""adoption agencies"" with the name of your state.
Keep in mind that while you can adopt a child who lives in a different state, you may have to go through a different process than if you adopt a child from within the state.
On an adoption agency's website, you can learn more about that agency's process, fees, and post-adoptive resources.
If you find an adoption agency in which you're interested, you often can fill out a preliminary application online to get further information or make an appointment to speak with a counselor or caseworker about becoming an adoptive parent.

, State government agencies and private adoption agencies have specific criteria that prospective parents must meet before they can be considered to adopt a child. You can research these criteria online.You typically must have identification and personal documents available for review when you complete your adoption application. By researching ahead of time, you can find out what documents you'll need and gather them together.
Looking at eligibility criteria ahead of time allows you to prepare your family for the application and home study process. Unless you do a direct, private adoption, you will need to complete a home study. Some states legally require a home study regardless of how you adopt your child.
Home studies can be intense and intrusive if you don't understand the caseworker's role in the process or the types of questions you'll be asked. Doing advanced research online can help you learn what will be expected of you and your family.

Review listings of available children.,
Compare adoption providers.,
Conduct thorough background checks of adoption providers.,
Make sure a particular adoption method is legal in your state.",How to Research Adoption on the Internet2," Many adoption agencies and services have online directories of children available for adoption. While many of the children listed may find permanent homes before you complete the process, these listings still give you a good idea of the types of children typically available through that agency.For example, if you want to adopt an infant, you can look at children available to see if the agency or service has any infants listed.
Many state agencies have listings that include a detailed profile of the children available, including not only their ages and genders but also their likes and dislikes. Especially if you want to adopt an older child, this can help you best find a child who would fit into your family.
For example, if your family is very active and spends a lot of time outdoors, you might want to look for a child who enjoys the outdoors.

, Adoption agencies can differ significantly in the services they provide, the types of children they have available for adoption, as well as the fees they charge for their services.Researching these issues on the internet before you contact the adoption agency allows you to evaluate them on your own time and find the agency that will work best for you without making a commitment to any one agency.
Private agencies must meet the state legal requirements regarding home studies and education of potential adoptive parents, so don't assume that you'll get out of a home study if you use a private agency.
One point of comparison is wait times. After you're approved for adoption, you'll have to wait to get matched with a child. Private agencies typically have shorter wait times than state services do, although it depends on the situation and the type of child you want to adopt.
For example, if you want to adopt an infant, you're going to have a longer wait time at either a private or public agency. However, private agencies may have a wait time of several months, while with the state services you could potentially wait years for an infant to become available for adoption.

, Despite the wealth of information that is available, there still are people or groups running adoption scams. Protect yourself and your family by investigating and agency or individual online before you give them any money or information.For example, if an agency asks you for a lot of money up front, they may be a scam. You'll pay an application fee and a home-study fee when you sign up with an agency, but you shouldn't pay anything else.
Scams are more frequent in international adoption than they are in domestic adoption, so be extra careful if you're looking into international adoption. Typically it's better to go with an agency that is based in the United States, rather than in the country from which you want to adopt.

, Not all methods of adoption are allowed in all states. If you adopt a child through illegal means, you run the risk of having the adoption nullified. You also may face possible criminal penalties.For example, in some states you can place an advertisement in the paper or online, find a birth mother, and organize an adoption yourself. However, in many states this isn't legal.
If you have any doubts or concerns about the adoption method you want to use, or a particular adoption agency, contact an attorney who specializes in adoption.
An adoption attorney also can advise you on the best adoption methods and connect you with people or agencies who can best help you, given your situation and the type of child you'd like to adopt.

Visit the USCIS website.,
Review the eligibility requirements for international adoption.,
Decide which countries you're interested in.,
Look into international adoption agencies or facilitators.,
Learn about home study requirements.,
Study the immigration and citizenship process.",How to Research Adoption on the Internet3," The website for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has a section devoted to international adoption information and the process you must go through to adopt a child from another country and get U.S. citizenship for that child.The USCIS refers to these adoptions as ""intercountry adoptions."" Using that term in your internet research may yield better results. You may want to start your research at uscis.gov/adoption.
The State Department also has information online about international adoption. You also can find other information there about international travel, such as if you were planning to travel to the child's country of origin to meet the child.
Through your research, you can learn more about the immigration requirements so you can better prepare for the adoption process. For example, there may be documents and information you need to gather to make the background check and home-study process move more smoothly.

, The USCIS is responsible for evaluating prospective adoptive parents and determining whether you are eligible to adopt a child from another country. Researching these requirements on the internet ahead of time can make this process easier.If you want to adopt a child from a foreign country, you must first file an application with the USCIS. You can download this application, Form I-800A, from either the USCIS or State Department website.Look at this application so you can plan ahead of time and gather the information you'll need.
Keep in mind that you must complete this application and have it approved by USCIS before you accept a placement. You also must refrain from talking to anyone who is responsible for caring for the child. If you intend to use a particular adoption service provider, such as an adoption agency, you must provide the name of the agency and contact information on your application.
The application requires basic contact and background information about you and your spouse (if you're married).
As part of the application, you also must provide a home-study report. In some circumstances, you can get your state to complete an adoption home study and send the report directly to USCIS. Check with your state service to find out if your state sends this report or if you would have to send it yourself.

, You potentially must follow a different adoption process, depending on the country from which you want to adopt a child. Researching the countries where children are available for U.S. adoption can help you understand more about how you would adopt that child.There are two basic processes. If the country is a member of the Hague Convention, you follow the process set forth in that treaty. Otherwise, you use the non-Hague Orphan Adoptions process and guidelines.
If you already had several countries in mind before conducting your research, learning more about these processes may help you narrow down your list.
Keep in mind that adopting a child from another country implicates the laws of your state, the federal government, and the laws of the child's country of origin, as well as international laws and treaties.

, The process for adopting a child from another country is complicated. An international adoption agency or adoption facilitator such as an adoption attorney can make the process easier for you.Conducting internet research on your own can help you understand the process, but doing research on your own in this complicated area can often result in more questions than answers.
Keep in mind that an international adoption potentially implicates state and federal law in the U.S., the laws of the child's country of origin, and international laws and treaties. These laws can intersect and interact with each others in ways that make the process seem confusing or redundant.
Often, there is a specific order in which the various steps must be done and applications completed or approved. Doing something out of order can result in a denial or extensive delay. For this reason, it typically is best to have someone on your side who has experience completing international adoptions.

, If you want to adopt a child from another country, you must comply with the home-study requirements set forth in international law. You can research these requirements online so you're prepared for the process before you start.Whoever completes your home study must be licensed or authorized to conduct home studies under the definitions of the Hague Convention. State adoption services and most private accredited adoption agencies typically are approved.
A home study for an international adoption may have greater interview requirements than if the home study is completed for domestic adoption. Keep this in mind especially if you've already had a home study completed.
When you get your home study completed, it must be submitted to the USCIS within six months of completion. If you delay any longer, you'll have to get another home study done. Do all the research you need to do to prepare for your home study before you schedule one, so that when the process starts you have everything ready.
In addition to reading about home study requirements on the USCIS website, public and private agencies also may have information that you can review in advance on their websites.

, In some situations, a child you adopt from another country will not be granted U.S. citizenship automatically. Generally, this depends on the age of the child and where the adoption takes place.There are particular visa types that you must complete, depending on whether the adoption takes place in the U.S. or in the child's country of origin. Researching these visa types on the internet before you begin the adoption process can ensure that no mistakes are made.
You can read about these visas on the USCIS website, and also download copies of the visa applications so you understand the information that must be included.
Learning about required visas and documentation in advance also can help you ensure that your adopted child automatically becomes a U.S. citizen, rather than having to wait or go through the naturalization process.

Get counseling, if necessary.",How to Put Your Child Up for Adoption," There are many reasons why someone wants to put a child up for adoption, and no one can tell you whether or not it is a good idea do so. However, you should take some time to clarify why you want to put the child up for adoption. Sometimes, people are overwhelmed with responsibilities and feel that they have no choice but to give up a child. A little reflection should reveal whether you truly want to go ahead with the adoption.


Think about what it would take for you not to give the child up. Do you need more money? Would it help to have another person in the home to take care of your children? If you can identify something that is obtainable, then you might want to seek out financial or familial support instead of giving the child up.
Clear your head and think over your decision. You don’t need to rush into anything. Write down your reasons and revisit them to make sure you still feel the same way throughout the adoption process.
There is no right or wrong reason to give a child up for adoption. Putting a child up for adoption doesn’t mean you love him or her any less.With “open adoption” available today, there is also no reason why you can’t visit or hear from the child after adoption.;
, In an open adoption, the birth parents and the adoptive parents share identifying information with each other. This means that you will know the names of the people who adopt your child.With an open adoption, you and the adoptive parents can agree that you will maintain a presence in the child’s life. For example, you might agree to visitation or to receiving letters from the child.


A closed, or “traditional” adoption, is different. No identifying information is passed between the birth parents and the adoptive families.You therefore will not be able to track down the adoptive parents or your child at a later date.
Closed adoptions are ideal for those parents seeking closure or privacy.You can give up your child and move on with your life, secure in the knowledge that no one else will know of the pregnancy or adoption.

, If you cannot raise a child, then you could seek to have a family member raise him or her as a legal guardian. When a family member becomes a legal guardian, he or she has the legal authority to make decisions about the child’s medical and education needs. At the same time, your legal parental rights are not severed.To learn more about legal guardianship, see Become a Legal Guardian. You should also meet with a lawyer to discuss how to request guardianship from a court.

, You should not give up your parental rights lightly. If Child Protective Services has removed the child from your home, you should talk with an attorney. Do not simply assume that you can’t get your child back. You should also meet with a lawyer if you are a biological father who has been contacted by the birth mother and told that his child is being put up for adoption.


You should talk with a lawyer about your parental rights and what responsibilities you will have if you do not go through with the adoption. For example, you may be responsible for child support or for raising the child yourself.
To find a qualified family law attorney, see Find a Good Family Law Attorney.

, There are more than 2,000 adoption agencies in the United States.An adoption agency will find adoptive families and perform background checks on them. Because of how stressful the adoption process can be, a qualified agency will help smooth things out for you.


A great resource is the search engine at the Child Welfare Information Gateway, which is a service provided by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.In this search engine, you can select a state and then “Private Domestic Foster Care and Adoption Agency.”
You can also do a general Internet search for your state or county. Type “adoption agency” and then where you live. Write down the names of adoption agencies. You might also look in your phone book.

, Before selecting an agency, you should get a general sense of its reputation. You only want to work with a reputable adoption agency. Take the following steps:


Look at the website. Does it strike you as professional looking? Or does it contain poorly-written, inaccurate content? The more professional an agency’s self-presentation, then the more professional the agency probably is when handling adoptions.
Contact the state’s licensing agency. Each state should have an agency that licenses adoption agencies. You want to contact this government office and see if an agency is in good standing.Search for your state’s Licensing Agency on the Internet.
Check to see if the adoption agency has ever been sued. You can find this information by contacting your state’s Attorney General’s office.Ask for references. The agency should be able to give you three references for adoptions that they have handled over the past few years.

, As you attempt to narrow down your list of adoption agencies, you can call the references provided. Have several questions prepared to make the most of your telephone conversation:Were they pleased with how the adoption agency handled the adoption?
Was there anything they didn’t like? How responsive was the agency to suggestions or criticism?
What post-adoption services were available? Was counseling made available?
Would the reference recommend the agency?

, Once you have selected an adoption agency, you should schedule a meeting. You want to meet the staff and see the office that they have.

, You should be open with the adoption agency about whether or not you want your child to be raised by someone of a certain religion, or by parents who share your race or ethnicity.


At some adoption agencies, you can look through a book of prospective adoptive parents who have been screened.This is true of an open adoption, since you will know the adoptive parents’ identity.
You may be involved in selecting families as well. After you narrow down the parents that you want to consider, the agency will share detailed information, such as a Home study Report, with you., It is illegal to sell your child. However, you can be reimbursed for expenses, such as living, medical, and pregnancy-related expenses.For example, your visits to a doctor may be covered.

, The adoption agency should handle this. Each biological parent has parental rights which cannot be terminated without a court order. If you are a birth mother, then you cannot terminate the father’s rights yourself. Indeed, if he were to show up and assert his parental rights, he could stop the adoption.


For this reason, the adoption agency will probably want to contact the father. You should be honest with the agency about who the father is. Do not try to hide the identification out of embarrassment or fear. If the father finds out about the pregnancy and intervenes, the entire adoption could be derailed. It is best to tell the agency who the father is, even if he doesn’t already know.
A court needs to terminate the parental rights during a hearing. If the father refuses to consent to the termination, then he will need to attend the hearing and prove that he intends to support the child.

, You want to give birth to a healthy child, so follow all advice given by your doctor. If you are advised to stay in bed or avoid certain foods, then do so.

, You will need to sign away your parental rights. Typically, you must wait a certain amount of time to recover from the childbirth. The waiting time can vary, but is often between one and two days. You most likely will need to sign in front of a notary public or a judge.You also will have a certain amount of time to change your mind. This amount of time varies by state. For example, in Maryland you can revoke your consent to the adoption within 30 days., Many adoption agencies will have counseling services available to mothers, both before and after the adoption.You should take advantage of any services offered.


Adoption counseling can help you deal with grief and stress.If you have an open adoption, then adoption counseling can help you deal with setting boundaries with the adoptive parents.

Prepare yourself emotionally.,
Find an agency or adoption service.,
Write a letter to the service.,
Set up an appointment with a social worker.,
Give your social worker some background about yourself.,
Put yourself on a tracing list.,
Conduct the real trace.,
Get in touch with your genetic parents.",How to Find Your Genetic Parents if You Were Adopted," Make sure you are emotionally stable before you start a trace. In some cases, tracing your birth parents can cause a lot of wear and tear emotionally, and for many people this is an extremely emotional, stressful, and draining time. Make sure you have the support of a family member or friend who can walk with you through this experience. You may feel the need to talk your feelings through with a professional, and there is nothing at all wrong with this. It can often be a good thing, particularly if the outcome is not what you had hoped for.;
, If your adoptive parents are aware that you are starting a trace, the best thing to do is to ask them what agency they went through. If you want to start a trace but do not want your respective family to know, then the best place to start would be with your local health service adoption service.

, Write them a letter stating your name, date of birth, the hospital you were born in, the area etc. Also, it is important to include the names of your adoptive parents as the adoption order will be in their names. In the letter state that you are aware that you are adopted and would now like to conduct a trace. Be sure to give your current address for correspondence but also mention the address you grew up in as a baby with your adoptive family, as this is the one they will have on file.

, Eventually, the service will write back to you (unfortunately this can take some time) with an appointment to meet with a social worker who will be assigned to your case. The social worker will talk things through with you, discuss your feelings and prepare you for the journey ahead.

, The social worker will do their best to get your file by using the information you have provided them with and then contact you again to arrange another appointment. This appointment will give you what is known as 'Unidentifiable Background Information'. You will get the basic information regarding the circumstances surrounding your adoption & a brief synopsis of your birth parents (mainly regarding your birth mother).

, After the appointment with your social worker, they will place you on what is known as a tracing list (waiting list). Unfortunately, it can take up to two years to get to the top of this list, depending on where you are from. There are many, many people out there who are adopted and conducting a trace, but not enough social workers to deal with cases immediately.

, Once you have come to the top of the list, the social worker will contact you again to inform you of this. They will ask you again if you are ready and willing to go ahead with the trace because the next stage of the trace is much faster and in some instances it can become far more 'real' to the adoptee. In some cases it can take as little as 6 weeks to find your birth mother, but it could also take up to 6 months. If your birth mother has emigrated it may prove more difficult so patience is a prerequisite of this process.

, Once they have located your birth mother, the social worker will write to her and ask her to get in touch with them. Your birth mother will then be informed that you want to start communicating with her, be it to start a relationship via letter writing, or simply because you want to ask her a question regarding health issues in the family history.

Talk with other family members.",How to Know if You're Adopted or Not1," Wanting to know your origins isn’t a sign of disloyalty to your family, whether they’re your birth family or adoptive. It is very common for adoptees to want to understand their personal histories, and research suggests that this knowledge can improve a person’s well-being., Has some particular event or experience prompted to you ask these questions? Have you always felt a little different from the rest of your family?


It’s natural as you grow up to feel somewhat disconnected from your parents, or to feel sometimes as though you have nothing in common with them. It’s also common to feel like you are different or an outsider during adolescence. While these feelings may be stronger for adoptive children, almost everyone experiences them at some point.

, Do you want simply to know whether or not you were adopted? Do you want the story of how you came to be adopted? Do you want to search for your biological parents? Do you want to contact your biological relatives, or do you just want to know who they are? Understanding what you want from the situation will help you as you talk with your family.

, While the number of “open” adoptions (adoptions with some level of contact between the biological and adoptive families) has risen dramatically over the past few years, many people still feel uncomfortable talking about adoption with their children or with other adults. Even if your family wants to talk to you about this issue, they may not know how.Stigma is particularly likely if the adoption occurred under certain circumstances, such as a teenaged mother giving up her child for adoption or an intra-family adoption.

, This is an obvious step, but it can be very difficult. Keep your parents’ feelings in mind as you ask questions, but be open with them about your feelings too.


It’s probably a good idea to approach your parents first, if they are still living, rather than going to other family members. Many family members may wish to respect your parents’ wishes and could feel uncomfortable sharing information with you if you haven’t talked with your parents first.

, Once you’ve gathered your information, you may feel overwhelmed by the need to ask your questions, but wait for an appropriate time. Avoid bringing up this sensitive topic after a fight, for example, or when someone is sick or tired. Ideally, everyone should feel calm and relaxed.

, Writing down some of your questions and ideas beforehand will help you determine what you want to say and how you want to say it, and it can help you avoid hurting anyone’s feelings.

, Some parents don’t discuss adoption with their child because they are afraid that their interest in their biological family will damage the family. Opening by affirming your love for your parents will help prevent them from feeling defensive or attacked.

, Explain to your parents what has led you to think that you may be adopted. Try to avoid using accusations or definitive statements such as “I know I’m adopted because my eyes are blue.”

, Understand that this discussion may be very difficult for your parents, especially if they have waited a long time to share this information with you. Pressing for too much information too quickly could overwhelm them.


Try asking questions that prompt discussion, such as “What can you tell me about where I come from?”

, A question such as “Would you like to talk with me about where I come from?” may meet with a better reaction than “Why didn’t you tell me I was adopted?”


Try to avoid using words like “real” when asking about your origins. Questions such as “Who were my real parents?” can make your adoptive parents feel devalued or hurt.

, It’s natural to feel confused or even hurt about discovering you were adopted, particularly if your parents have kept that information from you for a long time. However, it’s important that you avoid being judgmental or angry with them, as this will only hinder clear and honest communication between you.

, You don’t have to constantly reassure your family that you appreciate them, but offering an example or two of something that makes you feel connected to them can help let your family know that you aren’t looking to replace them.


Many adoptees say that they feel that their personal values, sense of humor, and goals were shaped by their adoptive parents, so these could be a good place to start., The adoption conversation can be a very hard conversation to have, and you may not learn everything you want to know immediately. If your parents are visibly uncomfortable or become upset, try saying something like “I can see that this question may have upset you. Would you prefer to talk about this later?”


Don’t assume that silence means that your family doesn’t want to talk about your adoption. They may just need a few minutes to figure out how to approach the subject.

, If your family kept information about your adoption from you, even for just a few years, it may be very difficult for them to overcome their fear and anxiety about discussing it. It may take several talks before you reach a point where you can learn what you want to know.

, Many therapists are specifically trained to help adoptive families overcome issues and challenges unique to adoption situations, and seeing one doesn’t mean your family is broken. A family therapist may be able to help your family talk about adoption in a helpful, healthy way., You can ask other people in your family about your adoption and your connection with them using similar techniques to those above. You may even discover a deeper emotional connection with them now that they know you know your whole story.

Study genetic traits and recessive and dominant genes.,
Understand common myths about genetic traits.,
Pay attention to conversations taking place within your extended family.,
Look through family records and photos.,
Research your birth records.,
Realize that public records research can be frustrating and incomplete.",How to Know if You're Adopted or Not2," Your genetic makeup determines many aspects of your appearance, such as hair color and texture, eye color, freckles, height, and build. Discuss any obvious disparity with your parents.


Consider that intra-family adoptions may mean you have physical traits in common with other family members. You may have been adopted from another family member such as an aunt or cousin who couldn't care for you.
Your genetic traits will also help to determine your risk for certain diseases and medical conditions, although your environment (health care, diet, fitness, etc.) also has a significant effect. Knowing your personal history will help you and your doctor make informed healthcare choices.
While “race” is not considered a biological construct by most scientists, people with similar genetic backgrounds often share similar risk rates for developing medical conditions. For example, individuals of African and Mediterranean descent are at higher risk of developing sickle-cell disease than others, and individuals of European descent are much more likely to develop cystic fibrosis than those of Asian descent.It can be useful to know whether you should exercise particular care to lessen any potential risk factors you may have.

, While your genes do determine many things about you, from your hair color to your blood type, there are many widely held misconceptions about how genetics determine your physical appearance. Understanding these misconceptions will help you draw more accurate conclusions about yourself.


Eye color is not determined by a single gene, and there are approximately nine categories of eye color. Two blue-eyed parents can have a brown-eyed child, and vice versa (although brown-eyed babies born to blue-eyed parents is not common, simply possible).Eye color can also change, especially in infants: many babies are born blue-eyed but develop different eye colors as they age, so any judgments made based on eye color are very unreliable if made before a child's eye color has developed.“Attached” vs. “free” earlobes are actually two places on a much larger continuum. While there is some family influence on earlobe type, it is not a reliable marker of genetic inheritance.The ability to “roll” your tongue is linked to genetic inheritance, but can vary widely even within families. Even some twins have different tongue-rolling capacities! It is not a reliable marker of genetic inheritance.Left-handedness tends to run in families, but it isn’t a certainty. In fact, even some identical twins can have different dominant hands! Which hand is your dominant hand is likely affected by a variety of genes and your environment, rather than a single gene., While snooping or prying is probably a bad idea, you may learn something about your origins by listening to how your extended family talks about things such as your childhood.

, If you have a hunch that you may have been adopted, look through family photo albums and documents to see what pictures exist of you and when they may have been taken. Documents related to your medical history may also contain clues.

, If you have a good idea where you were born, you can write to the appropriate agency to request a copy of your birth certificate. Many places also keep public adoption registries that you can search.


The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention maintains a database of vital records agencies in all American states and territories; if you were born outside of the United States you will need to look for an office of “vital records” or something similar.
All states keep records of births, deaths, and marriages that occur in their state. They may be held by the Secretary of State’s office or the Department of Health in your state. Many online databases also hold these records, although they may charge a fee.

, The information you find is only as good as the information you start with. If you've been given the wrong birth parent name, wrong city, etc. you could be in for a very long and difficult process. Errors happen with data.

Talk to friends who are adopted.,
Contact family friends or neighbors.,
Join an adoption support group in your area.,
Have a DNA test done.,
Understand how DNA testing works.,
Register with a reputable adoption reunion registry.,
Contact a private investigator who specializes in adoption cases.",How to Know if You're Adopted or Not3," Chances are, you know someone who was adopted. Talking with them can help you understand how they learned they were adopted and what they did afterward. Friends may also be able to offer you advice on how to bring your questions to your family.

, Thanks to social media, it is now very easy to get in touch with people from your past even if you can’t visit your childhood home in person. Understand, though, that people may not feel comfortable discussing their knowledge of your family with you. Explain to them why you want to know, but don’t press them for information if they seem reluctant.

, Many people go through the process of discovering that they’re adopted and dealing with that information every year. A support group of other adoptees may be able to offer you advice and resources for your own search, as well as help you handle the process emotionally.

, DNA sampling can track your genetic markers and compare them to those of other family members. You can visit a genetic specialist, or you can use a mail-order test like the “Family Finder” test. For this option, though, you will need to get another close relative (a parent, sibling, or first cousin) to agree to have a test done so that you have a point of comparison.


If you buy a DNA test online, go with a reputable provider. The three biggest providers of online DNA testing are Ancestry.com, 23 and me, and FamilyTreeDNA. These companies also often maintain large databases of other individuals who have had these tests and can compare your DNA to theirs.

, A DNA test can offer you clues to your genetic identity, but it is often limited in its effectiveness without a large pool for comparison. If you are having a DNA test done without the participation of another family member, your information may be less useful.


There are 3 basic kinds of DNA tests: mitochondrial (inherited maternal DNA), Y-line (inherited paternal DNA, but only works for males), and autosomal (inherited relations to others such as cousins).Autosomal DNA tests may be the best option for adoptees, as they can connect your genetics to a wider network of people.
A DNA test can verify whether or not you are biologically related to your immediate family, usually through mitochondrial DNA. However, it is less likely to be able to connect you to another family if your genetics don’t match your own family’s.

, The International Soundex Reunion Registry and Adoption.com are both considered reputable, reliable registries for individuals who are seeking to reunite with their biological families., This option can be very expensive, so it is usually reserved for once you know you've been adopted but can't locate your birth parents or information about them. Look for an investigator in your hometown as they are probably familiar with the town's record archives.

Family law attorneys can specialize in many different disciplines (e.g., divorce, adoption, custody) so be sure you find one that specializes in juvenile court processes and custody issues. To find a reputable attorney, call your local bar association or visit their website. State and town bar associations often have attorney referral services for your convenience. You can also talk to friends and family to see if they have any recommendations.


If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed to you during your first hearing, which will be the detention hearing.;
, At your first meeting with the social worker assigned to your case, which will be the Team Decision-making Meeting (TDM), you will have a chance to ask that your child be placed in the custody of a relative. When you attend your TDM, you should bring any family member you are thinking about having take responsibility of your child. Regardless of your efforts, the social worker will also contact relatives to inquire about having the child placed with them.


In order to have your child placed with a relative, that relative must pass a background check and must have a place for the child to sleep. CPS will walk through the relative's home in order to ensure the home's safety.
Do not worry if your relative is financially unable to care for your child. In this event, your relatives would receive a monthly stipend to help care for your child., When your child is taken from you, you will have the right to ask why. When you do so, ask the social worker about the nature of the allegations against you and what has been alleged. In addition, you can ask about how the CPS process will be conducted and what you can expect. Finally, you can always ask CPS what will happen as a result of any court hearings and processes., If your child has been taken from you, know that you have the right to visit them. In order to do so, you must talk with CPS and discuss how this can be arranged. In general, you will have the right to visit your child within five days of them be taken from you. This first visitation will likely be supervised. After that first visit, talk with the social worker assigned to your case about working out a schedule of when you can visit with your child in the future.


If you disagree with the social worker's decisions regarding visitation, you have the right to appeal their decision to a court., When your child is taken out of your custody, the social worker must complete certain tasks within a specific timeline. This ensures your child is not taken away from your for longer than necessary and that you have the ability to be heard in court. In general, your case will proceed as follows:


On day one, your child will be removed from your care and the social worker assigned to your case will have 48 hours to gather facts and prepare a petition for a juvenile court.
On day two, you will be notified about the date and time of your first hearing, which is called a detention hearing.
On day three, the social worker will file their petition, which explains to the court why your child has been removed from your custody.
On day four (or within 72 hours of your child being removed), your detention hearing will take place in order to determine where your child will stay. You will be assigned an attorney at this hearing if you have not already hired one., Before your Team Decision-Making Meeting (TDM), gather as many supporters as you can and ask them to join you. They could be neighbors, family members, teachers, doctors, etc.. They will be able to talk to the social worker and convince them of your fitness to maintain custody of your child.


In addition, be prepared to discuss why it would be safe for your child to return home. For example, if your child was taken from you due to neglect, be prepared to show the social worker that you have a plan in place to never neglect your child again.

, As soon as is reasonably possible after your child has been removed from your custody, you will be notified of a TDM. During this meeting, you and any supporters you have will meet with the social worker and discuss whether a safety plan can be developed so that your child can be returned to you. A safety plan will address all of the safety concerns that caused your child to be taken away from you and will dictate how those concerns will be alleviated.


If all safety concerns can be adequately addressed, your child may be returned to you.
However, if not all concerns can be alleviated, your child will remain in out-of-home care and a court hearing will be scheduled., At your detention hearing, a judge will get an impression of the case and will determine where your child will be placed. Before the hearing begins, you will be given an opportunity to read the petition the social worker filed and you will have an an opportunity to ask questions about it. You need to make sure you attend this hearing because vital decisions will be made about your child and their well-being. If you attend, you can help make these decisions and you will show the court that you care about your child.


If you do not attend, the court will move forward without you and you will be sent a letter notifying you of the next hearing., About two weeks after your detention hearing, you will have the opportunity to attend a jurisdictional hearing. At this hearing, you will admit or deny all of the statements in the petition the social worker filed with the court. The court will then make a determination as to the truth of the petition and your statements about it. When you attend this hearing, come prepared and be sure you have read and understand the petition. If possible, bring with you evidence of your ability to care for your child.


If the judge agrees with the petition, the court will schedule a dispositional hearing, which may take place at the same time as the jurisdictional hearing or at a different time.
If the judge agrees with you and finds the petition to be untruthful, the case may be dismissed and your child will be returned to you., At this final hearing, the court will listen to testimony from both sides and will consider evidence that either party presents. If the court determines that your child should remain out of your custody, the court will make orders about when and how you can visit your child and what services you will be required to complete. If the court determines that your child can be returned to you, this will happen.


As a part of the court's order, you will take part in creating and following a ""case plan."" A case plan outlines the services you will need to take part in, the steps you will need to follow, and timelines that will be required to be followed in order to have your child returned to you., When you attend the dispositional hearing, be sure you prepare adequately. If you have people that can testify on your behalf, bring them. If you have evidence of your ability to parent, bring it.


For example, if your child was taken from your custody due to unsafe living conditions, bring a new lease that shows you have moved in to a more suitable home. If your child was taken from you because you were abusing drugs, bring recent statements from rehabilitation centers stating that you are working to fix your problem.

, If your child continues to be out of your custody for any extended period of time, you will need to take part in dependency review hearings every six months, if not sooner. During these hearings, the court will review a report from the social worker about your progress with your case plan. At these hearings, the court will determine whether to continue or terminate out-of-home services. If you have followed your case plan and are making good progress, you may have your child returned to you. If you still have work to do, your child may remain out of your custody until you make more progress.When you attend these reviews, be prepared to answer questions about your case plan and your ability to follow it. If it would help, see if you can bring in people to corroborate and back up your claims. Consider keeping a checklist of tasks you have completed and how those tasks relate to the requirements in you case plan. See if you can check off all requirements before your first review hearing. If you can do so, your chances of regaining custody of your child will increase greatly.

, If your child is not returned to you after your first dependency review hearing, ask the court and the social worker what you can do to make more progress before the next review. Everyone involved usually wants your child to be returned to you, so they should be willing to give you their advice. Once you receive their advice, take it seriously and do what they say.


For example, if your child was taken out of your custody due to alcohol or drug abuse, the court may ask you (or require you) to take part in rehabilitation sessions. If this is the case, do what they say and get better. Your child will only be returned to you when the court is confident in your ability to parent.

, Over time, as you take part in all required dependency review hearings and complete all requirements under your case plan, the court will make the decision to return your child to you. When this happens, your case will be closed and you will be reunified with your child., When an individual suspects you have been abusing or neglecting your child, they can file a report with your state's Child Protective Services (CPS) (also called Family and Children's Services, Health and Human Services, or something similar). Most often these reports are filed by other parents, neighbors, teachers, or police officers.The most common reasons these individuals file a report include alcohol or drug abuse, physical abuse or neglect, or other safety issues in your home.In general, once a report has been evaluated by CPS, you can expect one of the following responses from a social worker:


A community response. When the emergency response social worker find the report to be unfounded or inconclusive, the report will be closed. However, the social worker may contact you to discuss the report and may refer you to community-based organizations that may be able to help you stay out of trouble in the future.
A differential response. If the social worker assigned to your report finds it to be credible but finds no immediate threat to the health or safety of your child, the report will be closed but the social worker will contact you about the report. The social worker will likely require you to contact and meet with certain organizations in order to ensure the health and safety of your child.
A traditional CPS response. If the social worker finds an immediate threat to the health and safety of your child, a welfare case will be opened and you will be notified., When a welfare case is opened, it does not automatically mean your child will be removed from your custody. In general, a welfare case can have one of three outcomes:


First, if the social worker finds high-risk factors (for example, evidence of abuse or neglect) but also finds that any safety threats have been reduced, your child will be allowed to stay with you. However, you and the social worker will have to create a ""safety plan,"" which is a number of things you will need to do in order to keep your child with you.
Second, the social worker can get the juvenile court system involved. If this happens, the court will be involved in your activities until you can resolve the issues that led to this response.
Third, if the social worker finds immediate safety concerns, they can remove your child from your custody and place them in a safe environment., When a social worker determines your child needs to be removed from your custody for safety reasons, that social worker will come to your home and talk with you and your child. With your permission, the social worker will remove the child from the home. If you do not give the social worker permission to remove your child, the social worker may employ the help of law enforcement or may seek to obtain a warrant from a juvenile court. If this happens, your child may be forcibly removed from your home., When your child is removed from your home, they will be taken to a CPS office and evaluated to ensure they are healthy and safe. Afterwards, CPS will make a determination about where the child will be placed. Usually, a child will be placed:


In the home of another parent;
In the home of a relative; or
In foster care."

To access adoption records, the relevant state law is that of the state where the child was adopted. This might not be the state where the child was born or where you currently live.


Summaries of every state’s adoption laws are available at The Child Welfare Information Gateway website.
Generally, some states are “open records” states. In these states, you can simply get access to the your birth certificate. However, most states limit the kind of information you can receive.;
, The adoption file contains various kinds of information. The information can generally be divided into “identifying” and “non-identifying” information. Some states will release only “non-identifying” information but will require a court order to release “identifying” information.


“Identifying information” includes the names and addresses of the birth parents as well as the adoptive parents. If you want to actually find and talk to your birth parents or your child, then you will need identifying information in order to find them.
“Non-identifying information” does not identify the people involved in the adoption. Examples include:health information on the child’s biological family
whether the birth parents had other children
a medical summary of the child’s birth
the place and date of the child’s birth
the birth parents’ education
descriptions of the birth parents (such as race, hair color, and eye color)
the ethnicity or religion of the birth parents
the reasons for the adoption



, Thirteen states have opened their adoption records. If the adoption took place in one of these states, then the child can get his or her original birth certificate. The birth certificate will list the name of the birth mother and possibly the birth father.


To get the birth certificate, the child will need to be a certain age (typically 18 or 21). In some of these states, you cannot get the birth certificate unless the birth parents consent to its release (or don’t veto the release).In alphabetical order, the following are “open records” states: Alabama, Alaska, Delaware, Hawaii, Kansas, Minnesota, Montana, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin., More than half of all states maintain “mutual consent registries.” These registries allow biological parents and adopted children to find each other while providing the option of maintaining anonymity. With a mutual consent registry, the adopted child or birth parent files an affidavit with the registry. This affidavit states whether they consent to or refuse to consent to the release of information to the other party if it is requested.A mutual consent registry does not release information until and unless each party agrees to the release. For example, a birth mother might submit an application to the relevant mutual consent registry seeking information about the location of her birth child. After receiving the request, the registry will look for a consent affidavit signed by the child. If the child has submitted the affidavit already, then the registry will release the information to the birth mother.
However, if the child has not given consent, then the registry will not automatically release information to the birth mother. Instead, the state registry might contact the child and ask if he or she agrees to the release of information. In other states, the registry will not even call the child but will instead wait for the child to contact the registry on his or her own.

, States that don’t have a mutual consent registry might have created a confidential intermediary program. Here, a third person (the “intermediary”) can look at the records.


If a birth mother is seeking information about her child, the intermediary will tell the child that someone wants to contact them. The intermediary then checks if the child consents to the release of his or her identifying information.If the child agrees, then information is released.
In some states, you need to file a petition in court before you can access the intermediary program.
As with a mutual consent registry, both parties must agree to be contacted before a confidential intermediary program will release identifying information.

, To begin the search for your adoption records, you need to know the state where the adoption took place. Ask your adoptive parents if they remember the state in which they adopted you.


If you were the birth mother, then you should remember where you gave up the child. If your memory is hazy, then look through your records, or ask friends and family if they remember where you were during that period of time.

, You might only have the name of an adoption agency. If so, search online to see if you can find a phone number for the agency.


Some agencies might have gone out of business. However, if you know the state then you can contact the Secretary of State and see which counties the agency was registered to do business in.

, You can also get a copy of your birth certificate. This copy will have your adoptive parents’ names on it. However, you can see which county issued the birth certificate. This might be the county where the adoption records are kept.

, Once you know where the adoption took place, you need to contact the appropriate state’s registry to see about getting whatever information is available.


You can find the registry by performing an Internet search. Type the state and then “adoption registry” or “mutual consent registry” into a search engine.
If the adoption records are located in an “open records” state, then type “state” and “adoption open records” into the search engine. In this way, you can find the agency to contact.

, Not everyone can request information from a state registry. Typically, you need to be a blood relation of the adopted child. Often, adoptive parents are also given permission to access adoption information so that they can find the birth parents. Each state’s statute should list who can gain access.


In Maryland, for example, only the following people can get “identifying information”: birth parents, any siblings, and the adopted child if 21 or older (provided he or she does not have a sibling under 21)., You need to fill out an application to access information in the registry. There may be a separate form for birth parents, adoptees, and siblings. In some states, however, each party uses the same form.


In New York, birth parents should complete the “Adoption Information Registry Birth Parent Registration Form.” This form is available for download at the New York Department of Health website.
Adoptees can complete the “Adoptee Registration Form.”
Siblings should complete the “Adoption Information Registry Biological Sibling Registration Form.” Siblings will also have to attach to the application a photocopy of their current birth certificate., You should return the completed form to the address provided. Some states charge a filing fee. The fee can vary, depending on the state. In Arkansas, you have to pay a $20.00 fee. New York charges no registration fee., Currently, Arkansas, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Texas require that a person undergo mandatory counseling before they can register with the state’s registry. The counseling seeks to inform applicants about the potential effects of reconnecting with a birth family., You probably need a lawyer to help you unseal adoption records. If your state is not an open records state or if the birth parent/child does not consent to release identifying information through a state registry, then your final option is to petition the court to unseal the records. This is a complicated process which requires a lawyer’s assistance.


To find a qualified family law attorney, see How to Find a Good Family Law Attorney.
You might be worried about the costs of hiring a lawyer. If so, then you should realize that most states now allow lawyers to offer “unbundled” legal services. With this service, a lawyer might draft a petition for you but do no other work. Alternately, you might agree to meet for a half-hour of advice. With unbundled legal services, the lawyer only does the work you give him or her., You need to file a petition with the court in the county where the adoption took place. The sealed adoption records are held there and only a judge in that county can unseal them.


Many states have prepared “fill in the blank” forms that you can fill out and file. Check with the court clerk to see if there is a form you can use.
If there is no “fill in the blank” form, then you need to draft a petition and an order. You should have your lawyer do this. You can use the sample petition and order at the adoption.com website. Revise it according to your circumstances.
Your petition is critical. You need to explain to the judge why you have “good cause” to unseal the adoption records. Typically, a state that seals adoption records will not unseal them simply because you want to find your birth parents. Unfortunately, there is no standard definition of “good cause,” and some states find “good cause” in very few circumstances. Your attorney will know what circumstances a local judge would consider “good cause” to unseal the records.

, Wait to sign the petition until you appear before a notary public. You can find notaries at the courthouse as well as at county offices. You will probably be charged a small fee to have your petition notarized. Be sure to bring sufficient personal identification (valid driver’s license or passport).


You can also find a nearby notary public by using the locator at the American Society of Notaries website. Search by your zip code.

, Make a copy of the petition for your records, then take the original petition and any attachments to the court clerk. State that you would like to file the petition.


The court might require a filing fee. Call ahead of time and ask. Also ask what payment methods they accept. Not all courts will accept personal checks or credit cards. Should you be unable to pay the fee, then ask the clerk about a fee waiver form and complete it.

, After you file your petition, the court will schedule a hearing. At the hearing, you need to show the judge by “clear and convincing” evidence that the need for unsealing the adoption records outweighs the maintenance of confidentiality.You should not expect the judge to simply rubber-stamp your petition and unseal the records.


Bring evidence to bolster your argument. As an example, if you need to reach your birth mother because you need to know her family’s medical history, then you should get an affidavit from a doctor. This affidavit will explain to the judge why you need the medical information.

, If the judge agrees to unseal your records, then you should get a certified copy of the judge’s order. You will want a copy for your records.If your state uses an intermediary system, then you might need to give a copy of the certified order to the third-party intermediary. Ask the clerk for how to get your copy and whether you need to contact the intermediary yourself."

Sign a contract.",How to Find a Surrogate Mother," There are two types of surrogacy, and you will need to find a surrogate who is willing to use the route you prefer.


In the most common process, called ""traditional surrogacy,"" a surrogate mother gets pregnant through the artificial insemination of sperm into her own egg. The sperm can be inserted into her vagina at a doctor's office, or in some arrangements, she can inseminate herself using such devices as a turkey baster. She then carries the baby to term and delivers it, at which point the intended parents assume custody and raise the child as their own. This method is most affordable, and the baby will have the DNA of one of its (male) intended parents and the surrogate.Donor sperm can also be used for traditional surrogacy (either from a sperm bank or a willing friend).
Another option, gestational surrogacy, uses the egg and sperm from the intended parents and a process of in vitro fertilization. The surrogate mother in this case is basically the birth mother and has no genetic claim on the child. This method is more expensive but allows two opposite sex parents to both have their DNA represented in the child (in other words, they will be his biological parents).
Because traditional surrogacy involves the surrogate's own egg, it is more legally complex. Some states allow for a surrogate mother to change her mind and back out of a surrogacy contract if the egg is her own, because they see her as the biological mother with claims to her own offspring. Because of this, gestational surrogacy is legally easier in most states, even though it is more expensive.;
, Surrogacy is increasingly common, as there are many situations in which parents might choose to reproduce using surrogacy. Some of these scenarios include:


A woman is biologically unable to conceive a child or doing so might be medically risky (for example, if she takes necessary medications that would be dangerous during pregnancy).A gay couple wants to have a child that has one of their DNA. Either using the surrogate's egg or a donor egg, one of them can use his own sperm to fertilize the egg.Advanced maternal age makes reproduction impossible or difficult, and/or failed attempts at in-vitro fertilization have made natural conception difficult.
Many other reasons, such as a woman's professional career making pregnancy and birth undesirable or impossible.

, Depending on where you live, you may experience some social backlash or disapproval for your decision to use a surrogate. You should prepare for this reaction.


Many people consider it unethical because there are children in need of foster and adoptive homes. Some families who conceive via surrogacy report that they are often asked ""Why didn't you just adopt?""
Many people disapprove of it because it can separate the act of reproduction from the context of marriage, which some people disagree with on ethical or religious grounds.
While you can prepare answers for these types of personal questions, perhaps the best thing to do to prepare for social reactions is to find a support group or other people who have been through the same experience.

, Depending on where you live, there will be rules about what you will be expected to pay and what kind of rights you have during the surrogate's pregnancy.In some states, like Indiana, Kansas, and Kentucky, the state government has indicated that surrogacy contracts are either unenforceable or can be overturned by a party to the contract. Entering into a surrogacy contract in states like these might be risky.Michigan and New York expressly prohibit surrogacy and will fine people who enter into a surrogacy contract.Utah is notoriously strict on surrogacy. Traditional surrogacy (which uses the surrogate's egg) is against the law, but gestational surrogacy (which implants an egg fertilized through IVF) is allowed, provided that it uses the egg or sperm of at least one of the intended parents.People in Utah who want to opt for traditional surrogacy will have to go outside the state to find a surrogate and conduct the legal proceedings.
Most states, however, are generally favorable toward surrogacy contracts and have no major obstacles facing prospective parents or surrogates.

, The route you take toward surrogacy, whether through private party arrangements or an agency, influences how expensive it might be.


The cheapest possible route will still cost you. If you have a friend who is willing to be a surrogate, and you want to use your own or donated sperm from a friend, you may only have to pay fees for legal proceedings, the surrogate's medical insurance and bills for procedures and delivery, and whatever compensation plan you agree upon. This will differ depending on your agreement, but you should know that the average cost charged to insurance for all medical expenses associated with a pregnancy and delivery in the United States is about $30,000 for a vaginal birth and about $50,000 for a C-section (including fees for routine checkups and screenings like ultrasounds, blood tests, and cervical exams; as well as the expenses of labor and delivery including anesthesia and the hospital stay).Women with insurance pay an average of $3,400 out of pocket.Using a surrogacy agency and donated eggs and sperm is the most expensive route, but sometimes it is the best option. Between agency fees, psychological screenings and monitoring (generally required to help the agency avoid liability if there are problems), medical procedures and screenings, legal representation and fees, and insurance fees (covering the pregnancy, delivery and newborn(s)), the cost to the parents can easily top $150,000., Sometimes, family members are willing to be surrogates for their relatives. This has its benefits and challenges, but may help you feel better about the surrogacy process if you are working with someone you know and trust. It is also sometimes the only option because of how expensive an agency can be.


Be sure that you choose someone who is reliable, healthy, and who does not engage in risky behavior. While there are no official laws for who can be a private surrogate, you should choose someone who has had at least one healthy pregnancy and birth and is involved with that child's life, is at least 21 years old, has no health problems, and is not addicted to any substances. Its also a good idea to find someone who does not have a history of pregnancy issues or miscarriage.
Surrogacy is a huge commitment and sacrifice, so do not ask someone that you have a nominal relationship or who does not fully support you.
Be sure the relationship is acceptable. There are certain familial relations that cannot be a surrogate because it would endanger the baby's health (as in incest). For instance, you cannot ask your husband's sister to be the surrogate using his sperm and her egg. But, you could ask her to be the surrogate using donated sperm from another man.

, If you don't have a friend or family member who might serve as a surrogate, its possible that your friends know of someone.


Consider setting up a blog about your family and why you want to find a surrogate. Then, share the link on your social networking sites like Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram, and ask your friends to spread the word.
Ask your church or civic group to spread the word.
Be sure that anyone who is referred to you is well known by someone you trust. Conduct a thorough interview of this person. Find out why they want to be a surrogate, and what they hope to get out of the experience.

, If your friend is willing and eager to proceed, it is still important to ensure that everything is done legally to protect you, the surrogate, and the baby.


Be sure that she agrees on the terms of the surrogacy, including what steps she will take during her pregnancy to ensure the health of the baby:Does she agree to not smoke, drink, and to exercise?
Does she agree to attend regular checkups and screenings at the obstetrician's office?
Does she agree to notify you of every test result and finding?
Does she agree that you may be present at ultrasounds and the birth?
Does she agree to relinquish all rights to the baby immediately at birth?
What will happen in case of miscarriage, still birth, or multiple births?



, A lawyer specializing in surrogacy law or reproductive rights will be able to ensure that all legal requirements are met.


A lawyer specializing in surrogacy will be prepared to include all necessary terms, but be sure to include all of the steps she has agreed to take to ensure the health of the pregnancy, as well as expenses for her insurance, medical expenses, maternity clothes, stipend for food, coverage of lost wages due to maternity leave or if she should be unable to work for unexpected reasons, etc.).
Be sure that your paperwork is signed by all parties and filed before proceeding with insemination. In states that are favorable to surrogacy, the judge can issue a ""determination of parentage"" before the implantation or insemination procedure takes place, to help prevent any legal issues later.In some other states, you will have to undergo adoption procedures after the birth, and until those procedures are completed, the surrogate will have custody of the child., Agencies exist to match parents with women who are willing to be surrogates. These agencies charge a fee to handle all aspects of the surrogacy.


Agencies screen potential parents and provide counseling about options (such as traditional vs. gestational surrogacy, and local vs. international surrogacy). They locate and arrange interviews with surrogates, handle the contracts and legal aspects of the arrangement, and act as a go-between for fees such as surrogate compensation and medical fees. They also help you resolve any problems that arise.
They also have the ability to conduct thorough background checks, psychological evaluations, and health screenings on all parties, and provide ongoing counseling throughout the process., You can locate an agency using the yellow pages or Google, or by word of mouth.


If you know someone in your area who has had a baby via surrogacy, ask them what agency they used and if they were satisfied with the experience.
If you don't know anyone who has used a surrogacy agency, put the word out in your social circles that you are looking for a reliable agency. Post to Facebook, Twitter, or to private groups like mommy groups or church groups to ask for referrals. Even if no one has used an agency, someone likely knows of someone else who has.

, The first appointment should be a free consultation (verify this when you call to be sure you won't have to pay a fee if you decide to go with someone else).


At this appointment, you can interview the agency to be sure that you are comfortable working with them. Bring a list of questions and write down their responses. Be sure to ask:

How long have you been in business? How many successful surrogacy births have you arranged in that time?How many unsuccessful surrogacy arrangements have you had? Why?
How do you select surrogates? (They should screen them medically and psychologically as well as having criteria like those suggested by the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, such as being over age 21 but under 34, having had one child, good health, no smoking, etc.)Have you been sued by clients or surrogates (if yes, why?)? What was the outcome of the litigation?Are there any state-specific problems with surrogacy that they have encountered, such as delayed court orders or adoptions? What do they do in these situations?How close are the estimates they give clients to the final fee that clients actually pay?If you feel comfortable with the agency, you can also begin to discuss the process and look at profiles of available surrogates. You might also want to set up your own profile so the agency can help find you an ideal surrogate match.

,


This is a personal decision based on your circumstances and finances, so there is no right or wrong answer; but you will only be able to choose a surrogate mother who agrees to that method. Most surrogates prefer to use the gestational process rather than the traditional process, since the former does not require the use of their own egg.

,


A history of a successful birth helps ensure that the woman's reproductive abilities are intact and that she is healthy and strong enough to birth a child.
This is also recommended by the American Society of Reproductive Medicine because a woman who has given birth is better able to make an informed decision about the process understanding the difficulties of pregnancy and labor and the emotional issues that come with the birth of a baby. She will be able to decide whether she can handle growing and birthing a baby that she will never see again.

, Someone who takes care of her body, eats healthy food and gets good exercise is an ideal candidate. She will also need to be comfortable undergoing invasive medical tests and procedures.


She should not smoke, drink, or take recreational drugs; she should also be free of STDs and not engage in non-monogamous sex, and/or be willing to abstain from sex for the duration of the pregnancy.
She should be willing to take prenatal vitamins and any medications prescribed by her obstetrician, as well as changing her diet as needed throughout the pregnancy (some women develop gestational diabetes, which requires a major change to the diet).
She should have no history of pregnancy complications or miscarriages. If you are using a traditional surrogate, she should also have no family history of genetic disorders.
In addition to physical health, mental health is a major consideration. Ask for a mental health evaluation from a qualified therapist. You want to make sure your surrogate will be able to give the baby to you after birth without any trauma or regrets.

, If you are going to be using her egg via traditional surrogacy, you might prefer to choose a surrogate who looks like you or your partner or who has a similar ethnic heritage.


If you are using a donor egg or your own egg via gestational surrogacy, then this is not a factor since the child will not have any of the surrogate's DNA.

, A good match depends on you and your surrogate being compatible. Pick someone you will enjoy getting to know for the next 9 months to 1 year.


At the initial interview, she is also interviewing you. While you need to ask very personal questions eventually, some of them might be best saved for the second interview (like personal questions about her sexual history). On the first interview, you should get to know her as a person and ask more general questions like:Why do you want to be a surrogate?
(Assuming she has had a successful birth) What are your favorite and least favorite things about pregnancy and birth?
How do your family and friends (and/or husband or partner) feel about you being a surrogate for someone else?
How do you feel about me (and/or my partner) being present at doctor's appointments, ultrasounds, and the birth?
Do you want to maintain contact after the birth, and if so, what do you hope that looks like?
How many babies are you willing to carry, and what are your feelings on selective reduction?
If there were complications with the fetus and the doctor recommended terminating the pregnancy, how would you feel about that? Would you be OK with it if that was our choice?



, Make sure your surrogate is willing to go through legal channels and to sign a contract stipulating reimbursement, fees, healthcare and level of involvement before, during and after the birth of the baby.


Be sure that the contract is written up by a professional to avoid any loopholes or errors in wording that could be potentially damaging later.
Include all the expectations for all parties, agreements on what to do in contingent circumstances (like multiple fetuses, miscarriage, terminating the pregnancy, etc.), agreements about compensation and reimbursements, and requirements for the surrogate (health related behaviors, regular doctor's appointments, no smoking, etc.)

Speak to an attorney.,
Draft a petition.,
File the petition.,
Attend a hearing.,
Obtain a certified order.,
Reach out to the child.",How to Find a Child Given Up for Adoption," You should gather as much information about the child as you can. This information will be useful if you need to petition a court to unseal adoption records or if you need to search for the child using the internet. Among the information you should try to get:


The name of the agency you went through (if you worked with an adoption agency).
The location (state and county) where the adoption took place.
The name you gave the child.
The child’s birthdate.
The child’s Social Security Number (if applicable).;
, Adoption agencies and state agencies have two different types of information on the child and the adoptive parents: non-identifying information and identifying information. You will want identifying information if you hope to find the child. Identifying information includes names and addresses.


Most non-identifying information is collected about the birth parents. It includes information about the birth parents’ medical history, general appearance, and education level, among other things.You can contact the agency to see if any non-identifying information was collected about the adoptive parents. Although any information is helpful, be aware that non-identifying information will not lead you to the child.
Check your state laws to see how you can get identifying information, such as the names of the adoptive parents, the child’s new name, and where they lived when the adoption took place.

, Your ability to access information will depend on the state in which the adoption took place. The law will spell out who may seek what information and in what circumstances. For example, states may limit your ability to get identifying information.


A summary of state laws is available at the Child Welfare Information Gateway website.
Because states often revise their laws, you should check to see if you can find your state’s most recent statute. Search in your favorite web browser by typing “your state” and “adoption statute.”

, Over 30 states have created registries for birth parents and the children they surrendered to find each other. In a “mutual consent” registry, the child and birth parents can file statements with the registry, consenting to the release of their identifying information.If your child has already filed with the consent registry, then you can get the information after you register yourself. If the child hasn’t submitted information, then you most likely will have to wait. In some states, the registry may contact the child, but in other states this will not happen. Instead, you will have to wait for the child to apply to the registry him or herself.


Some states also run a confidential intermediary program. In these programs, a request is made to the state agency and the intermediary will contact the other party to check if they consent to the release of their identity. The other party can either consent or refuse.
In some states you need a court order to be able to use the intermediary program.

, Read your state statute to see if you can access identifying information from the state registry. Some states restrict who can access identifying information. For example, in Wisconsin, siblings are not allowed to perform searches for each other.However, about 37 states allow siblings to access identifying information if the other party consents., To use the registry, you will need to submit a form. Each state should have its own form, which should be available on its registry website. In New York, birth parents and siblings have different forms to fill out. The form for birth parents is called an “Adoption Information Registry Birth Parent Registration Form” and is available from the state’s Department of Health website here. Siblings must fill out an “Adoption Information Registry Biological Sibling Registration Form,” which is available here.


In New York, siblings must also include a photocopy of a current birth certificate.To find your state registry, search “your state” and “adoption registry” or “mutual consent registry.” The registry should be housed on a state website, such as a Department of Health or Vital Records.

, You should mail it to the address provided. You may have to pay a fee. For example, in Arkansas, you have to pay a $20 fee., Several states require that people seek counseling before registering for the state’s registry. The purpose of the counseling is to inform you about the consequences of seeking out information or contacting a birth family.Arkansas, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Texas require counseling., If your state does not have a registry, then you may want to petition the court to unseal the adoption records. In order to bring a successful petition, you will need to prove that you have “good cause” for unsealing the records. A natural curiosity to find the child you surrendered might not be sufficient. Accordingly, you need an experienced attorney to help you craft a strong case.


Visit wikiHow’s How to Find a Good Family Law Attorney for tips on how to find a qualified family law attorney.
If you cannot afford an attorney, then look for a legal aid organization in your area. Legal aid organizations provide low-cost or free legal help to people with low incomes. To find a legal aid organization in your area, use the Legal Services Corporation’s Locator.

, You start a lawsuit by filing a petition with the court. The petition will include the relevant facts and the legal reason why the adoption records should be unsealed. Some states will have “fill in the blank” forms for you to use. Ask the court clerk if a form is available. In Texas, you would use an “Application For Access to Termination and Adoption Records” form, which is available from the Texas Law Help website.


If you can’t afford a lawyer and your state does not have a “fill in the blank” form, then you can view a sample petition and order here, at the adoption.com website. Revise the sample petition to reflect your situation.
Make sure the petition is notarized, if required. You should sign your petition in front of a notary public. Notaries can be found in most courthouses or large banks. Be sure to bring sufficient personal identification, such as a valid driver’s license or passport.

, You must file it in the county where the adoption took place.If you live a distance away from the county, then call the court clerk and ask if you can file by mail or fax.


You may have to pay a filing fee. If you cannot afford the fee, then ask for a fee waiver form.

, Before a judge will grant an order to unseal the adoption records, you will need to appear before the judge to answer questions and argue your case. You must show by clear and convincing evidence that your need for the information outweighs the confidentiality of the adoption process.You should bring any supplemental information to support your case. If you are a sibling looking for a brother or sister in order to obtain medical information, then you will want an affidavit from your doctor explaining why the medical information is necessary.

, If the judge agrees to unseal the court records, then you should have the judge’s order certified. Ask the court clerk about how to get a certified order.Sometimes a judge may refuse to directly release unsealed records to you. Instead, you will need to go through an intermediary. You may need the certified order to give to a third-party intermediary.Keep a copy for your own records as well.

, If the judge agrees to unseal the adoption records, then you should be given the names of the adoptive parents and the child’s name (which may be different than the one you gave him or her). You may need to contact the adoptive parents first. Ask them if they would give a letter to the child.


To find either the adoptive parents or the child, you can search online. Visit wikiHow’s How to Find Someone for advice on what web search applications you can use to find the child.

Ask for the name of the foster family.,
Stay involved.",How to Find a Child in Foster Care1," As the birth parent, you still have parental rights until a court terminates them.Accordingly, you should still receive updates about where the child is staying and how your child is doing. Go through your papers and look for the name of your child’s case worker.;
, Your first call should be to CPS to talk to the social worker or case worker assigned to your case.You can find the phone number for CPS by checking in your phone book or by looking online.


Identify yourself and ask to speak to your case worker. If you don’t have the name of your case worker, then just identify yourself and explain why you are calling.

, Once you are connected to CPS, you should ask for the name of the foster family. The case worker should give you the name, since there is generally no reason to keep it from you.


Indeed, you generally have a right to visitation with your child, so you should discuss a visitation schedule.However, CPS might not tell you the location of your child if it has concerns about the child’s safety.

, Even if your children are not with you right now, you should still stay as involved as possible. Your children definitely need your time, support, attention, and love.In addition, if you ever want to get your children back, then you need to show CPS that you are capable of parenting your children.


You also must complete all court-ordered services, including any drug or alcohol treatment plans. Keep necessary documents that show successful completion.
If you follow your services and maintain a close connection with your children, then you should be able to get them back.

Ask the birth parents where the child is.,
Talk to Child Protective Services (CPS).,
Call your guardian ad litem.,
Contact an attorney.,
Prove your paternity.",How to Find a Child in Foster Care2," You should check with the birth parents to find out where the child is located. They have a right to be kept informed about which foster family their child is staying with.You should contact the birth parents and ask.


You might not want to talk to the child’s parents because your relationship has broken down. In that situation, you should realize that it will be harder to find out where the foster child is located.

, You can check with CPS to see if they will tell you where the child is. For example, you may be a family member or close friend who is willing to offer “kinship” care for the child while the birth parents are unable to care for them.CPS should have contacted you as soon as the child was removed from the parental home; however, you might not have been immediately available to care for the child. You can talk to CPS.


Grandparents and other family members should realize that very few states grant an automatic right to see the child. You have rights to visitation in some circumstances, but you really can’t demand to see the child.
Nevertheless, CPS may be more than willing to let grandparents and other close family members visit the child if they think it is in the child’s best interest. For this reason, you should call and explain that you want to see the child.

, If you are a child in foster care, then the court should have given you an attorney who will represent your best interests. This person is your “guardian ad litem.”You should call him or her and ask if you can see your sibling. Your guardian ad litem will work with CPS and your sibling’s guardian ad litem to see if you can contact each other.


You may have left foster care because you are now an adult. In that case, you should call CPS if you want to find a minor sibling still in foster care.

, Grandparents may need to sue to establish visitation rights with the child. Each case is different, but you shouldn’t assume CPS will let you see the child. Generally, you must prove to a court that it is in the child’s best interest to visit with you. States also have other criteria, which vary by state.If CPS is not forthcoming about where the child is, then you should meet with an attorney to discuss your options.

, Fathers have a right to know where their children are; however, you must establish your paternity legally. Generally, you would be considered the father if the mother put your name down on the birth certificate or if you were married to the mother at the time of birth.You can also establish paternity by completing a voluntary declaration of paternity form created by your state. Contact your local court clerk or a local legal aid organization in order to get the form. In some states, there is a time limit for claiming paternity using a voluntary declaration.
You may have to take a DNA test to establish your paternity, especially if you have waited a long time to claim paternity or if there is a dispute. You should contact your state’s Department of Child Services. The state will probably be more than willing to help you take a DNA test since you will have to financially provide for the child once fatherhood is established.
Accordingly, you shouldn’t claim paternity unless you really are the father. Once your parental rights are established, you will be financially responsible for the child until he or she reaches adulthood.

Consider adopting a foster child.,
Contact an agency in your state.,
Attend an orientation.,
Complete an application.,
Take pre-service training.,
Complete other requirements.,
Undergo a homestudy.,
Identify the characteristics of the child you want to adopt.,
Visit the child.,
File for adoption.",How to Find a Child in Foster Care3," There are tens of thousands of children looking for a permanent home. If you want to adopt a child, then you should consider adopting a foster child.


Many parents who adopt foster children qualify for adoption assistance. This can make the adoption inexpensive or even free if you adopt through your public agency.You might qualify for financial assistance to care for the child. For example, an adopted child may qualify for state medical assistance. Also, the child might qualify for a “special needs” subsidy which averages around $800 a month., Your state has an agency that oversees the adoption process. It is called the Department of Family and Protective Services or something similar.In many states, you can also work with a private agency which will partner with your state’s agency.


You can also contact AdoptUSKids at 1-888-200-4005. They will transfer you to a public agency or contracted private provider in your state., The adoption process will differ slightly, depending on your state. However, many states will ask you to attend an orientation held for foster or adoptive parents.At the information session you can ask questions.


Because a foster child might stay with you as you wait for the adoption to go through, you should think about getting licensed to be a foster parent at the same time as you get licensed for an adoption.
In some states, all adoptive parents must also be licensed as foster care providers., Your agency or private provider will probably require that you complete an application, either at the orientation or afterwards. Completing the application allows you to move forward with the adoption.

, Usually, states require adoptive families to take a series of trainings to help them understand the needs of adopted foster children and to further the child’s integration into the family. Each state has different training requirements, but generally you will need to complete four to ten sessions.Trainings will help you in the following ways:


Prepare you for the adoption.
Allow you to form relationships with child welfare staff who will assist you throughout the adoption process.
Answer any questions you have.

, Your state will have other requirements which you must satisfy before you can go through with the adoption. Depending on your state, you will probably have to complete the following:Obtain a medical clearance. Your doctor will probably have to complete a form to provide information about your medical history, a recent physical, and general health.Undergo a criminal background check. Most states will check to make sure that no adult in your home has a felony conviction or a conviction for child abuse or neglect.
Get letters of reference. You typically also need to provide the agency with several letters of reference from people who know you, such as neighbors, friends, or employers.The agency may have a form that you can give to your references to complete.

, A social worker performs a homestudy, and it is a key part of the adoption process. The purpose of a homestudy is for the social worker to understand whether you are prepared for adoption. One of the meetings will be held at your home, and your social worker will inspect it.Every member of the family should be present for the social worker’s visit to your home. The social worker will need to talk to everyone.

, You can begin the search for a child after you complete the homestudy.You will work with your social worker to identify your preferences in children to adopt. For example, you may have a preference for certain children depending on certain characteristics:gender
age
race
physical health or disability
mental health or disability

, After you have made a match, the agency will probably allow you to begin visiting the child.Eventually, the child should begin staying with you for extended periods of time.


If you are certified as a foster family, then the child may live with you permanently until the adoption goes through.

, You start the formal adoption process by filing a petition with the court. Your state agency should help you find a lawyer who can draft and then file the petition in court. The process from filing to adoption generally takes six to eight months (in some cases longer).The agency will continue to remain involved as you wait for the court to finalize the adoption.

",How to Set a Realistic Wedding Budget," Do you want to go traditional (parents of bride pay & bride)? Do you want to be more modern (pay for it yourself)? Do you want to be progressive (and share the wedding expenses with your fiancé)? Keep in mind that the tradition of having the bride's family pay for the wedding was established in days when a father would effectively pay a family to take his daughter off of his hands, as she wasn't seen as contributing to the family economy. Consider whether that's a tradition you wish to be a part of.;
, Since today is not the 1950s and most brides are working full time and plan to continue working full-time, ask your fiancé to share the expenses of the wedding. Traditionally the groom's family only pays for the rehearsal dinner, and possibly part of the honeymoon. The bulk of the expense is really the wedding (the flowers, the cake, the gown, the food, the music, etc.).

, This is really critical. You may think flowers would cost $500, but really they can cost $2,400 easily. Many vendors have minimums - get this information up front.

, Nowadays, wedding deals offered by websites such as Groupon or dedicated wedding deals websites such as Wedobo , BridesRally , Wedding Channel can save you a ton of money.

, It may be good to use software like Excel to easily update this and make cost comparisons between different vendors for the same thing (like different flower shops).

, How? Asking questions about his views would be a good place to start. Sharing the list of potential costs with him would be wise. Better yet, look into venues and costs together - reviewing purchases and setting budgets based on one another's needs is something you'll be doing for the rest of your lives!

, Keep in mind that if your families are paying for all or part of the wedding that they may feel entitled to add to this guest list. Be up front with them about this.

, Will you pay for it yourself or ask your parents for assistance? Do you both feel right even asking your parents for financial assistance?

, Special note: money from family has strings attached, so be careful about setting expectations that this is YOUR wedding and that you appreciate their financial contributions.

, The top line should have the total amount you are willing to spend and the end of the sheet should have a running total of projected and actual wedding related expenses.

, Before you can create a budget, you must find out how much wedding related expenses cost in your area. By doing your research, you make sure you budget appropriately. Otherwise, you might end up under budgeting (or even over budgeting) for certain items.Widen your net a bit when you are researching. If you live in a city, check some smaller towns close by. Many times, things will cost less outside of the city.
Make a table to keep track of your research. List the prices, the name of the business, and which part of the wedding it is.

, After doing your research, make a list of what you want for your wedding. What do you and your partner want? Is food and the venue more important than invitations and flowers? Decide what you want to spend 75% of your budget on. Then, decide what you want to spend very little on. Most importantly, decide what you can live without. If you don't care about chair decorations, wedding favors, and flowers on every table at the reception, cut those out. You'd be surprised how much money you'd save.Receptions can be extremely expensive, sometimes over 50% of your overall budget. When planning your budget, carefully plan for the reception so you don't spend all of your budget there.
For less expensive weddings, you will probably be looking for free venues and reception spaces. Most of the decorations will probably be DIY by either you or family members.
For example, for a $3000 wedding, the reception may cost $1100 (for food and utensils), alcohol and beverages another $600, a discounted photographer (who is a friend) $400, homemade invitations $175, flowers $50, decorations $300, and hired staff $375.Everything else is either free or DIY by the couple, families, and friends.

, When creating a budget for your wedding, decide what is important. One technique many brides and grooms on a budget follow is to choose the most important thing to splurge on. This is up to your personal preference - is there a caterer you really want? A dress that's calling your name? A photographer you just have to have? Choose this thing and start your budget there.Deciding to spend more money on one item can help you prioritize. Your wedding will still feel lavish because you're spending the money on what matters to you.

, If you are having a wedding on budget, you will not have a luxury wedding that should actually cost $20,000. That doesn't mean you can't have a beautiful, perfect wedding. Adjust your expectations for your budget. Trying to replicate an expensive wedding can end up in disaster for you.


This is why prioritizing is so important. By deciding what is important for you and your soon-to-be-spouse, you ensure that you make things count where it matters. In 20 years, you may not remember that you didn't serve alcohol, but you may always be disappointed you didn't spend money on a quality photographer.

, Planning a wedding yourself will save you loads of cash. The earlier you start planning, the less last minute decisions you will make, which can lead to bad decisions or unnecessary money being spent.


The earlier you start planning your wedding, the better deals you can find. Giving yourself plenty of time allows you to look for sales, discounts, and comparison shop., This is your and your soon-to-be-spouse's wedding - no one else's. Just because a blog, a magazine, or your great aunt said you need to do something at a wedding for it to be proper doesn't mean you have to do it. Just because someone said not hiring a DJ or the groom not wearing a tux is tacky doesn't mean it actually is. This is your special day. Skip unnecessary traditions. Decide what you and your soon-to-be-spouse want, and make that happen., Before you start budgeting for your wedding, decide what things are musts for your special day. Do you want a specific wedding dress or flowers from a florist? Do you want a 5-course meal? Do you want a fancy wedding photographer? Knowing what things are important to you and your soon-to-be-spouse will help you know where to put your money, and where to cut corners.

, This can be hard. How do you decide who you invite and who you don't? This can be especially difficult with regards to family and friends. Many people invite extended family and acquaintances to avoid drama. Remember the golden rule: This is your wedding. Invite those people who are most important to you and who you want to share the special day with.


A small 25 person wedding can easily morph into 100+ people once you start guilt adding people. Make a list of people you both care about and stick to it. Each person adds a significant amount of money when you factor in space and chair rental, invitations, thank you cards, and food.
If you have acquaintances and extended family you'd like to celebrate with, consider having a low-cost party after you return from your honeymoon. This party can be at your home, and you can keep the costs low.

, Wedding gowns can easily reach over $1000. When you add this cost to bridesmaid dresses, you can really rack up significant costs. Instead of dropping that much on dresses, consider buying cheaper ones off the rack. Many bridal shops have sales throughout the year, so if you plan ahead, you can buy your dress for a fraction of the price. You might encourage your bridesmaids to buy cheaper dresses from department stores as long as they buy it in a certain color.


Think about buying your wedding dress at a consignment or thrift shop. Some consignment shops specialize in formal wear, including wedding dresses. Thrift stores like the Good Will also carry wedding dresses that have been donated.
Look at used wedding dresses online. Sites like eBay and Craigslist have many listings for brides selling their nearly brand new wedding dresses. Other sites, like Pre-Owned Wedding Dresses.com, offer designer pre-owned wedding dresses for a fraction of the cost.Sew your own wedding dress, or borrow one from a friend.

, Try to save money by getting a bulk package when you rent the tuxes. If you don't have your heart set on the groom wearing a tux, let him and the groomsmen wear nice suits they already own, or that they can buy at a much cheaper cost.

, As you plan your wedding, don't feel you have to do everything on your own. Ask family members and friends to add their input; they might have ideas for cutting corners you haven't thought about.


Getting ideas from family and friends might also help you find a surprise florist, photographer, or wedding cake baker. If you have talented family members and friends, consider asking them to do the wedding photography at a cheaper rate for a gift, or baking the cake for you.

, Signing up with a website that scours the internet looking for deals on wedding essentials, from flowers to venues, could save you hundreds. Sites like Bride Rush are specifically geared towards finding you the perfect elements at the best bargains. Enter your location and date - month or day - and they send you updates.

, Instead of getting married on a Saturday in June, go for a less popular wedding month. Having your wedding in April and October can save you money, or try February for an even cheaper date.During peak season, venues will charge much more to rent a venue.

, Saturday weddings cost sometimes twice as much as weddings on other days of the week. Some places will charge less for Sunday weddings, while other venues may charge more for weekend days but lower the price during the week. If you don't mind getting married in the middle of the week, you might save yourself a pretty penny., City parks, backyards, and other green spaces make lovely backdrops for wedding ceremonies for a fraction of the price. Contact your favorite spots, or a park that is special to you and your significant other, and see if they allow weddings. Ask around and see if a friend has property with a field or a grove of trees. Or if someone you know has a beautiful backyard, see if they'll let you use it for the special day., Did you go on your first date to the zoo or aquarium? Did you get engaged at the coffee shop you both frequent? Many places will rent out their business for weddings. Zoos, art galleries, and aquariums are beautiful, unique places to have a wedding. Ask your favorite coffee shop or restaurant how much it would cost to hold the reception on their patio or in a back room.Think outside the box for places to hold the wedding and reception to save yourself some money.


Don't ignore apartment or neighborhood clubhouses, churches, hotels, or bed and breakfasts. Some of those places might offer great deals.

, Venture outside of the metropolitan area when searching for venues. Many times, venues in smaller cities cost a fraction of what venues in larger cities do. Towns outside of the large cities also might have some gorgeous garden spaces or halls that would make perfect wedding and reception venues., By having a wedding earlier in the day, you eliminate the need for large dinners. Instead, you can serve brunch, a light lunch, or warm hors d'oeuvres instead of a large expensive dinner.

, Instead of providing a large dinner with a meat and sides, or a large buffet with different choices, serve a light dinner, brunch, or lunch. Go for warm h'ordeuvres even if you have a night wedding, along with a beverage and cake. Choose to do a dessert-only reception.Some people may not be happy, but you will save a lot and still have a nice reception.

, If you want to serve a full meal, get creative so you can save some cash. Instead of going for a catering company, be unique in what you serve. Ask your favorite restaurant to cater the affair. Many restaurants offer buffet-style catering packages at reasonable prices. You will be happier with food you love, your guests will get quality food, and you will save yourself some money., If you are having an outdoor wedding, why not have an outdoor reception to match? Bring blankets and a few chairs, and serve a picnic-style buffet.Or have a backyard BBQ reception with homemade food.

, Wedding cakes are extremely expensive. Think about getting sheet cakes for your guests. The ceremonial cake can be smaller, and therefore, less expensive.Or buy a cake at the supermarket - or make one yourself - and then decorate it. If your mother, grandmother, or other relative is a fantastic cook, have them make the cake as your wedding gift.


Instead of a cake, why not have cupcakes or even pies?
Don't feel you have to have cakes - any dessert can be served at your wedding. Think even farther outside the box and have a cheese wheel with relishes, nuts, and fruit., Instead of having an open bar, serve only wine or beer. If your wedding has a theme, think about serving a signature cocktail.Or skip the alcohol all together. If you're not planning on drinking, don't spend that excess cost on something just for the guests.

, With quality home printers, you can make invitations yourself that look as good as professional ones. Since most people will just throw them away, there's no reason to spend a ton on invitations.Buy some cardstock from an office supply store, use a pretty font, and add a few creative touches. If you are crafty, you can add accents, ribbon, and lace.

, Unless your dream wedding is one where you're surrounded by tons of flowers, think about limiting the flowers you use. Florists and flower arrangements can rack up the costs, so instead of spending hundreds or thousands on flowers, have your bridesmaids carry a single rose while you carry a small bouquet.If you're having a wedding during flower season, grow your own flowers to use in the ceremony, or get them from a garden of a friend or relative.
Skip extravagant flower centerpieces on the tables. Instead, opt for cheaper centerpieces.

, Instead of spending a pretty penny on a band or a wedding DJ, get some speakers, an iPod, and a playlist of your favorite songs. This way you can dance to your favorite tracks while not wasting a ton of money.If you have your heart set on a live band or orchestra, contact local college music departments. Ask if they have string quartets, or know of any music students or local bands that would be interested in playing the wedding. They will probably agree to play for a much lower fee.

, Everyone has a cellphone with a camera these days, so get your guests to snap photos throughout the ceremony and reception. Websites like Eversnap allow you to make an album for your guests where they can upload their photos and videos. You can hire a photographer to help finish the photos and save a lot.


If you do hire a photographer, then do the dance, cake cutting, and bouquet throw early in the evening so you don't have to pay the photographer for longer than necessary., While this can be labor and time intensive, you can really save a lot of money. Many wedding decorations, like candles and candle holders, can be found at dollar stores. Pintrest and craft blogs provide endless ideas for wedding crafts.Give homemade favors instead of store bought ones. Most people throw favors away, so save money by making them yourself. Or forego the favors all together.

, Save money on professional hair and makeup by doing it all yourself. Many hair blogs explain how to get beautiful, yet simple, wedding hair styles. The bride and bridesmaids will look as beautiful with simple braids or at-home beach curls, and your wallet won't be suffering.

, Instead of making a traditional wedding registry at a store, register for other things. Try registering for wedding items, like your photographer or money towards the venue.When your family and friends start chipping in, you can have a lovely wedding with a much lower cost - your family and friends might even appreciate not having to go shopping for you!


You can also register through online sites, like honeymoon wishes, to have friends and family give money towards your dream honeymoon instead of buying you unneeded kitchen appliances.

, Many vendors will provide discount services in exchange for letting them advertise at your wedding. Lay a business card with contact information at each place setting at the reception, or put their name and contact information in the wedding program."

Fill in whatever gaps have been left.",How to Have a Big Wedding on Little Money," Invite people whom you love and who love you. They are the people who wish you the best and will serve to make this as authentic an experience as possible.;
, Do not invite someone just because they are helpful. If there is no love lost between you, leave them off the list.

, It is unusual to ask your guests to help you create your memory. Instead of an impersonal registry at some faceless department store, give them a chance to personally make your day special. To do this, decide what you'd really like from you guests to help make the wedding special and let them know:


Lay both lists side by side and begin to match what you need to the persons on the guest list.
Create a script to inform people what you need. You do not want to appear demanding or greedy, simply grateful for their love and willingness to help. Begin with, ""I want you to know you are invited to come share my joy at my wedding!""  From there, you may decide how to introduce your need. Usually, guests will ask what you need and you can let them know.

, For example, you might:


Have an aunt prepare a roast for the dinner.
Have a friend prepare a specific rice dish that you like how she or he makes.
Ask another friend for a turkey.
Ask the friends of your parents to provide flowers and other decorations.
Ask a childhood mentor to provide their talent to sew the dresses at a great discount as wedding presents.

, Give it to your maid or matron of honor work with the best man and have them make sure that everyone comes through with what they have promised. If anyone is likely to back out, ask that they let you know that at least two weeks in advance. You may have to end up asking someone else, or pay for it out of your pocket, so be on top of it.

, If there are still guests to whom you've not assigned roles yet, consider asking them to take on something, or go on and pull out your checkbook.

, The ring can be simple or simply beautiful. Remember, there are anniversaries coming up and they get progressively better in terms of upgrades you can make to the stones. You want something to build on--if you start at the top, where will you go from there?

, You do not need more than two attendants on each side. You are including everyone in your wedding by asking them to create it, so nobody should have tantrums about not wearing a bridesmaid dress.

, If you go to a budget bridal store, you can get a beautiful gown for next to nothing. If you choose to create your dress, remember it does not have to cost a lot to be beautiful.


Suits can be purchased that will be useful in other venues, or rent a tuxedo.

, Many cell phones take better pictures than some professionals do, so don't be shy about asking folks to forward you their best shots. You may consider only posing for the wedding party pictures. This will reduce the time you are paying for the professional photographer.

, If you are careful, you should be able to have an absolutely beautiful wedding for under $2000.

Watch your weight.,
Consider the shape.,
Use postcards.,
Stock up on Forever stamps.,
Use the Internet.",How to Save on Postage for Your Wedding Invitations,"


The heavier your wedding invitation is, the more it will cost to send. Be careful about your choice of paper as well as the number of inserts you include. Consider combining some of the information you need to include onto fewer sheets of paper rather than giving each insert its own piece of paper. For example, you could include a map to the reception on the back of the hotel information. Ideally you should keep your wedding invitation mailing at less than 3.5 ounces.;
,


Oversized and irregular shaped envelopes also cost more to mail. A regular envelope is considered between 3.5 (8.89 cm) and 6 inches (15.24 cm) high and between 5 (12.7 cm) and 11.5 inches (29.21 cm) long. It also can't be more than 0.25 inches (.635 cm) thick. You will also want to be careful of including any bulky embellishments, such as bows and monograms that cause the thickness of the invitation envelope to increase.

,


Rather than including an RSVP card, use a postcard. It is good manners to include the postage on the RSVP that you want the guest to return, so don't forget to budget that postage in as well. A postcard is approximately half of what card postage is. You can still include the same information, but use less paper.

,


Forever stamps are released by the United States Postal Service prior to the rise in postage rates. They are issued at the current rate and can be used ""forever,"" even after the increase. Stocking up on these stamps prior to the increase can save you a lot of money on your wedding mailings. The Forever stamps come in few designs. Although the designated wedding stamps are pretty hearts and flowers, they aren't going to save you money on your wedding invitations.

,


Wedding traditions are changing with the times, so feel free to do whatever works the best for you. RSVP web sites are a new way for your guests to respond to your wedding invitation, which keeps your invite ""green"" and inexpensive. You can also include the hotel information, maps, rehearsal dinner information and any other pertinent wedding information that will save you from having to include on paper in the wedding invitation packet.
Go 100 percent green and send out your wedding invitation on line. While this is far from traditional, some couples may be comfortable with doing away with the traditional wedding invitation. This will save you tons of money on the invitations to your wedding and will be kind to the environment at the same time.

maid/matron of honor toasts to the groom
father of the bride toasts to the couple
bride and groom toast to their parents and the guests;
, Some people at the wedding might not know who you are, so making this clear at the beginning will avoid any confusion.

, Show gratitude to whoever is hosting the wedding, whether it's the parents of the bride or the couple themselves. E.g. ""Thank you for welcoming us to this happy occasion, and sharing your joy with us today.""

, Stories of how various parties met are always popular, whether you talk about how the bride and groom met or your first time meeting either of them.Here are some additional ideas:The first time the bride or groom told you about meeting their partner.
The first time you realized these people were an important part of your life.
A time you got through something together, whether challenging or fun.
The story you are looking forward to telling their kids one day.
The way you have seen the bride or groom change for the better since they met.
When you’re 90 and looking back, what would you say of your friendship?
Tell a story of some specific detail or action that exemplifies why this person is special in this world, and to you in particular.
If you were given three wishes for the couple, what would they be? Be careful with the use of clichés here. Don’t use wishes you’ve heard before.
Tell about the time your friend saw you through an embarrassing moment. (Careful. Consider the audience).
If it’s a second marriage and there are children involved, consider a toast referencing the newly created family.

, Say something nice about the person (or couple) you are toasting to. Although your intentions might be good, don't go on and on about how great a person is; instead, choose a few appreciative adjectives that go a long way (e.g. ""he's generous, intelligent, and kind"")., Offer a wish, a traditional toast, or a blessing. Here are some ideas:


Here's to the groom, a man who keeps his head though he loses his heart.
May she share everything with her husband, including the housework.
My greatest wish for the two of you is that through the years your love for each other will so deepen and grow, that years from now you will look back on this day, your wedding day, as the day you loved each other the least.
May 'for better or worse' be far better than worse.
Here's to the groom with bride so fair, And here's to the bride with groom so rare!
May I see you grey, and combing your grandchildren's hair.
May you live each day like your last, and live each night like your first.
May you see each other through many dark days, and make all the rest a little brighter.
To keep your marriage brimming, with love in the wedding cup, whenever you're wrong, admit it; whenever you're right, shut up.
I would like to make a toast to lying, stealing, cheating and drinking. If you're going to lie, lie for a friend. If you're going to steal, steal a heart. If your going to cheat, cheat death. And if you're going to drink, drink with me.

, Finish off with a phrase that's to be repeated by the guests. For example: ""Let us now toast the happiness of Jill and Jack. To Jill and Jack!""

, Both people have to be equally committed to this concept, or the guests will be able to tell. Writing your own vows isn't for everybody.

, Once you and your future spouse have committed to writing your vows, you should take some time, both separately and together, to think about what you love about each other and what makes your relationship special. This will help you brainstorm ideas for your vows, and you will hopefully see that you have so many wonderful things to say about your significant other that it'll be nearly impossible to trim down your vows! Here are some ways to reflect on your love:Make a vow date. Seriously. Go to a romantic restaurant, or your favorite restaurant, have some wine, and talk about what you love about each other. Share your best memories of the relationship, discuss the hardest thing you went through together, and talk about the moment you knew you wanted to be with each other forever.
Don't be afraid to be a little silly during your vow date! Goofy memories work too. Bring a notebook and jot down some ideas.
Take time to reflect on your own. Write your thoughts about your loved one in a journal.
If you have kept a journal throughout the course of the relationship, go through it to see if you can gain any insight into the relationship.

, Once you have both reflected on your relationship, you can discuss some of the nitty-gritty of your vows so you make sure that you are on the same page and present a united front to your guests. Here are some important things to decide on before you jump into writing your vows:


A time or a word limit. Most vows are around one minute long, or 150 words long. Don't make them any longer than that. Keep it short and sweet or your guests will get restless.
Decide on a tone. Will it be serious with just a touch of humor? Poetic and lighthearted? Deeply romantic? Though you don't have to have the exact same tone as your partner, your vows won't sound right if you went for ""deeply romantic"" while he chose ""completely hilarious."" Remember that, while you are welcome to show your silly sides, that there should be a serious undertone. You are making a lifelong commitment, after all.
Decide on a structure. Go for a matching structure, such as starting with ""I promise..."" or ""I pledge..."" You can also have the same opening or closing line, such as ""Thank you for wanting to be with me forever."" You can refine the structure as you start writing, if you like.
Decide whether you will write them together or separately. Will you share all of your thoughts during the process, run them by each other at the end, or keep them a surprise until it's time to get married?
Decide on a due date. This may sound silly, but you should have your vows done at least a month before the wedding so you don't end up writing them overnight. The more time you take to write them, the more you will be able to express how you really feel.

, Brainstorm all of the things that make your future spouse so special. This could be his or her beautiful blue eyes, the way your loved one can make you smile no matter how awful you feel, or how your significant other knows exactly what you're thinking even if you're miles away.


Make a list of adjectives that describe your beloved's best qualities. Think about the ones you want to emphasize in your vows.
Focus on anecdotes to help emphasize your beloved's best qualities. Saying he is ""kind"" is less effective than talking about the time he cleaned the whole house because he knew your family was coming for a visit.
Think about the times your beloved has really been there for you. All good relationships still have some rough patches, and you should think about how your loved one showed character when he helped you through a rough time in your life.

, Write down the most memorable moments you have shared with your future spouse. This could be anything from your amazing vacation to Napa Valley to the time he stayed in to watch two days worth of bad television with you when you had all of your wisdom teeth taken out.


Think about the places you have gone together, from a special hike on a mountain top to your favorite restaurant.
Think about key milestones in your relationship. This could be anything from getting a dog together, moving in together, your first date, or the moment you knew it was meant to be.
Think about the hardest time of your relationship. How did you work through it together?

, Depending on who your significant other is and what memories you've shared, you'll write a list of promises you will make to your loved one forever. Some can be serious, like always apologizing no matter what, or never going to bed angry, while others can be more fun, like promising to always do the dishes as long as you can win the thermostat war.Remember that in most traditional vows, people promise to be there for their loved one in sickness and in health, through the good times and the bad, and to support them no matter what. Find a personal way to make some of these same points, since that's what marriage is really all about.

, You may be so focused on writing the perfect vows and impressing your guests that you're forgetting to show what makes you who you are, and what makes your loved one so special. If you're both really silly together, go the silly route. If you're both hopeless romantics, don't be afraid to go over-the-top with some poetic phrases. This is your day and you should show off who you really are.


You can look at other vows, read poetry, or browse the Internet for inspiration. You can ask a close friend who recently wrote her own vows if she would share them with you. These can be helpful guides, but don't lean too much on the words of other people, and focus on showing what makes your relationship unique.
If you have a sense of humor, throw in a lighthearted joke! After saying something serious, you can tell your loved one, ""I promise to always watch Monday night football with you, as long as you still bring me flowers every week.""
Remember to be yourself, but don't forget your audience. You can still share the best parts of who you are and what your relationship means without isolating, confusing, or boring your audience. Does Grandma Flo want to hear about your beloved's amazing foot massages? Probably not.

, As you write your vows, it may be tempting to fall into clichés. The point of writing your own vows is to make them as personal as possible, so try to find the most original ways of showing how you feel. Avoid calling your future spouse your ""best friend"" or your ""soul mate,"" or saying that your ""heart melted"" when you first met.


You should avoid clichés, but don't obsessed over being too original. If your beloved really is your best friend, don't be afraid to say so. But for the most part, focus on writing the vows that only you could have written.

, Once you feel confident about your vows, it's time to get some feedback. Though you may think that your vows will bring your audience to tears, you need to make sure that you've set the right tone and have clearly communicated your feelings before you share them with the world. Here are some people to ask for feedback:


If you and your spouse-to-be have agreed to share your vows, ask what he really thinks.
Ask a trusted best friend who really knows you and your relationship to see if it's communicating everything you want to say.
Ask your parents, or even your grandparents, for advice. Having the insight of an elder will help you understand more about the nature of love.

, Once you've got your vows down, all you have to do is focus on the execution. You should practice saying them enough times that it sounds natural, but don't say them so many times that your vows sound too rehearsed. They are supposed to come from the heart, after all.


Focus on speaking clearly and maintaining eye contact with your beloved while glancing at the audience.
Remember that on your wedding day, your vows won't sound just like they did when you rehearsed them. You will be a little bit choked up, and that's okay! Your vows will only sound sweeter if your audience sees how much you truly love your future spouse.

Pre-print the response envelopes with the hosts name and address.,
Direct people to your wedding website.",How to Write Wedding Invitations," A formal wedding invitation is often divided into several lines, all of which provide pertinent information about the ceremony, reception, and those involved. The lines of a wedding invitation include the:Host line, where the names of the people hosting the wedding open the invitation
Request line, where the invitation is formally put forward to the guest
Relationship line, where it’s indicated how the hosts are related to the couple
Name of the couple
Date line
Time line
Venue line
Address line, which states the address and location of the ceremony venue
Reception line, which explains what type of reception or party will take place afterward and where;
, Traditionally, the host of a wedding was the person paying for it, but today, this is an honor that the couple can bestow upon any chosen loved one.When you look at a wedding invitation that says something like “Emily and John Gordon request your presence at the marriage of their children,” Emily and John Gordon are the hosts who are extending the invitation. The wedding host is most often:


A bride’s parents
A groom’s parents
The couple and their parents
The couple alone

, When a bride or groom’s parents host a wedding, their names are the first to appear on the invitation.


Typically, you will use courtesy titles followed by the surname (Mr. and Mrs. Gordon), or courtesy titles followed by the husband’s full name (Mr. and Mrs. John Gordon).

, If it’s a bride and groom getting married, the first line will typically have the name of the bride’s parents (Mr. and Mrs. John Gordon). The second line will begin with “and” followed by the name of the groom’s parents (and Mr. and Mrs. James Burrows).


If two brides or two grooms are getting married, the formatting will be the same, but you will have to choose whose parents come first. However, you can also put all the parents on the same line.

, When the couple and both sets of parents are hosting the wedding, it is customary to open the invitation by saying something that indicates everyone is involved, such as:Together with their parents
Together with Mr. and Mrs. John Gordon and Mr. and Mrs. James Smith

, When the couple themselves choose to host their own wedding, their full names appear at the very beginning of the invitation.


The names are often on separate lines, with the bride’s name traditionally coming first when there is a bride and groom.Even when the couple are the hosts, wedding invitations are still generally written in the third person., In the instance of a second marriage, it’s not uncommon to open a wedding invitation with the first names of the children—instead of the hosts—from the new couple’s previous marriages. , Once the name of the host has been stated, it’s time to actually extend the invitation to the guests. This is often done with wording along the lines of:


“Request the honor of your presence,” which is usually reserved for religious services.
“Request the pleasure/honor of your company,” which is usually used when a service will not be religious.“Invite you to celebrate with them”
“Would like you to help celebrate”

, In the next line, you can explain how the host is related to the couple. There are several different wording choices you can use depending on the relationship.


When the hosts are a bride’s parents, you can say “at the marriage of their daughter”
When both parents are hosting, you can say “at the marriage of their children”
When a groom’s parents are the hosts, the next line can simply be “at the marriage of”
When the couple is hosting, you can say “at the celebration of their wedding/union”
When an invitation has been extended by children from previous marriages, the relationship line can say something like “at the ceremony that will unite them as brother and sister”, When there is a bride and groom, the bride’s name traditionally comes first; if there is more than one bride or no bride, you will have to decide whose name appears first.


Feel free to include a bride and groom’s full names; traditionally, however, only the bride’s first and middle names appeared on invitations, because the bride’s parents paid for the wedding, so her surname was already mentioned.
When the groom’s parents are the hosts, it is sometimes necessary to write “to their son” between the bride’s name and the groom’s, so the invitation is stated as “Mr. and Mrs. James Burrows request the honor of your presence at the marriage of Catherine Renee to their son Ryan Kevin Burrows.”

, Once the host has invited the guest and introduced the couple, it’s time to include all the relevant details about time and place. First comes the date of the wedding, followed by the time on the next line.On a traditional, formal wedding invitation, the names of all times and dates are spelled out (write “Monday the second of March” as opposed to “Monday, March 2”)Similarly, instead of writing 2:00 p.m. on a formal invitation, you would instead write out two o’clock in the afternoon.

, The location of the wedding ceremony comes after the date and time,and this should include the :


Name of the venue
Address of the venue (unless it’s a highly recognizable place that will be easy to find)City and state/province where the wedding will be held

, This tells guests what to expect after the ceremony. If the wedding ceremony will be followed by dinner and dancing at the same venue or a different location, now’s the time to let your guests know. This can often be something simple, such as:


“Dinner and dancing to follow”
“Reception to follow”
“Party to follow,” and be sure to note a time and new location if applicable

, For example, if children aren’t permitted, you can write “adult reception” on the reception card. Similarly, you can also indicate a dress code in the reception line, such as “black-tie reception to follow.”


To tell guests delicately that children are not invited, you can also have a box on the RSVP card that asks you to indicate how many adults will be attending., Unless you want guests to reply by telephone or through a wedding website, it’s best to include a physical card that guests can mail back in response to the invitation.

, To encourage people to respond by mail, make it as easy as possible by providing pre-printed envelopes so they don’t even have to address the RSVP themselves.


The return address should be the name and address of the hosts, and not necessarily the bride and groom., For couples who do register with a wedding website, guests can RSVP immediately online. However, it’s important to mention specifically on the invitation or RSVP card that guests must visit that site for more information."

Choose your newspaper.,
Contact your newspaper, or visit the website.,
Gather the necessary information.",How to Write a Newspaper Wedding Announcement1," Generally, you'll want to run an announcement in the paper where you and your future spouse are living. You may also want to run it in both of your hometowns or where your parents or grandparents live.


Some people enjoy also running the announcement in a national newspaper. Keep in mind, though, you will have to contend with more paperwork if you run the announcement in numerous newspapers.;
, You need to know exactly what your newspaper wants. Some will want to have staff write the announcement; in that case, they will just need information from you. Others will expect you to write it.Also, you'll need other information, such as the word count and what they expect you to include.
They may also have a specific format and font that they want you to use when creating your announcement.

, You'll likely know all of it, such as the bride and groom's names, the parents' names, and the wedding date. You'll also need information such as the officiant's name and the location of the ceremony and reception.


You may also want consider adding the bride’s maiden name, where the wedding will be, and where the bride and groom will live after the wedding.
For longer announcements, you may want a description of the wedding, including the bride's gown and the wedding colors, or you may want to provide information about the honeymoon.

"
"
Keep it concise.,
Consider beginning the announcement with the parent’s names.,
Consider beginning the announcement with the couple’s names.,
Include information about the ceremony.,
Finish up with any extra information you wish to include.,
Review and edit the announcement.",How to Write a Newspaper Wedding Announcement2," The key to writing the announcement is to keep it concise. That is, you don't want to be too wordy. Even if you are creating a longer announcement, you should still keep the word count in mind because, as mentioned above, some newspapers may charge more for articles with more words.

, You can begin the announcement one of two ways. In the first instance, you can start with the parents' names, having them announce the marriage of their children. For example:


""George and Loretta Jones would like to announce the marriage of their daughter Jess Jones to Jay Kroner, son of Barbara and Roger Kroner.""

, Alternatively, the announcement can be made by the couple themselves, for example: ""Jess Jones and Jay Kroner would like to announce their marriage.""


However, it is still customary to include the parents' names at some point, for example ""Jess is the daughter of George and Loretta Jones, while Jay is the son of Barbara and Roger Kroner.""

, Make sure to include the date. Try to include several bits of information in each sentence, such as the location, the date, and the officiant. For example:


""The couple was married on July 17, 2014 in a quiet ceremony at the botanical gardens. The wedding was officiated by Reverend Lisa French and followed by a reception at the community center.""

, For instance, you can talk about how you met or where you went or are planning on going for your honeymoon. For example:


""Jess and Jay are planning on honeymooning in Italy."" You could also consider something like ""Jay and Jess met while volunteering at the local food bank, and their relationship burgeoned over their love of gardening.""

, Look for typos and grammatical errors. Take out anything that isn't strictly necessary. Have your partner read over it, both to check for errors and to make sure the wording is acceptable to him or her. Also, check to make sure it follows the newspaper's guidelines, including the word count.


Keep in mind that the paper will likely edit it again for content and style.

Become a planner in your own life.,
Develop a passion for weddings.,
Consider getting some formal training.,
Get hired for a job as an entry-level event coordinator.,
Shadow a wedding planner.",How to Work for a Wedding Planner1," Organize small and large birthday parties, anniversaries, school events and community events. You should have a passion for planning functions if you are going to work in event planning.;
, Whether you are inspired by planning your own wedding or enjoy attending weddings, you have to be ready to ""think wedding"" most days of the year. Decide if you can immerse yourself in all aspects of a wedding from formal wear to catering to stationary and everything in between.

, Search for certificate or associate's degree programs in your area. You may be able to attend an intensive course or conference specifically in wedding planning.


Education is not necessary to become an event planner. Most people earn clients by showing their portfolio of past events. However, it may be valuable to show a prospective employer that you have received formal training in wedding and event planning.

, This need not be on a wedding event, necessarily. However, at least 1 year of experience in event coordinator will make you eligible for most wedding planner assistant jobs.

, Doing a job shadow is helpful for 2 reasons: you can get an up-close view of the daily work involved and you can develop contacts in the industry. Choose 1 of the avenues to find a job shadow opportunity.


Ask a wedding planner that you know if you can job shadow them for a day or a week. If you have some open time in your schedule, you may request an unpaid or low-paid internship for a few months in order to learn the ropes.
Look in the phone book for local wedding planners. Although you may feel uncomfortable calling someone you don't know and asking to shadow them, you will develop contacts in the industry by doing so. Ask if they take on interns as well.
Post an ad on Craigslist requesting an internship. If possible, take more than 1 internship to gain more contacts in the industry. Getting a job with a wedding planner is often easier by word of mouth than by job posting.
Go to a mentor site, like PivotPlanet. This job search site allows you to sign up to speak with a wedding planner by web conference. You can set a number of dates to check in and ask questions about jobs, the industry and tips on getting started.

Develop a portfolio.,
Network with wedding planners in your area.,
Join a professional organization, such as the Wedding Industry Professionals Association (WIPA) or the National Association of Wedding Professionals (NAWP).,
Start a wedding blog.,
Call your contacts and ask if a position is available.,
Check Internet job boards regularly.,
Apply for project-based/contract work.,
Consider moving to a metropolitan area.",How to Work for a Wedding Planner2," Bring together pictures of events you've put on or helped to produce. Write down the facts about the event and its success.


If you don't have any experience with graphic design, you may want to hire someone to help you with portfolio layouts. Print everything on quality paper, laminate it and stick it in a professional quality envelope.

, Attend conferences and bridal fairs, and introduce yourself as a wedding planner assistant. Many people in the wedding industry believe many of these positions are made available informally to contacts rather than posted on job boards.


Create business cards with this title. Bring your portfolio with you, in case you find a job prospect.

, Network with people on the site, post on their job boards and attend events.


Note your professional organization on your business card.

, A well-edited wedding blog can show your passion for the industry. Keep on top of the newest wedding fashions and put the site on your business card and portfolio.

, Some wedding planners may be willing to offer a trial run of an assistant position. If they are not hiring, ask them to keep your resume on file.

, Although there are not always a lot of wedding planner job postings, you may find occasional positions on Craigslist, CareerBuilder, Indeed, SimplyHired or another site.


Look for work as both a wedding planning assistant and as a personal assistant to a wedding planner. A planning assistant is likely to work more independently than a personal assistant, but either job is a good entry-level position in the wedding industry.

, Let wedding planners know that you'd be willing to aid them when large accounts come along. You will be able to gain experience and prove your worth to prospective employers until you find a full-time position.

, If you are not finding many job positions and there aren't many wedding planners in your area, then you are less likely to find a planner assistant job. Search job boards in larger cities and move to a more populated or destination wedding area that has more prospects.

Contact event planners.",How to Zone Agricultural Land for Use As a Wedding Venue," Your neighbors can be your strongest supporters or your most bitter rivals if you want to rezone your property. The best way to potentially get them on your side is to keep them informed of your plans every step of the way.In the early stages, let them know about your plans and reassure them that you will keep them informed on developments.
Give them the chance to ask questions, and do everything you can to assure them that events you host won't cause any disturbances to them or their property.
Ask your neighbors for their support. You may want to right up a brief contract that summarizes any agreements you've made on which their support is conditional.
For example, your neighbors may be concerned about traffic and noise during late hours. You could promise them that you would not host a wedding with more than 50 guests and that all events will end by 10 p.m.;
, Each county has particular forms you'll have to complete to have your agricultural land rezoned for use as a wedding venue. Read the forms carefully to make sure you have the right ones before you start the application process.Many counties have conditional permits that you can get to host special events. These applications typically are less complicated, and may have a higher chance of being approved.
Conditional permits do restrict the number of events you can host each year, as well as the dates and times you can host events.
You may be able to download applications and instructions from the website of your county clerk or county zoning board.
If you can't find a website, contact your county's planning department or zoning board to find out how to get a rezoning application.

, Your application requires information about you, your property, and your proposed use or development of your property. Make sure to answer every question thoroughly, and contact an attorney or other land use expert if you have any difficulties.You'll need the legal description of your property as it appears on your deed, including your parcel number or any metes and bounds description.
In some circumstances, it may be necessary to get a professional survey of your property, particularly if you plan to use locations near property boundaries and ownership is disputed.
Keep in mind that it may not be necessary to have all of your property rezoned, just the parts you plan to use as a wedding or special event venue.
For example, if you have a rustic barn on your property that you want to use as a wedding venue, but the barn and surrounding property only occupy one of your 20 acres, the remaining 19 acres don't necessarily need to be rezoned.

, Zoning boards or planning commissions have specific submission guidelines that can vary greatly among states and even counties within states. Make sure you're following the correct procedures and have included all required documentation.In addition to the application form itself, you may also be responsible for submitting a copy of your deed.
The office where you submit your application should have a checklist of documents that constitute a complete application.
Make at least one copy of everything you submit with your application for your own records before you turn them into the office.
You'll be expected to pay a fee when you submit your rezoning application, which typically amounts to a little over a thousand dollars.
Typically when you submit your application, the date for your hearing will be scheduled. It also may be scheduled after your application is processed, in which case you should receive a notice in the mail.

, While the board typically provides general public notice of all upcoming zoning hearings, you may be responsible for providing specific, personal notice of your rezoning application to owners of neighboring property.The zoning board will have forms that must be used to provide the required notice, as well as procedures you must follow. You also must provide them with a full copy of your application.
There will be a deadline by which your neighbors must be notified of the hearing, typically expressed as a certain number of days or weeks before the hearing is scheduled to take place.
Keep in mind that if you're responsible for providing notice, you typically also must present proof of service to the board, either before or at the hearing.

, Zoning hearings can be complex and intimidating proceedings, particularly if you've never been to one and are unfamiliar with the zoning board generally. An attorney can help you navigate the proceedings, giving you a better chance of having your application approved.Look for a local attorney who has experience representing rezoning applicants before the zoning board or planning commission.
Someone with familiarity of the zoning board members will have a good idea of the types of information you'll need and the arguments that may persuade certain members.
If you don't know where to start finding an attorney, consider looking at information from past zoning hearings and check the names of any attorneys who were present.
You also may be able to find an attorney by searching on the attorney's directory on the website of your state or local bar association.

, You should have a written notice from the zoning board that lets you know the date, time, and location of your hearing. Make sure you arrive a half hour or so before the time listed so you have time to find the correct hearing room and get settled.There typically isn't a dress code for zoning hearings, but you still want to look clean and professional. While you don't necessarily have to wear a suit, consider wearing the type of clothing you'd wear to a job interview.
Before your hearing, organize the documents you plan to bring so you can find them easily.
You also should write an outline with detailed notes of what you plan to say to the board or commission when it's your turn to present your proposal.
Think about the questions you might possibly be asked. If you have time, you may want to attend another zoning hearing to get a feel for the procedures and the types of questions the board members will ask.

, Since it's your application, the board typically will hear from you first. You'll explain to the board what zoning change you want them to make and why. Go into detail about the types of events you want to host and any preparations you've made.Typically your hearing will begin with a swearing-in ceremony. Everything you say during the hearing must be the truth, and you face perjury charges if you lie or distort the truth over the course of your presentation or while answering any questions.
After you are sworn in, you typically will be asked to give a brief presentation. During this presentation, you essentially will summarize your application and the reasons you want to have your property rezoned.
Explain to the board everything about the events you plan to host at your farm if your application is granted, including the size of those events and the space you have available.
You may want to present photos of the structures and areas you plan to use as a wedding venue as well.

, Members of the board typically will have questions for you about your application. Any neighbor or other member of the public who opposes your application also will have the opportunity to explain their position.Zoning hearings are unlike any court proceeding in that anyone who is present and has an interest in the proceeding can ask questions of anyone else.
This means that in addition to the board members themselves, you may find yourself fielding questions from neighbors or community members regarding your proposed use of your property.
Other people also have the ability to make statements or argue against your application. When others are speaking, it's important not to interrupt or even mutter comments under your breath.
If you have something to say in response to someone's statement, raise your hand and wait until you are recognized by the board before you speak.

, The zoning board typically won't let you know whether they've decided to grant your proposal immediately after the conclusion of the hearing. Rather, expect to get written notice of the decision within a few weeks.Most zoning boards have a deadline for a decision, so you typically won't have to wait more than 45 days to find out whether your application has been approved.
Typically the board will mail you written notice. If your application is approved, the decision will include details about your new zoning or permit status.
If your application was denied, the notice should include information on how you can appeal the decision and what steps you need to take next.

, If the zoning board didn't approve your application, you usually have the opportunity to appeal that decision to an appeals board or other authority. However, if you want to appeal you typically must do so quickly.Typically you have 30 days or less to complete your forms and file your appeal with the appropriate office. Review your zoning board decision notice for details.
In some counties the appeal will be made to a judge in the county court. If you haven't already hired an attorney, you should strongly consider hiring one to handle your appeal.

, Rezoning your agricultural land for use as a wedding venue is only the start. Before you can host events, you may have to make various improvements on your property so it complies with safety and accessibility regulations.Safety and liability are important concerns, especially if you're incorporating a structure such as a barn.
Make sure your liability insurance is up to the task of protecting you if someone is injured at an event.
Narrow bridges or steps may cause accessibility concerns. You may have to build additional entries that are accessible for wheelchairs and other disabled guests.
Parking also should be a concern. The size of event you can host may well be determined by the number of cars you can accommodate. You may want to consider paving a parking area, as rain can cause inhospitable conditions for wedding guests forced to park in a gravel lot of a field.
If you're using a structure, have a fire marshal or other inspector certify the number of people you can safely host in the structure and ensure other regulatory requirements are met.

, You may need other licenses to host weddings, depending on the rules where your property is located. The types of gatherings you plan to host also may play a factor.For example, if you plan on hosting receptions at which alcohol is served, you may need a permit to serve alcohol on your property.
You may need other permits for late-night gatherings or if the wedding party wants to have a bonfire or set off fireworks.
Review the list of licenses in your area and apply for the ones you want. If there are some you'd rather not deal with, make a note to include it as a restriction in your contract.

, Before you start booking events, you need a basic contract that outlines the terms and conditions of renting your property. This contract should incorporate any restrictions that are defined by the size of your property or local regulations.If you don't have certain licenses, your potential clients should understand that those things are not permitted if they want to hold their event on your property.
For example, if you don't have an alcohol license, this should be included in your contract. Potential clients who want alcohol at their reception may prefer to hold the ceremony at your location and the reception elsewhere.
You also need to note the days of the week your property is available, and the times of day events can take place.
List limitations on the party size you can accommodate, as well as any other restrictions or limitations.
The contract also should include any provisions regarding early access to the location to set up before the event, and your requirements for cleaning up after the event.
Settle on a price to rent your property for a wedding or other events, and state it specifically in your contract.

, Once all your legal prerequisites are satisfied and you're ready to start booking events, the best way to find new clients is to meet and develop strong relationships with wedding and event planners in your area.The easiest way to find event planners is to do a basic internet search. Once you find event planners in your area, review their websites to get a feel for the types of events they frequently plan.
If you see an event planner who focuses on rustic occasions, or has previously planned a wedding on a farm or in a barn, put them on the top of your list.
When you contact event planners, give them an opportunity to come and tour your property and take pictures so they can sell it to potential clients.
You might want to consider offering a discount to your first few clients just to get your property out there and help spread the word.

Make Sure Everyone is Early.,
Capture those Memories.",How to Throw a Surprise Bridal Shower," Select a date when all the important people can make it, including the bride-to-be. So, know everyone’s availability and plan accordingly.;
, You love your girlfriend, but it will be to her own advantage if you lie to her in this situation. Your friend will figure out that you’re planning a party no matter how hard you try to hide it (or no matter how many people on Facebook you tell not to say anything). So, tell her it’s a party – just don’t say that it’s a bridal shower party. Make up a birthday, anniversary, going-away, etc. party.

, A rental projector is the perfect way to showcase home videos or collages of photos of the bride- and groom-to-be. Order the rental projector as soon as you know the date of the bridal shower. This way, you’ll ensure that the company has one reserved for you and that it gets to your house on time.

, The groom-to-be is the perfect person to help you plan the bridal shower. He’ll have those sought-after pictures that you want for your rental projector collage. Plus, he’ll be in on the conspiracy to help you avoid having the bride-to-be find out about the bridal shower.

, Regular party guests should have an earlier invite time than the bride-to-be. Make it at least 1 to 2 hours earlier since you know that most people are going to be late. This shouldn’t be too much of a problem since your guest of honor still thinks she’s going to some type of party. Everyone, however, will want to see her face when she walks in.

, Have all the cameras and video cameras ready for when the happy couple walk through the door, and capture as many memories of the day as possible. You can always use these for your next projector collage, for example, their first anniversary party.

Consider the season.,
Decide on contrasting or complementary colors.,
Choose three to four colors.,
Give your guests a hint on color block invitations.",How to Use Color Blocking in Your Wedding Decor1," When you’re choosing the colors to use in your color blocked wedding, consider what season you’re getting married in. This will give you a good place to start for selecting colors.


Winter weddings tend to use whites, blues, purples, and sometimes a pop or two of red.
Spring wedding color schemes usually use pastel colors – pinks, purples, yellows, oranges, blues, and greens.
Summer weddings usually utilize bright, vivid colors. There are a lot of options here – reds, oranges, yellows, bright pinks, purple, and turquoise are all common summer wedding colors.
Fall wedding color options include reds, yellows, oranges, and browns.;
, Once you know which seasonal colors you like, decide if you want a contrasting or complementary color scheme. Contrasting colors are those those found next to each other the color wheel and can include different shades of the same color. Complementary colors can be found opposite each other on the color wheel.


For example, purple and yellow, and pink and green are complementary colors because they are opposites on the color wheel.
Contrasting colors include red and orange, and purple and blue. They also include shades of the same color, like burgundy, bright red, and pink.

, Once you’ve got an idea of which sorts of colors you might use for color blocking, you’ll need to narrow it down. Three to four colors will give you plenty of variety without overwhelming your guests.


For example, if you're leaning towards a summer color theme using complementary colors, you could choose orange, blue, purple, and yellow.
If you're selecting a spring theme with contrasting colors, you could use purple and pink (which are next to each other the color wheel), but use a couple of different shades of each color.

, Once you’ve selected your colors, you can use them in your invitations. This gives your guests a hint as to your wedding theme, and can also help you work out your design before you tackle things like ceremony and reception décor."

Use color blocked fabric for your ceremony backdrop.,
Color block your altar flowers.,
Use blocks of color for your ceremony aisle.,
Color block your bridal party's attire.",How to Use Color Blocking in Your Wedding Decor2," Depending on where your ceremony is taking place, you might have the chance to use color blocking near where you’ll say your vows. Use big chunks of the colors you’ve selected to frame your ceremony location.For example, if you’re saying your vows under a canopy, you can drape the canopy with bolts of fabric in the colors you’ve selected.
For example, if you've chosen orange, yellow, purple, and blue, you could drape purple and yellow fabric next to one another on one side of the canopy. Drape the blue and orange on the other side.

, If you’re getting married in a church, consider placing flower arrangements on either side of the altar. To color block flowers, use only one color in each arrangement, rather than multiple colors in one arrangement.For example, if you're using different shades of purple and pink for your color blocked theme, set up one floral arrangement that includes many shades of pink on one side of the altar, and another in shades of purple on the other.
You could also place two arrangements - one pink and one purple - on either side of the article.

, You can also color block your aisle by laying down flower petals, feathers, or fabric organized by color. This not only allows you to use color blocking, but it also draws your guests' eyes to the front of the ceremony venue.


So, for example, if your colors are red, orange, and yellow, you could lay out horizontal strips of red material, orange material, and yellow material, and then keep repeating the pattern all the way up the aisle. You could also run long, vertical strips of material in the those colors side by side, running all the way up the aisle., You can also use color blocking in what you ask your bridesmaids and groomsmen to wear. You can ask your bridesmaids to wear all one color, and the groomsmen to wear ties and vests in one of the other colors, or you can mix the colors up.


For example, you could give your attendants the option of choosing which of the colors you've chosen they want to wear. You can also choose bridesmaids dresses that use more than one of the colors you've chosen. Color-blocked bridesmaids dresses are popular currently, and easy to find.

Color block your table linens.,
Use contrasting centerpieces.,
Color block your appetizers.,
Color block your drinks and glasses.,
Color block your wedding cake.",How to Use Color Blocking in Your Wedding Decor3," Since your guests’ tables will take up the most visual space in your reception venue, they’re a great place to use color blocking. There are many variations for using color blocking in table linens, and it will give your reception area a visual punch.For example, at each table, you could use one color table cloth and a contrasting color for the napkins.
You could also use the same color for all of the table linens, but make the chair covers a contrasting color.
You can also make each table its own color but have it contrast with the tables around it. So, for example, one table might have red napkins, a red table cloth, and red chair covers, but the tables on either side might be completely orange and completely yellow.
If you’re using one long table, instead of multiple smaller tables, break the table up into colored sections.

, When you’re designing the centerpieces for your tables – whether they’re flower arrangements or something else – follow the same theme as the rest of your table. It brings the color blocking theme to the whole table and also draws your guests’ eyes to the center.For example, if you have contrasting napkins and table cloth colors, match the centerpiece to the napkins. You'll have the most of the tablecloth color (since it's so big), and you’ll want the centerpiece to stand out. It also ties the whole table together.
You can also make the centerpieces match all of the linens on the table if you’re doing a monochromatic design at each table.
You also have the option of using all of the colors in your theme in the centerpieces. Arrange like colors together but feel free to use multiple colors. So you might have red roses, surrounded by yellow ribbons, and accented by orange stones.

, If you’re having a hors d’oeuvres or cocktail reception, you can still use color blocking. When you’re planning your food, consider what colors might come up. Then ask your catering company to arrange them according to color.


For example, you might arrange your smoked salmon appetizers so they are next to the grilled asparagus (pink and green are opposites on the color wheel).
You can also arrange appetizers according to complementary colors. So you could do a red appetizer like tomato bruschetta next to an orange appetizer like grilled apricots, which are next to a yellow appetizer like lemon mousse (these colors are next to each other on the color wheel., You can even incorporate color blocking into the drinks you serve at your wedding. Consider serving drinks with recipes that create different colors, or using differently colored sugar or salt rims on your glasses.For example, if you’re serving a red punch, you can provide your guests with glasses rimmed in purple, yellow, or orange sugar.
Even if the drinks aren’t set out ahead of time, you can color block the drinks available to your guests. You can ask the bartender to only serve certain cocktails – and you can plan the color of your cocktails to complement one another. This way, even half empty glasses on tables look great in your photos!

, The dessert table is usually one of the focal points of the reception. Your wedding cake – if you have one - can be color blocked. You can achieve this look by using one color per tier, so the outside of the cake reflects the color block theme. Or you can ask your baker to color block the inside of the cake by using colored layers of cake.If you’re doing an alternative to a wedding cake – cupcakes, or a candy bar, for example – you can still use color blocking. Simply group the same colors together. So you might have chocolate candies on your dessert table, but keep them grouped by foil color. The same goes for cupcake frosting.

Pick a goal number.,
Think future, not past.,
Remember, you don't have to invite every single family member.,
Accept you may hurt someone's feelings.,
Cut it altogether.",How to Trim Down the Size of Your Wedding Guest List,"


You may be limited to a certain number of guests based on the capacity of your ceremony site or reception hall. While every guest you invite won't attend, you need to have an absolute maximum number. You need to know the most guests you will be able to invite before you can start trimming your guest list.
Cost may also determine how many people you will be able to invite. Determine how much it will cost per person and set a budget based on the most you are willing, and able, to spend.;
,


Just because you were best friends with people in elementary school doesn't mean you have to invite them to your wedding if you don't have contact with them anymore. Even good friends from high school and college can be left off the list if you haven't been close with them since. A good rule to go by is if you haven't talked to them in the last year, and you don't see yourself hanging out with them in next five years, then you probably can leave them off of your wedding guest list.

,


Every family has distant relatives that live far away and aren't as close with the rest of the family. Yes, you may be related to them, but no, you don't have to invite them to your wedding if you are trying to trim down your wedding guest list. The truth is, they may not even find out about the wedding until way after the fact if they aren't in touch with those family members you are closer with.

,


Someone is bound to be hurt he or she wasn't invited to your wedding, especially if, at one time, you were invited to his or her wedding. Your relationship with that person may have been different at the time he or she got married or perhaps he or she wasn't as careful about the guest list. Either way, you can't worry about how everyone is going to feel about your decision. If you feel like you can leave someone off of your wedding guest list, then you are probably making the right decision.

,


If it is getting too difficult to narrow down your wedding guest list, elope. This way you can just take your closest friends and family with you and not have to worry about making all of the decisions it would take to trim down your guest list.

Insert the stakes in the ground.",How to Secure a Wedding Aisle Runner on the Grass for an Outdoor Wedding," Lay out your runner, starting at the altar area & secure the ends with one aisle runner stake at each corner.;
, Space them evenly along the aisle sides.

, The stakes should be carefully inserted into the ground, with the flat design overlapping the aisle runner.


The stakes should be inserted into the ground, not through the runner, gently holding it, without tearing it. A pack of 12 each aisle runner stakes is enough for one at each corner and four along each side of the runner.
For best insertion into the ground, hold the long ""stick"" of the stake with one hand & gently push the stake into the ground, while gently pushing on the bend, not on the top.
For best placement of the aisle runners ends, gently fold the edge of both ends of the runner before placing the stake. It is recommended to fold the runner end approx. 1 inch (2.5 cm). This will create a smoother, attractive edge & give slightly more material bulk for the stakes to hold onto.

Have fun.",How to Throw a Goth Wedding," Are you doing it for attention? To look cool? If you are, then stop right there. Having a Gothic wedding because you think it would be cool isn't the way to go. If you are doing this because you have been a member of the Gothic subculture ever since you are a teenager and it is your lifestyle, don't hesitate and go ahead.;
, If you're having a Gothic wedding, you may want to have it at a Gothic castle. This helps set the mood and gives it a good outlook. If there are none in your area, you may want to think about finding one in your region and staying overnight before the wedding.

, What do you want your guests to be eating? Ask around and make sure you get something on there everyone will enjoy but remember that you can't please everyone. Just go for the choice you think would be the most enjoyed.

, Not everyone is a fan of themes, but some people are. Since this would be a Gothic wedding you may chose something to do with a Gothic movie, or even a Nightmare Before Christmas wedding. Be creative this idea, you're already having a Gothic wedding and that's unique enough.

, Just because it's going to be a Gothic wedding, doesn't mean you have to have it on Halloween. You could if you wanted because it'll be great but it's up to you depending if your venue will hold it on that date.

, You can have your wedding reception in a church (depending on if you're religious) or a registry office. Or you might just decided you want to get married at your venue. It's up to you to decide.

, You need to decide how many people are coming, how many adults and how many children (if you want children that is). You also need to decide if your venue too small or too big for them. You want a reasonable enough room. If you think your venue is too small then you could try to find another room within the venue or if you wanted, you could have a marquee outside (just wish for a nice day). If all else fails, you're going to have to find somewhere else.

, Your bridesmaids should be your closest girlfriends for example, your sister or your daughter. Your fiances best man could be his best trustworthy friend.

, The colour you want for your bridesmaids dresses is going to be the same colour as the ties of the suits for your men. The groom could wear a different colour to make it easier to point out that he is the groom.

, You usually send them out 6 weeks before your wedding. There are hundreds of different designs and templates you could have for your wedding invitations. You could have them darkly coloured.

, This the part where you think about what you (as the bride) is going to wear. As you are having a Gothic wedding, you may what to have a dark coloured dress. Black with purple or red is a great choice, but it doesn't mean you have to have it that way. Find lots of different styles and try them on. Some styles are:


The Mermaid wedding dress (this is if you have a nice figure and you want to show it off)
The Princess style wedding dress
The A-line wedding dress
The Empire wedding dress
Grecian wedding dress
The Sheath or Column wedding dress
The Ball Gown wedding dress

, You need to chose:


Tiara, jacket or veil (not all of them because it doesn't look right + there's too much).
Shoes; heals or flats?

, You might have to find someone to do these for you as it will look nice as it's done professionally. There are tons of styles to chose from and there will be a one that fits you. Don't be afraid to wear dark make-up either. Wearing make-up that you feel comfortable in will make you feel confident with yourself. This is important for your day in the spotlight!

, You might like your men to wear a darker colour such as black or grey. Most people wouldn't want men to wear black suits because they are usually worn at funerals and represent death but in a Goth's case, black represents beauty.

,
Buttonholes
Photographer (you want to make sure they have experience and make sure they have a portfolio because they can be very expensive).

, Chose your wedding cake, you have many different styles. Chose how many layers you want on your cake and what flavour they are going to be. You could chose from a number of styles for example cupcakes or tiered. You could always have a fake tier to keep the cost down - not everyone is made of money.

, You could have anything you want. For example, you could have


Candles
Feathers
Flowers
Sparkly decoration... use your imagination. Your decorations can be as small and as big as you want. Just make sure guests can see each other.

, If your venue is close enough, you could have something traditional for example a horse and carriage. If you want to be more modern, you could go for a limousine. Some other ideas are:


Helicopter (unique)
Rolls Royce or Bentley (classic cars if you didn't want a limousine)... and so on. Don't be afraid to turn up in what you want, you could even get there in a tractor, there's nothing stopping you!

, If you're going to have a Gothic wedding, you'll want some Gothic music right? But you still want people to dance, so make sure you don't always have Gothic music playing. Playing a bit of Lady Gaga or P!NK will never hurt anyone! There are however some gothic or goth friendly songs that are also club worthy such as suicide commando, combichrist, ayria, blutengel. (future pop is a good genre.) Some good suggestions for gothic music are:


Switchblade Symphony
Clan of Xymox
Bauhaus
Siouxsie and the Banshees.... you want to make sure you have a wide range of artists on there. You might even decide to have a live singer. Not everyone has a DJ.

, Throwing any wedding shouldn't feel like a chore. This article is for people who wouldn't know where to start. You don't have to completely follow this article step by step either, for some it may just be a little lift.

Be aware that weddings may trigger family issues.",How to Resolve Wedding Disputes with Your Fiance or Fiancee," If certain disputes regard serious discussion, a sit down talk may be necessary. Before talking over major disagreements with your partner, pause to gain perspective. Try to understand where they're coming from going into the conversation.Try to imagine how you would view the conflict as a third party. Imagine two of your friends are having the same disagreement. How would you feel as an outsider?
For example, maybe you always dreamed of getting married in your hometown. Your partner moved a lot and does not really have as clear a sense of home. You feel, therefore, your hometown is a more sentimental choice for you and you should therefore have your way.
What would you say to a friend having this disagreement? You may say something like, ""Maybe it makes your partner a little sad that he didn't have a clear home growing up. He may not want to think about bad memories of moving on his wedding day."";
, Your wedding is the beginning of your marriage so it's important to learn good communication skills now. If an issue is important to you, do not be passive about it. You do not have to be aggressive, but you should be able to clearly and assertively bring up an issue that's bothering you.Use ""I""-statements that focus on your feelings instead of blaming or accusing your partner. For example, do not say, ""You won't let me have the wedding in my hometown and that upsets me."" Instead, say, ""I feel sad that I won't get married in my hometown like I always dreamed.""
When asserting yourself, express what you want but also let your partner know you're willing to compromise. For example, ""I understand you have your reasons for not wanting to get married in Ohio, but maybe we could reach some kind of middle ground.""

, There are always two sides in a conflict. After you've stated your case, allow your partner to talk. At first, listen with the goal of empathizing and understanding your partner's perspective. Make sure your partner feels heard and understood before you offer a solution.It can help to repeat what your partner says to make sure you understand. You can also ask questions for clarification when necessary.
For example, ""So, you don't want to get married in my hometown because you're worried you'll feel like an outsider there? Is that what you're saying?""

, Even if your intentions are good, you can sometimes accidentally give negative signals when listening. Be aware of your body language so you look attentive and caring while talking over differences. Maintain eye contact and sit still so you look like you're paying attention. Fidgeting or glancing around the room can make you look impatient., Once you've both expressed yourself, brainstorm together to think of a solution. See this as a collaborative effort. Try to find a solution with your partner instead of suggesting one.Start off by saying something like, ""Okay, so we both have valid reasons for wanting a particular location. Do you think there's some way we could compromise?""
Talk it out together, remembering to be empathetic to your partner's needs and wants—this may alter your perspective. Figure out if there's a way to change certain wedding details so you can both feel your needs are being met.

, Often, couples fight over finances during wedding planning. One of you may want to spend more on your outfit, decorations, or another aspect of the wedding. Sit down and figure out a reasonable budget together and try to figure out how to spend money in a way that's mutually beneficial.Be reasonable about finances. Wedding spending should be more or less equitable. If your partner is not spending a fortune on their outfit for the big day, you should not overspend on this aspect of your wedding.
Opt to spend your budget primarily on things that benefit you both. You can splurge a little on the reception, which all your friends and family members can enjoy. You can also spend on something like your honeymoon, which is for both of you.

, Religion often plays a big role in regards to how a wedding unfolds. You and your spouse may have different religious traditions and expectations regarding a wedding. If you make a genuine effort to understand one another's cultures, religious differences may be able to be accommodated.However, it is important to incorporate aspects of both of your religions into your wedding ceremony. For example, if your partner is Jewish and you are Catholic, then you could have a rabbi and a priest officiate the wedding.


Talk openly about your personal religious beliefs and traditions. Make it clear which traditions are very important for your wedding and which ones you do not adhere to as strictly.
Make sure you respect your fiancé or fiancée’s religion as well. If there are religious traditions that are very important to them, allow them to follow these rules on your wedding day.
Take this as an opportunity to learn more about your spouse. See it as less of a source of conflict and more as a chance to grow closer.

, No two people have exactly the same taste. You and your future spouse may disagree on things like flower arrangements, color schemes, and other aspects of your wedding. It's important that you're willing to compromise here. Remember, taste is subjective and this is just as much your partner's wedding day as yours.It can be helpful for you to each write down how much certain aspects of the wedding mean to you on a scale of one to ten. Maybe flower arrangements are a ten for you, but centerpieces for the reception are a two.
You may find that certain details mean a lot to you, but do not matter to your partner. If flowers are very important to you, your partner may let you choose flowers. If you don't care what the centerpieces look like, allow your partner to choose them.
If both of you ranked something as a high priority, compromise here. For example, maybe you both have strong opinions on wedding colors. In this case, both of you may have to compromise and settle for your second choice. Instead of going with a color scheme one of you hates, pick colors you both like.

, Where you get married can be a very sensitive issue. You both may want to get married in your hometown, for example. You may have to work out a reasonable compromise on location, especially if one location is very inconvenient for friends and family members.You can agree to a destination wedding, choosing a location that's a center point between your families. You can also have the wedding in one place and the reception in another.

, For weddings, it's sometimes best to pick your battles. Each time a conflict arises, ask yourself, ""What am I really upset about?"" Some details may mark underlying tensions, which should be talked out. Others are fairly minor.For example, maybe you hate the idea of your partner wearing a particular set of cufflinks. While they love them, you find them tacky. Is this really about anything other than the cufflinks? If not, it may be better to simply let this go. It's your spouse's wedding to, and they're entitled to make certain choices.
Other issues may mark deeper sources of conflict. For example, maybe your partner is against getting married in your hometown and you don't understand why. While you would be willing to compromise on this, you do want an explanation. It may be good to talk this out.

, If you can't let something go, it may be indicative of a deeper conflict. Try to identify what that is when consider the role you want in wedding planning. Ask yourself what you're really upset about and how to best address this.For example, maybe your partner wants an even number of bridesmaids or groomsmen for each person. However, you have a lot more close friends and do not want to leave anyone out.
Think about any underlying issues that may be at play. For example, maybe your partner is slightly more introverted than you and you sometimes feel your social life is hampered by this. The bridesmaids/groomsmen issue may be related to this and is something to have a conversation about before the wedding.

, A lot of times, small issues blow up because one or both of you does not feel valued. Maybe you don't mind that much that your partner chose the wedding colors, but you feel they made the decision too hastily and without consulting you. It may be a good idea to calmly let them know you would like a bigger part in decision making in the future.Be specific. There may be some areas that are not important you, and where you don't mind letting your partner take the reins. However, if certain areas are of high importance, make this clear to avoid conflict.

, A lot of times, squabbles over the family attending the wedding indicate hidden conflicts. Maybe one of you feels a bigger sense of obligation to your family. Maybe you feel your family provides more financially than your partner's family, and sometimes feel taken advantage of. Always examine your feelings regarding conflicts with your partner's family. They may reveal something that could be a source of dispute during your marriage.Compromise on what roles your family members will play in the wedding. For example, maybe your partner wants his family in the wedding party, but you just want your family in the audience. Would you be okay with your family playing less of a role in the wedding, or should the two of you change plans to accommodate everyone?
Think about why family issues are becoming heated. This can indicate a deeper problem you should address. For example, you don't want your partner's brother as groomsmen because his behavior is often very difficult. This could be an issue down the road at holidays and other events. Talk this over with your partner.

, Weddings often bring people from the past back into your lives. If your spouse, say, invites an ex or a friend you never liked, this may bother you. However, work on letting these things go. Remember, you should focus on the present.Pause and ask yourself how often you'll see certain wedding guests. If your partner invites an ex who rubs you the wrong way, will you really see that much of them after the wedding? It may be best to let these kinds of conflicts go.

, Weddings can often bring out details about you and your partner’s family backgrounds and this may lead to conflicts that otherwise haven't been raised before. Be sure to communicate effectively with your partner, share relevant family history, and give yourself plenty of planning time to resolve these issues before your wedding.

Fold the wedding gown carefully, without creasing it.,
Use acid free tissue paper to place between each of the folds of the dress to help prevent creasing or the fabric touching other parts of the dress.,
Once folded, wrap the wedding gown one more time completely with the unbleached muslin prior to inserting in the box for storage.,
Once boxed, slide your wedding dress packaged box under your bed or in a drawer or on the shelf of a closet.,
While some people choose to store wedding dresses in specialty garment bags and store them hanging or laying flat, boxing your wedding gown is the best choice for long-term storage and preservation.,
When you are ready to reuse the gown or remove it from the box packaging, simply reverse the process and be careful not to snag or catch the dress or pull too roughly when taking it out of the box.",How to Preserve and Store Your Wedding Gown," Wrap the sleeves under the bodice of the bridal gown, and then fold that back over the skirt, then wrap the skirt up and over the top of the bodice. After this, you can continue to fold the gown until it will neatly fit into the box snugly, but not too tightly. However, remember not to fold creases. The gown should be folded loosely.;
, Since many wedding gowns use special stitching or beads, sequins and pearls, you do not want these items to scratch or snag satin or silk fabrics when folded, and the tissue paper between folds will help prevent this.

, This is a time-consuming process, so you don't want to package your dress until you are sure you will not need to remove it from the package again for some time. Wrapping and packaging your wedding dress over and over can damage the dress, so wait until you are truly ready to store and preserve your dress before you box it.

, The less light that can reach the dress while it is stored the better.

, The gown will probably need to be taken to a cleaners and pressed and refresh after storing it this way, but you will be able to avoid the musty, 'stored' feel and scent of a dress stored in garment bags or hanging but not used regularly.

, When you do remove it from the box, beside slight wrinkling of some material, your wedding gown should look every bit as good as it did the day you stored it, no matter how long you have stored it.

Select traditional invitations.,
Select casual invitations.",How to Print Your Own Wedding Invitations3," Traditional invitations include several enclosures (often called an invitation suite), including a wedding invitation, reception invitation and response card. Traditional invitations are printed on high quality paper and are ideal for formal weddings.

, Casual invitations may not include as many enclosures, and may direct guests to a website for additional information about the wedding. Casual invitations are ideal for a themed wedding or a less formal event. Casual invitations may feature embellishments and distinct paper designs.

"
"
Purchase an invitation suite.,
Purchase cardstock and matching envelopes.,
Purchase layering papers.,
Evaluate the paper color.,
Consider your paper preferences.,
Request paper samples before placing your order.",How to Print Your Own Wedding Invitations4," Many companies offer invitation kits that provide the invitations, enclosures and envelopes for wedding invitations. Invitation suites are available in many paper colors and designs, ranging from traditional formal invitations to casual themed invitations.


Order at least 20 to 25 percent more invitation suites than you plan to send. This allows for extra pieces in the event of mistakes as you are printing them. For example, if you plan to print 100 invitations, order 125 invitation suites.

, If you don't mind cutting your invitations and enclosures to the desired size, order cardstock and matching envelopes. This is a less expensive option than an invitation suite and offers design versatility.


Order at least 25 to 50 additional pieces of cardstock to allow for printing mistakes.
Order envelopes for the invitations and enclosures. An invitation suite comes with envelopes for the invitations and enclosures, but if you are making your own invitations from cardstock, you will need to order the envelopes separately. For example, if you want guests to mail back a response card, you need to supply an envelope that fits the response card. Some couples choose to use outer envelopes and inner envelopes. The outer envelopes are addressed, while the inner envelopes protect the invitation and enclosures. If you are using both outer and inner envelopes, be sure to order the correct quantities and sizes for your invitations.

, Add some visual interest and color to wedding invitations by layering the printed card on top of a different color cardstock. This makes the invitation appear to have a border, and results in a thicker invitation. The layering cardstock should be about 1/4-inch larger than the printed cardstock.


Do not add layering papers to pre-cut invitation suites, as the final invitation size may not fit in the envelopes provided with the invitation suite.

, Most standard wedding invitations are printed on a white or cream cardstock. However, there are different shade of white and cream. Consider whether you prefer a bright white, an eggshell, a light cream or an ivory tone for your invitations.


Mix and match color palettes to find colors that complement each other. If you choose to use layering papers or colored inks, evaluate how the colors look with the white or cream cardstock you choose before purchasing any paper.

, Environmentally conscious couples may want to choose 100% recycled with 30% post-consumer waste paper. Those who desire a luxurious feel to the paper may prefer 100% cotton paper. Couples who want a more dramatic invitation may choose textured paper.

, Most paper distributors will provide samples either free of charge or for a small shipping fee. The paper sample will allow you to evaluate the paper weight, color and texture.

Choose a word processing or design software to create your invitations.,
Select the fonts for the invitation.,
Determine the text alignment.,
Consider the line spacing.,
Add visual interest with graphic elements.,
Add color to your invitation design.",How to Print Your Own Wedding Invitations5," Professional desktop publishing or design software may be helpful in creating elaborate invitation designs. However, any word processing program can be used to create basic wedding invitations.

, A font is the typeface (or sometimes called lettering) used for your invitation. Most wedding invitations feature 2 fonts--1 script font and 1 block font. Do not use more than 2 different fonts or the invitation may be difficult to read.


Experiment with free fonts available for download online. Try different font combinations and font treatments, such as italics, lowercase and uppercase typeface.
Try different font sizes. The font size is how big the text appears on the invitation. Because fonts vary in typeface size, it is difficult to provide a suggested font size for invitations. As a rule of thumb, avoid font sizes smaller than 9 point. Consider using larger font sizes to highlight different parts of the invitation text, such as the names of the bride and groom.

, The text alignment is how the text is aligned or arranged on the invitation. Traditional wedding invitations feature center alignment. However, consider right or left justified alignments depending on your invitation design.

, Line spacing is the amount of space between the lines of text. If the line spacing is too far apart or too close together, the invitation will be difficult to read. Adjust the line spacing as necessary to meet your design needs.

, If you are not an artist or graphic designer, the easiest way to add graphic elements to a wedding invitation is through high-end clip art.


Look for clip art with resolutions of at least 300 dpi (dots per inch). Low resolutions graphics do not reproduce well and often appear blurry. For crisp, high quality graphics, use only high resolution images.
Incorporate graphic elements that carry out the theme of your wedding. If your wedding does not have a specific theme, consider images like florals, branches and Victorian flourishes to create invitations with timeless appeal.

, Evaluate the color scheme of your invitation as a whole, and then add carefully placed pops of color. Consider colored graphic elements like clip art or choose text in a color that complements the invitation design.


Consider adding color to the finished invitations with embellishments like ribbon or paper strips. Wrap a single ribbon around the invitation suite (with the invitation in front and the enclosures behind it) and secure with a piece of tape along the back of the invitation. You can also use patterned strips of paper or fabric instead of the ribbon to add color.

"
"
Print the invitations using your home printer.,
Pay a printing company to print the invitations for you.",How to Print Your Own Wedding Invitations6," Before you begin printing the final invitations, run a test print to make sure the invitation prints correctly.


Feed the cardstock into your printer. If you are printing many invitations, the printing process may take a while. Be patient and allow for plenty of time to print the invitations.
Stay by the printer while the invitations are printing. You will be able to notice the moment there is a printing problem, stop the printing process and not waste paper.
Purchase extra printer ink before beginning the printing process. You don't want to be halfway through printing your invitations and suddenly have to run to the store to get more ink.

, Evaluate the cost of the printer ink for your home printer compared to having the invitations printed at a local print shop. In some cases, it may be cheaper to have the invitations printed locally. Most printing companies require a .pdf of the invitation image in order to print it, but inquire about the file requirements at your local print shop.

Assemble the printed invitations.",How to Print Your Own Wedding Invitations7," This can be a good opportunity to involve family and friends in the wedding preparations. If you are involving others in the assembly process, be sure to provide a completed invitation as an example. Depending on your invitation, assembly simply may involve putting printed invitations in envelopes; or it may require mounting printed invitations on cardstock, adding enclosures and embellishments, and then placing invitation suites in envelopes.

Place the invitation on top of the background paper.,
Consider adding a ribbon.",How to Print Translucent Wedding Invitations," Most translucent wedding invitations are the same size as the background paper, although they can be smaller. You can print your own background paper, or you can use plain or patterned cardstock.
, You can do this with a paper guillotine or paper cutter, or you can ask a print shop to do it for you. Make the cuts as precise as you can., Go to the page set-up, and adjust the paper size to match your invitation. This ensures that it prints in the correct scale and proportions., You can download a template from the internet and fill it in, or you can design one from scratch. Play around with the fonts, sizing, alignment, and line spacing. Dark colors will show up the best, especially if the background will be dark.Some people fine that thinner fonts work better with vellum and acetate paper than thicker fonts., Depending on the program you are using, you should be able to get to this simply by clicking ""Print."" Don't print the test invitation just yet., Choose the type of print quality you want, based on the type of paper you are using. Next, select the paper size.Some people find that a draft setting works best for vellum and a normal setting works best for acetate., Vellum should be printed on the coated, less-shiny side. Acetate should be printed on the rough side.Find the printed side of vellum by licking your finger and taping both sides. The side that sticks is the coated side., Vellum and acetate are slippery, which can result in curling or jams. You can prevent these from happening by folding a strip of tape over the feeding edge of the paper. You can also tape a sheet of plain paper to the back using double-sided tape.Try to use removable or repositionable tape, if you can.

,, Most printers will have sliders on the sides of the tray. Push these closer or further apart until they are flush with your paper., Let the ink dry, then inspect it. This will help you see if there are any formatting, scaling, or alignment issues without wasting your pretty paper. If something is wrong with the printed invitation, try printing on the opposite side or changing the print quality settings., Set your printer to print however many sheets are in the tray, and hit print. Once the first batch is done, check your printer's ink level, and print your second batch. Keep doing this until you have printed all the invitations.Consider printing a few extras in case you mess up during assembly.

, This is especially important if you are printing on vellum or acetate. If you don't let the ink dry or the way, the invitations will smear., This is only necessary for vellum or acetate. Carefully peel the tape away from the leading edge and discard it. If you taped paper to the back, peel that off., You can use solid-colored or patterned cardstock. You can also print out your own design.

Choose a color or pattern that works well with your wedding's theme.
Avoid dark colors or the lettering on the invitation won't show up.

, You can cut the background paper down until it is the same size as the vellum or acetate. You can also cut it a little larger, leaving a ½ to 1-inch (1.27 to 2.54-centimeter) border all around.

Use a paper cutter or paper guillotine to do this.

, Turn the invitation over so that the back is facing you. Run a strip of thin, double-sized tape along the top edge. You can also use glue dots instead., Align the top edges and run your finger across the tape. If you cut the background paper larger, make sure that your invitation is centered., This is not completely necessary, but it can give your invitation a nice touch. Punch two holes near the top of the invitation. Thread a piece of narrow ribbon through each hole, then tie the ribbon into a bow at the front of the invitation.

This works especially well with invitations that are the same size as the background paper.

Include braille on signs and placards.,
Ensure adequate lighting.,
Make sure the space can be easily navigated.,
Talk to the manager of the venue.,
Provide transportation.,
Consult your blind guests.",How to Prepare a Wedding Ceremony when Your Fiance Is Blind1," If your partner reads braille, it is a good idea to include braille writing on all of the written materials for your wedding (such as programs, placards, and signs). Many companies offer this service, or you can purchase a braille printer and make these materials yourself., If your partner (or guests) are visually-impaired, keeping the venue well-lit can make a huge different in their ability to navigate the space. You want to create as much light in the space as you can, and you want it to be evenly-distributed. Add standing lamps to the space, or increase the wattage on your bulbs.You can use incandescent, full spectrum, or florescent bulbs.
You can help reduce glare by covering windows with blinds or curtains, and avoiding shiny surfaces (like shiny tablecloths).
Using contrast (such as dark tablecloths with white dishes, or a dark rug on a tile floor) can also help make the space more accessible.

, When choosing a venue, make sure that it is a safe, accessible place for your partner. Make sure the aisle is flat and smooth, and that your partner will be able to navigate the space easily. Also, make sure that the seating is adequately spaced (with rows and chairs a little father apart from one another) to make the space more accessible for your guests., Speak the manager of your venue about what can be done to accommodate your partner and other blind guests. With the help of your partner, create a list your specific needs and bring this list to the manager. Find out everything they can do to make the day easier and more enjoyable for you and your guests.For example, you might inquire with the venue about your ability to bring guide dogs.
You might ask about adding additional lighting.
You might find out if you can customize and rearrange furniture in the space.
For best results, bring some of these needs and concerns to light before you book a venue.

, An effective way to help accommodate your blind guests (or any of your guests) is to provide transportation to and from the wedding. You might book a limo, bus, or car service, or simply asks some friends and family to volunteer. Providing transportation can make it easy for many different people to attend., If your partner is involved in the visually impaired and blind community, remember there will probably be several guests with visual impairments. Even if you have already tried to foresee what accommodations you could make for them, it is best to inquire about their needs. Every blind person is different, and there may be simple and reasonable ways for you to help make your guests comfortable.

Plan your flowers.,
Choose your food and desserts.,
Decide what to wear.,
Get your partner's opinion on visual aspects.",How to Prepare a Wedding Ceremony when Your Fiance Is Blind2," Since your partner may not have as much authority over the visual aspects of the wedding, let them take the lead on scents and tastes. Allow your partner to select the flowers for the wedding based on scents they enjoy. Work with a florist who is sensitive to your partner's disability., Give your partner the opportunity to express their opinions when it comes to the wedding menu. Select foods and dessert items that your partner enjoys. Work with a caterer and dessert-maker who offers ample test-testing opportunities., Gather together your partner's friends or siblings with whom they'd like to buy their clothes for the day. These important members of the wedding party should know your partner's tastes before going shopping.Make sure that the people they have chosen are used to working around the impairment. Remind them to describe things in detail.
Your partner can touch and feel the fabric and try things on but may want people to tell them about colors or fit.
Remember, they might not have a clear image of what they look like but they'll know if they feel beautiful.

, If your partner has partial sight or lost their sight they will probably have opinions on color schemes they particularly like. Involve them in such choices if they wish. If they were born without sight, let them choose scents and textures they have enjoyed and combine this with your own preferences."

Seek advice from other couples.,
Be open to changing some traditional aspects.,
Consider audio description.,
Decide who should know about their visual impairment.",How to Prepare a Wedding Ceremony when Your Fiance Is Blind3," Talk to couples who have been through something similar. They could offer invaluable tips and advice on how to make the wedding a success., You may think a veil over the bride's face is obligatory but, if it hinders them, your partner might prefer to opt out. Guide dogs and canes might not be the most common aspect of a traditional day, but if they help your partner to feel comfortable, incorporate them.If they are happy with the idea, ribbons or a small flower can dress the cane up. Some people like to invest in a new, decorative cane for the day.

, Audio description is a way in which many couples have made the day more special for themselves and their visually-impaired guests. The script is partially planned in advance and a description is given of details such as the dress, the beautiful venue, what is happening, etc. Talk to your local services for the visually impaired or look it up on the internet to find more information. A friend or relative might like to do this for you on the day.
Earphones are discrete and manageable.

, You may have guests who are not aware of your partner's visual impairment, such as relatives who have not met them yet. It is entirely up to you and your partner what you do in this situation. Ultimately your partner may not like people to know or may prefer people to be aware.

If you want them to know, add a detail on their wedding invite or call them beforehand. Your family may have informed them beforehand.
It is highly recommended that the organizers in the venue and the person who is officiating over the ceremony are aware of your partner's impairment. Special arrangements can then be discussed.

If you’re worried about budget concerns, consider hiring a part-time coordinator to help with wedding details or a day-of coordinator to help at the wedding.If you don’t want to hire a planner, find a comprehensive wedding checklist online to help you stay organized.;
, Weddings can be very expensive, especially if you don’t do the proper budget planning.For example, some people overspend because they invited more people than they could afford. Do thorough research by using online wedding calculators and talking to vendors to make sure you stay within your budget. Budget considerations include:


The number of guests you will invite
Whether or not you want to serve a meal
How much you want to spend on a venue
How much money you want to spend on your appearance

, The number of people you invite to your wedding will affect the kinds of venues you can use. Therefore, you need to create a guest list as soon as possible. Keep in mind that you may need to reduce the number of people you’re inviting if you can’t find a venue within your budget. When choosing people for your guest list, ask yourself:


Is this person a member of my family?
Have I spoken to this person within the last year?
Do I want children at my wedding?
Will this person be offended if I don’t invite them?, Popular and affordable wedding venues can fill up months in advance. Therefore, as soon as you have a tentative guest count, you need to go find a place to get married. Visit several different locations to find the right place for your wedding. While you’re looking, consider:


What time of day is the wedding? Does the venue look nice at that time?
Is the venue a full-service venue? Will they provide chairs, tables, and linens?
Is this venue big enough for my entire guest list?Does this venue require a deposit? Can I afford it?

, Once you’ve booked your venue, you can send out wedding invitations. Talk to a printing shop or go online to find wedding invitation services. Include the date and time, RSVP information, the ceremony location (if separate from the reception,) and the dress code.Some people also like to include their registry information.


Most people send out invitations six to eight weeks before the wedding.
If your wedding is more than six months away, consider sending a “Save the Date” announcement instead.Send out the invitations closer to your wedding date.

, A wedding vendor is anyone who provides a service for the wedding. When talking to potential vendors, make sure you fully understand their pricing and packages. You want to know up front if there are any hidden fees.Examples of potential vendors include:


Florists
Photographers
Bartenders (if your catering service doesn’t provide them)
A DJ or wedding band

, The officiant is the person that will lead your wedding ceremony. Usually, a religious leader or Justice of the Peace would fill this role. However, it’s become popular to have a close friend or family member officiate the wedding. Depending on where you live, there may be special laws dictating who you can use as a wedding officiant.A friend or family member may have to become ordained before officiating your wedding.
When choosing a wedding officiant, make sure you talk about getting a marriage license.


, If you’re planning on serving food at your wedding, you will need to reserve a caterer. Ask any representatives from your venue if they have any recommendations. These vendors will be familiar with the venue and its staff. When talking to potential vendors, ask questions such as:


“Are you available on the date of my wedding?”
“Are you legally able to serve alcohol?”
“Do your prices include the costs of servers and bartenders?”
“Do you have any price minimums I’m required to meet?”
“Can you provide rentals such as tables, chairs, and linens?”, Depending on your wedding cake budget, you may want to order your cake a few months in advance. This will allow you to talk about several different cake designs with the baker and even taste some cake samples. Keep in mind that large, complicated cakes are usually quite expensive.


When choosing a baker, look at their portfolio to be sure that you like their work.If the baker can’t deliver the cake to the wedding, designate a trusted family member to pick it up on the day-of.

, Most venues charge less money for Sundays than they do for other days of the week. You can potentially save thousands of dollars by moving the wedding to an unusual day. Popular alternative times include:


Sunday afternoon
Friday evening
Sunday morning, Most venues and vendors charge less money between December and March. Additionally, many vendors that might be fully booked during the wedding season will be available. Take advantage of this by having a winter wedding.Winter weddings are usually held indoors because of cold weather. If your preferred venue is outdoors, hold your wedding in the spring or summer.

, The less people you invite, the less money you’ll have to spend on food, alcohol, and chair rentals. If you’re having trouble keeping your guest list short, try limiting your guest list to family and close friends.Smaller weddings are usually more intimate than larger weddings.

, Resist the temptation to splurge on an elaborate four course meal. Instead, serve a small buffet with entrees and appetizers. If your wedding will be held in the evening, skip the entrees altogether and serve appetizers and small desserts instead.If you won’t be serving a full meal, you should indicate that on the invitation. For example, write “Appetizers and sweets will be served at the reception.""

, Buy your dress a few months in advance to allow time for alterations. Additionally, choose a dress that flatters your body type and fits in with your wedding vision. For example, if you’re getting married in a ballroom, you may not want to wear a simple shift dress. If you’re having trouble choosing a dress, bring some close friends or family members along to help you choose.


Purchase wedding shoes that match your dress.
Many bridal boutiques also offer bridesmaid dresses. If possible, you can kill two birds with one stone by shopping for bridesmaids dresses at the same time.

, Avoid getting beauty treatments the day before the wedding. If you have an adverse reaction, you won’t have time to recover from any rashes or swelling. Instead, get these treatments done a week or two before the wedding. Beauty treatments can include:


Hair waxing
Eyebrow shaping
Facials and other skin treatments
Hair coloring, If you have room in your budget, consider getting your hair and makeup done professionally. A professional makeup artist will be able to give you a flawless look that will last all day. Similarly, a professional hair stylist can do your hair quickly and securely.


If possible, book “in home” services that will allow the stylists to come to you.With some practice, you can also do your own hair and makeup.


, An emergency bag will help correct any wardrobe, makeup, or hair problems that may occur throughout the wedding. If you don’t have time to assemble this bag yourself, ask a trusted friend or family member to assemble it for you. This emergency bag can include:


Spare makeup for touch-ups
Deodorant
Headache medicine
Breath mints
A small sewing kit, No matter how beautiful your dress, makeup, and hair are, you won’t look good without a smile. However, after an hour or two of posing for pictures, you may have trouble looking genuine while smiling. If you need help faking one, try chuckling quietly just before the photo is taken., The Maid of Honor usually has more duties than a bridesmaid. This person will help the bride organize the bridesmaids dresses, host the bachelorette party, and attend the bride’s dress fitting.Be sure to talk to the bride about other specific duties she may want you to do. Other tasks can include:


Signing the marriage license as a witness
Holding the bride’s bouquet during the vows
Giving a toast after the ceremony

, Bridesmaids usually don’t have any specific duties. However, make an effort to be helpful and attend any events that the bride asks you to attend. Additionally, you may have to buy your own bridesmaid dress. Other obligations can include:


Assisting with the wedding planning
Attending the bachelorette party
Assembling party favors for the wedding guests, The Best Man has more responsibilities than the other groomsmen do. Usually, the best man plans the bachelor party and pays for the groom’s food and drinks.Make sure to talk with the groom about any other specific duties you may have. These duties can include:


Holding the rings before the ceremony
Driving the groom to the wedding location
Dancing with the Maid of Honor

, The groomsmen don’t usually have any specific responsibilities. However, be as helpful as you can to the groom, especially when setting up for the wedding. Additionally, you may be asked to chip in money for the bachelor party. Other duties can include:


Paying for your own suit rental
Ushering older guests to their seats
Decorating the honeymoon getaway car, Most weddings have a dress code. If you don’t follow the dress code, you risk looking sloppy and underdressed. Look on the invitation for the dress code. If you don’t see one, talk to the bride or groom’s family.


Black Tie events are very formal. Women wear long dresses and men wear tuxedos.
Wear cute cocktail dresses or a dress shirt and nice pants to a Semiformal event.
If you attend a Dressy Casual event, wear a fun dress or a nice shirt and pressed jeans., Different cultures have different rules about what’s appropriate to wear to a wedding. Follow these rules as best you can. If you aren’t sure what colors you can wear, contact the bride or groom’s family for advice. For example:


In the U.S., it is rude to wear white to a wedding if you’re not the bride.When attending an Indian wedding, avoid wearing black, white, or red.Only the bride should wear red at a Chinese wedding., If the wedding invitation included an RSVP, make sure to use it. The bride or groom’s family will be keeping track of the RSVP’s and using this information for budget planning. If you don’t send the RSVP, you may not be able to attend the wedding.If you lose the card, contact the bride or groom’s family for help.

Nail down the wedding details first.,
Look for bakeries.,
Set up an in-person consultation.,
Space out your tastings.,
Research cake designs.,
Brainstorm flavor combinations.,
Decide what kind of frosting you want.,
Adorn your wedding cake.,
Bring a helpful person along.,
Eat beforehand.,
Taste things separately.,
Take notes and ask questions.",How to Plan Your Wedding Cake Tasting," Before you begin researching bakeries, you should have your wedding venue, guest count, wedding date and time, and your wedding design (flower arrangements and colors) already set. Knowing these details will enable you and your baker to plan a wedding cake that fits your wedding vision., Ask married friends or family members about reputable bakeries in your area. Also, identify wedding cakes you have eaten and enjoyed in the past, and try to contact the bakery that made the cake. You can also search for bakeries in your local area online. Make a list of two or three bakeries that you are interested in., Do this by calling the bakeries on your list. When you set up the appointment, ask the bakery if there is a tasting fee and how the fee will be applied. Also, let the bakery know the number of people that will be attending the tasting.Make sure to ask if there are any additional fees if you decide to bring extra people along.
You should schedule your consultation six months before your wedding date.

, Try to avoid booking all of your appointments in one day or one weekend. Instead, space out your tastings over a couple of weeks. This way, you can avoid overloading your taste buds and make a better decision., Look for inspirational wedding cake designs online. Choose and save pictures of designs that you like. Bring these pictures with you to the tasting. You can also browse the baker’s portfolio to get more ideas.When browsing cake designs, keep in mind the size and shape of the venue, as well as your budget. For example, if your wedding is in a big venue, you may want a tiered cake.
Remember that the bigger the cake and the more ornate the design is, the more expensive the cake will be.

, Identify flavor combinations that you have already tried and liked, for example, lemon cake and raspberry filling. Also browse the bakeries' menus and identify flavor combinations that you would like to try. Write the flavor combinations down and bring the list with you to the bakery when you go to your tasting., When you are doing this, make sure to consider the time of day your wedding will take place at, as well as the season. For example, because buttercream frosting has a low melting point, you may want to choose a different type of frosting if your wedding will be outside during the summer.Buttercream, fondant, and cream cheese icing are common wedding cake icings.

, Think about how you would like your cake to be decorated. Many wedding cakes are adorned with flowers or fresh fruit. Additionally, if you have an heirloom or a vintage cake topper, make sure to let your baker know so they can incorporate it into the design.For example, many wedding cake designs incorporate a cascade of fresh or sugar flowers.
Instead of flowers, you can have an ornate design piped on the cake.

, Because they know the details of your wedding intimately, your wedding planner is a great person to bring along with you to your cake tasting. You could also bring along a family member or friend who understands your wedding day vision.If you decide to bring an additional person to the tasting, choose a supportive person who will let you make the ultimate decision.

, If you go to your cake tasting on an empty stomach, then it will be harder to choose flavors because everything will taste good. Going when you are not hungry will enable you to actually taste the cake, filling, and frosting flavors and decide which ones you like best.Eating cake while you are hungry may also cause you to feel sick.

, Make sure to taste the cakes, fillings and frostings separately. This way you can get a better idea of how things taste and what you like and dislike. Once you have tasted everything separately, then try different combinations of the elements that you like.Additionally, when tasting the cakes, begin with the lighter cakes and end with the heavier cakes.

, Take note of cake, filling and frosting combinations that you like. Also take note of the flavors the bakery can and cannot offer. This way you can compare and contrast each bakery after you have finished all of your tastings. Additionally, make sure to ask the baker important questions so you can make an informed decision before you sign a contract. Ask the baker:“When will the cake be made?”
“Do you deliver and if you do, when will it be delivered and what is the delivery fee?”
“What specific ingredients are used in the cake, filling and frosting?”
“How much do decorations cost, and what is the price difference between a tiered and sheet cake?”

Set out affordable wedding favors.",How to Plan an Affordable Beach Wedding," A beach wedding is typically free or fairly cheap. If isn’t free, you will probably have to purchase a permit that could range from $30 to $300. Once you’ve committed to beach wedding, plan the exact location. Some of the most affordable beach wedding destinations are in Mexico, Hawaii, and Jamaica. If you live near a beach, then the decision is easy!If traveling is necessary, consider if the people you’d like to invite to your wedding will be able to afford the expense and time off required for travel.;
, Booking a reservation at a resort might sound expensive, but it could actually be a cheaper option. At some resorts, like Sandals, Beaches, and Dreams, the wedding ceremony is free if you book a minimum number of nights for enough guests. Once you’ve booked the rooms, the resort will handle just about everything., Having quite a few guests at your wedding can lead to big discounts. You may get airline, room, and various freebies if you book for enough people. The company may not offer discounts, but it definitely doesn’t hurt to ask., Once you’ve decided on the location, research what the peak season at that location is. You, of course, don’t want to have the wedding in the middle of hurricane season, but try to plan as close to the off-peak season as possible. One or two weeks before off-season is ideal. This will save you money, but the weather should still be good enough to enjoy., Having a smaller wedding will of course be cheaper than inviting hundreds of people. If you and your partner have big families, a very small wedding may be impossible. Try to trim down the guest list as much as possible. It should be easier to cut out co-workers and acquaintances of your mom if you are traveling for your big day., Did you know that just about anyone can be certified to officiate a wedding? Hiring someone can cost anywhere from $100 to $400 or even more than that. Ask a friend or family member if they would be willing to get an online certification. You should offer them some money, but they may want to do it for free just for the honor of being able to marry you and the love of your life.

, Fresh flowers can often take over wedding decorations. A lot of flowers are beautiful, but not necessary. Instead, think of flowers as accents rather than your main decoration. Save some money on flowers by going to the local flower shop, flower mart, or even the grocery store.Custom flower arrangements usually won’t stand up to the heat and wind on the beach anyway.

, Don’t worry about buying expensive wedding décor, like an ice sculpture, that likely won’t last. Get crafty and create some of your own decorations. You could find and paint an old wooden board, make flowers out of paper, or make your own candles.Invite your friends over for a crafting party. Have some wine, food, and create decorations that everyone can enjoy on the wedding day.

, You don’t have to have an expensive wedding dress to look absolutely stunning when you walk down the aisle. Look for a dress that fits you off of the rack without the need for alterations. For even more affordable options, rent the dress or buy a used dress from a friend.A shorter, more casual dress will be ideal for the beach. This type of dress will usually be cheaper than a long, elaborate wedding dress.

, The ceremony won’t last very long, so it’s not necessary to put out nice seats for everyone. Place aluminum folding chairs on the sand right before the wedding. Or, if you aren’t traveling for the wedding, have guests bring their own folding chairs.


It’s also an option to have everyone stand for the wedding—unless they are not able to stand. Then, you will need to have some seats available.

, You will probably want a professional photographer there for the ceremony or part of your ceremony. After that, take advantage of technology. Have your friends take photos and upload them to photo sharing websites, like Eversnap.If some of your guests have mobility impairments, recognize that it's nearly impossible to push a wheelchair in the sand. Many beaches have walkways or platforms. Check on this before the ceremony.

, Minimize your reception expenses by planning by a simple but elegant wine and cheese reception right on the beach. You won’t have to move far for the reception, and it reduces the cost of the wedding even more. Remember that public beaches seldom allow alcohol to be served and police may become unwanted guests. Ask to rope off a part of the beach to avoid problems.You could also ask a friend that is a wonderful cook to make appetizers. It would probably cost less than a caterer.
It’s also an option to only have the ceremony and forego a reception.

, You, your partner, and your guests may be too hungry for just cheese after the ceremony. A way to reduce to cost of catering is to hire a food truck. A pizza truck is one option. Who doesn’t love a good pizza? It would be hip, delicious, and way less expensive than a fancy meal that people may or may not like.Remember to attend to peoples allergic needs. Have some options available for common allergies.

, You don’t have to spend a lot of money to dance the night away at your ceremony. Create a playlist on a computer or iPod, put out some good speakers, and get your hands on a mixing deck if possible. Offer money to a musically inclined friend to play DJ for the night., It’s a good idea to have a canopy to protect your reception area from rain showers and uninvited seagulls. If you want to buy a canopy, you can find them for fairly cheap online and at many supermarkets. For a tropical flare, decorate the canopy with tulle, twinkling mini-lights, and silk flowers. Use hurricane candles for lighting.Remember your guest's comfort and safety. Provide seating for the elderly as well as sunscreen and insect repellent just in case.

, Thank your guests for attending your special day by putting out favors that they can take home. Present them with beach wedding favors such as personalized sand-dollars, seashell candles, or Hawaiian Silk Leis."

, If you are having a small wedding near your home, you may be able to have the wedding near Christmas without many conflicts. A larger wedding may benefit from being scheduled around a long weekend, such as President's Day or Martin Luther King Day.

, Many wedding planners suggest that weddings around holidays and destination weddings should send out save the date announcements a year in advance. Ensure your announcement goes out to all your intended guests at least 6 months in advance.

, Dates near holidays or long weekends may need to be booked up to a year in advance, while other winter dates are usually easier to book because of decreased demand. Consider a hunting lodge, a ski chalet or a rustic estate with a snowy pastoral scene to highlight the season.

, Once again, you can play up the uniqueness of your chosen wedding date by including snowy scenes, holiday themes, snowflakes or cozy fireside tableaux. If you can't find any templates that cater to this season, ask a local print shop to design a custom invitation.

, Common winter wedding colors include snowy white, icy blue, crimson, jewel tones, forest green and chocolate brown. Consider choosing a light color and a bright color to play up the contrast and winter tones in your décor.

, Consider that you, your bridesmaids and your groomsmen will probably need to arrive at the venue in the cold or take a few pictures outside. If you want to have strapless dresses or thin satin, consider augmenting the wardrobe with cashmere or angora sweaters, muffs, cute ear warmers, fancy gloves, scarves, snow boots or other playful wardrobe choices.


Grooms can dress warmer in wool suits. Tweeds and tartans add some festivity to the wardrobe.

, Most locations make an outdoor wedding impossible in the winter; however, you can still create the look of winter wonderland by incorporating trees, pine cones, snowflakes, frosted glass, mittens and much more. If your date is around a holiday, choose a couple of your favorite decorations for a more festive atmosphere.

, You will need to ensure that your venue has a place to store dripping coats and boots for all your guests. Temperature control is important, because you want it to be cozy, but it can quickly become too warm with many people in 1 room.


Ask the venue about their temperature controls and ventilation. You should be able to adjust your heat a number of times during the reception.

, Winter is known for its firelight, so try to incorporate a fireplace, candles or a clear starry sky with twinkle lights. Soft lighting will add some ambiance.

, Flowers will be more expensive to bring to a cold locale. Use poinsettias, ivy, willow, thistle, leaves and branches to enhance the flowers you plan to use.

, Interview photographers to see how they can use the snow or fireplace to play up the romance of the day. If you want to be outside for a few photographs, you want someone who can shoot photos well and quickly.

, Many weddings feature a cocktail hour. Warm your guests up by having hot cider, hot chocolate, mulled wine, Irish coffee or hot toddies.


Another seasonal drink that is served cold is eggnog. Consider adding this to your bar if you are getting married during the Christmas season.

, Instead of serving salmon or chicken, you may want to do a roast, thick risotto, mashed potatoes, hearty greens and rich soups. For dessert, consider shortbread cookies, gingerbread, roasted chestnuts or fruit cake as a supplement to your wedding cake.

, Pack tea bags or hot cocoa mix in a knit satchel.

Make a list of the guests.You can make a long list of the person you invite.,
Send invitations.,
Find a dance hall.,
Find a best man and a bridesmaid.,
Find a hairdresser.,

Find a music group.,
Find a photographer.,
Buy the wedding dress.",How to Prepare a Turkish Wedding," You must be sure that everybody has a seat in the dance hall. This list allows you to know how many people to invite and it helps you choose the right dance hall.;
, An original card is the best. It is best to have them made in Turkey, but most invitations are in Turkish. If you Turkish but you live in Europe, you can order invitations in Turkish with another language.

, After making a list of the guests, provide seats for everybody. Each family should have a table.

, In the wedding, the best man and the bridesmaid are essential because they help the bride and groom with the weeding and the preparation. They can be a couple who the bride and groom know or two independent people, a friend of the bride and a friend of the groom.

, A hairdresser is a very important detail for the bride. If you do your wedding on a Sunday, you can have problems finding a hairdresser. Look for a hairdresser that you know who can come especially for you.

, The cook is an important point for receiving the guests, because during the wedding food is served by the bride and groom's families. Some examples of food are etli pilav, tursu and baklava.

, Music during the wedding should be dynamic. There are different kinds of music and dances, such as halay, misket, ciftetelli and roman havasi. You can hire a singer with the music group.

, The photos and the video are two things which are really important to the wedding. If the photographer is professional, you can have good photos with a beautiful landscape. The photos stay in your memory forever. The videos of the wedding shows who danced during the wedding. It can be a good memory too.

, They are many wedding dresses, the bride must choose the perfect one. There are many stores in Turkey, Germany or France. Miss Defne is the store where the brides buy the best dresses.

Sit down together and talk about what music matters to you.,
Be prepared to compromise.,
Note that there is a fairly standard treatment for music playing for both the ceremony and the reception.,
Note the standard music requirements for the wedding ceremony:



Prelude music: This refers to the music that plays before the ceremony begins.,
Note the standard music requirements for the reception:



General music: This is background music playing as guests arrive at the reception and mill around.,
Choose between traditional or contemporary music for the wedding ceremony.,
Try to find music that has meaning for both of you.,
Consider the songs that contain lyrics that reflect your love.,
Choose the first dance song.,
Consider the acoustics of the venues.,
Use good quality music players.,
Make a playlist of the music you've chosen.,
Decide how you will have the music playing.",How to Plan Your Wedding Music," Each of you will have different ideas and preferences and this is about getting the main ideas heard, to allow both of you to plan in full knowledge of what matters to one another.


Write down a list of the songs and/or music that you would like to form a part of your wedding. Ask your future spouse to do the same. Bring the lists along to your discussion together.
Take notes of your discussion so that you can remember which songs and music you would both like to have at the wedding.;
, If there is music that your future spouse wants but you don't like it, consider how you can reach a compromise. Perhaps it can be played during a less important part of the ceremony, or simply not be used as your first dance song. Find ways that can include the music without upsetting you on the day.


If the music is of a style that you really don't like, such as punk, 80s hip hop, 50s crooners, or what have you, then perhaps suggest it be played as a fun moment during the reception, after the traditional and romantic parts of the wedding have been finalized. This can be part of your gift to your beloved.

, While you are free to play around with this any way you like (unless the faith or tradition requires it to be strict), it is helpful to know what parts of your ceremony and reception may need music.

, It's important because the guests are a mixture of emotions from anticipation to annoyance at having to wait, and music can soothe them and create the ambiance that you're wishing to have.

Processional music: This is music or a song played as the wedding party and/or important guests enter the ceremony place and are seated or positioned.

Bridal entrance music: This is the bride's last moment as an unmarried woman and it's her moment of special glory. A rousing piece of music that announces her entrance is almost every bride's dream.

Interlude music: That music that is barely heard but is playing away in the background while documents are being signed, candles are being lit or gaps are being filled.

Recessional music: This music is the post-ceremony music, as the bride and groom leave the place of ceremony (and people throw confetti and give out congratulations).

Postlude music: This is music that keeps playing in the background after the ceremony, to make things pleasant for those still milling around and awaiting to head to the reception.

, It is also the songs played during most of the dance time later in the night, it's whatever you or the DJ have selected to keep the dancing going.

Entrance music: This is music played when the new husband and wife enter the reception venue together.

First dance song: That special song for the new husband and wife to take the dance floor together and celebrate their union in dance.

Mother/son and/or father/daughter music: A nice idea for the parents and children to come together during a dance.

Cake cutting music: Not essential but this music can make a nice touch. It should be very low, background music.

Last dance song: This is the song to end the reception for the bride and groom as they're about to leave. It should be special to the couple but it doesn't need to mark the end of the dancing if guests wish to keep enjoying the event and the reception is still open.

, You may want the traditional bridal music, with the full classical experience. Or, you might prefer to use more contemporary songs, for a more tailored and intimate wedding experience. Either way, you will need to agree upon what works for both of you.



Traditional classical wedding music: This includes Pachelbel's Canon in D, Bach's Ave Maria, Bach's Air on a G String, Mozart's Ave Merum Corpus, Vivaldi's Four Seasons (especially the Winter Movement), Mozart's March of the Priests from The Magic Flute, Bach's Cello Suits, No. 1 Prelude, Grieg's Wedding Day at Troldhaugen, Rimsky-Korsakov's Procession of Nobles, Berlioz' Marche troyenne, and so forth.

Hymns: These may be determined according to your faith, to what your place of worship suggests and what you like. In Christian marriages, by way of one example, commonly used hymns include Ave Maria, Amazing Grace and On Eagles' Wings.

Modern love songs: There are so many possibilities here that to list them is not possible. Use the ones you already know and love, the ones that your beloved loves, or do a search online for lists of suitable songs. However, bear in mind that modern love songs used for the ceremony part are best kept clean, respectful and calm for the place of worship/ceremony location. Leave the raucous and fun stuff for after the ceremony. Of course, it's your wedding and if you want it another way, that's up to you!

, Now that you're aware of each other's tastes, there is another important element to consider. It is simply––the songs that resonate to both of you because they were playing during your courtship. You might have a dance floor number that was playing when you first fell for one another, or there might have been a song playing in the restaurant on your first date. Perhaps there was a song on the radio as you held hands overlooking the city in the car or a song that you dedicated to one another during your dating time. These types of songs have very deep meaning because they recall the moments during which you two were becoming closer.

, This is another style of song that might be suitable for your wedding music choices. Although the song may not have immediate recall for either of you, its wording may be so apt that both of you instantly feel it reflects your love for one another. You can search for lyrics online, using phrases that represent your love for one another, and using terms that reflect elements of your love and coming togetherness that both of you think are worthy of honoring.

, If you're having a first dance, and many cultures and faiths do have this element, then the first song is going to be important. It might be pre-determined by tradition, in which case you won't have much choice. Otherwise, if you are free to choose, this is a chance to select a song that really sums up your feelings for each other. Give this choice a serious thinking through; you may need to let the ideas bubble up for a while, or it may come to both of you in a flash. Ultimately, go with what feels right.


You'll know the song is right when you both cry: ""This is our song!"". It will be the song that reflects your relationship, sums up your feelings for each other and perhaps provides promises of ongoing support and love.
There are plenty of online lists for ""first dance song"". Spend a few evenings going through these and finding your likes. It's a fun exercise that the two of you can enjoy together, and you might discover some wonderful new music that you both like.

, Although you may be wrapped up in having certain music or songs, they might not sound as good as you wish them to. Be sure to trial the music, if possible, in the venue(s), so that you can be sure that the music will sound excellent.

, If bringing along your own, ensure that the players have the capacity to play the music loudly enough without distortion. If hiring someone to play the music, or hiring equipment, seek their advice as to appropriate placement and playing levels, etc.

, Once you've finalized the list of songs, turn it into a playlist. Play it in the car, at home, and on your MP3, to be certain that you've made the right choices. Having a digital playlist also makes it easy for the music to be played on your own players or used as a back-up for any hire equipment or music personnel.

, Will you use the venue's music facilities, bring your own players or hire a professional to come and play the music? Perhaps you'll pipe music through the ceremony venue's facilities but hire a DJ for the reception? Whatever your choice, make it early so that if bookings need to be made, these can be sorted out very early on.


If a friend or family member offers to be DJ, be sure to have a few meetings with this person to clarify absolutely everything you want them to play and say.

Pick the hall.,
Plan the guest list.,
Write the invitation cards.",How to Plan an Arab Wedding1," The reception hall is crucial and must be reserved at least six months in advance. When looking for the perfect hall, size is the most important factor. A hall should be large enough to fit anywhere between 500 to 1,500 people. Décor is simply extra and not viewed as a main priority.


You should anticipate extra people coming to your wedding and take into consideration the seating arrangements. For example, you should make sure the hall employees are lenient and ready to add additional tables as guests arrive, if necessary.;
, The parents and grandparents of the bride and groom should do the guest lists. The bride and groom should never compose the official or entire wedding guest list alone. It may be risky, as many elder relatives and family friends will take great offense to being overlooked or not viewed as a priority guest. In essence, the bride and groom’s wedding party is really a formal gathering held by the bride and groom’s parents, and most of the guests that arrive may even be strangers to the bride and groom.

People begin to imagine how simple or extravagant the wedding will be, based on how much money and effort went into making the invitations. Usually, a smaller, empty envelope is enclosed in the larger envelope, along with the invitation, so people can leave money as wedding gifts to help start the bride and groom’s financial funds.

Arabs take pride in hosting and expect only the best for themselves and their guests.

, The dessert is the final component of the wedding feast. It consists of long, connected tables of various sweets, which range from fresh fruits to whole cakes. However, If planning on a budget, multiple tables of various desserts can be expensive. Less expensive options, such as having a tray of desserts served to each table, may be considered. In general, the guests are responsible for serving themselves the desserts from buffet style dessert tables.

Consider if you would like staged or candid photos. Candid photos are great if you want a light and fun look to your photos. Staged photos are most common and are usually better for photos that will be framed.You could have a mix of staged and candid photos during your session.
Think about how many locations you would like to use for the shoot.;
, How formal or casual you want the photos to be depends on what type of couple you are. It also depends on what the photos will be used for. You may want to take some casual photos for yourselves and social media. Then, take some formal photos to be framed and sent out for announcements., Once you have decided what type of photos you’d like, begin to consider a theme. A wintry theme is an easy and excellent choice because there is so much to choose from within that category. You could base the photos on the holiday you celebrate, or you could simply stand in front of a wintry scene.You can find ideas for a wintry theme by looking up winter engagement photos on social media and through search engines.

, Ask for recommendations, or search the internet and social media for a photographer in your area. Check out the photographer’s portfolio to make sure you and your partner like their quality and style. Call the photographer to ask about rates and set up a date.You can choose a photographer just for the engagement photos, or you can ask the photographer for an engagement and wedding package.

, Ideally, it is best to set up a photography session soon after your engagement. Factor in what you will be using the photos for. For example, consider if you will be using the photos for sending out announcements, or putting an announcement in the paper. Aim for the photography session to happen at least three months before the wedding. Consider the fact that the photographer will need some time to edit the photos when planning the session.

, You and your partner could simply stand in front of a snowy scene. Or, you could be active and make snow angels in the snow. If being outside in the cold isn’t your thing, you could have photos taken inside in front of windows showing a wintry scene.If you’re going to get lay or play in the snow, plan those shots for last since your clothing will get wet.

, Winter is a season full of holidays and festivities. If you celebrate Christmas, have the photographer take a picture of you and your partner picking out a tree. If you celebrate another holiday, take a photo of a moment that is a special part of that holiday for you.You can also plan photos for non-holiday festivities, such as ice skating and building a snowman.

, You don’t have to get cold to take wintry photos. Cuddle up with your partner in front of a fireplace. Go to a local café and grab a cup of coffee. You could also have photos taken of you and your partner baking holiday cookies., Cities often provide a great backdrop for winter engagement photos. If it is snowing the day of your session, simply have photos taken of you and your partner standing in front of the falling snow in a pretty part of the city. Or, you could go to a place decorated with holiday lights and other props., The country can provide just as pretty of a background, if not prettier, than the city. Go to a location near you that is especially beautiful, no matter what time of year it is. Or, travel to a cozy cabin or ski lodge out in the country., Make your photos fun and full of action by having photos taken of you and your partner engaging in a snowball fight. You don’t have to really hit each other with the snowballs—it’s okay to simply act out the scene. You can also invite friends and family to partake in the activity., Skiing may be an activity that you enjoy with your partner, or you may have grown up doing it with your family. Consider having a few photos of you and your partner dressed up in skiing gear. If skiing isn’t your thing, sledding can also make for fun photos., Hot chocolate is a classic winter drink. Hold up two mugs of hot chocolate for a few photos. You can use your favorite mugs, or use mugs with you and your partner’s initials on them., Choose a few quotes from your favorite winter movie or song. Write the quote on a chalkboard, or paint the quote onto a sign. Hold or place the sign in front of you and your partner.For example, hold a sign that says “Baby, it’s cold outside.”

, Hang mistletoe from a branch or doorway. You can also have the taller partner hold the mistletoe over your heads. Have the photographer take a few shots of you and your partner kissing beneath the mistletoe., You can wear formal festive clothing, like a glittery dress or sequined shirt. Or, you can wear fun and silly festive clothing. For example, wear tacky holiday sweaters for a few photos., Be sure to bundle up in warm clothing if you’re taking photos outside. Choose your most stylish winter clothing. For instance, wear your favorite winter jacket and boots. If you’re taking photos inside, choose a cute and comfortable sweater., Keep warm by adding accessories to your outfit. You and your partner could wear items things such as a scarf, gloves, and a headband. If you have a wintry hat, like a beanie or knitted hat, wear that for outdoor photos. You could also wear items like a faux-fur vest., Winter is a popular time for holiday and cocktail parties. If you’re taking photos inside, dress up in your best cocktail attire. You could wear a suit, or a dress with a pair of tights."

Think about the benefits of a small wedding.,
Set a budget for your wedding in advance.,
Know all of the areas you need to plan for in a wedding.,
Cut out what isn't important to you.,
Plan a casual wedding theme.,
Use flowers strategically.,
Wear for a suit instead of a tux.,
Don't buy a wedding dress.,
Get your marriage license first.",How to Plan a Small Wedding1," Having less guests does not make your celebration any less meaningful. On the contrary, it gives you more time to spend with people that matter to you and your partner. Having fewer people will make your day less stressful, allowing you to focus on what really matters -- loving and committing to your partner. Other benefits of small weddings include:

Time to talk to guests beyond a simple ""hello.""
A chance to involve more people in the events.
Less expensive reception and ceremony.
A more intimate, close-knit event.;
, You will not have a small wedding if you don’t establish what “small” is. Sit down with your spouse and wedding planner and decide on a concrete amount that you are willing to spend. You can then keep this number in mind as you begin purchasing things for the wedding.


If you don't have a budget in mind it becomes much easier to spend thousands more than you expected. Choose a number and stick to it.
In the United States the average wedding costs $25,000. That said, the majority of American couples spend $10,000 or less on a wedding.Each guest at a wedding costs, on average, $250 more at a normal sized wedding., Even small weddings are, in essence, parties that you throw for your friends, family, and spouse. As such, there is a variety of problems and concerns that need to address to make sure everyone has a good time. In general, you need to think about:


Venue for the wedding (church, registrar, etc.)
Reception
Entertainment
Flowers
Food, drink, and wedding cake
Photographs
Transport and Lodging
Invitations
Decorations and clothing
Gifts / Party Favors for attendees.

, A small wedding is about trimming excess and getting rid of things you don't really need. Holding your wedding in your hometown instead of at a big destination means most people can come straight from their house. Don't like flowers? Substitute pictures of you and your spouse for the centerpiece. Look at the above list and ask yourself what is really essential. What can you make yourself? What can you limit or cut back?


Once you've started to trim down your wedding, make estimates about the cost of each thing you still want and compare them to your budget.
Remember that a small wedding is often more intimate, giving you time to be with the guests that matter instead of bouncing around to 100 people or more.

, Small and casual weddings allow people to feel much more comfortable and close to one another. Consider ditching elaborate, classy wedding themes like lace or ivy and go for something simple, like a color. Not only do people spend less on clothing, you spend less on decorations that you will only use once. Check out sites like Pinterest, Etsy, or The Knot to browse through thousands of wedding themes on any budget to get craft ideas.


Remember, the theme of your wedding is not important, your marriage is.
Make your location a big part of the ""theme."" If you are getting married on the beach, for example, the sand and the surf will be much more enjoyable than hundreds of beach decorations.
Use what you have at home or make your own decorations. A few strings of Christmas lights, for example, will create beautiful lighting without breaking the bank. If you already have a lot of green decorations, consider making the color your theme., A tiny arrangement of flowers placed well is often as efficient as having lots of flowers everywhere. Floral arrangements can get very expensive very quickly, so find ways to eliminate or limit them to save money. Some suggestions include:


Use local, seasonal flowers or wildflowers instead of big, exotic bouquets.
Buy 1 big beautiful flower (like a rose or chrysanthemum) and use it instead of a full bouquet for a minimal but striking look.
Opt for pictures, art, paper flowers, or colorful fruit bowls instead of flowers for an off-beat look., This is a good way for the groom to save money. If you already have a nice black suit, consider wearing it instead of a tuxedo. Even if you do not own a black suit, consider buying one for the wedding instead of renting a tuxedo. The cost of a respectable black suit is usually about the same as a one day tuxedo rental and you can use the suit again in the future.

, It might sound like blasphemy, but wedding dresses are incredibly expensive to only wear once. Opt instead to borrow one from a mother, relative, or close friend. This is not only cost effective, it shows someone how much you care and begins a tradition of passing down a dress across generations.


More and more stores are renting out dresses now, allowing you to get your dream dress for a fraction of the cost., The only things that are truly ""necessary"" for a marriage to happen are two people who want to be together forever, a legal certificate, and a witness or two. Focus on that idea as you plan your small wedding. In CA, for example, a marriage license costs anywhere from $35-100, and that is technically all you need to begin your married life together.


You can always hold a reception later on, or separate from getting your license, in order to save money and cut costs.Some scientists have found a correlation between cheaper weddings and happier couples, so remember to focus on each other, not money."
"
Know that venue matters more than any other thing when budgeting a wedding.,
Reserve your venue well in advance.,
Talk to the venue in advance about any regulations, fees, or needs.,
Ask a friend to officiate the wedding for you if you are not at a church.,
Get friends to fill in for photographers, videographers.,
Arrange for low-cost DJ instead of a band.,
Plan the table placement.",How to Plan a Small Wedding2," The average US wedding costs $25,000, but almost $11,000 of that is spent on the venue and food.You need to consider where you are having your wedding before anything else or you may end up with very little of your budget to spend on, entertainment, decorations, invites, etc.


Urban areas are almost always more expensive because they are much busier and serve a larger variety of couples. Even moving out to a venue in the suburbs can save money.Have the wedding during the fall or winter. Popular wedding venues are not as busy during these times and they often have lower prices as a result.
Saturday is the most expensive day to get married., The sooner you start booking places for the wedding the better your chances are you'll find the perfect spot. Many popular wedding destinations, like churches and parks, book up between 9-12 months in advance, so you need to be quick if you are heart-set on a spot. That said, small weddings thrive at unique, off-beat, and smaller locations, so don't limit yourself to the ""classic"" wedding spots. Call around town and ask about:


You town park.
The beach.
A friends' backyard.
A local farm, bed and breakfast, or ranch.
Museums, the historical society, or state parks., Some venues require you to use their in-house catering company for your food. Others may have a limit on the number of guests allowed or have a minimum number of guests. You need to be in touch with the venue in advance before you put any money down to avoid unpleasant surprises later.

, The American Marriage Ministries will ordain almost anyone, making them legally able to marry a couple in the United States. What's more, registering is free and can be done almost instantly online. Skip the big service or officiants and have someone close to you run your service for an intimate and cheaper wedding service.Be sure to ask someone 3-4 months in advance, giving them time to register and prepare for the service.

, A good photographer can cost you several hundred dollars, but a small wedding can benefit immeasurably from a friend's touch. Ask a friend with a nice camera if they are willing to spare 1-2 hours of the party to take pictures and offer to pay them for their service. Not only will you feel comfortable being photographed by someone you know, you limit the number of people at your reception and save money.


Make sure the photographer puts the pictures online using Snapfish or Flickr so that all the guests can see them later.

, Bands are great, but they cost extra money to pay for each member. DJs, however, are much cheaper and can play an almost infinite number of songs right from their laptops.


If you don't care much for music, make a wedding playlist with your spouse. You can pick the songs that you love and change them on the fly as guests arrive.
Consider asking a musical friend to ""DJ,"" by making a playlist with them and asking them to put on important songs for you like the ""First Dance.""

, Most guests prefer assigned seating over choosing where they need to sit, and it is your job to plan things.This may seem stressful, but you need to remember that people are there to enjoy your special day, not complain about who they are sitting next to for dinner. Make a simple drawing of your reception with all of the tables roughly laid out. Start by planning your table with the bride, groom, parents, and bridesmaids/groomsmen. Then add people to tables so that everyone knows at least 1-2 other people. It is okay if they don't know everyone -- this is their time to make a new friend.


Once you've assigned the seats, make a small card at each seat telling people who sits where.
For small weddings with under 50 people assigned seating may be too rigid to be fun. Give your guests some freedom and try one big table or an informal ""eat where/when you want"" catering style.

"
"
Know that each additional guest will cost you more money.,
Set a cap on your invitations.,
Make a list of the ""essential"" invites.,
Make your invitations yourself.,
Get your guests involved in the wedding.",How to Plan a Small Wedding3," While the specific dollar amounts will change from wedding to wedding, more people will always lead to a more expensive wedding. Most catering companies charge couples per person for food and waiters, so more people require more tables, chairs, and a bigger room. On top of that every guest needs an invitation, save the date, and a party favor after the wedding. These costs will quickly pile up with every extra guest.


Additional costs for each guest can range from $80 per person (small, low-key wedding) to over $300 per person (extravagant wedding)., Much like when you are budgeting, you should start the invitation process by asking yourself how many people you want at the wedding. Small, intimate weddings usually invite anywhere from 20-50 guests (the average wedding has 140 guests or more), but you need to plan the number that works for you. Some things to keep in mind include:


Is this just for family and close friends, or should you invite aunts, uncles, and coworkers as well?
How many bridesmaids or groomsmen do you want? 2-3 of each will keep costs down.
Who do you ""need"" to invite? Should you really spend your special day with people you've only seen once or twice over the past year?

, You and your spouse should draft a list of the 10-15 people you strongly want to invite to the wedding. This will be your jumping off point for the invitation list and will usually contain parents, grandparents, the best man and the maid of honor. There will likely be some overlap between you and your spouse as well, which frees up space for other guests.


Keep this list as small as you can by reminding yourself ""this is a small wedding."" You want your time with people to be meaningful, not rushed.

, For a small wedding, creating personalized wedding invitations is not only easy, it lets your guest know that you care about them. Instead of spending money buying and printing costly invitations, purchase some nice stationery from your local art store and write out a simple invitation by hand.


Look online for ideas on how to customize your invitations, from adding decorations and pictures to writing messages or poems.

, A smaller wedding gives everyone the chance to get involved. You can afford to spend more time with everyone instead of rushing around the party, so get your guests involved in the wedding to keep them entertained and give your party and intimate, tight-knit feel. Ask you guests to:


Read a line from a prayer.
Submit pictures to a slideshow.
Pick 2-3 songs for the DJ to play.
Share a story of the bride and groom in a wedding book/video."
"
Ask about the cost of food per person if you are using a catering company.,
Think about a buffet for a simpler wedding meal.,
Cook your own appetizers.,
Ask your venue if you can bring your own drinks.,
Order a small wedding cake.",How to Plan a Small Wedding4," Food costs vary wildly, but more often than not they are calculated by the number of guests. You will be asked to supply a guest list to the catering company, which will then return to you with the total cost. More food, of course, costs more, but the variability amongst different caterers will be stunning.


A small wedding in Minnesota might cost $25 per person whereas a Manhattan wedding might cost over $150 a person.Know your cost before committing to a caterer.

, Don't feel like you need to offer a handcrafted, 5-star meal to make your wedding memorable. Having servers drastically increases the cost of your food, and most people won't mind getting up to chose their food themselves. Skipping servers and a waitstaff will keep your wedding small and on a budget.

, This may seem like a hassle, but it is a great touch of personality for your party that can save hundreds on food costs. If you have a small wedding it becomes even easier: choose a recipe that you can make and freeze later, then have someone you trust heat them up before the reception. Some recipes to try include:Mini-pizzas
Quiches
Gougeres
Crackers and cheeses
Fruit spreads

, Whether you tell your guest to B.Y.O.B. or you bring all of the alcohol yourself, skip out on the exorbitant prices of the bar and bring your own drinks. While this may seem cheap to some, the ability to personalize the menu will make your wedding night special and intimate in ways that are difficult with big weddings.


Invent a ""couples cocktail"" to serve at your wedding.
Buy bottles of wine from grapes grown the year you met or got engaged.
Limit hard alcohol, as wine and beer will last longer and cost less.
Alternatively, set up a ""cash-bar,"" which is when the venue supplies its own bartender for free/cheap but charges your guests for each drink., Don't forget that, by the time it comes out, most people will have already eaten and the cake is often destroyed by the bride and groom's ""first cut."" The wedding cake is mostly a showpiece, and you'll be lucky if even half of it is eaten. Knowing this, skip the 5 tier cake and go for something simpler.


Smaller weddings, however, give you the chance to share your cake with everyone.
If you require extra cake you can always have a sheet cake baked so that there is an adequate amount for all. Serve the wedding party from the fancy cake and the rest of the guests from the sheet cake."

Do you want a garden that is intimate, has special meaning to you or is close by? Or are you looking for a large garden in a public space that has nearby amenities such as a restaurant or cafe?


Your own garden, or the garden of your or your fiancé's parents might be just the thing. Or, perhaps the garden of a relative or friend.
A local garden, such as one in a park could work well if it allows for gatherings.
A botanical garden is often a lovely venue for a garden wedding. However, some may charge a lot for this, so bear that in mind when choosing.
You might want to use a garden of a specific type, such as a beach garden, a coastal garden, a lavender farm garden, a modern garden, a medieval garden, etc., to reflect your personal interests. In this case, you may have to go further afield to find the right garden. Do some online researching.;
, As well as a lovely environment and well tended plants, there are some things you must consider for the a garden wedding:


There must be bathroom facilities somewhere near the wedding area. Guests and wedding party alike will need this space for various purposes.
Have a form of shelter provided, just in case it rains or blows a gale. This might be a covered space, a room in a building or a marquee, depending on what the garden space is near to. If it's your own garden, do you have a room large enough in the house to accommodate everyone? Moreover, is that what you want, to get married inside a house, should the weather prove inclement?
Consider mud. Are there pathways and grassy areas that can be used to avoid getting dirty when walking about the garden? Long dresses, trails, trouser ends and shoes can be spoiled if the garden is muddy or dirty.
Legalities and formalities. Is it legal to use the garden in question for a gathering? Do you have to get permission, fill out forms, make payments, etc.? Find out all of this or your day could be spoiled by overlooking such a simple yet important necessity.
Convenience. Is there parking space nearby? Is the garden easy to get to, especially for people with limited mobility? Is is safe for small children (if coming)? Is the garden a long drive away?
Vibes. Most of all, do you like the garden at the time of year you're planning to have your wedding? It might look gorgeous in fall but half alive in mid-spring. Or, it might look like a winter wonderland mid-winter but very ordinary in mid-summer. Be sure to check out photos if you don't already know what the garden looks like a the time of year your wedding is scheduled for.
Is the garden free? If it's a popular public space, you'll need to sure that it is available for you to use on the wedding date, at the specific times. There might be other weddings or events being held there. In some cases, the garden may be locked due to having specified hours. Be sure to ask in advance about these things if the garden is not privately owned.

, Garden weddings are generally best during the daylight hours, so that the guests can appreciate the setting. In summer, this can be a bit later into the evening, provided the air temperature promises to be warm.

, Choose close family members, close friends and people you really care about. Everyone else is superfluous. If someone can't make it, don't substitute, just let the group size stay intimate.

, This can save a lot of money and lets you customize them to suit the garden theme. There are many software programs that will help you to design invitations and you can either print them off yourself at home or send them to the printer once designed.

, Keep it simple, as the garden can be the star of the occasion. Think plants, greenery and garden colors. A good place to start researching your ideas is Pinterest, checking out the ideas that other people celebrating a garden wedding have gathered together.

, Know in advance how much money you're prepared to spend, then stick to this. Any expensive ""must haves"" should be thought over very carefully, and slept on. That way, you can decide whether anything expensive is really worth the outlay or whether you're just caught up in the excitement of planning. Remind yourself that the garden is going to do a lot of the work for you, in that you can make the most of nature's designs without having to add much else.

, For a day wedding, a buffet or picnic lunch under a gazebo in the garden can be lovely. Or, you can set up a marquee close by and have basic catering done. Having a lunch or afternoon tea reception is a great way to save money. Sit-down dinners are generally one of the large expenses of a wedding, so by avoiding that, you can save a lot of money and still have a lovely time. Other options include:


Go to a nearby restaurant or cafe and have a meal there. Be sure to book for your party though, don't just turn up!
Have an evening cocktail party reception. Cocktail party receptions are still generally cheaper than a sit-down dinner and can be held either in a marquee (provided the garden allows this under liquor licensing laws), or you can head to a bar prepared to throw this event for you in a private room.
Have a picnic. Ask family members to help buy and prepare suitable picnic food, and to bring along blankets, fold-up seats, and so forth. Generally you don't need permission to have a picnic in a park space, but do check.
Have the reception inside your house. If you have the wedding in your own garden, use your dining room or other similar space for the reception. You could even hire a caterer or chef just for the evening––this should still prove much cheaper than hiring a reception center.

, Choose a wedding dress that is elegant yet affordable. It could be one that you've purchased used, one made up by a clever seamstress in the family (or yourself) or a dress that is purchased on sale. Beautiful dresses do not have to cost a lot––good fit and comfort are the most important thing. For the groom, consider hiring the suit. Ask the bridesmaids to wear a dress of their own in the color scheme of your wedding.


Accessories can be garden themed, such as a bridal veil with leaf motifs sewn onto it (you can do this yourself), a brooch featuring flowers, a necklace with flowers, and so forth.

, This will save you more money but be sure to give this person a decent gift in return for their kindness.

, Being outdoors, loving nature, enjoying the simpler things in life––this is your guide in keeping the budget reined in, as you really don't need lots of decorations, expensive clothing or over-the-top dining.

, Have a plan B in place in case it rains, is freezing or is really windy. If possible, have the indoor location overlooking the garden or incorporating the garden in some way. If that's not possible, consider how plan B can still evoke the garden concept indoors, such as by bringing in container plants, decorating with garden themed items and perhaps beaming pictures of gardens onto the walls.

, Provide instructions on how to get to the garden space chosen if it's in a public place and it's not immediately obvious.

, If it's popular, you may find that it's already taken.

Limit what drinks you offer.,
Set an amount you can afford.,
Invite a reasonable number of people.,
Only offer alcohol during certain times of the evening.,
Choose a reception hall that allows you to bring your own alcohol.,
Buy in bulk.",How to Save Money on Drinks for your Wedding Reception,"


You don't have to offer a complete bar. Consider serving just beer and wine or just a select few liquors. The same goes for mixers. Don't feel like you need to offer every possible mixer there is. Maybe just a couple sodas and a juice or two will suffice. If you want your guests to have the option of having top-shelf liquors or multiple mixers, you could choose to supply a couple choices, but have other options available for guests to purchase on their own.;
,


If you have a strict budget, let the venue know what it is. Once the allotted amount is gone, guests will have to pay for their drinks. As long as you offer enough for all of your guests to have a drink or two, it is completely reasonable to have a limit. Remember, too, that some guests won't have any alcoholic beverages while others will have more than their allotted amount.

,


If you are worried about saving money on drinks, look at your guest list. The more people you invite, the more drinks you will be expected to provide. Reducing the guest list will allow you to offer more to fewer guests.

,


In order to save some money at the bar during the reception, don't leave the bar open the whole time. Consider having servers offer a glass of wine at the table during dinner, but close the bar. This way, guests may have a glass of wine during dinner, but it will limit their access to additional drinks.

,


When you purchase drinks from the reception hall, you pay much more than you would buying a bottle off the shelf. They are hard to find, but certain venues allow you to bring in your own alcohol for them to serve. While the hall may still charge you corking fees or bartender fees, the overall cost will be significantly less. While this may require more footwork, it will definitely pay off in the end.

,


Whether you purchase the drinks from the venue or bring them in yourself, you will save by buying kegs and the largest bottles of liquor available. Buying boxed wine versus bottled can also save you some money, although some boxed wines are not of the highest quality. In that case, you'll have to decide whether you prefer quality over quantity.

Keep an eye out for sales.,
Hire a professional florist.,
Order pre-made flower arrangements.,
Recycle flower arrangements.,
Make your own flower arrangements.,
Use a variety of colors.,
Include a mixture of cheap and expensive flowers.",How to Save Money on Wedding Flowers," Although flowers can be expensive when ordered in large quantities, they can be less costly if you take advantage of coupons and discounts. Find different flower shops that offer low prices.;
, Finding a person who is experienced with flowers can help you manage your budget. A professional will be able to arrange flowers at your wedding once you tell him what you envision. Communication with your florist is important, as you will need to explain in detail your expectations. Once you have told him your vision, step back and allow him to do his job.


Be sure that the florist understands your theme and budget. One common mistake that people make is forgetting to include flowers in their budgeting plans, then later realizing that they won't be able to afford them after all the other purchases. Be sure to communicate your ideas to your florist as early as possible so that he can give you the best suggestions.

, Making these purchases can save a lot of time and effort, especially if they're ready to be set up as soon as they arrive. This will also prevent you from having to hire an expensive florist, although you may still want to find a cheap one to give you advice on finding the right, complementing colors for your theme. You can find pre-made flower arrangements online at low prices.

, Although you may be tempted to fill the entire building with flowers, it becomes a waste when you and the guests move to another room. Rather than spending loads of money on different arrangements, have volunteers move them with you as you go. Set up the flowers in the new location so that their beauty can be appreciated.


For example, flower arrangements from the wedding ceremony can become centerpieces and decorations for dining tables.

, It not only saves money but also allows you to express yourself in the pieces. Understand that creating your own arrangements can be a difficult process, so you should take on this project only if you are experienced. Although they may seem simple, DIY projects can quickly become overwhelming and sometimes end up costing more than if you simply hired a florist.


If you still wish to create some of your own flower arrangements, you could hire a florist and allow him to complete one part of the work while you do the other. However, be sure that your themes and color choices complement each other's; otherwise, you may end up with clashing arrangements. Constant communication is important.

, One common mistake would be to stick to one color in flower arrangements. However, it is best to mix a handful of complementing shades in order to create a stunning effect. Guests will be least likely to notice that you didn't use many flowers, as they will be too distracted by the beautiful blends in the arrangements. If you use the same color throughout all of your arrangements, the effect will fail to leave a good impact upon people, and they will definitely notice the few flowers used.

, Sometimes, a few expensive flowers can leave a bigger impact than if you put together bouquets of cheap ones. Do not be afraid to include room in your budget for several pricey flowers, but beware of purchasing too many. Also, including expensive blooms will allow you to use less flowers, which ends up saving money.

Have conversations with your family about what they have and how they are willing to help.In some families, the parents are willing to pick up a large percentage of the wedding cost.
If you have to talk to your family about contributing, you can say something like ""As you know mom, my wedding is coming up soon, and I was hoping that you could let me know if you and dad could pitch in. I'm just trying to understand the budget for the wedding right now."";
, The best way to reduce overspending is to set a budget and to not deviate from the budget. Have a discussion with your partner about how much money they have and are willing to spend on the wedding. Once you get a good understanding of how much you can spend overall, you'll have a good idea of how much your budget is.

, It's important to associate specific dollar amounts to your costs so you'll know if you are going to go over budget. The most important expenses to figure out include the cost of the reception, attire, ceremony, flowers, entertainment and photography. Once you've estimated this number, add 5% for other expenses that you may have not accounted for.Remember to include the cost of your honeymoon as well.

, The more guests that you have, the more money you'll have to spend on the overall wedding. Invite only your closest friends and family to keep the list small. If your guest list is bloated, consider trying to reduce it by 20%, then reduce it again. Invite the people who you care about the most., As you plan for your wedding, you'll need to contact certain people to get quotes for your wedding. Instead of settling for the first person that you talk to, shop around and see who offers the lowest prices. Look for promotions or sales and make sure to read customer reviews so that you can get a better understanding for the different vendors at your wedding.Vendors include photographers, caterers, and musicians.

",How to Plan a Wedding in Two Weeks and for Under $500," Go to the courthouse and get the marriage license. (Note that in some countries you may need to wait a month or more after acquiring a licence to have a legal ceremony.);
, Invite people by email, phone, or (if you trust your delegates) word of mouth. If you have more than two weeks, use a computer to design and print your own invitations, but remember that they'll take time to go through the mail.

, If you don't have somebody in mind, ask people you know. Just about anybody can become an officiant, and chances are that word of mouth can put you in touch with somebody who has, or is willing. Choose somebody you are comfortable with.

, This step is not about haste or budget, but about having a ceremony that is meaningful and comfortable for you.

, Jewelry stores may try to sell you the fanciest, priciest thing, but meaning is far more important here than cost.

, Let everyone know that your wedding is a barbecue, picnic, beach, or luau theme. It is much easier and less costly to orchestrate these gatherings than something more formal or fancy, and nobody will mind that everything doesn't all match. Consider having a picnic or potluck wedding. Local guests can bring a food item, the more the merrier. Have a volunteer maintain a sign up list for the foods so you don't have too many of the same item. Chances are, your parents and/or grandparents' wedding receptions were cake-and-punch gatherings. If you invest a good portion of your budget on the cake, this can be a beautiful option.

, People are a lot more comfortable in casual clothing, anyway, and it will put everybody at ease. Wear clothes you already own, or buy something simple that you can wear again.

,, Your guests won't have to stop everything and get lost going from here to there, and you won't have to prepare and clean up two different venues.

, Ask around and get creative. Otherwise, rent from a local party center.

, See if a party store near you has an inexpensive roll of plastic tablecloth material in the color of your wedding. Cut it to length and don't forget to tape it down, especially if you're outdoors. If you decorate further, skip the crepe paper and balloons, which belong at birthday parties. Rolls of tulle or organza are nearly as inexpensive and deliver real wedding appeal.

, A level-headed high school or college student is ideal, particularly anybody who has had experience in band, drama, restaurants, or the like. This person will help you watch timing, direct and assist with setup, run last minute errands, line people up for group photos, and so on. Offer to pay this person, especially if he/she is a ""starving student"", treat him or her to a nice dinner, or return the favor.

, Avoid making favors that will require much assembly. Enlist a friend who is ""crafty"" to do this for you!

, A single open rose or camellia floating in a bowl of water can be very elegant. Alternatively, for centerpieces, consider simple candles

, Let your guests know that you'd like copies of their snapshots. You'll probably have dozens of cameras in the crowd, and some will get good pictures. It's easier than ever to share photos. You'd have a hard time stopping people from taking hundreds of photos of your wedding. Do take the time to line up different groups of your guests for photos after the ceremony.

, Many guests will naturally clean up after themselves when given the opportunity.

Keep the wedding small and simple.,
Skip the traditional gifts for your wedding party.,
Buy decorations on sale.",How to Plan a Low Budget Wedding2," A wedding dress is a large expense but it can be reduced. Try looking for sample dresses that fit you instead of getting one custom made. If you are seeking to get a free dress, see if any family members or friends have a dress they are willing to give you or let you borrow. If you want your own dress, make sure to keep it minimalistic instead of getting ornate add-ons that can increase the cost of your dress and wedding.The average cost of a wedding dress in the U.S. is $1,200.
Great websites where you can purchase second-hand dresses include OnceWed, Still White, and Nearly Newlywed.

, Photographers, bartenders, and tailors can increase the cost of the wedding. Think of friends who would be able to fulfill those roles in your wedding at a discounted price. Talk to people that you know and ask them if they would be interested in doing your wedding., Instead of having a florist get all of the materials for your arrangements, you can purchase flowers at wholesale and provide them to the florist. This will reduce the cost that you need to spend on flowers. Negotiate and have a conversation with your florist about what a tight budget you are on.If you or someone you know has gardens with naturally growing flowers, see if you can use them instead of having to purchase them.

, Instead of getting ornate and extravagant wedding materials, think small but refined. Keep an open mind and be willing to negotiate the quality of certain things to keep the price down. Speak to your partner and bounce ideas off them so that you stay realistic.

, Typically the bride and groom get gifts for people in the wedding party. If you're on a tight budget, consider skipping this tradition. You can also purchase cheaper gifts if you want to get something but don't want to spend a lot.Affordable gifts for bridesmaids include flowers, books, or cards.
Cheap gifts for the groomsman include a flask, whiskey rocks, pocket knives, or luggage tags.

If you have a beautiful backyard, consider having the wedding at your house. Think of your family and friends and write down a list of people who have a lot of outdoor space. If you need to rent, consider bartering any skills that you have for a discount on the building or function hall.If you are having your wedding outside, make sure that you have a backup plan in case it rains.
If you are asking to use someone else's property, you can say something like ""Me and Bill were really looking to save money, and you have a beautiful backyard. What do you think about having our wedding at your place?""

, Instead of having a professional photographer take photos, consider using your friends to create a photo album that you can remember. Encourage your friends and families to snap photos at the wedding and have them all upload the photos to a file sharing website. You can then create the album yourself, or you can do the project with a close friend.Websites like Eversnap will create an album taken by friends and family at the wedding. These services usually charge a fee.

, Instead of hiring a designer or printer to create custom guest invitations, consider designing and creating them yourself. If you aren't artistically inclined, ask your design-oriented friends for help or use a website like Freelancer, Fiverr, or Etsy to get your designs created cheaply. Then, once you have the design you can print them out yourself., Catering and food costs can run as some of the highest expenses for any wedding. If you aren't good at cooking, check to see if anyone in your family is and is willing to help. If no one in your family can cook, see if a local culinary school will cater your wedding at a discounted price., Instead of renting sound equipment, ask around your circle of family and friends to see if anyone has their own sound equipment that you can use. If your reception hall is smaller, you won't need a commercial grade sound system to play music. Get good speakers and hook them up to a laptop or iPod.Instead of hiring and paying for a DJ see if any of your family or friends wants to be in control of the playlist.

, Traditionally a reception serves a sit down dinner. Rather than pay the expense for catering, consider a less formal option for your reception. You could have a buffet style reception or have a breakfast or lunch reception earlier in the day. This will cut down on the food cost for your wedding."

For the bride: A mermaid style princess gown is a perfect way to fit in with the beach theme.,
For your cake, ask your baker to decorate it to fit an underwater theme, maybe edible sea shells out of fondant, candied sea creatures, etc.

",How to Plan a Romantic Beach Wedding," If it’s in a sheltered cove, the water should be calm and there shouldn’t be too much wind. If it’s fully exposed to the ocean, however, that could be a different story.;
, Your venue should be familiar with the tides, and should arrange your wedding so you and your guests will not float away halfway through the ceremony. It never hurts to check what time the tide starts to come in, in case you end running late.

, Make sure you have a good look at the beach and find out how private it is. It might look great in the photos but if there is a beach bar, or worse still a nudist beach right next to it, your ceremony might not be quite as serene as you imagine.

, Ideally, your venue should have direct access to the beach. If the venue is some distance from the sand but provides a shuttle to the beach, check how big the vehicle is and how long it takes; it could take a long time if a single minibus has to ferry all your guests back and forth.

, If the beach is a long way from the venue, your guests will not enjoy the ceremony if they are desperate to go to the toilet.

, Unless you are having a barbecue, a meal on the beach is going to be hard to organise, but if you want to eat on the sand you might be able to find a cater that specialises in beach wedding receptions. If you want to have the ceremony on the beach but your reception inside make sure you look for a venue that has a great view over the ocean; an ocean view terrace would be perfect.

, Ask your bridal shop if they have this variety available. Most notably, ask if the dress comes in sea colors, such as aqua, light peach, or cream to match the color of pearls or the sand.

This can add on a considerable amount of cost. To prevent yourself from spending outside of your budget, establish a limit for your spending.


You'll likely want to break your budget down by category to help prevent overspending in specific areas, including food, decorations, entertainment (like a DJ and dance floor), and so on.
As you plan, you may find that some things are more expensive than you first thought. Prepare yourself to be flexible. You may have to cut some of the more frivolous things to prevent excessive spending.;
, There are many things to coordinate when planning a wedding. Make a list of all the major requirements you'll need to pull off your plan. Set specific dates for when you want these requirements fulfilled so you don't fall behind in your planning.


Some examples of major requirements include: food, decorations, a venue, an officiant, entertainment, a photographer, and more.
It's best to set early deadlines. Wedding venues, photographers, and entertainment (like DJs or live music) have a tendency to fill up well in advance.

, It's best to keep a written record of your plans. As your wedding plans take shape, you may have to make changes, and a written record can help you remember these along with everything else you'll need.


You may want to use a shared digital document with your future spouse, like a saved file on a cloud account or Google Docs, so you can easily update and keep an eye on plans as they develop.
An Excel document is a great way of keeping track of your budgeting information. Not only will this keep it orderly, there are powerful Excel math functions that tally things like total cost, saving you from the effort.

, Sci-fi is a pretty broad category, and without some specification you could get guests arriving in anything from stormtrooper armor to future punk duds. This may make your wedding too busy or hodgepodge, and detract from the main focus. Some sci-fi sub-genres you might want to use to focus your wedding theme include:


Apocalyptic or post-apocalyptic
Cyberpunk
Hard sci-fi
Military sci-fi
Space opera
Space western

, Some places will be better suited for a sci-fi themed wedding than others. Churches, for example, might frown on less traditional weddings and decorations. Privately owned locations will likely allow you the most freedom.


Some private locations that you might have your wedding at include places like camp/park grounds, private property (like your backyard), event halls, and so on., You can borrow from your favorite sci-fi scenes to dress up your venue. For example, you might recreate the Yavin IV award ceremony from the end of Star Wars: A New Hope or the opera scene with the Diva from The Fifth Element. Some other scenes to consider include:


The bridge of the star ship Enterprise, or any one of the featured star ships in the Star Trek franchise.
The TARDIS interior (from Doctor Who)
An otherworldly scene that mimics a different planet, like Mars, or a desert planet, like Arrakis from Frank Herbert's Dune Chronicles., Include graphics and designs from your sub-genre or franchise specific themes on your wedding invitations. These might include things like popular characters, devices, spaceships/vehicles, iconic scenes, and so on.Remember to include information about attire for the wedding. If you expect guests to dress the part, you might want to include some simple suggestions.
You might choose an iconic font, like the opening crawl font used at the beginning of Star Wars, to set the tone of your invitation.
For example, on a Star Trek themed invite, you might include graphics of phasers, communicators, and a picture of the space station Deep Space Nine.

, If you want guest to dress up, many of your friends and family will likely get into the spirit of things and bring a costume of their own. Some guest, however, may not. If you want your atmosphere to be consistent for all guests, you might want to have a few simple costumes on hand.


For example, if you have a Star Wars themed wedding, you could buy some simple, inexpensive robes so that uncostumed guests will look like Jawas or Jedi.Extra costumes for a Star Trek theme might include some plain colored shirts in the style of crew member uniforms (e.g. red shirts, gold shirts, blue shirts).

, Simple centerpieces might be made up of action figures from your sub-genre or franchise specific theme.More elaborate designs might be in the spirit of your sub-genre or chosen franchise, like:


Model spaceships as centerpieces for space opera and hard sci-fi genres.
Fake blasters and laser swords for military sci-fi themes.
Cyberpunk doodads purchased from artisans, like those sold on Etsy or at renaissance festivals., For franchise specific weddings (like Star Wars, Star Trek, Doctor Who, and so on) you could use make a playlist of your favorite songs from the franchise soundtrack. For more general themes, you might:


Choose music that evokes a spacey feel, like The Planets (Holst), Symphony Fantastique (Berlioz), or the Firebird Suite (Stravinsky).
Use music based on major works of science fiction, like Space Jazz (based on Battlefield Earth) or Geidi Primes (based on Dune).

, If you want to go all out, you can research recipes online that imitate popular dishes from your sub-genre or franchise. However, it might be easiest to simply rename common dishes, like steak, meat, and fish entrees in the spirit of your theme. For example:


You might call your fish entree the Mon Calarmari Course (Star Wars) or the So Long and Thanks for All the Fish Course (Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy).
A steak entree could be renamed the Tribble Course (Star Trek) or Shai-hulud Steak (Dune).
Vegetarian entrees might be neat if renamed the Avatar Course (Avatar) or the Eloi Course (The Time Machine).

, A wedding cake is often more a decoration than a desert, so it's only fitting that it matches your theme. You might ask a cake shop or a friend who's a master cake baker to design a cake in the shape of:Popular devices and vehicles from your sub-genre or franchise, like weapons, ships, robots, and so on.
Characters, aliens, or alien animals that are prominent in your chosen sub-genre or franchise.

Create payment plans.",How to Pay for Your Own Wedding," Do this before you do anything else, including setting a date. You will need to know exactly how much money you can set aside, monthly, in order to know how much money you can afford to spend on your wedding.;
, You might be surprised at how much cheaper it is to throw a wedding in December than in the peak wedding season of the summer or early fall. Talk to venues and caterers in your area to see if they would give you a discount for having your wedding during off-peak season or even on a Friday instead of a Saturday.

, Making a budget beforehand will help you figure out how many people you can potentially afford to feed at the wedding reception.

, As soon as you and your fiancé get engaged, go to the bank and see about opening a separate savings account primarily for wedding funds. Set up your paycheck so a portion of it is directly deposited into your wedding account. Look for a savings account with a high interest rate. If you're saving for a long time, you might as well get your money's worth.

, Maybe you know someone who has taken wedding photographs before and would be willing to work for free or for a percentage of their normal fee. You might be friends with a graphic designer who can design your wedding invitations for you. You might be surprised to see how willing your friends and family will be to donate their time and skills to giving you the wedding of your dreams.

, A wedding planner will cost you extra money but may know about discounts and deals that you don't. You can depend on a wedding planner to cut costs for you, so you know that everyone is working hard to save as much of your money as possible.

, Open a credit card to use for only wedding purchases. This will spread the payments out a bit so you don't have to pay for everything all at once.

, Talk to your venue, your photographer and your caterer about what payment plans they offer. You'd be surprised at how willing they are to work with a payment schedule if it means they will get your business.

Check to see if one of the hotels that is suggested in the wedding invitation is listed as a vacation option.;
, Always choose to include nearby airports and take advantage of non-peak travel.

, A strange part of air travel is that it is often cheaper to take two flights than one. Book a one-way trip to a major city with a layover in the wedding destination, and then get off with a carry-on bag at the layover.


Note that the airline will cancel your return flight if you have booked a return ticket.

, Look for car shares that are available in the area and sign up for an account in advance. Book the car according to the times you need it and you can pay $3 to $7 per hour.

, Stay in a room with two queen beds, and it will likely be cheaper than booking your own rooms. Better yet, check on a suite and get more couples involved.

, If you aren’t completely sure that your plans are settled, get the travel insurance. The $17 to $50 cost for insurance will likely be far less than you save by booking early.

, Book the venue hotel for only the wedding night. Save money with a cheaper option for nights before and after the wedding., If you need to stay more than one night, VRBO, HomeAway and AirBnB can offer great details on bulk accommodations. You will also probably get a kitchenette so that you can save money on food.If you are single, you can find room rentals or ask the bride and groom if they have local friends who would be willing to put you up., Since there will be photographic evidence of your fashion choices, try to swap with friends in different circles. Trade throughout the summer so that you look like you’ve bought a new dress for each wedding, without spending a dime.

, If you’re a woman, choose wedges since they are good for outdoor or indoor weddings. The dress is more important than the shoes, while they often get thrown off anyway in order to dance.

, For men, one suit that fits well can be accessorized with a tie, pocket square and cufflinks in several different ways. Renting a suit is only a good idea if you go to a wedding once in a while.

, Buy clothes that you can wear to work as well as a wedding. Make sure your clothes go with your one pair of wedding shoes.

, There are even sites where you can rent bridesmaid dresses for $50 a day, instead of buying one for $200.

, Early birds will get the best choice of items. If an item is on sale, you are also more likely to get a good deal.

, Amazon, Bed, Bath and Beyond, Target and Macy’s are known for providing options to get free shipping, so choose this registry over another one that charges $15 for shipping.

, If you are close to several friends who are attending the wedding, get together and pay $25 to $50 per person to buy them a larger item on their registry. Large presents are a huge surprise and they are likely to be impressed that you organized such a thoughtful gift., Try crafting a photo album, family recipe box or wall art. Look on Martha Stewart's website and in her books to find good DIY options that look expensive.

, Offering your professional services will help the bride and groom save money. You may be able to give them something they could not otherwise afford.


For example, opt to make the cake, do the flour arrangements, create a photo booth or sew some table runners.

, The bride and groom should be happy with your company. Get them a card with a sincere message inside.

, The rates of everything right from DJs, the hall to the photographers is much higher on Saturdays.

, Having your wedding in the peak season of June means you may shoot well past your budget since this is the time when the prices are at their highest.

,, Hence there is no need to invite each and every person you know on earth. Send invitations to close relatives and friends only.

, They charge a bomb for the work which can be done free of cost by your cousins, relatives and friends.

, They come cheap and make the atmosphere jovial. Along with balloons, you can also use lace and ribbons which would make the venue even more spectacular.

, Beautiful candles would light up the whole place, giving it a very romantic touch and this would bring down your costs as well. In fact you can easily make pretty candles yourself or get your friends to help you out.

, Place them on the table and let your relatives and friends click photographs themselves. And if the idea of disposable cameras doesn’t appeal to you, you can hire photography students. They can do a great job in a much lesser amount.

, Make sure food is appetizing and guests would not mind self-serving at all.

, Online bridal shops are the best place from where you can buy elegant bridal gowns at discounted prices. Online stores contain a vast collection of bridal dresses in different styles and designs and which you can browse from the comfort of your home. Besides, online bridal stores also offer attractive discounts and clearance gowns.

, Though wedding favors are a tradition, they are not a necessity. But if you wish to present guests with favors, you can always make wedding favors at home rather than spending money on buying expensive ones.

, Some public parks are available without charge if you are not inviting many guests and you reserve well ahead of time. If you are a member of a church, chances are you can use it for the ceremony at no cost. Save money by having the ceremony and reception at the same place.

, You will save money in the end, and chances are you were going to have to hire a caterer anyway. Perhaps a relative has a place you can use for your guests, a large yard with a tent. It's all about planning and possibilities.

, Most caterers are willing to work within your budget, even if that means avoiding the 3-course meal and focusing more on hors d'oeuvres. Also, if you are having an open bar, serve just beer and wine instead of hard liquor.

Plan your wedding cake the same way: check for local schools with cooking programs or relatives or friends who work at bakeries.







, The florist is one of the most expensive characteristics of a wedding and there are many faux-flower alternatives. Also, consider non-floral centerpieces, like using candles that you can buy in bulk or placing board games in the middle of all the tables as both a centerpiece and a conversation starter.

, Sometimes the cheapest and unique way to do something for your wedding is to make it yourself. Do the calligraphy for your own place cards, make your own favors, and create your own ceremony programs.

, You probably already know someone who can take the photos the day of the wedding or someone who can help you design invitations. Most of your loved ones would love to help you create your unique wedding, so all you have to do is ask.

, The play list will be what you want instead of concerns of paying someone else.

, Look for your wedding dress at a second-hand shop. Shop around Etsy for bridesmaid gifts. You can find old vases to use for centerpieces at thrift stores, as well as other fun and unique elements to include on your big day.

Forget fancy invitations.,
Don’t try to impress.,
Keep the decorations simple.,
Have simple favors.,
Have simple entertainment.,
Have a coordinator.,
Hold it early in the day.",How to Keep Your Wedding As Simple As Possible," If you can pull this one step off, the cost for just about everything else will go down, and everything will be fairly simple in comparison. Try to limit the guest list to just the main family members and add just a few close friends.;
, The biggest cost is often food. Keep it lower in cost by keeping it to a reasonable level and not having an extravagant, fancy dinner. Avoid having a large amount of dishes and desserts either. Simply choose a few key dishes, all of them simple, and leave it at that. While it is great that people enjoy the food, they are not coming there to have a fancy meal — they are there simply to celebrate your marriage and enjoy your company. If that’s not enough for them, it’s not your problem.

, When it comes to food, you can go two ways — simple in terms of how much trouble it’ll be (go with a caterer) or simple in terms of costs (have family prepare food). It is best to cater. This way, family can just get dressed and show up and enjoy the celebration and nobody has last minute worries.

, Ask for help from a few friends and family. Instead of trying to do all the preparations on your own, others should be enlisted. And most people love to help. There are a lot of little details that need to be taken care of, and if you try to do everything yourself, you’ll be running around like crazy. Instead, allow others to help out, delegate certain tasks, and when they do them, check them off your list. It makes life a lot easier.

, Choose the simplest attire in terms of how much work it’ll take, and for men that’s a rented tuxedo. Tuxedos are hassle free. For the girls, have a cheap dressmaker create some simple dresses for the little girls, then buy some very simple dresses for the bridesmaids. The bride, of course, should have a nice dress, but look for one that is fairly inexpensive, with a pretty and classic look.

, Traditional wedding invitations have a couple of different envelopes, tissue paper, some other paper, and that’s all before you even get to the invitation itself. It’s way too much trouble and too expensive. Print your invitations yourselves, on your printer, on stock stationery from an office supply store. You don't even need to put them in envelopes or address them. Just print two invitations per 8.5×11″ sheet of paper, cut the paper in half, and passed out the invitations like that. And instead of mailing them, have family pass them out.

, This is key — if you try to impress people with your fancy wedding, you’ll go to a lot of trouble and expense. It’s really not worth it. Everyone has been to fancy weddings, and while they’re nice, they last for one day and they put you deeply in debt. Rather, stay out of debt, minimize your stress levels, and spend some of the money on your honeymoon. It really doesn’t matter to the guests anyway — they’re just there to celebrate your wedding, and don’t really care if you don’t go all out. If they do, that’s their problem.

, Have a few floral arrangements, some candles, and that’s it. Very minimal, very little trouble, very little expense.

, Try some traditional candy, put in little inexpensive favor boxes. And that’s all.

, Book traditional dancers, an acoustic musical group, and that’s all.

, This doesn’t have to be a fancy wedding coordinator, but can simply be a family member who you trust to run things according to your plan. If you have someone else taking care of all the details on the day of the wedding yourself, you don’t have to worry about it, and can relax and enjoy the festivities.

, A morning wedding means a lunch buffet. This minimizes costs, and allows you to finish early and go to your hotel room afterward before you’re completely exhausted. Consider holding it on a weekday (for example, Friday), so many people will have to go back to work after lunch, meaning the party won’t last that long and there won’t be any drinking. That keeps things even simpler.

Choose your wedding destination.,
Keep three words in your mind at all times: simplicity, simplicity, simplicity.,
Choose your date carefully.,
Understand that stationery can be expensive in department stores and specialist shops, but honestly, who remembers what the invitation looked like?,
Have a morning wedding and a lunchtime reception.,
Provide your own music.,
Remember to figure in the cost of a dress.,
Get people involved.,
Set limits on your guest list.,
Say thank you nicely!",How to Get Married on a Budget (UK)," Churches, synagogues, and even your own home or future spouse's home is less expensive than most other venues.;
, Lots of weddings are overly-complicated which makes them a logistical nightmare and expensive. Keep things as simple as possible and you will have more cash to splash on the important things and less stress leading up to and on the day.

, Of course, the perfect English wedding is in June, July and August when the British summer is at its blue-skied peak, or perhaps at Christmas or Easter. The trouble is, is that at these times, lots of people want to get married and you are having to compete to get good venues and photographers. Get married out of season - venues are cheap, you can have your pick of them and the roads are empty! If you get married in Summer and it rains everyone says ""Oh what a pity!"" However, if you get married in February, and it doesn't rain it's a bonus!

, Shop around and order online - W.H. Smith do an excellent range!

, People drink far less at lunchtime anyway, but if you put a bottle of red and a bottle of white on each table and provide a glass of bubbly (good Cava is often better than cheap champagne!) on arrival and one for the toasts, that is more than enough. Lunch time receptions lend themselves to buffets - so much more sociable than a sit down meal as people get up and mingle!

, Bands, DJs and Orchestras can be very expensive.

, You can rent wedding dresses or do the eBay thing if the big white frock is what you want. Have a good look around the department stores and on the high street though and consider wearing something a bit less traditional. It is also cheaper than you might think to have clothes made!

, Who do you know who can bake a cake, decorate a cake, arrange flowers? Do not turn down offers of help! This is how a wedding should be - a family affair with everyone pitching in.

, Keep it to immediate family and closest friends - you can always have more people at the reception later to include all the people you couldn't invite to the wedding ceremony. Whittle it down to 50 for the reception. You can pack the church or synagogue - it won't cost you a penny! 50 will feel like a lot of people when you have them all together in one place and you have to talk to them all, but the point is that you CAN talk to 50 people.

, Lots of people will have put time and effort on your big day. Say thank you by turning a few of your photos into postcards. It is easy to get this done and people will love it. A few choice sentences on the back and everyone will feel special.

, If you don't want to scrimp on the venue or honeymoon, this is the best way to spend money on the things that matter. The guest list will remain small and many of the details can be provided by the venue you decide to rent.

, Fall and winter weddings can be made instantly charming by using the season to your advantage. An elegant fall wedding can be held in an orchard amidst falling leaves, while an elegant winter wedding can include snowflakes and accents in shades of icy blue and white.

,How to Have an Elegant Wedding on a Budget5,
"
Make sure that the decoration and design is the right kind to suit your taste, before you agree to give an order to the baker.,
Decide on how you want to decorate your wedding cake, whether you want to keep it simple and cute or splendid and rich.,
Consider borrowing the pillars.,
Find prices at a cake making or culinary school near your place.,
Save on your wedding cake topper prices.,
If you buy a multi-tiered cake, see that you decorate it yourself or have the florist do it for you.,
Consider a smaller tiered cake for effect, and get a sheet cake to feed the guests.,
If your venue charges a cutting fee for cakes brought in from outside sources, consider a cupcake tower.,
Find out your bakers fee structure before you book.,
Find out what portion size the baker is using.,
A design that is easy for that particular baker is going to cost you less than a design that is more difficult for that baker.,
Bakers are more eager to give you the little ""something extra"" if you are easy to work with and pay on time with their payment schedule.,
If you can't afford your original cake design after booking work with your baker to design a new one that does fit your budget better.,
Order your cake early as you may be able to lock in the cost of the cake with some bakers before price increases take effect for a given year.",How to Get a Lower Wedding Cake Price," Go through referrals and see what prices are being quoted. Look through their real portfolio first before deciding on your cake (not the 3-ring binder of flawless images). A supermarket could offer a wide range of cakes at a lesser cost than your bakery. However, you should note whether their cakes are made on the spot or produced elsewhere and shipped in. Many supermarkets get their cakes in frozen, baked in a central commissary. Freezing cake doesn't necessarily damage it, but thawing and refreezing cake and holding them an extra long time, does damage them. In addition you will have to provide your own delivery to the reception. Make sure someone has an SUV that is clean. Do not allow someone to hold the cake or place it in a seat, both are a disaster waiting to happen.;
, Avoid over-decorating the cake. It is not necessary to have a five-tiered cake. Your baker will help you determine what size cake you need for your guest count.

, There are disposable pillars available with your local baker or rental companies which are a better alternative than those crystal pillars if you want to cut down on the cost of the pillars. Let the baker or your local rental company help you with the disposable pillars instead of the crystal ones.

, Students have baking and decorating cakes as part of their curriculum. This may be a way to save a substantial amount of money, but you should be aware that your cake is being made by students and may not have the same quality as one made by a more experienced pastry chef.

, Often relatives and well-wishers ask what you need as a gift. Ask them for a wedding cake topper.

, If you want flowers on your cake but the cost of the sugar flowers isn't fitting in your budget, let your florist put real flowers on the cake. Just make sure that they are non-toxic. Check the price of the organic edible flowers. Silk flowers may be a better cost-saving solution.

, Even though it can be tempting to supplement with sheet cakes from the grocery store, consider kitchen cakes for your extra servings. A kitchen cake is an undecorated cake that looks exactly like your wedding cake when cut and is cheaper than a decorated cake of the same size. This way you can save a little and all your guests will get the same beautiful slice of cake and some will not feel like they got shafted with a grocery store sheet cake. Not only that, but many bakers won't provide a cake if you will be serving other cakes for insurance purposes and to protect their reputation.

, This will be priced comparably to a tiered cake, and you can avoid the cutting fee since there is no cutting and plating involved for the venue's staff. Note that some reception sites call it a ""cake service"" fee because it covers plates, silverware, and the server/dishwasher for the extra time involved thus may apply to cupcakes or table cakes as well.

, Find out things like: do they charge a delivery fee, what is the rental on cake stands, do they charge a setup fee, do they charge extra for fillings or which fillings are included in the price, if you find out your guest list is smaller than when you booked can you change the size of the cake (thus reducing the cost of the cake in many cases), what is the payment structure and is there a discount for paying cash up front, is the cake price locked in for X amount of servings or will the price go up if there is a price increase for the baker (minimum wage hike, ingredient cost hike, etc.), etc.

, A baker that uses a fruitcake slice is a different portion size than a baker using a party slice than is a baker using a wedding slice. The same counts for cupcakes as there are mini, regular, muffin, and Texas sizes available. When figured inch per inch regular cupcakes can actually be more expensive than having a tiered cake since the portion is different. A baker charging $5/slice with a fruitcake slice vs. a baker charging $5/slice for a party slice is a significantly different value for the money.

, Just as you have a specialty in the job you perform daily so does each individual baker. Keep it easy on them it'll keep it easy on your pocketbook.

, A little open communication goes a long way. Thursday through Sunday are your baker's busiest days of the week giving other brides the same attention you want given to your cake, don't expect immediate replies to your email or calls during those days. Stay easy to work with and your baker will be more likely to do the little extra on the value side of your cake than you otherwise may have gotten. If you have to send a check, make sure it's sent before your deadline and use a service like priority mail with delivery confirmation so you can send your baker the tracking number and help avoid any problems involving ""the check is in the mail"" potentially losing your deposit if it doesn't arrive in time.

, Refer to the above: A little open communication goes a long way!

, This can also help you avoid extra fees such as ""late fees"" if the cake is booked last minute (2 months or less from the event).

Evaluate your finances.,
Estimate wedding costs.,
Decide how much you are willing to spend.,
Prioritize your wants and needs.,
Create a budget--and stick to it.",How to Minimize Destination Wedding Costs1," Sit down with your betrothed, and take a hard look at your finances. Look at your monthly expenses, the money you take in each month, and any extra you might have. You should also look at any areas you can cut costs in for a while, such as lowering your phone plan or eliminating your satellite TV service.Be honest with yourselves about how much you make and how much you can save. If you cannot have the wedding of your dreams with what you make, you can always opt for a long engagement.;
, Wedding costs vary considerably based on decorations, clothing, travel, food, and a myriad of other factors. Discuss what you want in your wedding--your must-haves and things you can let go of--and create a clear estimate of how much your dream wedding is going to cost.After you’ve created a dream wedding cost list, eliminate unnecessary expenses and create 1-3 more scenarios to keep your options open.

, After you’ve reviewed wedding costs, come to an agreement on how much the two of you are willing to spend. If one party wants to spend more than the other, begin whittling down (or lifting up) your respective ideal budgets and agree on a price or price range., Create a list detailing your wants and needs in order from “absolutely must have” to “I can live without it.” This will be absolutely necessary when you create your budget; if you are over your budget, you can begin to whittle away the “I can live without” items and hold onto your must-haves.This step can be tricky, as many couples have different priorities. Start with “must-haves” you both agree on, and move on to one-sided musts next.

, Once you’ve created your priorities, craft your budget, taking into account any savings or cost-cutting you’ve found. Once you reach the final number you are willing to spend, stick to that number--no exceptions. Your budget is there to keep your wedding a responsible celebration of your union. It is not worth going into debt over.Make sure you are realistic when running numbers. Hoping for $200 flower arrangements when you’ve only seen $500 arrangements will get you into trouble quickly.

By setting a clear amount at the outset, you can save yourself a lot of grief and be more incisive as you make your decisions.;
, During these times everything is far less crowded and much cheaper. Keep in mind that the dry season in Hawaii is April through October, so if you are thinking about an outdoor wedding, that time period is least likely to be rainy. Additionally, weekends are much more expensive and crowded than weekdays.


Avoid planning your wedding in June or July. This is peak tourist season in Hawaii, and during those months the cost of everything is very high.
Even during dry season, rain is a possibility. In general, most of the rain occurs at night, so an evening wedding outdoors could be affected by this.
Consider having an indoor back-up venue, just in case.

, All of the islands are beautiful, but getting married on Oahu is considered the easiest and cheapest route. Prices for everything are generally significantly cheaper there than on the outer islands. Even better, Oahu has the most options for wedding venues.


Oahu is the third largest of the Hawaiian islands, and is home to Honolulu, the capitol. There is a lot to see and do there, so you'll have no lack of pre and post wedding activities to choose from.
The international airport of Hawaii is located there, so it is also the most accessible location in Hawaii.

, This may sound like a luxury choice, especially if you are on a tight budget, but planning a wedding remotely is extremely hard to do. Unless you have friends or family that live on the island, hiring a coordinator will actually end up saving you money.


Coordinators can assist you with finding the perfect venue, hiring the minister, and are often marriage license agents themselves, allowing you to kill a lot of birds with one stone by working with one.
Most coordinators will provide you with wedding package options that vary in price, with many being quite affordable.
These packages are often all-inclusive (the more expensive the package, the more it includes), so choosing a package could provide everything from the hotel all the way down to the wedding cake and decorations., The state of Hawaii now requires that you obtain a permit to marry in the sand on the beach. Luckily these permits are cheap (about $20) and easily obtainable online without a waiting period or delay. If you work with a coordinator, they will usually take care of securing the permit for you, but it wouldn't hurt to inquire and confirm with them, just in case.Other low cost wedding venues to explore are national parks, state parks and botanical gardens. Rules vary, as far as number of guests allowed and whether or not a permit is required, so give yourself plenty of time to research and take care of these details.
Don’t forget to ask about any noise ordinances, and be sure to follow them., If they bring them along to give to you at the ceremony, you will have to haul all of them back with you, which could end up costing you a considerable sum. Instead, ask everyone to mail them to your home address.

Try to limit yourselves to one bag.,
Get married during cocktail hour.,
Get married during the week.,
Use a local officiator.,
Complete wedding plans yourselves.,
Minimize decor.",How to Minimize Destination Wedding Costs2," Most airlines allow only one bag for free, and charge for any additional bags. To avoid these charges, take only a single checked bag, and do not make any large, unnecessary purchases while you are traveling, as you will have to find a way to take them home.If you want to purchase gifts to bring home to loved ones, stick to small gifts such as scarves, or other small, easy-to-pack items that will not add a lot of bulk.

, Providing dinner for guests is one of the most significant expenses involved in a wedding. Instead of having a lunch or dinner, get married and have your reception during cocktail hour, and provide guests with only light finger foods.For an additional festive touch, visit a local market for your wedding food. This will also keep costs low, and will lend a more authentic atmosphere to your nuptials.

, Even when traveling in the off season, wedding expenses can skyrocket if you get married on a weekend, as this is the most popular time for planning events. Opt for a mid-week wedding to avoid weekend prices.Getting married mid-week can be difficult for your guests, so make sure you let your guests know as far in advance as possible, and specify the day of your wedding as well as the date.

, While it might be nice to be familiar with your officiator, using local officiators will keep costs low. If you invite a clergyman or friend of your own choosing from home, you will likely be expected to cover the cost of traveling and a hotel for this person. Instead, contact the authorities where you are planning to wed and ask about local customs and expectations regarding marriage and officiators.Some countries require a significant waiting period, so make sure you clear all of your plans with local authorities before solidifying your travel plans.

, Instead of enlisting the services of a wedding planner, complete as much of the planning as possible yourself. Wedding planning can get extremely expensive, while taking care of plans yourself can offer you the opportunity to negotiate prices.This approach to wedding planning can also extend to decorations and invitations. Design and print your invitations yourself, take your own engagement photos, or even create your own decorations.
If you do not feel comfortable creating wedding items yourself, enlist the services of a friend at a discounted price.

, Destination weddings are typically chosen for their scenery, so take advantage of the natural beauty of your chosen locale, and let that beauty serve as your source of decoration. A beach wedding, for instance, needs little to create stunning photos and memories.This can extend to the bridal bouquet, as well. Instead of purchasing expensive flower arrangements, pick local flowers or fauna and make a small bouquet, yourself.

Travel in the off-season.,
Check flight prices first.,
Compare prices.,
Check hotel restrictions.,
Check wedding packages.,
Travel close by.",How to Minimize Destination Wedding Costs3," The off-season will depend largely on the location you choose, but most places experience a higher volume of visitors in spring and summer. To cut costs, plan your wedding and travels for autumn or winter. This can save not only on airfare, but also on wedding venues and hotel booking.Make sure you are aware of any inclement weather associated with the off season, such as hurricanes or blizzards, and work your calendar around weather patterns to avoid a failed wedding attempt.

, Base your wedding date around flight prices. Before you set a date, check flights for your desired location, and choose a date that offers low prices. If you search early enough, you might even be able to travel in a higher-volume season for less money.Extend this same courtesy to your guests. If you found cheap flights, get your invitations out quickly so that your guests can take advantage of lower prices, as well.

, Before you settle on a wedding venue, compare prices, including hotel prices, travel costs, and ceremony expenses. Some venues will be inexpensive to use, but will cost too much to travel to, while others might have the opposite problem. Choose a destination that not only suits your wants, but also takes your budget restrictions into account., Some hotels require you to use their vendors, their clergy, and their facilities for all parts of your wedding, while others are extremely lax in their rules and regulations. Take this into account when choosing a venue, as you might not like the facilities for both a wedding and a reception., The style of wedding you want will determine what type of hotel you want to visit. If you are a more controlling personality, you might want a hotel that gives the reins to you. If you are a relaxed personality, you might like the convenience of an all-inclusive package.


All-inclusive packages can be more expensive, but they can also be budget-friendly, as you don’t want to find and negotiate with vendors on your own.

, Destination weddings do not have to be to far-off places. You can have a destination wedding at a small beach town 5 hours away from your home. You can have a destination wedding as little as two hours away. When you decide on your venue, distance should not be the first priority. Instead, your first priority should be finding a venue you love.If you met in college in another state, you can get married on your college campus. Get creative with your destination, and give yourself the freedom to be sentimental.

Create a “must-have” list.,
Explain your plans to others.,
Invite only who you can accommodate.,
Do not offer to pay for guests’ expenses.,
Host a home-based reception.",How to Minimize Destination Wedding Costs4," When creating your guest list, craft a list of people you absolutely want in attendance. Typically, this includes parents, siblings, and close friends. If you have a large family, you might also include aunts and uncles. Do not deviate from this specific, pared-down list when preparing your invitations.Write this list according to your unique wants. If you are not close to your parents, they might not be included in your “must have” invitations.

, Before sending out invitations, explain your travel plans to friends, distant family, and acquaintances who might be offended by not receiving an invitation to the ceremony. Coworkers, too, might be interested to learn of your destination wedding plans, and will likely be placated by the knowledge that few people will be in attendance.This step will relieve some of the discomfort of planning an intimate destination wedding. Planning a large-scale destination wedding is both stressful and expensive, so defending your choice upfront is key.

, Although it is common to extend “courtesy” invitations to people you are certain will not be able to attend, avoid this practice. Some of your courtesy invitations might end up being able to go, which will put more financial strain on your family.Your accommodate list might be slightly larger than your must have list, and could include friends and family that are not as close. If your budget does not permit more guests, however, your “must have” list and “accommodate” list can be identical.

, Of those you do invite, make it clear that airfare and a place to stay are not included in the wedding, and that all expenses will need to be paid from their own pocket. While providing food or drinks following the ceremony is to be expected, you cannot and should not be expected to foot the bill for every guest’s airfare and hotel.While you do not have to pay for your guests, do check with the hotel you are staying at to determine whether or not they offer discounts for large parties. If they do, you can pass these savings along to your guests.

, Host a small reception back home for everyone who was not invited to be a part of the wedding ceremony to make them feel included while keeping your wedding costs low.Your reception can be as big or small as you’d like. Traditionally, receptions such as these are more like meet-and-greets, where people come to wish you well. You do not need to go all out and provide dinner, purchase fresh attire, or do a lot of decorating.

Elope.,
Organize a small wedding party of 10-12 guests.,
Arrange a wedding brunch or lunch for under 20 guests.,
Ask guests to pay their own travel and hotel expenses.",How to Get Married in Hawaii for Cheap2," A romantic ceremony for two is the most budget-conscious wedding option.Many resorts and wedding coordinators have “Just The Two of You” wedding packages that are extremely affordable. Start by checking out the major hotels and resorts for wedding packages, and go from there.


Most basic wedding packages include the ceremony set up, minister, flowers and decorations, cake, champagne and sometimes even the photography and a romantic dinner for the two of you.
After the ceremony, the rest of your stay will be your honeymoon, so there are no additional costs to travel elsewhere.

, Many resorts and wedding planners offer affordable packages for a small number of guests, which would include the ceremony, champagne and cake.In lieu of a reception, arrange for everyone to enjoy dinner at a large table at the hotel’s restaurant, or in their garden or nearby on the beach.


Check airlines for discounts that cover the air fare for small wedding parties. Look for any wedding packages that might include accommodations and multi-room discounts.

, This works best for guests that are close friends and family only. Keep the details simple and have your wedding in the late morning, to be followed by a wedding brunch or lunch that essentially functions as a reception. This is a particularly lovely idea for outdoors, when the temperature is just right.


Cost for alcohol will be very low, since the event is so early, and you won’t need to worry about spending money on a band or DJ.
After brunch, guests can either go off and do their own activities or you can plan activities that everyone can do together.

, When it comes to destination weddings, guests are typically expected to pay for their own airfare and travel accommodations.This is not unusual and makes things very affordable for you. Of course, if your wedding budget allows it, paying for those things is a wonderful sentiment on your part. However, it is not expected or required.


Since guests will be expected to pay their own way, you will need to send out invitations quite early, in order to give them plenty of time to prepare for travel. No less than 6 months out is a reasonable time frame. 8 months prior to the event or even a full year is much better, though.
Think carefully about who you want to invite, especially considering the financial burden that will be placed on the guests to attend. Keep things simple and small.

"

Keep flowers and decorations to a minimum.,
Go with a more casual approach to wedding attire.Destination weddings typically aren’t traditional, and that includes the approach to attire.,
Enlist tech savvy guests to help with photography.,
Book services as early as possible.Generally, booking services and locations early will help you lock in a much lower price.",How to Get Married in Hawaii for Cheap3," Instead, incorporate Hawaii’s natural beauty into your ceremony. This is especially easy to do when you’re planning an outdoor wedding, since paradise is all around you.


Have a wedding coordinator assist you with finding the perfect spot where you can take full advantage of Hawaii’s natural beauty.
Botanical gardens are a popular and beautiful choice, but you have plenty of options.

, Tailor your style of dress to your surroundings. Keep it simple and consider a less formal dress code.


A traditional white wedding dress with a train would be out of place on the beach, and a tuxedo will probably be hot and uncomfortable for a groom in Hawaii.
Consider casual and beach attire for both the couple and the guests.
Make sure that your guests know ahead of time what to wear so that they can plan accordingly.

, A professional photographer is a great investment, but try going with a very basic photography package at a low cost. You will still have gorgeous professional photos from the wedding, but your tech savvy friends and family can help you get plenty of additional pictures from the event.


Technology is such that almost anyone can get great photos with a decent digital camera and even a cell phone, especially when you factor in all of the filters and editing possibilities that apps can provide.

, The closer you get to the wedding date, the more the services will end up costing you, so give yourself plenty of time to book in advance.


If you choose to go with a wedding coordinator, this is yet another area that they can significantly help you out with.

Draw up a budget.,
Figure out how many guests you can invite.,
Decide how many courses you want.,
Do your research.,
Plan the menu.,
Save money for the bar costs.",How to Budget for a Sit Down Wedding Dinner," It is most important that you know exactly how much money you're working with, as well as how much of your wedding budget you can designate to a sit-down dinner.;
, A sit-down wedding dinner can cost anywhere from $30 to $150 per person. If you're inviting over 200 people, you may want to stick to the lower end of the spectrum, but if you're only inviting 50 people, you may be able to spend a bit more.

, In most cases, the more courses you have, the more expensive the meal is going to be. Cut courses to save on cost.

, Before you go anywhere, look up caterers you are interested in online and see if you can get a quote. If you cannot get a quote online, make appointments with different caterers. Be honest about your budget. If the caterer is out of your price range, it's better to know early. Similarly, if the caterer knows your budget, he or she may be more likely to work with you on cutting costs.

, Once you decide what caterer to use, you will need to finalize what food to serve at the reception. See if the caterer will give you any discounts if you order certain foods to be served. For instance, chicken is usually cheaper than seafood.

, If you are doing an open bar, you will probably have to play a flat fee (usually about $10 per person) for alcohol. Even if you are having a cash bar, you will have to pay for the bartenders. Bottles of champagne are usually extra, so keep that in mind if you plan on doing a champagne toast.

Google photographers in the area.,
Know what you had left from Google.,
Look for amateurs.,
Consider your job.,
Look around to see if there are photographers in the area affiliated with a church and do charity work.,
Advertise your wedding to the public.",How to Get a Deal on a Wedding Photographer," You will want them to be located as close to you as possible so that gas is not an issue. Look at their website and pick the ones that fit your ""style"", the ones that stand out to you and excite you about what your gallery will look like. Make a list of the ones you love and call them. Talk about what you want, your budget, and if they are available.


Let the photographers that you think might work know you will get back to them shortly. If you really like them, don't wait too long. If they take it offensively that you do not want to book right now, write them off.They don't care about what you want, they only care about the money. Cross off the photographers you can't afford, are booked, or you just didn't click with. Start a fresh new list.;
, Now, look up photographer meet-ups in your area, or places they go to show off their work. Make them laugh, make them like you, show them a good time. People, especially photographers, like people who admire their work as well as a good laugh and conversation. Bring up your wedding. From there you will have quite a few interested in doing the wedding for you.


Let them know your price range. By the end of the night you will have plenty more photographers to choose from on your list. Put them in order from least expensive to most and then do more research on their galleries. Now it is time to downsize the list, but try keeping the ones you take off on a separate back-up list just in time. You also want quality over price. It is very cool when you find a photographer that has both, but it is very hard, depending on where you live.

, If you know any photographers that are just starting out, they would probably do a mock wedding to see if they could produce the quality of photos that you want. Make sure there are enough distractions there so you know they can work under pressure. If it doesn't work out, at least you had fun and have a few fun photos to show off. If you do not know any amateur photographers, try Craigslist, but be very selective and make sure they know what they are doing.

, What do you do for a living? Some photographers are willing to trade services. Ask around. The worst that can happen is no one is interested at the moment.

, You could even lower the fee for those with low income.

, If it is alluring enough, you might just get a few photographers offering their services just to get their name out there and make a few more clients in the process. Let them know they can advertise their services in some way at the wedding. It might seem like an inconvenience, but if you want quality photos that you cannot afford you might want to think about making a few sacrifices.

Reserve a block of rooms for your guests several months before the wedding for the best rates.


Speak with the appropriate manager when asking for discounts and reserving rooms.
Don't be afraid to haggle! Some haggling is acceptable! You just don't need to be rude about it.;
, Venues, catering, and florists tend to be cheaper in small towns than in large metropolitan areas. Find an out-of-the-way hamlet nearby that is drivable for attendees but not going to cost as much as your actual city.

, Consider getting married during an off season, such as Lent, September through November, or April. You will be able to negotiate rental prices with reception halls due to decreased demand and business. For instance, if you marry during Lent, you may be able to negotiate a bigger reception hall for the same price as a smaller one.


Also, off season weddings allow for more flexibility because on the off chance you have a 95% return rate on your wedding invites, you will be able to scramble for a bigger room, cake, or food order more easily and often at less cost than during the summer months.

, Fridays are also popular wedding days but may cost a lot less than a Saturday event. For even greater savings, choose a weekday evening for your wedding. Schedule the wedding to allow guests time to arrive at the ceremony after the work day has ended.


Many guests enjoy weekday weddings as this frees up their weekends for other activities.
Choose a date between November and April (between May and October if you live in the southern hemisphere) to avoid higher peak season rates in many areas.

, Consider having your wedding during the day, such as a weekend brunch or a luncheon on Saturday or Sunday. The cost for the venue will be much lower and the daytime lighting is better for color photography.

, This can save several hundred dollars which your minister may charge. See information on Becoming Ordained to set up your choice of an officiant.

, Cut out the travel (and limo fees) between the chapel and reception hall by having the wedding on the same location as your reception! Also, you may be able to negotiate a cheaper price for using more than one service provided at a particular location. This also makes it easier for out of town guests, since they won't have to drive to two locations. They will appreciate it greatly!


Many churches have halls that are equipped to handle wedding receptions at reasonable fees - especially if you are a member.

, Musicians will charge more if asked to perform beyond the time stated in their contract. You will also incur additional limo charges if your event runs longer than planned. Give yourself a certain amount of extra time, to allow for things to go wrong, and then stick to that schedule.


You might find it useful to assign someone the task of keeping track of the schedule and making sure everything stays on time.

, If you don't know any musicians yourself, call local college music departments rather then browsing the yellow pages. Students will be cheaper than professionals.


Better yet, if you have a close friend that does music stuff well, ask them if they'll offer you a reduced fee as a wedding gift. You should only ask people that you would actually invite to a wedding though.

, When planning your ceremony and reception at a hotel or other venue, ask to speak to a manager who is in charge of these services. A manager should be in a position to offer the best rates for the hotel’s services.


Ask the manager to throw in extras. Use hotel house linens instead of renting others. Hotels and catering halls have their own props and centerpieces that they are happy to loan. Always ask for at least 10% off stated rates.

, Another way to reduce the costs associated with weddings is to not mention that the item or service is for a wedding. For example, if you are renting a venue for the wedding, indicate the room will be used for a ""family gathering.""


This approach can also be helpful for wedding cakes. A regular cake is generally priced much lower than an identical cake which has been identified as a wedding cake.
If you plan to have a simple flower scheme (like gerbera daisies and green poms) you can avoid a large markup and the need for an appointment by not mentioning the wedding.

, Check at the chapel or venue to see if there's another wedding the same day. Sometimes you can split the cost of decorating with the other couple - if you're both willing to choose neutral colors and whoever goes first makes sure no well-intentioned relatives ""clear things up"".

, Instead of flowers and ribbons to decorate the church, try large potted ferns up at the altar with simple candles. They're inexpensive and very elegant. Keep the ferns back from open flames, though! Safety first!

, Doubling up on favors and decorations or decorations and food can save you a ton of money and some set up and cleanup time, making your special day that much less stressful! There are lots of options for doing this. Consider:


Instead of one big wedding cake, put a small cake on each table. The cake is the dessert and the centerpiece! Surround it with fake flowers or candles to complete the look.
If you are doing favors, put the pile of favors neatly stacked in the middle of the table.
Try decorating with a photo of the couple or a photo of a city the couple visited together, and use that as the centerpiece, surrounded by inexpensive votive candles. Or, get multiple mini-frames and photos instead and give those away as favors!

, Ask a friend with pretty penmanship to address your invitations instead of hiring a calligrapher. This can save a ton of money and look just as nice! Again, just make sure that they'll do an okay job and that you'll pay them either a small fee or take the arrangements as a wedding gift. You don't want them to feel taken advantage of!


You can have a friend do your wedding programs too! Some of the most attractive wedding programs are printed from a home computer and then creatively assembled with colored cardboard, tissue paper, ribbon, etc.

, When you are considering the cost of postage check with the Post Office to find out if there is going to be a rate increase. This can blow your budget. In the U.S., buy Forever stamps at the current rate. They will be honored by the post office as a first class stamp no matter how much the postal rate increases. That's why they're called Forever stamps.

, Use an online service for RSVP and simply include the web address on your invitations, saving the need for RSVP cards and extra postage. Consider including a phone number for those who may not have Internet access.

, Buy your centerpiece flowers at a wholesale warehouse. Wholesale warehouses often sell products in bulk and cheaper than normal stores. You can often get 30-40 small centerpieces for less than $100 if you are willing to ask friends and family to help.

, Have bouquets made of dried flowers or nice ""silk"" flowers instead of costly, fresh flowers. Cloth or ribbon flowers are also a lovely and durable option. Having the arrangements made days or weeks in advance can save time, money and stress.

, If you do decide to go with fresh flowers, choose flowers that are in season. Possibly grow them yourself or buy the flowers in bulk at a Farmer's Market and arrange them yourself. Or, some trade schools that train florists will arrange wedding bouquets for the cost of the flowers.

, If you simplify your flowers and arrangements, perhaps a close friend can assemble fresh or silk flowers, which will save you hundreds of dollars. Just make sure that they'll do an okay job and that you'll pay them either a small fee or take the arrangements as a wedding gift. You don't want them to feel taken advantage of!

, This might halve your flower budget. Consider having fewer flowers and less expensive flowers. Buy loose flowers and have the venue personnel or a talented friend place the flowers artfully in tall glass vases. (The arranging may be done for free, but check first!)

, Wedding cup cakes are getting more popular and they are not hard to make it yourself! Even better, you can get all the girlfriends and family members to help out. You can find great recipes over at the famous Cupcake Project website, which was designed to create unique recipes for wedding cupcakes.

, Your baker can frost a few ""pretend"" tiers so your cake looks grand but saves you money. You can also purchase a sheet or round cake at a warehouse club or grocery store and have it done in the same color frosting as your wedding cake. You'll be able to feed more for less.


Also, figure about 20% fewer servings of cake than there are people. Many don't eat cake, so a lot of cake gets thrown away. At a cost of $2.00-$7.00 (average cake costs) per serving, it's heart-breaking to see forty pieces get thrown in the garbage.

, This will save you enough that you could get a fancier recipe or fancier cake decorations if you really want and still spend less. This is because creating a structure to hold up multiply layers is challenging and time consuming for your baker.

, Having candy for guests to eat instead of cake may save you money and provide a unique and memorable experience. Also, if you're going to have a candy ""bar"" or station, don't give away favors. The candy can also be a favor! There's no need to provide your guests with both.

, Look for a dress at a thrift or consignment store or eBay and then have it altered. If you get a talents seamstress (or even better, if you know one!) this can help you get a designer look at a super bargain price! Altering is cheaper than you'd think, and you might even be able to negotiate for a discount if your bridal party also needs tailoring.

, Consider a non-traditional dress that you could wear again after the wedding too. This will make the cost easier to justify. The days of strictly white dresses are gone and colored dresses are coming in to fashion. You can easily get a longer dress altered to cocktail length and then use that for Christmas parties and other formal gathers for years to come.

, If all the groomsmen will be in tuxes and they don't already own one, use a tuxedo or menswear shop that gives you the groom's tux for free when you order others at the same time. This can save lots of money. Rentals can also save, if you don't plan on ever using the tux again.

, The bridal stores charge outrageous prices for veils. Finding a cheap alternative can end up saving you a ton of cash! You can even try making your own veil or getting a crafty friend to do it for you!

, Your bridesmaids are responsible for the cost of their own attire. Try to be understanding about today's economy by choosing dresses from a less expensive source, including dress catalog companies.


First order one dress in an appropriate size for one of your girls and have her try it on. This way you can see up close the fabric quality, color, and style of the dress without buying several and then finding out you hate them. Even though returns are allowed, it's time consuming and you don't have time to waste.

, You can choose different dresses for each girl but give them all one commonality such as color, a scarf, a belt or a shawl. By having the girls all in the same accessory, you weave a common thread that makes things look well put together. This can save money and time on ordering dresses, fittings, etc.

, Make a list of the most important things you want for your wedding and have your fiancé do the same. Are you most committed to having gorgeous flowers, inviting 400 people, hosting the wedding at a particular location, or serving filet mignon and lobster? Knowing your priorities before the planning starts will help you decide what to spend money on, and what you don't mind doing cheaply or doing without.

, This is difficult but sometimes necessary if the cost per guest is going to break your budget. Cross off names on the list of guests who might feel obligated to come to the wedding if they are invited, but would not have their feelings hurt if they are not asked to attend. Think of inviting only relatives with whom you have a close relationship instead of everyone related to you. Invite only the people who are important to you and your parents, rather than everyone you know.

, You have to buy nice gifts for every member of your bridal party, and that adds up. Plus, traditionally, the entire bridal party plus their dates are invited to the rehearsal dinner. Seven bridesmaids and seven groomsmen, all their dates, ring bearer and flower girls, and their families, plus both sets of parents and all the readers in the ceremony, plus officiant could add up to 40+ people to feed!

, Professionally posed and properly lit photographs are one of the few beautiful keepsakes you'll have from your special day, but getting them doesn't have to break the bank. Choose an experienced photographer who will include all of the images on a CD for one low price. Then you can make as many inexpensive copies as you need rather than pay a huge reprint fee to the photographer.


Put together a list of the group shots you want, make a detailed timeline for the day, and give a copy to everyone on the shot list. Be sure to ""pad"" your schedule by 15 minutes so those who run late don't get left out.
Also, consider a private pre-wedding encounter for the bride and groom followed by all of the posed photography. Completing everything before your wedding means you can spend the entire remainder of your day enjoying yourself and the company of your guests. (Guests don't really like to be kept waiting between the wedding and the reception.)

, If you are doing a round of toasts, guests can toast with whatever they are currently drinking instead of you having to purchase champagne for everyone. Instead of a limo, consider a regular vehicle. If you are happy with just serving beer and wine, skip the full bar and save a bundle on liquor. Consider a lovely formal dress that isn't a traditional gown from a bridal shop.

, After looking at the final plan of your wedding, but before paying any deposits, decide where you can simplify the whole process. Consider whether you really need choral singers and a string quartet at the ceremony and a wedding singer and a DJ at the reception. Releasing doves or butterflies or having a candle-lighting ceremony are all wonderful, but may end up costing a lot of money. Simplicity saves money and if done well, your wedding may seem more serene and awe-inspiring.

, Remember that the wedding is one day at the start of a life-long commitment. Look beyond the wedding day to the goals you will have as newlyweds. If you want to purchase a house in the next few years, keeping that as a priority throughout the wedding planning process will help you to be prudent about how much you spend on that one day.

Create a vision.,
Prioritize.,
Know how much to expect to spend on each aspect.,
Set an overall budget.,
Set aside a portion of your budget for each expense.",How to Plan a Wedding on a Budget1," First decide what you want the wedding to look and feel like. You might not be able to have everything you want, but no matter how much you plan to spend you should develop an overall idea of the aesthetic of your wedding.


Where will your wedding and reception be held? Will it be indoor or outside? At a church or another public venue?
Do you want a big event inviting everyone you know, or an intimate service with a limited guest list of close loved ones?
Do you want a spring wedding? Summer? Autumn? Winter?
What's the style? Modern or retro? Traditional or daring? Rustic or urban?
Will there be a theme?;
, It's likely you won't be able to have every idea of your vision, but a few colorful, unique details can make your wedding as memorable as any grandly orchestrated event wedding.


Figure out what aspects of the wedding design you can do yourself. If they aren't too time consuming, you can probably keep those.
Pick a few key details to center your design around and concentrate on making those really shine.

, Wedding planners recommend the following formula to divide your costs and not let any one element get out of control.


48-50% for the reception. It's easy to get caught up on on the ceremony, but the reception is just as important—and expensive!
8-10% for flowers.
8-10% for attire.
8-10% for entertainment and/or music.
10-12% for professional photography and video
2-3% for invites.
2-3% for gifts for your guests.
8% for miscellaneous expenses and possibly a wedding coordinator.
Be sure to budget an extra 5-10% of your money for surprise expenses like printing extra invites because of mistakes, additional tailoring needs, umbrellas for a rainy day, and ribbons for the wedding programs.

, Think about all the things you need, but be honest and conservative about what you can afford. On the one hand this will be a once-in-a-lifetime event, but on the other it's rarely worth going broke to throw a nice party. Set a total dollar cap and try to stick to it.

, Set up a budget spreadsheet and allocate money to each part of the event. Keep track of how much you are spending and enter it into the sheet.


Remember, if you can find savings in one aspect, you can move that money around to give yourself more room to work on other aspects (or just keep it cheap). Make sure your spreadsheet compares your actual spending to expected spending so you know if you are over or under budget.

Begin by cutting down the wedding list.,
Choose an off-season date.,
Prioritize your budget list.,
Design your own invitations.,
Negotiate with your vendors.,
Create your own centerpieces.,
Ask friends and family members to provide services.,
Buy your bridesmaid dresses off-season for deep discounts.,
Provide a buffet.,
Keep the wedding alcohol-free.,
Make your own favors and keep it simple.",How to Cut Wedding Costs," The bigger your guest list, the higher the expenses. Keeping the guest list to 100 people or less will cut down on food, invitation and reception costs.;
, If you can't cut the guest list down, consider having your wedding on a weeknight or a holiday weekend, such as Thanksgiving, when demand is down and venues look to make deals in order to book clients. Speak with prospective reception venues about which dates are usually slow and negotiate on pricing.

, Create a spreadsheet or notebook that lists the highest and lowest prices for all aspects of your wedding. This includes food, flowers, entertainment, rental fees and any other costs. When deciding which areas to cut down on, you can refer to the list and choose whether to forfeit certain things or use the cheapest option.

, New computer software allows brides to create their own wedding invitations for cheap. You can use a database of clip art or upload your own photograph to a computer software program and print invitations at home.

, Wedding vendors want as much business as possible. Even if the vendor doesn't appear open to negotiations, always try to bargain down the price or add extra services or products for little to no extra cost.

, Votive candles and mirror bases are available in bulk from wedding suppliers and can make budget-friendly centerpieces. Silk flowers can also help reduce the centerpiece cost as they are cheaper than real flowers.

, Many people are happy to provide catering, photography, hairstyling or entertainment as part of your wedding gift, and this really helps with having a cheap wedding.

, Bridal stores often provide a clearance rack that consists of bridesmaid and flower girl dresses from the previous season. Rent tuxedos from a store that gives you back your deposit when you return the tuxes by a certain time.

, Family-style buffets are more budget-friendly than sit-down dinners, especially if you can use friends or family to help cater the wedding. If you really want a sit-down dinner, choose pasta, chicken or another less expensive entrée.

, Open bars can run a bride and groom thousands of dollars. By providing free soft drinks, tea, water and coffee, you can save on reception costs. If you really want alcohol, you could consider putting a time limit on an open bar and then switching to a cash bar.

, Invite your bridal party over to help you create simple favors, such as bags of candy or little jars of homemade goodies with a monogrammed ribbon.

"
"
Ask around.,
Call multiple vendors.,
Know when to settle.,
Alter your budget as needed.",How to Plan a Wedding on a Budget2," Talk to other recently married couples you know. They probably looked at a number of vendors in planning their own wedding. Ask your vendors as well—the wedding business is a tight-knit community, so your photographer might be able to recommend a really good chef, or the wedding dress shop might give you a referral for a great florist.

, Shop around! Don't get set on any one vendor until you hear their prices and compare them to a couple others.

, Find a balance between quality and price. Think carefully about how a more expensive detail will fit into the big picture of your wedding. Will anyone really notice real gold ribbons in the decorations? Sometimes it is best to just settle on a cheaper version and move on.

, Your budget is an idea, but it is going to have to change as you start entering real dollar numbers.

"
"
Print your own invitations.,
Use fake flowers over real flowers.,
Create your own decorations.,
Shop at budget stores.,
Downplay the reception.,
Make use of your connections.",How to Plan a Wedding on a Budget3," If you are at all visually artistic or into design, this can be a great way to cut costs and make your wedding feel more personal. Wedding invitation designers can charge a lot for their services compared to just basic printing places that you can bring your own design to.

, This might seem tacky, but real quality flowers can be incredibly expensive. There are plenty of flower alternatives that will look just as good from a far and have their own charm up close. Sometimes you can get these for a fraction of the cost of real flowers—and pass them on to another couple once you've used them.

, Again, this can save a lot of money over professional decorations and add a personal touch and flair to your wedding—and be a fun creative experience.

, High end wedding dress shops can charge tens of thousands of dollars for a dress you plan to use once, but there are budget stores out there that offer similarly styled dresses for a few hundred dollars. The same can be said for menswear.


Unlike wedding dresses, a nice conservative suit for the groom can be worn a number of times and might be a good investment for life.

, Everyone knows you don't have to spend a lot of money to throw a great party. Have everyone bring a dish of food, potluck style. Choose a cheaper time of day to hold the reception to save money on the venue. Providing snacks is less expensive than providing a meal. Having a signature cocktail can require hiring extra drink servers, but pouring champagne is easy.

, Leverage the talents of your friends and family to avoid hiring professionals where you can. Do you have a friend who is into photography as a hobby? A cousin who loves to bake who is up to the challenge of a wedding cake? A designer coworker who can whip out a great invitation for a few beers? Know anyone in a great band? Barter favors instead of cash where you can.

"
"
Secure funds as soon as possible.,
Keep track of how much you spend.,
Expect the unexpected.",How to Plan a Wedding on a Budget4," Being able to pay cash up front will give you access to more budget-friendly vendors who can offer their services cheaper by not having overhead like billing and so on. Cheaper vendors are also booked up sooner, so have money ready to secure their services as soon as possible.

, Every time you agree on or put down money on an expense, put it right in the spreadsheet. Don't eyeball it! If you do, the costs will get away from you.

, From uncooperative weather to invitation misprints, vendor screw-ups to extra guests, there will be costs you didn't think of or couldn't have foreseen. Keep calm and be prepared for these extra expenses.

Is your family or marriage in imminent danger? Are you feeling frustration that might resolve over time, or with some outside help? It can be difficult to analyze and understand our own feelings, but you should try to clarify for yourself why you need to dissolve the adoption so that you can articulate those feelings to others, including the court.;
, Attachment disorders, including reactive attachment disorder, bipolar disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and others are fairly common among adopted children. When faced with the many challenges presented by an attachment disorder, some parents misinterpret the child's behavior as sociopathic, psychopathic, borderline personality disorder, or narcissistic personality disorder.If you haven't already done so, seek treatment for the child and for yourself through. Each state has government-managed post-adoption services, ranging from support groups to crisis intervention social workers. You can find a complete overview of post-adoption services by state, complete with links to the various agencies, at https://www.childwelfare.gov/topics/adoption/adopt-assistance/?CWIGFunctionsaction=adoptionByState:main.getAnswersByQuestion&questionID=7.

, In families who seek dissolution, it is common for one parent to express that he or she has reached a ""breaking point."" In these situations, it is often the case that the other parent is only minimally involved in parenting the adopted child.This kind of dynamic can drive a wedge between spouses, and between the adopted child and the parents. If your situation could benefit from both spouses re-committing to a collaborative effort to raise the child, talk to your spouse about how you can restructure your home life to get both parents more involved. You may wish to consult a marriage and family therapist for some professional insight.

, When an adoptive family finds a new family to adopt the child, it is called a family-to-family adoption.Contact your adoption agency and ask if they handle family-to-family adoptions, or if they can recommend another agency that does. These agencies are also known as ""replacement"" or ""re-homing"" agencies.These professionals can help you locate another family that can provide the level of care that the child needs.


The adopting family will be subjected to a home study and required to demonstrate that they are mentally, physically, and financially capable of caring for the child. The new family may be required to receive training and pass a criminal background check. You may also be able to locate a family to adopt your child on your own using community resources, from word of mouth to online message boards. If you meet a family interested in re-homing the child, contact an adoption agency or a family lawyer to proceed with the re-adoption process. However, do not re-home a child without going through the legal adoption process. Placing a child with strangers who have not been reviewed in a home study is dangerous and may be a crime in your state.
If you cannot locate or work with a re-homing agency, you may need to try to find an adoptive family on your own, or file a petition to terminate your parental rights and return the child to foster care.

, The re-homing agency will need to conduct an assessment of the child's needs before the child is re-homed to another family. With your input, the agency should be able to gatherer clearer information about the child than was available when you completed your adoption. The assessment will include:


Interviews with your family;
Interviews of professionals who have treated the child;
Reviews psychological testing, health, and educational records; and
Reviews of the information you received at the time the child was first placed with your family., In addition to the placement of the child with a new family, you will need to participate in the legal process of giving up your parental rights. The adoption agency or an attorney will assist you. You may be required to make a court appearance, or simply sign paperwork surrendering your rights.

, Once your rights have been legally terminated, notify any agency that needs this information. This includes your health insurance company, the child's school, daycare, any agency from which you receive subsidies, and the previous adoption agency., Re-homing will be a confusing and painful time for the child. You will need to explain the situation in a way that is comforting and sensitive to the child's emotions. When you talk to the child, do not discuss your own feelings or any behavioral or emotional issues the child has exhibited.Instead, let the child know that the re-homing is not his or her fault, and that he or she will be adopted by a new family that will be better able to meet his or her needs. Let the child know that you will miss him or her, and that you want him or her to be happy with the new family.You can find a comprehensive sample to start your discussion here.
If you find it too difficult to talk to the child on your own, ask a trusted professional to explain the situation and your feelings. However, you should be present for the discussion so that you can affirm for the child that what the professional says is true.Do not discuss the possibility of re-homing with the child before the re-homing is certain. It is not fair to cause the child anxiety about going to live with a different family if the transition might not happen. Also, do not mislead the child about the reality of the re-homing by telling the child that it is a temporary arrangement or just a visit to another family., Because the relinquishing family wants what is best for the child, they can sometimes become over-involved with the new family, to the point of disrupting or sabotaging the re-homing process. Once the re-homing process is on track, step back from the situation and let the re-homing agency do its job in preparing the new family for adoption.


Parents who dissolve adoptions commonly report feeling extreme guilt and pain over having to give up their adopted child. Take time to grieve as a family, and seek outside support and help to cope with the transition.

, Depending upon your state, you may be able to petition a court to legally dissolve the parent-child relationship and return the child to state foster care. Courts are extremely reluctant to do so, and will only consider these requests where it would be in the best interests of the child. Additionally, parents who relinquish parental rights may be required to pay child support until someone adopts the child or until the child turns 18, and the parents may also face criminal charges of child abandonment, which prohibit the parents from teaching or caring for children in a professional capacity., Adoption is a very complicated area of family law. An experienced attorney can help you file your petition and assemble evidence showing that dissolution is in the child's best interests. An attorney can also advise you of what rights you are giving up, what consequences you face, and your likelihood of successfully dissolving the adoption.

, Your state may have pre-printed forms used to petition the court for a dissolution of an adoption. Check your court's website or contact the court clerk and ask which forms you will need to file. You will use the forms to explain why it is in the child's best interests to dissolve the adoption. Explain to the court why you cannot provide adequate care for the child, or why the relationships within the family are so bad that it would be best for the child to dissolve the adoption., Take your paperwork to the court clerk. The clerk will help you file your forms, and will give you stamped copies for your records. You may be charged a filing fee. If you cannot afford the fee, ask the clerk for information on how to file an application for a fee waiver.


The clerk will contact you with hearing date.

, You will most likely need to attend a court hearing, where the judge will inquire about the conditions at your home and why you believe the adoption should be dissolved. Bring any evidence and witnesses that can help the judge understand the conditions in your home. Consider presenting reports and testimony from social workers and professionals who have treated the child. If applicable, bring photographs or other documents related to incidents of violence at home. As you present your case, use your evidence to explain to the court that your adopted child needs a level of care that your family cannot provide, and that the child's needs would be better met with another family or in state foster care.

;
, These Safe Haven laws exist to ensure the safety of the newborn baby and make it possible for desperate people to relinquish custody without resorting to extremes. They are not created as ways to get troubled parents in more trouble. If you find yourself in this situation, you should feel safe to reach out to an attorney, a social worker, or even a member of the clergy. In all these cases, you would be protected by a privacy privilege in what you say to them, and they should be able to help you get connected with a Safe Haven location.

, Call your local hospital, police station, fire station, or other location that you believe may be a Safe Haven site. Ask the person who answers if they do accept drop-offs, if they have certain times, and if they have certain requirements. If you are concerned for your anonymity on the phone, you can dial #67 before calling to block your number from appearing., In most states the mother, father, or any adult who has legal custody is allowed to drop off a baby. In four states (Georgia, Maryland, Minnesota and Tennessee), only the mother may drop off the baby. A few states allow any adult to drop off a baby, as long as the mother approves.Eight states (Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Nebraska, New Mexico, South Carolina and Vermont) have no law about the person who may drop off the baby., Beyond that, every state has a variety of safe haven locations. In order to remain anonymous, and to avoid being prosecuted for child abandonment or endangerment, you must find one of these recognized locations.

, In addition to taking the baby to a hospital or emergency room, states allow the following safe haven locations. Be sure to research your state's safe haven law so that you know which will apply to you:


Police and fire stations. Most states have designated police and fire stations as safe haven locations. In states where police and fire stations have been named as safe havens, the baby must be left with an on-duty employee.
Medical centers. In states where medical centers are designated safe havens, the laws are very clear; babies can be left at medical centers during business hours and only with an on duty employee of that medical center.
Churches. In states where churches are considered safe havens, the law generally requires that the baby be left inside and that an adult be present at the church at the time. Some states require the baby be handed to an employee with emergency medical training.
Adoption agencies. A few states approve adoption agencies as safe haven drop offs. In those states that allow a baby to be dropped off at an adoption agency, the baby must be handed to an employee of the adoption agency during normal business hours.
Welfare agencies. A few states allow licensed welfare agencies to act as safe havens. In these states, the baby must be handed to a volunteer or employee of the company during normal business hours.
Other. A handful of states allow a parent to call emergency services and relinquish a baby to an Emergency Medical Technician (“EMT”) or an emergency responder, or leave the baby with an employee at a birthing center, institutional infirmary, or other medical facility., All states will allow the mother or person dropping the baby off to remain anonymous.But some will provide the person dropping the baby off with a questionnaire that can be dropped in any mailbox once completed. The questionnaire contains simple questions about the baby's medical history and any serious medical conditions the mother or father may have.You may also wish to consider preparing a simple document with the baby's date of birth and any serious medical conditions that run on the mother or father's side of the family to leave with the baby to ensure he or she gets proper medical care.

, The safe haven laws do not generally specify any condition for the baby at the time of drop off, except that the baby must not show evidence of abuse or neglect.The list of suggestions below are some things you should do, just as general care, to prepare the baby. In some states, failure to take these basic steps could be considered ""neglect"" and could leave the parent open to criminal charges. Keep in mind ""neglect"" mean grossly inappropriate care, as authorities have no wish to persecute desperate parents trying to do the right thing.


Feed the baby. Ensure that the baby has been well fed and will not need to eat again for at least a couple of hours. A just-born newborn does not have to eat immediately.
Bathe the baby. Wash the baby and his or her hair thoroughly with baby soap and shampoo.
Change the baby's diaper. Also, put rash cream on any rashes in the genital area or the bottom.
Dress the baby appropriately. A good rule to follow is to dress the baby as you would dress. For example, if it cold outside and you are wearing long pants and a sweater, dress the baby in a long pants and a sweater. A just-born baby will likely be fine wrapped in a blanket or towel unless it is extremely cold out.

, Most state laws require that you hand the unwanted baby to a responsible adult employed at the safe haven location you have chosen. To do this:


Choose an adult employee or staff member. This may be a nurse at a hospital, police officer at a police station, pastor at a church, or firefighter at a fire station.Tell the adult you have chosen that the baby is unwanted and you are leaving him or her pursuant to your state’s safe haven laws.
Hand over the baby and any blankets, bottles, or toys you have brought for the baby, as well as any writing you have prepared, such as the baby’s name, date of birth, or medical history, to the chosen adult, and you will be free to go., Adoption is a tough process for a mother as it results in the relinquishment of your child to another family. However, in some situations, completing an adoption can allow for your child to have the best life possible. Whether your pregnancy was unplanned or you do not have the financial means to care for a baby, consider an adoption if safe haven laws do not exist in your state.If you are concerned about the cost of an adoption, most (if not all) of your costs are paid for by the adoptive parents. This includes support costs, medical costs, and legal costs., If you think adoption would be a good option for you, or if you have more questions, contact a professional adoption agency. These professionals will help you understand the process, make plans, and fill out the required paperwork.There are multiple professional agencies in every state. Start by doing an online search for adoption agencies in your state. In addition, you can call your state's department of children's services to get more information.

, With your adoption professional by your side, work together to make an adequate adoption plan. Your professional will explain all of your options to you. For example, you might want to ask about open and closed adoptions. In an open adoption, you will have varying degrees of access to information about your child as he or she grows up. This might include physical contact, pictures, letters, or phone calls. In a closed adoption, you will not have any access to information about your child. These decisions can be made by you alone, but it is best to discuss these options with the adoptive family you choose. Ultimately, for the adoptive family to agree to the adoption, they will have to agree to your adoption plan.


If you are still pregnant, your adoption plan might include labor plans, hospital plans, and ways to get help paying for the pregnancy (if the adoptive parents are not paying). These plans may also help you find food, housing, and maternity clothes while your pregnancy is happening., While many parents do not like to search for adoptive families, doing so can help ensure your baby will have a happy and healthy home. When you are working with an adoption agency, talk with them about what you are looking for in an adoptive family. The adoption agency will then send you information about possible adoptive families. Look through this information to learn about their careers, interests, parenting style, and other important information. A lot of adoption agencies require the adoptive parents to go through home studies and background checks before they will be eligible to adopt.Once you decide on a family, you can choose to meet them in-person or over the phone. This will give you an opportunity to get to know the family better and make sure it is a good fit. Make sure you address any concern you have before moving forward., Once you agree on an adoptive family, that family will file a court action to formalize the adoption. Once the action is brought, you will be asked to sign a consent form, which indicates your willingness to go through with the adoption. Return your consent form to the adoptive parents once it has been filled out.

, In most states, if consent has been given by the biological parents for the adoption, you will either not have to go to any court hearings. If you do, they will be very informal and the judge will simply want to make sure you know what rights you are giving up. Go to your court hearings, if you have any, and be prepared to express your willingness to go through with the adoption.

, Relinquishment papers finalize the adoption and relinquish most, if not all, of your parental rights to the adoptive parents. Adoption agencies often provide services for mothers after relinquishment papers have been signed. Because giving your child up for adoption can be tough, adoption agencies will often offer emotional support and classes to help you cope with your decision.


Some agencies will help you get in contact with other mothers who have gone through adoptions themselves. Use these resources to help you get through the emotions of putting your child up for adoption."

The focus should be on discipline and additional embarrassment for your child should be minimized.


Most experts are adamant that children should never be spanked under any circumstances. Nonetheless, some parents believe that spanking is the best way to get children to adhere to rules. Whatever your position is on spanking, it’s clear that spanking can have some negative consequences. Therefore this method of discipline should be used sparingly and only to prevent your child from engaging in dangerous activities.
Be sure that siblings and other children are not present during the spanking.
If a spanking occurs in a public place you should take your child to a private area away from onlookers.;
, It is important that your child understands why he is being disciplined so that he learns what is acceptable and unacceptable behavior.Try to use all discipline, including spankings, as a teaching opportunity and not just punishment.


Be sure to use clear age appropriate language that your child understands when you explain the consequence.
For example you could say, ""Donnie, you were running through the house with the scissors and almost ran into your brother. I have already given you a warning about this behavior so now it is time for a spanking.""
Whenever possible, give your a child a warning before proceeding to spanking. This will allow him/her the opportunity to adjust his behavior to avoid the spanking.

, This position allows you to spank the child appropriately without causing injury. However, older children may stand up facing forward.


Make sure that your child is fully clothed during spankings. Spankings on bare skin can cause bruising and other avoidable injuries.

, Be sure to use an open hand and use limited force. Pats should never leave any bruising or marks of any kind. The focus should be on teaching your child better behavior, not hurting him/her.


Objects should never be used to spank your child and you should limit spankings to approximately three to four pats on the backside.
Never spank your child when you are angry. Any spankings should be done when you are calm. This will help you avoid unintentional injury.

, When the spanking concludes your child will likely be upset. Allow him/her the opportunity to calm down. Let him/her know that when he is ready that he can resume normal activity.


For example you could say, ""I know that you are upset. When you are ready you can come back downstairs.""

, Make sure that you and your spouse or any co-parents in the home are in agreement with the rules. It is very important everyone is on the same page with discipline so that your children are unable to split or divide parents and caretakers.


You can include your children in making some of the rules. It’s important that children feel like they are a part of family decisions. However, don’t be afraid to be firm about the important issues. For example, if your teenager needs to be home by 11pm don’t allow him/her to argue his way into a 2am curfew.
It is important to communicate your expectations regarding your child’s behavior with relatives, babysitters, and other caregivers outside of the home. If the caregiver is unable or unwilling to adhere to your behavioral expectations with your child, then you should consider putting your child in the care of someone whose parenting beliefs better align with yours.

, After a rule is finalized, it’s very important to be clear about the expectations so that rules are clearly understood.Make sure that the rules are explained when your children are calm and be sure to use language that they can easily understand. Trying to explain your expectations when your child is upset or tired will not really be helpful. You should be calm and well rested when having this discussion as well.


Make sure that the rules are concrete and specific so that there is no room for misinterpretation. For example, it’s better to tell your ten year old, “Be home by 7pm” instead of “Be home before it gets dark.”
Make sure that the rules are explained in advance. Try not to only discuss rules after one is broken. Instead, explain them in advance, even if it means repeating yourself. For instance, you could say, “We walk when we are at the pool” before arriving at the pool.
Try to word rules in an affirmative manner. For instance, you would want to say, “We walk when we are at the pool” rather than “Don’t run while at the pool.”

, Be consistent with the rules so that your children can clearly understand them. If you only enforce rules sporadically then you will confuse your children. This confusion will make it difficult for them to clearly understand your expectations and boundaries.So, if the rule is that your child is home by 7pm then when he calls and asks if he can stay at a friend’s house later, remind him/her that the rule is that he is home by 7pm.


If there was no rule formerly in place about a particular behavior when it occurs, then it’s important to take time to establish the rule and clearly articulate it after the undesirable behavior occurs.

, No, this does not mean to give in to their every whim. Instead, it means to avoid going getting into no-win arguments with your child. If you have made the rules clear and he is still trying to argue his way into submission, it’s okay to stop the conversation. The rule is still valid but you have removed yourself from the argument.For example, if your preteen is screaming, “It’s not fair, Ben gets to stay outside until 10pm” you can just respond by saying, “I know he does.” Or maybe your teenager is still beating the drum about using the car to go out on a school night; you could say “What did I say?” or “I said no” without additional discussion.
This approach should only be used after you’ve already explained the rules to your child and he is still trying to get his way. It minimizes the power struggle and helps to make it clear that the rule stands.

, Decide what behaviors you want to see more of in your child and reward that behavior. Your child is not born knowing what he should or should not do. As his parent, it’s up to you to train him/her and mold his behavior. Therefore, it’s essential for you to identify what behaviors you want your child to develop and reinforce them.Rewarding positive behavior with positive consequences is actually more effective than having to implement negative consequences for misbehavior.


Rewards for positive behavior should be consistent with the actual behavior. Verbal praise usually works well for most positive behavior whereas larger rewards should be reserved for more significant milestones. For example, straight As on a report card may warrant a celebratory dinner out.
You could also use a token system to reinforce positive behavior. A token system is when your child can earn points or small tokens for appropriate behavior throughout the week. At the end of the week, he can trade in the tokens or cash in the points for a larger reward.

, Instead, respond to him/her when he is demonstrating the behavior that you want to see and you will see more of that. When you take away the attention from the negative behavior then he no longer has an audience. Often this process will reduce the undesirable behavior and increase desirable behavior.For example, if you want your child to stop throwing tantrums, do not respond to him/her when he begins to demonstrate tantrums. Instead, wait until he is calm and is engaging in appropriate behavior before you respond to his requests.
Only ignore behavior that poses no harm to your child or other people.

, There will be times when your child acts out. Most acting out behavior is normal and developmentally appropriate. If you can figure out why your child is misbehaving, then you may be able to prevent future misconduct. Keep in mind that there are generally four reasons that a child may misbehave: to feel sense of power, because he feels inadequate, to get attention, or to get revenge.If your child is acting out because he feels powerless, then you may decide to give him/her other age appropriate opportunities to assert power. For example, he could start having more choice about what to wear to school or what to have for breakfast.
If your child is struggling with feelings of adequacy then perhaps you could help him/her identify his strengths and allow him/her to participate in activities that he does well in to build confidence.
Attention seeking behavior can be easily remedied by giving your child plenty of attention and praise when he is engaged in appropriate behavior. If you are giving him/her a lot of attention before he acts out, this will decrease negative attention seeking outbursts.
If your child is seeking revenge, sitting down and having an age appropriate conversation about how to better manage his anger is important. For example, you could say, “I know that you ae upset and I’m sorry that your brother made you mad. However, it is not okay to punch anyone. Instead, use your words and come talk to me or your dad about it.”

, A natural consequence is the natural result of a child’s own behavior. These consequences are purely the result of his actions and are not inflicted upon him/her by the parent.For example, the natural consequence that occurs when your son does not put his dirty uniform into the hamper is that his uniform is dirty on game day. If the natural consequence is appropriate, then allow your child to experience that consequence. Sometimes they are the best teachers.


Natural consequences should ONLY be used if the child is not in danger of being harmed. For example, you would not want to allow your toddler to touch a hot stove. The natural consequence would be that your child is burned and that is never appropriate.
After the natural consequence occurs, be sure to have a conversation with your child about why it happened. For example, you could say ""Jon, you did not put your clothes in the hamper so now your uniform is not clean for today's game.""

, If a natural consequence is not appropriate, then implementing a logical consequence is the next step. A logical consequence occurs as a result of a child’s behavior, however a parent or caregiver imposes it.The most effective logical consequences should be related to the behavior. Also, the consequence should not be overly punitive nor should it be so minor that the child is unaffected.


Here’s a good example of a logical consequence: if you find that you keep telling your son not to lay his bike in the driveway then you could say, “Jon, when your bike is lying in the driveway, it prevents me from being able to pull into the yard after work. Worse, if I do not see it, I may accidentally run over it. The next time that I see your bike lying in the driveway, I will be putting it in the garage and you will not be able to ride on it for 2 days.” This is better than using a consequence that is unrelated to the behavior such as “You cannot watch TV for two days;” overly punitive such as “You can’t go to your friend’s house for a month;” or too minimal such as “You will have to come outside and move it when I beep the horn.”
Always use respect and avoid being judgmental when utilizing consequences. For example, it is better to say, “I know that you are excited about going on the trip with your friend. However, your room must be clean before you go. If the room is not clean then you will not be able to go;” rather than saying “You are so sloppy and I’m not your maid. Clean this room immediately or you’re not going anywhere.”
Allowing your child to help choose the consequence can be helpful. For example, you could say, “You were running in the house and broke the mirror. How are you going to replace it?” Or you could say “Jon, if you are going outside then you have to wear your play shoes. If you want to keep on your school shoes then you have to stay inside. The choice is up to you.”

, Do not allow your child to negotiate out of the consequence. Once the rule is broken then the established consequence should be imposed immediately. If you have given your child a choice about what consequence to utilize, he should stay within the perimeters of the choices. It is very important to follow through on any consequences that you say that you are going to impose.

, If your little one is struggling to maintain self-control, as most toddlers do from time to time, start by giving him/her a warning.Make sure that the warning is clear and spoken in language that he is able to understand. You might want to say, “Jason, if you hit your friend again then you will take a timeout.”

, If the inappropriate behavior continues, then guide your toddler to a timeout area. An ideal timeout area is a quiet place that is free from distractions such as television, toys, and other childrenIt might be helpful to have a predesignated timeout space in your home or other places that you visit frequently. This way you can avoid the added frustration of trying to figure out a good timeout spot.
Be sure that you tell your child why he is being taken to timeout. And be sure to criticize the behavior and not the child. For example, you might say, “It is not okay to hit Sam” rather than saying “You are a bad boy for hitting Sam.”

, Most experts agree that the most appropriate timeframe for time out is one minute per year of age.So, your three year old would be in timeout for three minutes, your four year old would be in timeout for four minutes, etc.


Your child may resist staying in timeout and this is completely developmentally appropriate for a preschooler. If he refuses to stay put, firmly but gently hold him/her down by his shoulders. You may also try placing him/her on your lap and securely holding him/her there while he remains in timeout.
Some parents prefer to take a timeout away from their child instead when the child is resisting. This could simply mean telling your child that you are taking a timeout from him/her and then staying in the same room to monitor him/her but not responding to him/her.

, Reintroduce your child back into a positive activity after the recommended time in timeout is complete. If he is still engaging in agitated or frustrated behavior, it may be helpful to give him additional time to cool down. Let him know that he is free to return to the other activities as soon as he stops crying or whatever behavior he is engaging in.

Lead with a Kin First Philosophy.,
Develop written policies and protocols that reflect equity for children with kin and recognize their unique circumstances.,
Identify and engage kin for kids at every step.,
Create a sense of urgency for making the first placement a kin placement.,
Make licensing kin a priority.,
Support permanent families for children.,
Create a strong community network to support kin families.",How to Create a Kin First Foster Care System," Leadership is a key ingredient to creating a kin first culture. Leaders can promote the belief that children belong with family, ensure that resources, tools and training are aligned with the underlying values of a kin first culture, and hold all levels of the agency accountable for prioritizing placement with and connections to kin. Leaders can:

Identify champions within the agency who have the authority to implement policies and promote practices that are consistent with a kin first philosophy.
Create the staffing structures needed to identify, engage and support kinship families.
Advocate for a continuum of permanency options available to children in kinship care.
Promote strategies that allow kin to support children, parents, and foster parents even if they are not placement options.
Ensure agency staff and providers receive training on the value of kin, their unique needs, and how best to meet these needs.
Develop benchmarks and continuously review data on children involved with the child welfare system who are living with kin, including children living with kin as an alternative to foster care. Analyze multiple data elements, including placement type, race, age, and gender, to understand the characteristics and experiences of children living with kin.;
, Children in kinship foster care deserve the same attention as children placed with non-kin. Agencies that truly value kin will align their policies to ensure that children in kinship foster care have tailored services and supports and equal opportunities for permanency as other children. Whenever possible, policies should reflect the intent to serve families with respect for race, ethnicity, culture, sexual orientation, and gender identity. Well-drafted policies and protocols will streamline the process and make it easier to place children with kin.

Develop or review/adapt current written policies to ensure they reflect a priority for placing children with kin and preserving connections with kin. Ensure policies are designed with the unique needs of kin in mind.
Share draft policies and solicit feedback from multiple stakeholders, including kin and youth, before finalization. Sample policies include: emergency placement, relative notice and engagement, partnerships with American Indian/Alaskan Native tribes, defined roles and expectations for all stakeholders, full disclosure to kin and parents on all permanency options and support, and tailored training, services and supports for kin.

, Kin first states are ones that begin identifying a child’s extended family network from the moment the child comes to the attention of the child welfare system. Agencies should explore a connection with all identifi ed kin and assess for their capacity to protect children and help them thrive, regardless of their race, ethnicity, cultural heritage, sexual orientation or gender identity. Kin can play multiple roles during a child’s involvement with the child welfare system. They can support children and parents with open child protection cases, provide homes for children in foster care, help children stay connected to family while in foster care, including children in group care, and support families once the children return home. Strategies to identify and engage kin include:

Make family search and engagement a priority at multiple stages, not only when children are first removed from parents’ care.
When engaging kin, focus on the role they can play to help children preserve healthy family connections, even when the children are not placed with them.
Use a combination of casework and technology to identify kin.
Identify and engage fathers and paternal relatives.
Use family team meetings to identify, engage, and educate kin.
Engage tribes early in efforts to locate family placements and supports for American Indian and Alaska Native children. Be familiar with the requirements of the Indian Child Welfare Act and how this can shape work with kinship homes.
Document the family connections identified so the results of family search and engagement are retained for all parties working with the family throughout the child’s involvement with the child welfare system.

,  Research shows that kinship foster care is more stable than non-kin care and can help prevent disruptions that are harmful to a child’s well being. Kin first agencies invest necessary resources and align their policies, practices and staff to make the child’s first placement with kin whenever possible. Strategies include:

Create a firewall that requires approval by a supervisor, program manager or director for all non-kin placements.
Provide staff with tools they need to place with kin immediately, such as: well articulated roles and responsibilities across units, streamlined processes for conducting background checks and fingerprinting, clear procedures for conducting initial home checks, and training on the requirements of the Indian Child Welfare Act and how to work effectively with tribal governments.

,  Kin first agencies seek to remove all barriers to licensing kin who can provide a safe and stable placement for the child. When licensing kin, caseworkers should examine the suitability of each caregiver in relation to the individual child, not just whether the caregiver can be licensed according to state or tribal licensing standards. Additionally, kin first agencies work diligently to remove barriers before allowing kin to remain unlicensed so they can have the same access to financial resources and other supports as non-kin. Many kin first agencies believe that unlicensed kinship care denies kin equal treatment. Strategies for prioritizing licensing for kin include:

Adopt the National Model Family Foster Home Licensing Standards or model tribal foster care standards, such as those developed by the National Indian Child Welfare Association for a common sense approach to licensing all foster parents, including kin.
Implement a clear process for requesting and granting waivers and variances for non-safety licensing standards that will not adversely affect the child and are barriers to placement of the child with kin.
Develop written licensing procedures with clear timelines and processes, as well as an appeal process for kin who are denied licensure.
Facilitate the licensing process by providing kin with assistance to complete necessary paperwork, obtain items that are required for licensing, make home modifications, etc.
Provide kin with all necessary information about the licensing process. In jurisdictions that provide the option to care for the child as an alternative to foster care, fully educate kin on the differences between caring for a child as a licensed foster parent versus as an alternative to foster care so they can make an informed decision about which is best for their family.
Implement kinship specific training aimed at educating kin about their unique role and the expectations of the agency. Trainings should be culturally appropriate and trauma informed, recognize the unique family dynamics associated with kin care, and include examples that reflect the life circumstances of the kin participating.

, The ultimate goal for children in foster care is to safely return home in a timely manner. Kin should support the goal of a safe return home, but remain willing to provide a permanent home if that goal cannot be met. Kin can assist families by providing safe, loving environments for the children, being positive role models for the parents, and generally supporting the families through difficult times. It is important to honor families by taking time to understand their dynamics and relationships, and explain the legal process and options. This family-centered problem solving will lead to the best possible decision about the most appropriate permanent families for children.

Offer all options for legal permanence for the child, including reunification with the parents and subsidized adoption, tribal customary adoption, or guardianship by kin.
Provide kin families with quality services and supports after the child has become a permanent part of their family through adoption or guardianship.
Use family-centered team meetings to help families make the best decision about a permanent family for the child, including team decision-making meetings, permanency roundtables, multidisciplinary team meetings, etc.
Afford the same level of effort, supports and services to parents as provided to kin caregivers and non-kin foster parents.

, Community based organizations and other public systems can often be a child welfare agency’s best allies in achieving positive outcomes for children in kinship care. Community partnerships can ensure that kin have access to the tailored services and supports they need for the child.

Engage other public systems, such as schools, early care and education, economic security, and aging services to support children, parents and kin.
Involve legal stakeholders, including the judiciary, attorneys, and Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA), tribal courts, in supporting the agency’s priority for kinship placement and connections.
Provide opportunities for kinship families to network with each other through mentoring, support groups and leadership development opportunities.
Develop strong relationships and referral processes with community-based organizations, including tribal child welfare programs, that can provide tailored, culturally appropriate and relevant services to children, parents and kin.
Partner with private providers to meet the therapeutic and other needs of children, parents and kin.
Partner with kinship foster parents, youth, and other community stakeholders on the development of child welfare policies and protocols.

"
Avoid distractions.,
Simplify your rules.,
Ask your child to repeat what you have said.,
Write rules down.,
Have family meetings.,
Follow through.,
Use positive reinforcement.,
Be consistent.,
Give verbal reminders.,
Practice.,
Follow your own rules.,
Add some fun.,
Write a song.,
Make your rules into art.",How to Help Your Children Remember Your Rules," When explaining your rules to your child for the first or fifth time, make sure to set them up for successful retention. Talk to them in a quiet space when you have plenty of time and everyone is calm. Creating this space will help your child give full attention to what you are saying., Keep the rules short and simple. The more fully your child understands the rules, the more likely they are to remember them.For example, instead of saying ""You can only have friends over if I know their parents and if you've done your homework and I'm here when they come over,"" you could just say, ""You need to ask me before inviting friends over.""
Similarly, younger children might understand ""No screen time after dinner"" more clearly than ""limited screen time within 2 hours of bed.""

, Putting things into their own words will help children cement their understanding of the rule and remember it more easily. This also helps you to check whether the child has fully understood what you are saying. , Make a list of rules and hang them where the whole family can see them. This will make it very easy for everyone to remember and will prevent arguments about what the rules were.When setting limits on screen time, sit down with your kids and work out a schedule so that they can each have an hour to use the computer, for example. Have them write up the schedule and post it on the computer as a reminder and a way to prevent arguments about who gets to use the computer and when.
For younger kids, post steps to getting ready for bed in the bathroom, for example. Include things like brushing teeth, combing hair, and wiping down the counters. Add stickers for a little fun.

, Especially as your child gets older they will want to be treated more as an adult. If your older child needs to be reminded of their chores, for example, have a meeting during which you talk about every family member’s responsibilities for the week. This will keep your child from feeling singled out. Instead, they will feel like a part of the process.Think about having snacks during the meeting. Adding a special treat like popcorn or sodas can make the meeting more social and fun.

, When your child breaks a rule, stay calm and, as soon as you can, enforce the consequences that you have agreed upon. The child will understand that breaking rules will always have negative consequences and will be less likely to break rules in the future.If your older child breaks curfew, for example, revoke driving privileges immediately rather than forbidding them from going to prom in three weeks.
If a small child hits their sibling, for example, give them an immediate time out rather than forbidding dessert later in the day. Reacting immediately will more firmly remind children of all ages what your rules are and what the consequences of breaking them will be.

, Keep your eye out for times your child is following your rules and behaving nicely. Praise the child when they do something right. Giving positive feedback will motivate the child to repeat good behaviors., Reliably enforcing consequences for bad behavior and praise for good behavior will, over time, encourage better behavior in your child., As you enforce consequences for undesired behavior, remind them why you are doing so. For example, if your toddler has thrown blocks, say to them “I’m taking these blocks away because we made a rule against throwing them.” This will help the child understand why they are facing these consequences and help more firmly plant the rule in their memory., Rehearse with your child the behavior you would like to see. For example, if they run next to a pool. Have them return to their starting point and practice walking slowly next to the pool., For example, if you’ve set a rule that your child clears their dishes after they eat, be sure you clear your own dishes. Watching you will remind the child how you want things done. Showing that the same rules apply to everyone will also lessen arguments with older kids about the fairness of rules.

, Children are more likely to remember and participate in activities they enjoy. For example, when cleaning up the toys, play music and dance as you clean. , If there are multiple steps to a chore your child needs to do, sing those steps to a familiar tune. This makes the chore more fun and the steps easier to remember. , Rather than simply hanging a list of rules to be remembered, paint them, draw them, turn them into wall-art. Have your kids help. This will give a more creative spin on the rules, give them visual interest to help them be remembered, and also enhance feelings of cooperation. "

Encourage adequate exercise.,
Promote a healthy diet.,
Develop relaxation practices.,
Eliminate distractions.",How to Help Fidgety Kids Sit Still1," One factor that may make children more fidgety is a lack of exercise.Children should get at least 60 minutes or more of physical activity a day. Any physical activity that accelerates your child’s heart rate will help them burn off excess energy, allowing them to focus.Consider having kids play games and sports that encourage a lot of physical activity, like tag or soccer. You might also encourage them to jump rope, practice animal walks, do some wall pushups, or simply run around in the park.;
, In some children, fidgeting and an inability to concentrate may be the result of a poor diet. Sugary foods, such as soft drinks and sweets, cause a spike in activity followed by a quick crash in energy. In order to help children stay focused, try to promote a diet that is high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean meats. This will ensure that your children are eating foods that will supply them with a steady source of energy throughout the day.You should also try to encourage your children to eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner at the same time each day and discourage them from frequently snacking between meals., Anxiety is another factor that can cause children to be fidgety. To help your children feel less anxious, teach them mindfulness practices, such as meditation and controlled breathing. This will help them manage their anxiety and concentrate on their tasks.Mindfulness practices are a great way to teach a kid to handle distractions and hone their concentration.
If your child is particularly anxious, you should talk with them about their anxiety. You may also want to consult a mental health professional if the anxiety appears severe.

, Fidgetiness can be the result of external distractions. For example, music, a playing television, or noises from outside may distract your child from their task. If you want your child to concentrate and not fidget, be sure to remove anything that may distract them. Turn off any loud appliances and try to create an environment that is peaceful and relatively quiet.


If outside noises are a distraction, you might consider using a white noise machine or playing ambient music.
For fidgety children who do not have ADHD, fidget toys and other activities designed to help children with ADHD can be distracting.

"
"
Recognize that some fidgeting is normal.,
Look for signs of ADHD.,
Talk to a mental health professional.",How to Help Fidgety Kids Sit Still2," All children exhibit some fidgety behavior, which helps them concentrate and perform complicated tasks. However, fidgeting can become problematic when it is disruptive and distracts others. If your child exhibits some fidgeting behavior but is not disruptive, it is best if you try not to curtail it.Forcing a child to not fidget will cause them to spend all of their mental energy trying to sit still and distract them from whatever task they are working on.

, Fidgetiness can be a hyperactive or impulsive symptom of ADHD. However, on its own, it is not an indication of the disorder. ADHD manifests as multiple reoccurring conditions. These symptoms tend to fall into two categories, inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity, and include things like extreme restlessness, an inability to listen, forgetfulness, excessive talking, or talking out of order.In order for your child to be diagnosed with ADHD, they will need to exhibit at least six symptoms of the disorder in more than one setting, for at least six months.

, If you believe that your child has ADHD, you should visit a mental health professional and have them assessed. It is important that a professional evaluate your child in order to receive a correct diagnosis and course of treatment. A mental health professional will likely give you some strategies for handling your child’s ADHD that may include things like medication or increased activity.In some instances, children with ADHD also have other disorders like depression and bipolar disorder, as well as behavioral issues like conduct disorder and oppositional defiance disorder. In order to help your child, it is important that a mental health professional diagnoses all of the disorders that they may suffer from.

Allow them to fidget.,
Give them “fidget toys.” One way of proactively addressing fidgeting is by giving students “fidget toys” that allow them to fidget while they work.,
Use different types of seating.",How to Help Fidgety Kids Sit Still3," Fidgeting helps kids with ADHD concentrate and focus on tasks. If you discourage fidgeting, a child will spend all of their mental energy trying to stay still, which distracts them from their other tasks. As long as the fidgeting is not a distraction to others, you should allow fidgety behavior.For example, you might allow a child with ADHD to swivel in their chair, twirl their hair, or tap their pencil.This can be applied in the classroom and at home. Regardless of the setting, allowing a child with ADHD to fidget will help them focus.

, These toys are typically soft balls, like a stress ball, or objects that students can squeeze as they concentrate on a task. This ensures that the kids are not distracted by their own restlessness.Coloring books are another way for kids to be physically active while concentrating on a task.

, Various desks and chairs may help students work out their fidgetiness while boosting their concentration. Standing desks allow students to move their legs while they work. Stability balls provide a similar amount of physical stimulation for kids with ADHD. A Hooki Stool is another seating device that allows students to fidget while not distracting those around them.If it is not too much of a distraction, you might consider allowing students with ADHD more time to walk around while they work on a task.

Be united in your approach to discipline.,
Establish some ""house rules"" for the children.,
Focus on positivity where and when you can.",How to Handle Discipline Like Supernanny1," Discuss your disciplining actions with your significant other and all of the people who take care of your kids in your home. Supernanny Jo Frost always tries to ensure both the mother and father are on board with the same teaching method and approach, for consistency's sake. Everyone in the home needs to stick to the same rules and consequences.;
, What exactly these say will depend on your home and family's needs. Make sure these rules are clear cut and and set in stone. Display these rules prominently so your children can see them clearly. If your children can't read yet, explain to them what you mean by each rule. For safety-related rules in particular, illustrate what you mean.


Be realistic. Focus more on safety and danger-related rules than on trivial or minor ones.

, Don't go looking for trouble; keep your focus on your daily routine, but if you spot trouble, tackle it accordingly. Go about your day as normal. Give praise where praise is due, and follow your normal plan until the child shows signs of acting up.

"
"
Establish a spot in the house that can be used consistently.,
Give your child a warning when they misbehave.,
Take the child over to the naughty area if they continue to act up.,
Walk away and set a time for the child.,
Make sure that the child sits on this spot.,
Resolve the naughty time-out when the child has sat on the naughty spot for the full duration of their allotted time.,
Continue with the daily activities.",How to Handle Discipline Like Supernanny2," Where you decide to place it will depend on your child's actions and home set-up, but it needs to be available on a constant basis; don't pick somewhere where the child will be distracted or get in the way. If you have more than one child who consistently acts up (such as in the manner of twins or two siblings close in age), make sure that you have one seat/spot for each child.


In the show, at first many kids were easy enough that they used loose boundaries, like a rug, for their naughty spot. However, some kids were more problematic and needed clearer and more isolated naughty areas. Meanwhile, others need a ""cool off"" or reflection room where they could think about or even write down a resolution to their situation.
Make sure the spot isn't too comfy. Although padded chairs generally aren't allowed, there were spots in some Supernanny episodes early on in the series where small rugs were used, and others were chair cushions were used, but where child-sized chairs weren't allowed. Most often times the easiest spots to use consisted of nothing more than the floor in a corner away from most of the action in the room.
Don't blame outside factors for their bad behavior. In one of the first season's episodes, the child acted up, complaining of ""foot cramps"", but it turned out they just wanted mom's attention. Even if your child is craving attention, they need to learn to get it through positive means, not bad behavior.
Whatever kind of naughty spot you use, make this area known to every child.

, Stoop down and make complete eye contact with them. Explain the situation and what you will have to do if they act up again. Give them their one and only warning. Something along the lines of ""(name of child), please stop (this action) right now or I'll have to put you in the naughty area!"" will work.


Use an authoritative voice when you speak to them. Make sure that they realize that you are in control of them, and not the reverse. They will see that you mean business!
Don't pussyfoot around the problem. Get the job done and tell them straight up.

, Explain to them why you have put them there and how long they must sit there for the naughty time-out to be finished. Often, what will work here is ""I have placed you here on the naughty spot because you did (this action). Stay here.""

, Supernanny's method was to allot one minute for each year of age of the child. You can use an oven clock, a microwave clock, a hand-held timer, or your cellphone timer.

, If they get off this spot, return the child to the naughty area without talking to them. Restart the timer from the time you sit them back down. If the child gets back up, after placing them back down, you must bring them back and place them back to the area on the third time - follow through each time and reset the timer. Make sure they have served one full cycle of naughty-area time on the naughty area, without interruption.


Never place the child in their bed or crib as a Naughty Area place. The child will associate bed with punishment, which isn't a good connection to make.
Don't ever place the child in places where there is a safety hazard close by. Keep them away from the oven and similarly dangerous areas.
If there are items on a shelf nearby the area, watch for a temper tantrum from the child. If they reach for or throw the items, you may need to relocate this spot to another area.

, Go over to the child and explain for the last time why they were put there. Ask them tell you that they are sorry. Use something along the lines of ""(Mommy/daddy/grandma) has placed you in the Naughty area because you (action child took to deserve the spot). Please tell me that you are sorry."" Most, by that point, will oblige and learn from the experience.


If you have a child who hasn't stopped misbehaving after the time is complete, be consistent with the method and keep using it until they do. This is done to ensure the child realizes that their parents do still love them, but they need to behave none-the-less. Consistency is key.
If they do not say sorry, they will need more time in the naughty area. Add one more round of naughty area time. Repeat this as long as necessary until the child can admit to their wrong-doing. However, over repetitive naughty area times can really be emotionally scarring, so don't abuse your power as the parent. They should get the point after a few times.
Remember eye contact. If the child looks away or replies rudely, this could lead to more trouble down the line. Repeat the naughty area time until they are sincerely apologetic.

, Let them know you love them, and let them go back to what they were doing with, hopefully, a clearer and calmer head. If they misbehave again, repeat the routine, but if not, provide praise for handling themselves better.

Set up a room that has a space where the teen can go when they need discipline.,
Give them their warning.,
Take the child over to the reflection room, if their discipline problem continues.,
Set the timer for 1 minute for every year of age the child is.,
Talk about the situation after their time to reflect has completed.,
Have the child discuss what they've written down on the sheet of paper.",How to Handle Discipline Like Supernanny3," This can be a bedroom, a living room away from the family room, or somewhere where the child can cool off and gather their thoughts.


Decide with your partner if you'd like to use the room as a ""discussion room"" for the child, too. This is up to you, but be consistent; the same room can serve as a place for your child to calm down and for you all to talk about the issue afterwards.
In the example of the Cooke family from a 2005 episode, the area they set up was a rarely-used dining area where the child could sit on the chairs. However, the Duan-Ahn family used a living area with a chair that wasn't looking towards the entertainment.
Choose an area where there is little to no breakable furniture or where the furniture or things in it can be repaired without a loss.

, Older children will still need a warning about the potential consequences of their behavior. You may need to bend over to get down to their level and look them in the eye; make sure they know you mean business. It's easy to loose sight of the child when they've acquired more privileges, but they need to know that bad behavior is unacceptable.

, The reflection room is used as a space for the child to chill out and calm down so they can think about what happened.


On one episode, Supernanny had the child write their own reasons for being in the room. If this might help your child, give them paper and a notebook to share their thoughts, feelings, frustrations, and possible solutions. On others, the child was asked to sit on a chair away from the rest of the action in the house.
If you want the child to write, consider asking them why they were placed in the room, as well as which rules they broke and how they can avoid having to be placed back in that room again in future.

, This sets the general amount of time you'd want them to stay and ""cool down"" when they show problematic behavior. However, if you're having them write about their frustrations and rule-breaking, too, you may need to provide or require more time.

, Go over to the child, and ask them why they feel they've been put in the reflection room. Try (as a team) to develop a strategy/plan for avoiding the use of it the next time the act up happens.


When you're done making a plan, let them be proactive about behaving better; give them a hug and kiss and send them on their merry way.

, In the Duan-Ahn family episode, the father discussed it with the child on a nearby sofa (Supernanny called it the ""Talking Couch"", but you can call it whatever you want as long as you stay consistent on the name).

Take notes on all the details that your child’s previous caregivers tell you about his or her birth and early life.,
Select a scrapbook or blank book to use for this purpose.,
Put the book together as soon as possible after your child arrives, while the details of your adoption journey are fresh in your mind.,
Write out your child’s story, told from her perspective.,
You may want to make a color copy of the book so that your child can carry it around and read it, and not have to worry about wear and tear on the original.

,
Read the book to your child regularly.,
Allow your child to show their book with others, but don’t force it.",How to Create a Scrapbook for an Adopted Child," Especially in the case of international adoption, the process can sometimes take a long time, even when adopting an infant. The Lifebook can include that part of your child’s story—how you were waiting and longing to bring her home.;
, You may want to use stickers, stamps or other scrapbooking tools, or just keep it simple with words and photos.

, Include information about where your child lived prior to living with you. Difficult issues such as neglect and abuse should not be included, but can be shared with children when they are developmentally ready to hear them and, preferably, with the help of a trusted therapist or counselor.

, Grant’s daughter was born in Guatemala, the story in her Lifebook begins: “My name is Mia. I was born in the Central American country of Guatemala. Guatemala is the country just south of Mexico. Guatemala is a beautiful country.” It includes some history of her home country, along with photos and postcards.


The Lifebook story should emphasize the idea that your adopted child was planned for and wanted, and loved by both her birth mother and her adoptive parents. Part of what Grant wrote for her daughter included this: “At the same time that I was being born in Guatemala, God was figuring out a way to let my mommy and daddy in America know that I would be coming along soon. When they found out that I was going to be a part of the family, they were so happy.”

,, Grant adopted her daughter as a toddler, and she read the book to her at least once a week until she could read it herself.

, Often, this is the way an adopted child can share a bit of his or her story with people they trust.

Identify websites that connect parents.,
Confirm that you want an “open” adoption.,
Create a profile.,
Receive responses.",How to Connect with an Expectant Parent As Adoptive Parents1," Some websites allow expectant birth parents to flip through profiles of parents looking to adopt. These websites are a great way to connect expectant parents with adoptive parents. You can find these websites by searching online.


One website is America Adopts, which allows you to create an online profile.You should check how much it costs to host a profile on these websites. Generally, these services are not provided for free.;
, By connecting with an expectant parent before adoption, you are agreeing to an “open” adoption, at least in some form. In an open adoption, adoptive parents share identifying information with the birth parents. For example, you share both first and last names, as well as other information, such as Social Security Numbers or phone numbers.


An open adoption gives an expectant mother much more say in who adopts her child. It also allows birth parents and adoptive parents to stay in contact after the adoption.
There are varying degrees of “openness.” For example, you could swap only first names and location, but communicate mostly through a third-party intermediary.In fully open adoptions, however, the birth parents may even visit the child.
In a closed adoption, you don’t share any identifying information. You should spend some time deciding whether an open adoption is right for you before creating a profile.

, If you don’t know where to start, then you might want to browse the profiles of other adoptive parents. Generally, you will want your profile to contain the following:Information about you, your partner, and your family. Let expectant parents know what kind of family their child will be adopted into.
Details. Don’t simply say, “We love to travel.” Instead, write where you have travelled recently.
The level of contact you want to have. This is incredibly important for open adoptions. The expectant parents need to know how much contact to expect, otherwise the adoption could be very stressful.
Photos. Photographs help put a face to the information you have provided and are a great way to catch the attention of expectant parents.
Honesty. Don’t try to come across as too perfect. Expectant parents don’t expect you to be.

, Expectant parents searching your profile may send you an email to contact you. You should respond back promptly and answer any questions the expectant parents may have.

"
"
Find adoption agencies.,
Research the agency.,
Create a profile.,
Write a letter to the expectant mother.",How to Connect with an Expectant Parent As Adoptive Parents2," You can also connect with expectant parents by using an adoption agency. You can search for an open adoption agency by looking online. You can also find a listing at the America Adopts website, which contains links to many individual agencies.You can also adopt using a closed adoption. However, you won’t be “connecting” with the expectant parents.

, Although you may be anxious to connect with expectant parents, you need to give any prospective adoption agency a thorough look-over. Make sure to contact the agency and request information on the following:fees
average waiting time
number of current clients
services offered
geographic reach
education and counseling services available
percentage of successful adoptions

, Many agencies have online profiles which expectant parents can search. You should work with the agency staff to create your profile, including pictures of you, your partner, and your children.

, You also might write a letter to the expectant parents. Often, the letter is addressed solely to the expectant mother, since the father might not be involved. A good letter can be hard to write, but remember the following:Keep the letter brief. The shorter, the better. Also avoid large paragraph blocks, which can be hard to read. Instead, break up the paragraphs into easily digestible chunks.
Explain why you want to adopt. For example, you and your spouse may be infertile. You can state that fact, but don’t provide too much detail about how long you’ve struggled to get pregnant.
Remember to explain how open you want the adoption to be. An expectant parent is looking to see how they will be included in the child’s life after placement. It’s okay to be general: “We want to maintain open communication with the birth mother” is better than saying nothing.
Identify what makes you unique. You have to stand out. Expectant parents are reading many different letters. Being unique doesn’t mean being “perfect.” Instead, be yourself.

"
"
Advertise.,
Find adoption facilitators.,
Join adoption pages on Facebook.,
Hire an adoption lawyer.,
Tell everyone you know.",How to Connect with an Expectant Parent As Adoptive Parents3," You can’t buy children in the United States. However, you can generally advertise that you want to adopt. You can advertise in Craigslist or in the newspaper.Adoption advertising is regulated by the state, and each state has different laws. In some states, adoption advertising is outright prohibited.
You can find summaries of each state’s laws at the My Adoption Advisor website., Unlike adoption agencies, adoption facilitators are not licensed or regulated by the government. They are typically small organizations without a background in counseling. After they connect expectant parents with adoptive parents, the facilitator refers the families to an adoption agency to go forward with the adoption.Adoption facilitators have some advantages over adoption agencies. For example, wait times may be lower because they are skilled at finding pregnant women looking to give up a baby.

, Facebook may have pages related to adoption. You can join and then participate in the discussion, letting people know that you want to adopt. If no page exists in your area, then you can create one., In some states, you can have an “independent adoption” using an attorney and no adoption agency. An adoption lawyer can use their networking skills to find or advertise for a birth mother.You can find an adoption lawyer by contacting your local or state bar association and asking for a referral.

, Word of mouth is another good way to find expectant parents. Tell your family and friends that you want to adopt.They might know someone who is pregnant and looking to give the baby up for adoption.

"
"
Talk to your adoption worker.,
Plan for the meeting.,
Choose a comfortable location to meet.,
Keep your perspective.,
Dress appropriately.,
Be yourself.,
Analyze the expectant parents.,
Keep the conversation light but substantial.,
End the meeting appropriately.",How to Connect with an Expectant Parent As Adoptive Parents4," Before meeting with expectant parents, you should run it by your adoption worker or adoption attorney. Ask if anything sounds fishy. Sometimes, people meet with you only to try and scam you out of money.Your adoption worker or attorney can attend if things sound sketchy. Their presence will make the meeting less casual, but you might feel more secure knowing they are with you.

, There are definitely some questions you can expect to be asked when you meet. You should plan how you want to answer. Don’t memorize canned responses, but give some thought to the following:


Describe your family?
Does the rest of your family support the adoption?
What do you think about parenting and adoption?
How will you tell the child he or she is adopted?
What kind of open adoption do you want?

, The expectant parents might decide where you will meet. However, if you have a say in the matter, pick a place that is relaxing and comfortable.Avoid any place too noisy, such as bars or restaurants during lunch hour.


A coffee shop, restaurant (on off hours), or a park make excellent choices.

, You will probably be excited and nervous to meet with expectant birth parents. After all, you may have been waiting a long time for a match. You may be worried that an expectant mother might not like you and, therefore, won’t choose you to adopt her child. In order to avoid feeling overwhelmed, you need to put the meeting in perspective.Remember that you have already caught the expectant parents’ interest, otherwise they wouldn’t schedule the meeting.
Also remember that the expectant parents know quite a bit about you. They have probably looked at your profile or read your letter.

, Dressing appropriately generally means dressing how you would normally dress to meet friends. If you are meeting during your lunch hour, then you should wear your work clothes.


Nevertheless, you shouldn’t look sloppy. Make sure clothes are clean and wrinkle free.
If you think the expectant parent might be offended by an article of clothing, then pick something else.

, The most important thing is to be natural. Expectant parents are looking to meet you, not someone else. Commit to answering their questions honestly and being yourself., Remember that adoptions—in particular open adoptions—involve give and take. You need to make sure that you like the expectant parents as much as they like you. After all, this is someone who could be visiting your home or calling you after the adoption takes place.


Can you see the expectant parents as part of your family? If not, then this might not be the right family for you.

, This isn’t a job interview where you ask hard questions. It’s also not an opportunity to talk about how anxious you are to adopt. Instead, stay upbeat.Remember to ask questions but do so in a non-threatening way.


For example, don’t ask invasive questions. If the father isn’t present, don’t ask what he thinks about the adoption. That could be a sensitive subject.
Also don’t ask the expectant mother if she has done drugs or how many times she has become pregnant.Do ask how the expectant mother is feeling. However, make the focus more about the pregnant woman than about the baby.
If you reach an awkward moment where no one knows what to say, then make sure you have a photo album with you. You can flip through it and talk about your family.

, Once the meeting has come to an end, you should ask the expectant mother if there is anything else she would like to discuss.Some people are shy and need to be prompted. However, you want the expectant mother to have all of the information that she needs.

Decide with your partner on the why, when, how, and what of the grounding before you tell your child they are grounded.,
Decide if a grounding is an appropriate punishment, The punishment should always reflect the misdemeanour.,
Set out what you consider a grounding to entail.,
Remember why you are grounding your child - to discipline him/her and to teach them a better behaviour.,
Remove any opportunities for deceit and dishonesty.,
Allow your child to earn time off by good behaviour or by completing set tasks.,
Keep calm and positive.,
Set out a clear time frame.,
A day should be the absolute maximum length of time for a grounding for a child between the ages of six to ten.,
Do not discourage positive behaviours or hobbies.,
Consider time off or reducing the length of the grounding for good behaviour Allow older children and teenagers the chance to alleviate the severity of the punishment by completing set tasks, such as housework or volunteer work.,
Make sure that you and your partner can supervise the grounding for the duration.,
Perhaps you are home while their favorite TV series airs.,
You could expect certain chores to be done between their arrival home from school and your arrival home from work, the workload calculated make sure they will have to be home at a certain time in order to get everything done on time.,
Don't give a child the opportunity to deceive you.,
Ask your child for and listen to an explanation of why she/he did that which merited a grounding.,
Choose a time when you are both calm and have some time to spare.,
Ask their opinion on how they can avoid a recurrence of the event.",How to Ground Your Child," Do so at a time when you are calm and thinking clearly.;
, Therefore, grounding from social activities is appropriate if your child has broken their curfew, behaved badly when out with friends etc.

, Are you removing privileges, adding extra chores, giving an earlier curfew or only allowing your child out of the house or yard for supervised outing or not at all? Decide what you consider appropriate and practical and define the boundaries clearly for your child.

, Give your child the opportunity to do as you wish by explaining what you expect and only giving terms that they can manage.

, If you can't be sure that set tasks are carried out or a removed privilege is not availed of behind your back change the punishment for something that you can implement. You could keep a mobile phone in your handbag or in a press at work, for example, or expect the dinner prepared for when you get home. The transparency achieved will keep relations between you and your child open and calm and prevent the punishment from being undermined.

, Make the action and the positive consequence very clear from the start. Ultimately, helping people less fortunate or washing a floor will teach your child good behaviours; sulking in their room will only breed resentment.

, Giving the punishment whilst you are sulking or out of control with anger is counter-productive. If you are calm and level-headed whilst implementing the grounding your child will see that their behaviour was not infuriating, it was incorrect. They will understand that you're not totally unreasonable and taking your anger out on them but that you have reasonable expectations and limits and ultimately you want them to learn to correct the behaviour.

, An unclear timeframe makes it seem like you are relenting or giving up when you lift the grounding.

, Three weekends or one week is the very maximum for a tween or teenager.

, Do not prevent your child from attending any school activities, including the extra-curricular, unless this is the direct cause of the problem. Removing them from a serious sports teams (losing a place on a squad could be a real possibility and is unlikely to be your ultimate aim), extra-curricular classes or religious activities should be avoided if possible.

, These tasks should be clearly defined as efforts to reduce the length of the grounding beforehand and you should explain how you want the task done, what standard you expect and exactly what the exchange will be. Give them a little leeway if you feel they have given it their best shot.

, Adjust the punishments to suit what you know you can enforce.

, This should be the TV time you ban, not 'all TV', something you can never hope to enforce if the child is unsupervised.

, If you choose to implement this, make a list of the jobs and talk through them with your child. Prepare your child to succeed, not to fail.

, It will only breed bad feeling and undermine the punishment. A privilege which has been banned but which they can access will often pose too great a temptation if they know they won't be caught. It's asking for arguments and upset.

, In this way you will understand what caused the undesirable behaviour and how to prevent its re-occurrence. Guide them towards seeing the fault in their reasoning, if any, and discuss it together. Explain how the behaviour made you feel and why the behaviour is not acceptable.

, If voices begin to rise, check yourself before reminding your child to use a conversational tone, reminding them that you are listening and you hear what they are saying.

, Suggest a middle ground that accommodates both of you, if appropriate.

Start small.,
Calmly ask the child why they did what they did.,
Talk to the child about the consequences of their actions.,
Consider whether the child needs to be punished at all.,
Look at non-physical consequences, if needed.,
Make sure you are set on this plan.,
Decide on the place where the spanking will be administered.,
Once you have reached your destination and have come to a clear understanding, announce that the consequence of the child's actions will be a spanking.,
Tell the child that they should remain in position.,
Spank with an open hand, never a tool.,
Remove all rings from your fingers.,
Bend your child over your knee.,
Relax your hand and all your limbs, with one firm hand on their back and one on their bottom.,
Don't hit too hard.,
Afterwards affirm your child.,
Try to make the spanking a positive learning experience.,
Provide unconditional love.",How to Give a Spanking," Don't immediately spank your child if you see them doing something you dislike. Talk to them first, and try a nonviolent method of discipline if needed. If you decide to spank a child, it should only be as a last resort, after other methods have failed.

Conditional spanking (a mild spanking after a 2-to-6-year-old child has defied a less extreme form of discipline) is less risky than spanking as a first resort, according to some studies.;
, The child may not have realized that what they did was wrong, or maybe you misunderstood what happened. Talking can help clarify the situation: either helping the child realize why their decision was a bad one, or helping you realize that your child didn't misbehave after all.

If you're too upset to be calm, say ""I'm so upset, I need a break to calm down."" Walk out of the room and take some deep breaths. Then come back.

, Older children are able to self-reflect and realize why something is wrong. Ask them how they think other people feel about what they did, or what their actions caused. You can use nonviolent communication and ""I"" phrasing for scripts like ""When you ____, I feel ____."" For example:


""How do you think your sister will feel about you breaking her toy?""
""When I didn't see you in the store, I felt really scared. I need you to stay close by so I know you're safe and not lost.""
""How do you think Dad felt when he had to clean poop out of the bathtub?""

, Not every learning opportunity needs to involve punishment., Firmly and patiently tell them what needs to happen. Spanking should never be a first resort, and there are other ways to handle misbehavior.Firmly say no. Give a short, clear response to them in a stern voice. For example, ""we do not throw snowballs at people's faces.""

Clap-growl. For a young child, clap your hands loudly enough to startle them. Then give a firm ""no"" or a stern reminder like ""We are gentle with other people.""

Logical consequences. Tell the child to clean up a mess they made, fix something they broke, or pay for a broken thing they can't fix. This teaches them to fix their own mistakes. (If they are too young to clean or pay for it, you can do it together with them.)

Give a choice. Let the child choose between two or three options that you are okay with. For example, if your child is resisting getting dressed, say ""You can put on your shirt first or your pants first.""

Making up. Have the child make amends if they wronged someone. For example, if your son said something mean to his sister, ask him how he could make it up to her by doing something nice for her. Offer suggestions if your child is struggling to think of something (e.g. ""you could make her a card"").

Time outs. A time out should last roughly 1 minute for each year of age (e.g. 2-minute time outs for a 2-year-old).

Removal of privileges. For example, if your child keeps pushing people while playing, take the toy away for now and tell them why.

, Before you announce the spanking, be 100% positive that you want to spank your child. Spanking should be a last resort, after issuing non-physical punishments like timeouts, grounding or denial of privileges.


Spanking is illegal in some regions.
Studies show that spanking does not improve behavior in the long run, and causes children to become more aggressive. They are also more likely to suffer depression, anxiety, and substance abuse as they get older.Recognize that some people consider spanking to be abuse, especially if you hit hard. Never hit hard or leave bruises on a child. Child protective services may be called if people are concerned about you hitting your child.
Read up on alternatives to spanking., Spanking in front of others, especially friends or siblings, can be intensely embarrassing for your child. This can generate feelings of resentment that are counter-productive to your child learning better behavior. Especially if you spank on your child's bare bottom, privacy is important.

, The child will probably be a bit angry and resentful. They may also be a bit nervous. This is to be expected. You should be understanding of these reactions, but you also need to stand your ground.

, Tell them it would be unwise if they attempt to block or otherwise resist the punishment. If they are complaining or whining, tell them this will not cause a shorter spanking. Crying, however, is very natural before, during and after the spanking, and should never be punished.

, Using anything other than an open hand could be dangerous, and should be avoided.


Some parents, families, and cultures prefer bare bottom spankings even for teenagers, and some advocate spanking only over clothing. Use your own best judgment, considering all factors: your cultural norms (and therefore embarrassment and sense of intrusion your child may feel), your child's safety (spanking on a bare bottom can allow you to see how much redness you're leaving, but it also offers less protection from the hand), your child's age and comfort/discomfort with nudity, and what they're wearing (certain items of clothing might make it hurt more or less). While spanking may be acceptable to you as a form of punishment, you probably want to avoid it becoming a humiliating or traumatizing event; make your decisions accordingly, since you know your child and your culture the best.

, These can hurt your child and be dangerous for own hands as well. You don't want anything that will obstruct the spanking or possibly hurt your child. Also consider taking out any items in your pockets that may make it uncomfortable for your child to lie across your lap. Set these objects on a table or chair off to the side. If you have decided that you will spank on the bare bottom, pull down your child's pants and underpants now, or let your child do that.

, Sit down, then pull the child over your lap.

, Make sure your child isn't squirming and his or her legs are locked.


Do not talk during the spanking. Save any conversation for after the spanking is done—just get it over.

, It doesn't take a lot of force to successfully discipline your child, and hitting too hard can cause injury or trauma. Plus, the symbolism of the act is just as important as the actual pain inflicted, particularly if you decided to spank on the bare bottom. Make sure you listen to the child's responses, to know if you are hitting too hard.


For avoiding injury to your child you should keep a safe distance from the genital area, the coccyx and the kidneys of the child. Pay attention to the reddening of your child's bottom: at the latest if both cheeks are bright red, the spanking should end. Naturally, a spanking on the bare bottom will help you avoid accidentally spanking the genital area and obviously will help you see if both cheeks are a bright red. If you spank in this way, pull up your child's underpants and trousers as soon the spanking is finished, or let your child do that.

, Tell them that you just do it because you love them and that discipline is part of that love. Emphasize that they can prevent future spankings by thinking about their actions and making good choices. Never follow up a spanking with any other kind of punishment - after the spanking should come immediate forgiveness.

, This may sound odd, but when done properly a spanking can teach a child a valuable lesson that they will be glad of in the future. Do your best to make the experience constructive.

, Tell your child that you love them always no matter what.

Be clear about your expectations.,
Give your child enough time to comply with requests.,
Explain what behaviors may lead to a time-out.,
Recognize the utility of time-outs.,
Find a good location for the time-out.,
Decide on boundaries for the time-out.,
Give the child the opportunity to correct the behavior first.,
Direct the child to the time-out area.,
Set and keep the time limit.,
Do something else but continue to monitor your child.,
Recap the situation and plan for the future.",How to Give a Child a Time Out," The more clear you are, the less confusion may occur and thus less avoidable conflict with your child.


For example, if you want your child to put his crayons away and you say, “Make sure you put those away,” your child may be confused and not understand what you want him to do. However, if you say something like, “Johnny, please put your crayons away in your crayon box right now,” your child knows exactly what you are referring to, when you want it to happen, and where to put it.;
, Studies show that parents may not give their children enough time to respond to a request or command.Make sure the amount of time you give the child fits the command. For example, if you asked your child to put away his crayons, give him adequate time to complete this task. He will need to pick up his crayons, fit them all into the box, and then put the box away. Given that he is a child, this will take longer for him to do. Giving him only 5 seconds to do this is not enough time; 1 minute might be more appropriate.

, Children need to understand the boundaries and what the consequences are if they break those boundaries. If the child anticipates the time-out, it is more likely to result in compliance over time.When you are initiating the new rule of time-outs in your household, you can explain to your child the types of behaviors that might land him in time-out. For example, you could say something like, “Johnny, we’re going to try something new. Lately, I’ve noticed that you sometimes don’t obey me when I tell you to do something. If that happens, I may ask you to go to time-out.”
Give specific example such as, “Certain things might lead to a time-out. Some things you’ve done lately are when you didn’t put your crayons away when I asked you to, and when you screamed in the store because I said you couldn’t have a toy.” You can explain your reasoning by saying, “Since these types of things are happening, we need to try something new.”

, Children who act out have learned that their behaviors (such as tantrums) get them what they want (for the parent to give in).Some children want attention, while others simply want an item or piece of candy. The removal of attention received when giving a time-out may be the reason for increased compliance in the child. Time-outs don’t have to be viewed as punishments, but as the removal of parental behaviors that were previously reinforcing the child’s negative behavior (giving in to buying the item, letting the child have the candy, or giving up).

, Find an empty spot in your home. Make sure it is in a low-traffic area like a rarely-used room or a corner.


Depending on your preference and culture, you might want to name the time out area the “thinking chair,” or “time-out corner.”You can let your child know ahead of time that this area is going to be his “thinking spot” where he can go sometimes if he does not comply with your instructions appropriately (refusing to do what he is told, or having a tantrum).

, Planning out exactly how you want the time-out to happen will help ensure that it runs smoothly.


Decide whether to let children sit or stand. Standing is a slightly harsher punishment as it can be tiring. For standing, don't put anything in the area. For sitting, place a stool or small chair.
Do not allow the child to talk to you during the time-out.
Decide what you want to tell your child to think about while he is in time-out. You can tell him to think about how he can work on staying out of time-outs, or what you can do together (collaborative problem solving) to make sure his behaviors are good so he doesn't have to go to a time-out. Focus on what he can do better instead of telling him to, ""think about what you did wrong,"" as this can be shaming.
Have them face the wall. This is so that they cannot get any reinforcement from you or another family member.
Decide on the amount of time for a time-out. For every year of age there should only be 1 minute of time out given. For a 4 year old, 4 minutes of time out is appropriate., Next time your child misbehaves, first ask him to stop the behavior. Say, ""Please stop playing with your crayons and put them away. If you don't stop, you'll have to take a time-out.""


Emphasize that the child has a choice, to stop the behavior (or do the behavior you want) or go to time-out.
Count out loud in order to give the child time to correct his behavior.Let the child know that if he does not comply then on the count of 5 he has to go to time-out. Say something like, “I’m going to count to 5, and if you haven’t done what I asked you by the time I say 5, you have to go to time-out.” Count slowly, or give extra counts (Count to 10, or give him 30 seconds) to give the child enough time to complete what you asked.
If the behavior stops, then a time-out is not necessary.

, If your child does not comply with your request in a reasonable amount of time, let the child know that he now has to go to time-out. Tell the child what you would like him to do - either sit on the stool/chair or stand.


Try to remain calm and don't be rough with your child. Simply take him to the time-out area.
Tell your child what you previously decided for him to think about while he's in time out. Remember to avoid telling him to think about what he did wrong and instead say something like, ""Try to think about how we can make this better so that you don't have to go to time-out next time. When you're done with your time-out we can talk about it.""
Manage your own emotions. Your child may continue to kick, scream, or cry as he does not want to go to time-out. Remind yourself that you need to be consistent and that it would be worse to give in to him at this point; this is because it would reinforce his negative behaviors and teach him that the more he screams or cries, the better chance he will get what he wants.

, Tell your child how long his time-out out will be.


Do not let the child leave the time-out early! This will reinforce that if he begs you or tantrums further, he will eventually get what he wants.
Use a buzzer (or sound on your cell phone) if your child attempts to leave time-out early. This helps to manage the time-out more effectively and set appropriate boundaries.If the child attempts to leave the time-out, give a warning. Say something like, “You were instructed to stay in the time-out until the time is up. If you don’t do this, you will go into the holding chair (or a room alone).” The holding chair is where you would need to physically hold the child down in the chair (not hurting them of course), or stand right next to the chair until the time is up. Another option is to have them spend the rest of their time-out in a room alone.

, Consider leaving the room or going about your daily tasks. However, stay close enough that if your child leaves the time out area or starts talking to another family member, you will know.


It is important that you do not give your child attention during the time-out because this could reinforce his negative behavior.Stay strong. It can be very difficult to see your child cry or scream, or hear him beg or suffer. Use your own coping skills to tolerate these behaviors. Think realistically about the situation. Ask yourself, “Is my child really in pain right now or just upset that he did not get what he wanted?”

, Once the time out is over, approach the child and remind him why he was in time out.


Tell him that the time out is over and he can go back to playing, but if he does that behavior again, he will have a time out again. Be consistent and don’t back down!
Use collaborative problem solving.Time-outs alone may not be enough to completely extinguish a negative behavior. Try problem-solving with your child by asking, “What do you think we need to do in order to stop these time-outs from happening?” If your child says something like, “Just stop doing them,” you can respond by saying, “The point of the time-outs are to correct your behavior, remember? What do you think we can do about that?”
Use positive reinforcement. Positive reinforcement is where you give your child a reward in order to increase positive behaviors. For example, you could say something like, “If you make sure to put your crayons away for one whole week then we will go out for ice-cream.” Positive reinforcement tactics like these may reduce the amount of time-outs needed and increase positive behaviors.

Avoid the “Cry-it-Out” technique.,
Make sure your toddler engages in plenty of physical activity during the day.,
Be careful not to provide too much physical activity, which can overstimulate your toddler.,
Refrain from allowing your toddler to sit and watch television for too long.,
Take your toddler’s activity level down a notch during the late afternoon and early evening hours.,
Try to stick with the same routine before bed every night.,
Do whatever works for you, your child and your schedule.,
Keep the bedtime routine simple.,
Stay within your toddler’s sight when he is adjusting to his new bedtime routine.,
Let your toddler make decisions each night as part of his bedtime routine.,
Give your child other, limited options for going to bed, such as “Do you want to go to bed now or in 10 minutes?”.,
Avoid giving in to your toddler’s cries and pleads to postpone bedtime.,
Remain calm at all times.,
Ignore temper tantrums and crying fits.",How to Get Your Two Year Old to Stop Crying and Go to Sleep Alone," Refrain from allowing your toddler to cry it out. Once your two year old cries to the point where he is inconsolable, it becomes increasingly difficult for him to stop crying. Children at this age do not understand how to regulate their emotions, and if left alone to cry at night rather than being consoled, it can lead to feelings of abandonment. For children who are high-spirited, this can also be a result of producing less serotonin than what is produced by calmer, less intense children. Sure, your toddler may eventually stop crying and fall asleep, but it is likely to be form pure exhaustion, and not because he has learned to adjust to a bedtime routine.;
, Two year olds are a bundle of energy. If they are not provided the opportunity to use that energy during the day, it is likely that the energy will still be there when it is time for bed. Excess energy and an early bedtime simply do not mix. Also, regular physical activity helps to increase serotonin levels in the body.


Take him outside to play in the fresh air if weather permits. If he does not have a backyard to play in, take him to a local park or school playground. Even a simple walk around the block can help him use up his energy.
Encourage your toddler to play with toys actively. Even the simplest activity uses energy, so offer up lots of hands on activities that are age appropriate. Coloring books, modeling dough, building blocks and finger paints are all creative activities that two year olds generally enjoy.

, Energy-draining activities all day long can increase the amount of cortisol, a stress hormone, in the body. When cortisol levels are elevated, it can interfere with bedtime and inhibit sleep. In general, it is best to include no more than one large energy-consuming activity in a day. For example, if you are going shopping for 3 hours at a busy mall, it’s probably best to postpone a trip to the zoo or a play date with another child for a different day.

, Television viewing is not recommended for children under the age of three. That is largely because it can interfere with the way their brains process information, and may possibly lead to the development of ADD/ADHD. Although this theory has not been proven, it is gaining popularity among health care professionals, including pediatricians and child psychologists. What is proven, however, is that many young children who view television experience a surge in stress hormones, which can linger all day and interfere with sleep at bedtime.

, Calm your child down about an hour or so before dinner time. Make the switch from wild, unharnessed play to calming activities such as reading a book, singing songs or engaging in imaginative play with toys.


If the television or stereo is on throughout the day, shut it off just before dinner and do not turn it back on again until after your toddler has gone to bed. Eliminating distractions like this can help your toddler calm down.
Give your child a warm bath after dinner to help calm both his mind and his body. Try adding some lavender soap or use a lavender-infused shampoo, which has calming properties.

, This will help your two year old quickly learn what is expected of him at bedtime. After just a week of doing the same activities before bed, most children will adjust to their new routine and come to expect it each night. Decide on a bedtime and make sure you start your nightly routine at the same time each night.

, If you only have one child, you will likely have an easier time incorporating things into a bedtime routine that if you have multiple children. For example, with only one child, a walk around the block in the stroller is probably a simple enough task. However, if you have other children who have their own nightly routines, not to mention homework and extracurricular activities, a nightly stroller walk may be out of the question.

, Two year olds can only comprehend so much. If their bedtime routine contains multiple steps they can become overwhelmed, which can backfire at bedtime. A bath, a small glass of warm milk followed by teeth-brushing and a bedtime story is a simple bedtime routine that can easily be followed every night.

, This can help your two year old feel secure while transitioning to going to sleep on his own.


Stay in his room and perform some simple, silent tasks while he lies in his crib or bed. Fold laundry, balance a checkbook, go through the mail or simply read a book.
Explain to your toddler that you will remain in the room with him until he falls asleep, but that it is bedtime and not time to play or talk. Let him know that you are there to keep him company while he tries to go to sleep.
Do this every night. Eventually, your toddler’s sense of security will improve, and he will likely require less time to fall asleep at night.

, Limit his options to keep his choices simple.


Let him decide which story he would like to read at bedtime. Allowing him to choose one book out of two or three options will make him feel as if he is in some control. Asking him to select one book off a shelf of 20 books, however, can be overwhelming.
Lay out two sets of pajamas on the bed and allow your toddler to choose which pair he wants to wear each night.
During bath time, ask him which songs he would like to sing.

, He is likely to choose 10 minutes, but giving him the option makes him feel more in control of his bedtime, which can cut back on nightly power struggles. Refrain from engaging in power struggles with your toddler. Once you set a rule, it is important that you stick with that rule and follow through.

, If you give in just once, you are indirectly communicating to your toddler that rules can be broken. A two year old cannot comprehend special allowances like an older child can, so he will only learn that he can cry and bargain to get what he wants each night.

, It can be frustrating dealing with crying toddlers who refuse to go to sleep at night. It is important that you remain in control and never lose your temper. Don’t yell or raise your voice, but do communicate your rules in a firm yet gentle tone.

, Acknowledging them, in any way, shows your toddler that you his efforts to get your attention are working. Even negative attention is attention, so it is best to avoid acknowledging tantrums altogether.

Stay calm.,
Acknowledge your preteen's feelings.,
Be aware of your preteen's hormonal and biological changes.,
Avoid taking their words or actions too personally.",How to Handle a Preteen's Tantrums1," While it's very hard to be nice and calm when someone is throwing a fit, yelling or screaming, it's important to not overreact. Avoid yelling back at your child. They are upset and will likely be more upset if you make them feel unprotected or unloved. Try to soothe their frustrations by first focusing on how to soothe yourself in this moment.Take a deep breath. If they're having a tantrum at home and not in public, take a minute to do a breathing exercise. Slowing inhale for five seconds, and then slowly exhale for five seconds. Repeat as many times as needed to help calm you down.
Recognize if your emotions are increasing. Think for a moment that you are in control of your emotions. You can stay calm in this moment.;
, Communicate to your child that you understand their feelings. This doesn't mean you're saying it's okay to have tantrums by yelling, screaming, and slamming doors. It means that you acknowledge these very human emotions of being upset, frustrated, anxious, and overwhelmed.Consider saying, ""I know you're upset right now. I'm sorry that you feel this way. We can get through this together.""
Acknowledging their emotions doesn't necessarily mean caving into what they want. Be clear that you are there for them but you may disagree with what they're doing. Consider saying, ""I want to be supportive because I know you're feeling upset. I understand what you're going through. But right now, I don't agree with how you're behaving.""

, As your child begins to go through puberty, there are changes in their hormones and brain development. While this is not an excuse for their behavior, it is a way to understand how treating them like adults, or vice versa like seven year olds, may not work too well.Their impulse control may be more limited than in adults.
They may have more limited ability to express their feelings in clear and concrete ways. Their hormones may be sending signals that are confusing or different for them, and they don't know yet how to respond.
Their ability to understand others' body language may be more impaired than adults.

, Preteens are beginning to exert their desire for independence from you. They may be less inclined to tell you about what's bothering them or how their day at school went. They may shy away from being open, and it may have nothing to do with you. They may yell, scream, or fight, but don't let it make you too upset or angry.When a preteen is upset and yelling, focus on how you can treat them with respect. They are more likely to be respectful when you are demonstrating respect.
Focus on teaching them appropriate ways to communicate in a calm manner. If you are not able to calm yourself when talking with them, step away and come back to the topic when you can. If your child is not able to focus on what you are saying, wait until the tantrum has passed to address how they can use more respectful words and avoid name-calling or vulgar language.

Look for what is legitimate in their concerns.,
Create rules and boundaries for your preteen.,
Establish consistent consequences.,
Be firm yet kind.",How to Handle a Preteen's Tantrums2," While in the middle of a tantrum or outburst, it may be difficult to understand what they're wanting or the logic of their argument. Avoid assuming that their entire behavior and what they are wanting is irrational or wrong. We all were young once, and had difficulty with expressing what we wanted at times.During a calm time, ask them questions like, ""What is it you really want? Are you wanting more ability to make your own decisions? Or more freedom?""
Discuss with them about how well they think having tantrum is in getting what they want. Ask them, ""I saw you were upset when you asked me for something. How well do you think it worked in getting what you want?""

, Create clear rules and have consequences if they break those rules. Consider putting those rules in writing. By establishing house rules that are clear and agreed upon before your child has a tantrum, you will be better able to stick to clear and set rules.Understand that your preteen may want to push those boundaries of what is acceptable and what is not. Think about which things are negotiable and which are not. Be firm about the non-negotiables.
For example, a clear rule could be that at dinner time, there is no calling, texting, or other distractions while eating at the dinner table. This goes for everyone at the table.
As your child is getting older, consider including them in the input about appropriate house rules as well as consequences. By giving them the ability to add to the situation, you are demonstrating that you value their input.

, While sometimes tantrums just need to be ignored, if your child's behavior is very difficult and inappropriate, then set consequences for their actions. Avoid getting caught up in arguments.Avoid being manipulated by your preteen and stay firm but fair about the consequences.
Consider having multiple consequences for their actions. Then the child has the ""choice"" about which punishment or consequence to take from the options you provide. Then make sure to stick with what has been agreed upon.
Include your spouse, other parents, or other adults that may be involved in enforcing these consequences. If you and your significant other differ on how to enforce consequences, it's important address this issue so there is consistency among you both.

, Avoid caving into your preteen's various demands on a regular basis. This lack of structure may make it more difficult in the future if there are other arguments or tantrums. At the same time, avoid dominating your child and making them feel less-than. It is important that you demonstrate the ""why"" for your actions.


Be staying firm with a rule and its consequences you are helping to instill discipline in their actions.
Don't respond to your preteen with a vague answer or, ""Because I said so.""Provide positive feedback when your preteen follows what you requested them to do. Consider saying, ""Thanks you for being so calm. I appreciate you asking me nicely about what you want to do."""

Teach your preteen how to process their emotions.,
Instill healthy habits in your preteen to reduce stress and tantrums.,
Be a role model for appropriate behavior and etiquette.,
Keep a strong bond with your preteen.",How to Handle a Preteen's Tantrums3," Your preteen may not know how to process the emotions they are experiencing, which can make matters worse. To help your preteen, help them learn how to identify and process their emotions in a healthy way.Advise your preteen to name the emotion. Is it anger? Fear? Sadness? Worry? Ask you teen what it is that they are feeling.
Ask your teen to express acceptance of the feeling. For example, your teen can say something like, “It is okay to feel sad.”
Teach your teen how to express the emotion in a healthy way. For example, your teen can express the emotion by crying, writing or talking about it, exercising, or doing something creative such as painting or playing an instrument.
Encourage your teen to do something kind for themselves. Ask your preteen what would help them feel better. For example, your preteen might feel better after a hug, a relaxing bath, a walk, or after watching a favorite movie.

, Your preteen needs to learn healthy ways to cope with stress, anger, and anxiety. Some of these ways are very simple. By providing them guidance with this, and setting an example, you can help them understand what are healthy and unhealthy ways to let out anger or stress.Make sure that they get a good night's sleep. Sleeping well will help them function better.
Make their diet a priority. Avoid too much sugar and caffeine. This may make them crash after a sugar or caffeine high. Make sure that they aren't filling up on junk food on a regular basis.
Focus on exercise. When your child has a tantrum, they may need to release excess energy. Have them go outside and run in the back yard, or get them to do something physical that doesn't hurt others. Maybe you have a punching bag in the garage or some other exercise equipment that they can use.

, If you're yelling or swearing, and one of your rules for them is ""no swearing,"" then you may not be providing a good example to your child. If it is other people in the house that are acting inappropriate such as a spouse or older child, include everyone in the household about the house rules for appropriate behavior.Though your preteen may not admit it, they look up to you and other adults for guidance and understanding. Make sure to treat them as you would like to be treated--with honesty and respect.
Teach them how to make decisions about the way they act. Explore how they feel when other people yell, scream, or manipulate. See if they think that other people's tantrums are appropriate. While they may not fully understand, this is an opportunity for them to reflect on how their actions are part of the larger family or group.
Avoid throwing tantrums yourself. If you struggle to control your emotions, then your preteen may be learning this behavior from you. Make sure that you are setting a good example for your preteen by expressing your emotions in healthy ways.

, While it may be tough to spend time with a child who acts like you're the last person they want to be with, it matters that you keep your connection strong with your child. Quality time is key to a healthy relationship with your kids. You may be able to decrease these tantrums in the long run.


Set aside one-on-one time with your preteen. Do something together that doesn't involve electronic devices and other distractions. Make this a time to connect and share with your child.
Have regular family meals and family activities. Create a schedule for these times if it's hard to make this happen every night or every week.
Consider having some one-on-one time when your child is getting ready for bed. Sometimes connecting with them during these quiet moments can be meaningful even if it's just a brief talk and a hug.

Outline specific rules.,
Be clear with your consequences.,
Follow through with consequences.,
Use a timer.,
Insist that your child completes all homework and chores each day.,
Place the video game system in a common room.",How to Get Your Child to Stop Playing Video Games1," Clear, established rules are important for changing your child’s behavior. By letting your child know exactly what you want, they know what is expected from them and there are no grey areas. You should also establish clear consequences for any rule breaking. Sit down with your child and talk about the new rules. Don’t say, “You only get to play video games a few hours each day and not too late.” That is too vague. Instead, say, “On school days, you can play video games for one hour. You cannot play after 8 p.m.”;
, Your child needs clear, defined consequences for breaking the rules. Make sure that when you set the rules, you give them consequences they understand. Don’t be vague with consequences because that will just cause confusion.For example, tell them, “If you don’t have any outbursts or act out when you turn off your video games, and if you don’t play after 8 p.m., you can continue playing for one hour each school day. If you give problems, play longer than an hour, or play after 8 p.m., you will lose your gaming privileges for the next day.”

, After you set limits and establish consequences, you must follow through. If you let your child get away with breaking rules without consequences, they will not take you seriously and not follow your rules. Make sure to stick to your word if your child breaks the rules.Don’t change the consequences, even if you get mad. If the rules and consequences are not working, discuss new rules and consequences with your child and why they have changed.

, Using a timer and giving your child warnings can help them prepare for the end of their designated time. Children can be very resistant to change, even if they know it’s coming. Warning them that their time is about to be over will help them transition.Give your child warnings when they have 15 and 10 minutes left.
Set a timer for five minutes before the end. When the buzzer sounds, tell them, “You have five minutes left. It’s time to get to a point where you can save your game.”

, Your child should have responsibilities they have to complete before they are allowed their video game time. This includes homework and chores. After all the responsibilities have been met, then they can be allowed to begin their video game time.


Help your child see video games as a reward for finishing their homework and chores each day.

, One good way to set limits on your child’s gaming and monitor them is to place the systems in a common room instead of their bedroom. This makes it easier for you to enforce the rules and for your child to follow them.Placing a game console in a child’s bedroom gives them too much freedom to play when unsupervised. Additionally, it can cause too much temptation, especially for a younger child who has difficulty following rules.

Look for sibling rivalry.,
Encourage children to celebrate each other's success.,
Help the tattletale child develop social skills.,
Reflect on your child’s need for attention.",How to Handle a Tattletale Child1," If two siblings don’t get along, one child might tattle on the other in order to gain pleasure from seeing the other punished. This same dynamic might be driving tattletale behavior in the relationship between two classmates who don’t get along.To discourage sibling rivalry, pay equal attention to both children. Praise them both, but not in the same ways. Attend to the differences that make each child special. For instance, if Jane and Edwin are engaged in sibling rivalry that leads to tattletale behavior, tell Jane, “You are a great artist. I am proud of you.” Tell Edwin, “You did a great job on your math test. Keep up the good work.”If you’re a parent, help your kids develop healthy emotional lives. Encourage them to share how they feel when things go well and when things don’t go well. Help them find ways to channel their emotions in productive directions.
Some level of sibling rivalry is normal, but if it lapses into tattletale behavior (or worse, bullying), you’ll need to take steps to correct it. Schedule some family therapy sessions if your kids engage in extreme sibling rivalry.;
, Take the life lessons a step further by teaching children to be happy when someone else does well. This can help them understand that there is room for everyone to succeed, and no need to undermine people by tattling.


Lead by example! Celebrate other people's achievements and strengths, and do not gossip or unnecessarily criticize others in front of children.

, Some kids – both youngsters and teens – haven’t developed the ability to engage constructively in interpersonal problem solving. In this case, you should work with the child to help them develop social skills. Encourage the child to smile more, keep their arms at their sides, and look into the eyes of conversation partners and peers. These nonverbal signals communicate that they are friendly. Discourage them from crossing their arms, hanging their head, or scowling.Help the tattletale child meet others. Encourage them to sign up for an afterschool club or intramural sports team. These social situations will help your child develop a sense of self that reduces their need to tattle on others.
Help the tattletale child become an active listener. Show them how to nod their head when others are talking and use verbal encouragement like “Yeah” and “I see” when others are talking.

, If you’ve been neglecting the tattletale child, they might engage in tattletale behavior in order to get your attention. Even though the information the tattletale is conveying is not about them, they might become a tattletale – even unconsciously – in order to find an opportunity to earn your praise and attention.You can reduce the tattletale child’s need for attention by paying more attention to them. Praise the child for doing great work in school, or making a great play on their soccer team.Make sharing a two-way street. Ask the child to tell you about their day, and take time to show them things you like to do or to talk about your life.
For instance, you might say to your tattletale child, “Tell me about your day. I am very interested in what you’ve been doing.” Ask follow-up questions where appropriate.

Work with your child on techniques to stop playing video games.,
Reduce the time for video games slowly.,
Set up a transition routine.,
Establish family time.,
Help your child learn how to save their game progress.",How to Get Your Child to Stop Playing Video Games2," Involve your child in the process of limiting their video game playing. Talk about not playing certain games that will be too exciting or take too long on school night, or come up with a reward system for following the video game rules.For example, talk with a child about not trying to beat a level when they don’t have time. Instead, they can save that for the weekend.
You and your child can brainstorm rewards for not breaking the rules for a week, month, or longer. Don’t give rewards of more video game time. Instead, find other fun rewards you can both agree on.

, Instead of getting rid of video games completely, slowly taper the amount of time your child can play. For example, if they spend every hour after school playing, limit that to one or two hours at first. Explain to your child why you are reducing their time playing video games, but let them know you respect that they enjoy the activity and still want them to play.For example, you may say, “You get angry and have verbal outbursts when I tell you to stop playing video games. Your grades have fallen over the last few months because of your video games. This is unacceptable. I want you to be able to enjoy them, but we are going to limit how long you can play each day.”
Cutting off video games completely at first will more than likely backfire. You want to limit your child’s behavior, not take away something they enjoy completely.

, Ending video game time may be difficult, and your child may not be able to switch out of that mode immediately. Help your child by giving them a physical activity that marks the end of their video game time. This can help them get used to switching from that to non-video game life.For example, you can try specific language that signals a switch. Say something light like, “You are being called back to the RW from fantasy land! Welcome back!”
Set up a physical marker. Give your child a glass of water, stretch with them, or do a few jumping jacks.

, Get your child away from the video games by setting up family time where the whole family does an activity together. Family time should not be optional, and every member of the family including parents and children should participate.Allow your child to choose the activity sometimes, so they feel like they are getting to do things they want to do. Forcing them to do activities they don’t want to do can frustrate them.
You can ask your child to help you make dinner, and make family dinners a nightly ritual.
Go for a walk or bike ride together, play board or card games, or have a family movie night.
You may want to set consequences for not participating in family activities. For example, if they skip a family activity, they do not get their hour of video games.

, Many younger children do not know how to navigate the game features and may need help learning how to save progress. If they save their game and do not feel like all of their efforts have been wasted, they are less likely to give you a hard time about ending their playing session.


Explain to your child that many games take tens or hundreds of hours to complete, which means the game cannot be completed in one sitting. Help them understand that the game is meant to be spread out.
When their time is up, wait for them to get to a saving spot, and help them if they are too young to do it by themselves. If they try to extend their time by taking too much time to save, subtract the amount of time from their next day’s hour. If it continues, take away their privilege for breaking the rules."

Encourage your child to find other activities.,
Get your child involved in social activities.,
Encourage your child to get involved in physical activities.",How to Get Your Child to Stop Playing Video Games3," Video games are only one way that children can entertain themselves. There are a lot of things they can do, especially if they are not allowed ot fall back on video games. Encourage your child to pursue other interests, and if they can’t think of anything, suggest a few for them.Don’t be afraid to say no to your child when they want to play video games because “there’s nothing to do.”
For example, your child can play with other toys, put on plays, make music or movies, read, play outside, engage in something creative like drawing, writing, or crafts, or play board or card games.

, Gaming is a solitary activity. You can encourage your child to participate in group activities they will enjoy. Brainstorm together and let them choose activities they will enjoy instead of choosing one for them.You can try youth groups at your religious institution. Local Y Clubs, community arts centers, and libraries also offer youth programs.
Look into local arts programs for theater, music, painting, and drawing. You can also look for programs for computers, building, or other hands-on activities.
Recreational sports can be fun for some kids, though you should never force children to do sports who do not want to do them.

, Excessive playing of video games has been linked to conditions like childhood obesity because video games are sedentary activities. To get your child more active, encourage your child to choose a physical activity they enjoy. It’s important to let your child choose what they do. Encourage them to try new activities if they don’t have any favorites.Your child may enjoy bike riding, skateboarding, dance, martial arts, recreational sports, swimming, and playing games outside.

Determine an acceptable amount of time for video games.,
Familiarize yourself with the warning signs of video game addiction.,
Contact a healthcare professional if you notice any problems.",How to Get Your Child to Stop Playing Video Games4," Everyone has a different opinion for what is acceptable for video games. Decide on an acceptable time for each day or for the week. Some parents limit video games to one hour per day, while others completely ban video games during the school week and only allow for a few hours on the weekends.Many healthcare professionals and development specialists recommend that children should not spend more than two hours each day in front of a television or computer screen. Take this into account when determining what time limits you want to set and decide on an acceptable amount of video game playing time that works for you.

, Some kids develop an actual addiction to playing video games. They experience behavioral, emotional, and physical symptoms, such as becoming withdrawn from family and friends. It is important for parents to understand what the signs and symptoms are, so that they can recognize them if they develop in their child.For example, your child may be unable to stop playing, get aggressive or upset when they are not playing, or lose interest in all other activities. They may irritable or depressed when not playing video games. Children may neglect their personal hygiene, have disrupted sleep, and experience back or wrist pain.

, If you believe your child is addicted to video games and you’ve tried to limit their behavior with no change, you may need help from a professional. Your child’s doctor or a mental health professional can work with you and your child to help positively change their behavior and enforce limits.This may be a good option if your child reacts violently to limits on their video game access. If your child is destructive, aggressive, or threatening due to you trying to change their behavior, they may need to see a mental health professional.

Explain to the tattletale child when they should not tattle.,
Help the tattletale understand when they should report misbehavior.,
Direct the tattletale to reflect on their motivations.,
Illustrate the impact tattling has on the tattletale.,
Talk about privacy.",How to Handle a Tattletale Child2," Make it clear to the child that if a situation does not involve them, they should not report it. For instance, if a child is doodling in their notebook while the teacher is talking, they should not report this improper behavior since the teacher can choose to discipline that child if they wish.For example, you might say, “If a situation does not involve you, do not report it. If your classmate is doodling in their notebook while the teacher is talking, there’s no need to report this. The teacher can choose to discipline that child if they wish.”
Other situations where tattling is unnecessary include situations where the child could solve the problem themselves. Encourage the tattletale to exhaust all possible avenues for problem resolution before discussing it with an adult.
For instance, if the tattletale complains that their classmate is bothering them, suggest to the tattletale child that next time it happens, they should ask their classmate to kindly be quiet. Suggest that the tattletale child say, “Please be quiet.”

, Explain to the tattletale child that if their safety, or the health and safety of another student is at risk, they should immediately report the situation to you or another adult. For instance, if the child sees two children fighting with knives, they should report it immediately to an adult in charge.Boil it down for the tattletale by reminding them that tattling is intended to get someone in trouble, while reporting appropriately (“telling”) is designed to get someone out of trouble.

, When your receive a negative report from the tattletale, ask them to think about why they’re bringing this information to you. Ask them directly: “Are you trying to help your friend? Or are you trying to get them in trouble?”If they answer that they’re trying to help their friend, push them further by asking, “How does it help your friend if I find out about what they were doing?” Highlight the contradictions and falsehoods in the tattletale’s explanation and remind them that lying is unacceptable.
If the tattletale child admits that they were primarily interested in seeing their friend get in trouble, you should reply, “That is not a good use of your time or mine. Please do not tattle on others again.”

, Explain to the tattletale that by tattling, they run the risk of being targeted by bullies and called unkind names like snitch or spy. You could say, “Tattling might cause bullies to target you, and lead others to call you names like snitch or spy.” Ask “How do those mean names make you feel?”You can follow up by asking “How would you like being tattled on?” When they reply that they would not, remind them that they should always treat others as they want to be treated.
Inform the child additionally that tattling will not help them gain friends.

, Another way to discourage tattling is to talk about the value of privacy and secrets. Say ""Your friends might not trust you with secrets or important feelings if they think you're going to tell them to other people.""

Get other adults involved.,
Encourage the tattletale to be independent.,
Ignore the tattletale.,
Foster anti-tattling habits.,
Monitor the situation more closely.,
Be a good role model.,
Recognize occasions when tattling is okay.,
Encourage the tattletale to practice what they’ve learned.",How to Handle a Tattletale Child3," If you’re the parent of a tattletale child, you should talk to the child’s teachers, babysitters, and other caretakers about the tattletale behavior. If you’re the teacher of a tattletale child, talk to other teachers and the child’s parents. Together, you and the other adults involved can share ways to reeducate the child about how to differentiate between proper reporting of dangerous or untenable situations and improper tattletale behavior., Tattletales rely on their parents or other adults in charge to rescue them and make things right. Independent children, however, are better equipped to solve problems on their own and less likely to engage in tattling.Assign chores. Give the child tasks to do that correspond to their age and ability level. In elementary school, teachers can ask kids to clean up toys when playtime has concluded. Parents can ask their young children to organize the shoes in the closet. Teens might need to take out the trash, wash the dishes, or babysit their younger siblings.
Do things with the child rather than for them. Parents and other caretakers can help kids to adopt an independent spirit by doing things together with their child. For instance, instead of making dinner for your child every night, you could invite them to help out doing simple tasks in the kitchen like measuring water or other ingredients. This will instill a “can-do” attitude within the child over time.
Provide challenges for the tattletale. If you’re the parent of a tattletale child, you could insist that your child participates in extracurricular activities like soccer, hockey, and chess club that build mental toughness and independence. Help the tattletale explore a variety of activities and sign them up for one they enjoy.

, Acting on the tattletale’s reports will only encourage them to continue tattling. When you’re sure the information that the tattletale child is reporting is trivial or otherwise only designed to inspire a negative reaction from you, you should simply ignore the information. This approach will, over time, decrease the number of reports you receive from the tattletale.For instance, if a tattletale child reports to you that their neighbor is not listening to your directions, say, “Thank you” and continue your lesson.
Be sure that the tattletale is not reporting a situation that actually demands attention.

, Instead of ignoring or reprimanding tattletales for tattling, provide an incentive for them to communicate with you positively about their peers or siblings. For instance, you could set up a sticker chart that you fill up when you hear a tattletale say something kind about another student, or when a day goes by and they don’t tattle. After the child gets 25 or so tattle-free days, or reports 25 positive social interactions, they might receive a small toy or sweet candy., If a child is repeatedly tattling about a classmate or sibling, pay more attention to their interactions. That way, you prevent the tattletale from coming to you in the first place, and can act immediately to correct the situation as needed.For instance, if a child keeps tattling on the same person, keep an eye on their interactions. Tattling can be a way to seek help with bullying and abuse, if the child does not know a better way to do it. If it is a recurring report, look deeper into the dynamic and the relationship between the two children.

, If your child overhears you gossiping with friends about a third party, they might interpret it as tattling. Avoid doing this so that the tattletale does not come to believe that discussing the trivial behaviors of others – especially in a negative way – is appropriate.For instance, do not allow your child to overhear you saying things like, “Robert is very fat. He is a bad father, too.” These comments are unkind and your tattletale child might interpret them as a form of tattling, thus lending a sense of legitimacy to their own behavior.

, It is unwise to automatically dismiss a child’s concerns out of hand. If they came to you to report some misbehavior on the part of their peers, it indicates they trust you and you should think about what they’re reporting. If their report warrants a serious response, react in an appropriate manner., Behavior must be practiced before it is really learned. Ask the tattletale to reflect on their motivations, use their social skills, and be independent. Remind them to think twice before tattling again, and ask themselves if they are trying to help someone or merely get someone in trouble.Try roleplaying with the tattletale child to help them practice alternatives to tattling in different situations. For instance, you could play a noisy peer and another adult could play the teacher. After your child confronts you about your noisy behavior, you could apologize and quiet down.
Talk about examples in TV shows and movies, or even in your own personal relationships.
Encourage the tattletale to reflect on their motivations in the real world by saying, “Please remember what you’ve learned the next time you wish to tattle. Show me that you don’t need an adult to resolve every minor dispute you encounter.”

Remain calm.,
Don’t give in.,
Ignore them.,
Divert their attention.,
Take them to a different area.,
Use positive reinforcement.,
Don’t worry about what others think.,
Be aware of their triggers.,
Spend one-on-one time.,
Know their limits.",How to Handle a Child's Meltdown at the Store," When your child begins to have a meltdown, remember to remain calm. Do not respond to your child’s tantrum by yelling, screaming, spanking, and becoming angry with them. Instead, take a few deep breaths and talk to your child in a calm voice.In a calm, soothing voice tell your child, “Once you calm down, we can talk and figure out what is wrong.”
Don’t try to reason with your child while they are having the tantrum. You want to teach your child that negotiations and compromises happen when they are calm and in control of their emotions.;
, By giving them what they want while the tantrum is happening, you are giving in. By doing this, you risk reinforcing inappropriate behavior. You do not want to do this, so stand your ground.By standing your ground, you are demonstrating to your child that their behavior is inappropriate and will not elicit the desired response.

, When your child is having a meltdown they want attention. So any kind of attention, whether it is positive or negative, can reinforce negative behavior. Instead, give them some space to let them get their frustration out while you make your way to a far corner in the store.When your child makes an effort to calm down by themself, this is when you should ask them if everything is ok.
Certain situations can also cause your child to have a meltdown, for example, going from one place to another or after ending a fun activity. These are emotionally charged situations where your child may just need your love and support. In these situations, instead of ignoring your child, stop and hold or hug your child until they can calm down., If you sense that a meltdown is about to happen, divert your child’s attention by giving them a toy, a snack, or by showing them something interesting. Children have short attention spans, so take advantage of it.Keep toys and snacks in your purse or pocket for moments like these.
Take them to the seafood section and show them the swimming lobsters, or take them to the fruits and vegetables section and ask them to pick some fruit for you.

, If your child will not or cannot calm down, take them to a different location in the store. Go to a far corner that is quiet and away from other customers. Here you will be able to focus on your child, and it will give them time settle down and recover.Alternatively, you can take them outside of the store until they calm down.

, Once your child has calmed own on their own, reward them with praise and hugs. Show and tell them that you are happy that they were able to calm down by themself.Hug your child and tell them, “Everything is ok. We are almost done. When we get home you can have a snack and watch a video.”

, Know that there are going to people who judge you when your child is having a meltdown. Try not to let these people affect your mood and your ability to calm down your child. Do not apologize for your child’s behavior.Instead, use clear and positive statements like, “We are having some difficulties today” or “We are ok. I do not think this will go on for too much longer.”

, A variety of things can trigger a meltdown. However, the most common triggers are hunger, being tired, not getting what they want, or having to stop an activity they like. Therefore, try to notice patterns by taking note of when the triggers happen. This way you can respond appropriately.


For example, if your child is hungry, then give them a snack before going to the store or bring one with you.
If your child has meltdowns as a result of being tired, make sure they take a nap before going to the store with them.
Additionally, try to avoid areas in the store that you know might trigger a meltdown, for example, the toy or candy section.

, If the trigger is something unavoidable, then you will need to create a structure for them that will prepare them for the activity. By preparing them for the activity, your child will feel like they have more control over the situation because they know what to expect.Before engaging in the activity, talk to your child. Tell them that you are about to go to the store. Also, give them an incentive to be good, for example, a trip to the park or the ice cream store if they behave.

, If you know that your child is hungry or sleepy, then try to avoid taking them somewhere or prolonging your errand run. Take them home and address their needs before finishing your errands. Additionally, before taking them to the store, make sure their needs are met."

Prompt young children.,
Explain what they did wrong.,
State why we apologize.,
Give them time to think.,
Encourage them to make it up to the offended person.",How to Get Your Child to Apologize1," Children between the ages of two and five may not realize when they have done something wrong, and they may not have learned what apologies are yet. For these children, tell them when you want them to apologize in a calm but gentle voice.You can tell the child, “Say you’re sorry now.”
You might also try stating, “Can you say that you’re sorry?”
Stop this practice around age six. Children over six should learn to apologize on their own. By requiring them to apologize, you may be encouraging insincere apologies.;
, A gentle explanation of why the child needs to apologize can help them recognize that what they did was wrong. This will help them recognize these situations in the future.To a child under the age of six, you might say something like, “We say sorry when we make people sad or mad, even if we did not mean it.”
An older child might require a longer conversation. You might start by saying, “I understand that you’re frustrated, but it’s not right to call other people names. I think you need to apologize.” If the child is younger, then you might need to use different language, such as, “I understand you didn't like what he said, but it’s not right to call other people names. I think you need to apologize.”
For children over the age of six, you can encourage them to apologize, but you should not force them to do so. Children should learn that apologies are sincere expressions of regret, not a quick statement that can get them out of trouble., To teach your child the importance of apologizing, you might want to explain why it is important to apologize. You might point out that apologizing can heal hurt feelings or that apologizing can end a fight.


You might say, ""How do you think the other person feels? By saying sorry, you can make them feel better.""
If the child is feeling angry or sad about what happened, you might say, ""If you apologize, you might feel better yourself.""
You might emphasize that apologizing can make things better after a fight. You can say, ""When you apologize, you let the other person know that you didn't mean what you did. They will understand that it was a mistake.""Only use ""apologize"" when you are sure that the child understands that word. Otherwise, you can substitute ""when you say you are sorry” for “apologize.”

, Do not expect an apology right away. Some children may need time to realize that what they did was wrong. Instead of immediately demanding an apology, try to give the child a little space. They may come to you to apologize.You can put a child in time-out for a few minutes. Afterwards, you can, “are you ready to say you’re sorry?”
Do not drag out the apology too long. If the child does not apologize by the end of the day, you may just need to let it go.
Remember that the child's personality will factor in to how readily they will apologize.

, Try to attach the verbal apology with a sincere action. If the child hurt someone, you might ask the child to make it up to the other person. They might do a favor for the other person, or they can make a creative gift for the person they hurt.Writing a letter or drawing a picture may be a good way for the child to apologize to adults.
If the child took something from another child or did not share, you might encourage them to give the item back.

When you get down to your child’s height, you’re literally putting yourself on their level, which is a great way to start.Don’t attempt to have a conversation or give a child instructions from another room. It might seem easier to yell from upstairs, but it actually makes communication much harder.
You can also sit together at a table or on a couch if that’s comfortable.;
, Eye contact lets the child know that you’re listening and that you’re focused on them. It’s also a great way to see if they’re listening to you. If a child feels embarrassed or stubborn, they might not want to make eye contact, but if you stick with it, they may come around.Try to keep your gaze warm and non-threatening. If a child thinks you’re angry or trying to control them, they will probably be resistant.
You can gently let them know that you’d like them to look you in the eyes. You can say, “I’d like for you to look at me,” or “When you don’t look at me, I feel like you’re not ready to have a conversation.”

, There’s no point in trying to communicate with a child who’s in the middle of a tantrum or very aggravated. Before you try to communicate with the child, make sure they’ve calmed down.You can let them cool off by themselves, in their room or another safe place.
If you have a routine for calming the child down, you can do that until the child is ready to talk.

, Children can easily sense your intention by your tone. If you sound angry, controlling, or frustrated, they’re likely to get defensive. By using a positive tone, you are telling the child that you’re on the same team and that things aren’t so bad.If you have never been firm or direct with the child, this may come as a surprise to them. That's okay. You can say, ""I know we have done things differently in the past, but we're doing things this way now.""
Even if you’re saying something that’s no fun, such as, “I’d like you to pick up your toys now,” or, “There won’t be any TV tonight,” you can still use a tone that sounds positive.

, Ideally, you only have to tell or ask a child something once. However, it’s likely that you’ll have to ask them more than once until they get used to listening to you. You want to limit the amount of times you’re willing to repeat yourself.After asking once, wait to see how they respond. If you don’t get the desired response, repeat your request in a firmer tone.
Avoid repeating yourself too many times. Repeating yourself shows children that you are willing to keep nagging them, rather than taking action if they don't respond.

, For example, if you’ve said, “You need to get dressed before watching TV, or you’ll be late for the party,” it’s okay to let the child be late and understand that there are consequences for their actions.


Never do this when the consequences would put the child in danger or scare them.

, Young children have short attention spans and limited vocabularies. Avoid using big words or long sentences. Be clear and brief when you make a specific request.Find a single word or phrase that you can use to remind the child what you’ve asked. For example, if you’ve asked them to pick up their toys and they haven’t, you can just say, “toys.”
Use words they can understand. For example, instead of saying, “It’s your responsibility to brush your teeth in the evening,” just say, “You need to brush your teeth at bedtime.”

, Children will model their behavior on what they see from the adults in their lives. If you make promises you don’t keep, or don’t show up when you say you will, children learn that this is acceptable.If you promise a child a reward or something they’re looking forward to, be sure to follow through.
Don’t assume children will forget promises you’ve made. Something that might seem small to you can be a big deal to them. For example, if you said, “we can go see that movie when it comes out next month,” the child may remember that and be very much looking forward to it, even if it’s unimportant to you.
Stick to your new system of communication and discipline. This will show the child that even if you treated them differently before, the new rules are here to stay. It may take a while for them to get on board, but stick with it.

, It’s not fair to surprise a child by saying, “this room needs to be clean in five minutes.” Give the child time to understand the expectations, and to adjust their behavior.Very young children might not be able to fully understand units of time (such as, “in an hour” or tomorrow). However, you can still use these to make your expectations clear and help them learn. For example, you can say, “I need you to clean your room sometime today so that we can go to the park tomorrow,” or, “School starts in an hour, so you don’t have enough time to watch TV.”
If there are going to be negative consequences, the child definitely needs enough time to feel like they had a fair chance. For example, you can say, “You have half an hour to get dressed, or you won’t be able to play with the hamster before school.” Half an hour is plenty of time for a child to get dressed, even if they take a few minutes to hem and haw about it.

, Empty threats are one of the fastest ways to get a child to ignore your authority. If you state that there will be consequences for actions (whether positive or negative) be honest and follow through.It may be tempting to exaggerate or even lie sometimes, by saying things like, “Your face is going to freeze like that,” or, “Sugar will make your teeth fall out,” or, “If you’re not ready to go, I’m going to leave without you.” However, avoid doing this.
You can explain the actual consequences of actions, which are still substantial. For example, you can say, “Making faces like that around other people isn’t polite,” or, “Eating a lot of sugar isn’t healthy or good for your teeth,” or, “If you aren’t ready, we’re going to be late, and will miss part of the party.”
If you promise to reward good behavior, do it. Otherwise, the child will learn that their efforts won’t be acknowledged.

, Especially if you’re dealing with your own child, it can be painful to watch them feel upset or uncomfortable. The child might express frustration, or might make you feel guilty or bad for their suffering. However, if you’re using your best judgement and doing what is best for the child, maintain your position and accept that learning to accept discomfort is part of their maturing.If the child throws a tantrum or says things like, “I hate you,” or, “You’re a bad mom/dad/babysitter,” remain calm. Let them get these things out of their system and eventually calm down. You can talk to them about their unkind words later.
The child may express extreme discomfort when they’re not allowed to play with a certain toy, see a certain movie, or stay up extra late. However, remember that they will live through this, and will learn the important lesson of restraint and consequences. The limits you’ve set are healthy for them, not harmful.

, If a child listens the first time, or demonstrates good behavior, praise them. It’s also good to reward good behavior when you can. The reward may be something you had already promised, or it can be a surprise.If you didn’t promise a reward, a surprise reward can be very instructive to the child. For example, you can say, “Wow, since you cleaned your room so fast, we have some extra time. Do you want to go play in the park or get an ice cream down the street?”
Praise from an adult they respect can be a great reward for a child. You can say things like, “Thank you so much for doing your chores! You listened so well, and you did a great job. Your room is so clean, it’s amazing!”

, It’s always easier to listen to someone when they listen to you. No matter what you think about why the child is behaving a certain way, listen to them. You’ll likely learn about how they’re feeling and how to change this behavior in the future.Ask the child questions to help them articulate their feelings. You can say things like, “Did you think that was unfair?” or, “What did you want to do instead?”
Avoid getting into an argument with the child. Even if you disagree with them or think their feelings are irrational, remember that they’re a child. Let them express themselves before you explain your reasoning or justify your stance.

, Children will feel heard if you can say to them what you’ve heard about how they feel. Children might not know why they feel certain things, but if you can articulate something, their feelings may be validated and they’ll trust that you care about them..If a child says something like, “I wanted to play with the dinosaur but you took it away before I was done!” you can translate that into feelings and say something like, “It sounds like you felt like it was unfair that you couldn’t play with the dinosaur for as long as you wanted. It sounds like you’re really upset about that.”
If the child is upset and says hurtful things like, “I hate you”, or “Go away,” you can say something calm like, “It sounds like you’re really mad at me right now. When you calm down a little, I’d like to know more about why you’re so mad.”

, Children might not be able to understand (or agree with) all of your reasoning. However, when you explain things to them, it shows that you are interested in engaging with them, rather than simply making rules without their understanding.It’s okay if a child doesn’t agree with, or understand your reasoning. For example, if you say, “I need the livingroom to be clean,” and the child doesn’t see why, you can simply say, “Because it’s important to me. I like to have a clean house.” That is explanation enough.
Avoid going into extended lectures. If a child asks what it means that sugar is unhealthy, you can offer some age-appropriate explanation, such as, “Sugar doesn’t actually contain the kinds of vitamins and minerals that give us energy. And it can actually make you sleepy after you eat a lot of it.”

, Do this without assigning blame or expressing judgement. Simply state, in a calm tone, what you’re observing. You can also reference a request you made previously.Keep it simple. Instead of saying, “You left your clothes on the floor. I told you not to do that,” say, “I see clothes on the floor. Clothes need to go in the hamper.”

, When children feel that they’re always being told, “no,” they’re likely to become less agreeable. If there are times when you could negotiate instead of saying, “no,” try to find them.Be creative and talk it out. For example, if you’ve told the child they can’t play ball in the house, but they’re upset about that, find out what they really want. Is it that they just want to play ball? Or do they want to play in the house? Once you know, you can say something like, “Okay, when I’m done with work, we can go outside and play ball together,” or, “If you want to play in the house, I can play an indoor game with you when I’m done with work.”
Some things might be okay at another time. For example, you can say, “You can’t play video games today, because it’s a school day. But on Saturday, you can use the computer for video games.”

Give the child templates for apologies.,
Apologize with them.,
Encourage sincere apologies.,
Correct the bad behavior.",How to Get Your Child to Apologize2," Your child may not realize the correct way to apologize. Instruct the child by giving them specific templates that they can use to apologize to other people.


You might teach the child to say “I’m sorry that I did what I did.” For example, they might say, “I’m sorry that I didn’t eat my dinner” or “I’m sorry that I yelled at you.”Another good template is to say, “It was wrong to do what I did. Next time I will not do that.” For example, the child might say, “It was wrong to kick your seat. Next time, I will sit still in the car.”If the child tries to say something like, “I’m sorry, but the other kid deserved it,” ask them to try again. This time, they should not defend their actions. Instead, encourage them to state what they will do better next time.

, If the child is young, you might tell them that you will apologize with them. Visit the offended party, and together, say you’re sorry. If the child is apologizing to you, you might offer to say sorry to them back.You can model apologies in the following ways:


You can say, ""How about I go apologize with you? We can do it together.""
If the child is apologizing to you, you might state, ""How about I go first? I'm sorry that I yelled at you.""

, Some children may learn to apologize within seconds of doing something wrong to avoid getting in trouble. It is important that the child learns to apologize when they sincerely feel bad about a situation. To do this, try not to demand apologies from children over the age of five.


If you suspect the child is being insincere, you might ask, “Do you really mean that?”
If you think that the child is just saying sorry to get out of trouble, you might encourage them to demonstrate their remorse. For example, they might clear the table for you that night or write a nice note.

, Apologizing by itself does not mean that the child will stop misbehaving. It is important that you also discipline them appropriately for bad behavior so that they will not repeat their actions.Time-out is an effective disciplinary action. Make them sit in a quiet area or room, and leave them there for one minute per year of age.
You may need to remove certain privileges to discipline the children. Try taking away television or video games for a day."
"
Admit when you are wrong.,
Stay calm.,
Forgive the child when they apologize.,
Remain neutral during sibling conflicts.",How to Get Your Child to Apologize3," If your children see you apologize, they will be more likely to follow your example. When you are wrong, do not be afraid to say that you are sorry.Apologizing to your children will not undermine your authority, and it may encourage them to apologize to you. You might say, “I’m really sorry that I got mad at you when you didn’t do anything.”
If your child sees you argue with other adults, you should apologize to the other person. This will show your child that everyone should always apologize, even if they are a grown-up.

, If you react angrily to other people, your child will learn to react with anger too. If your child or somebody else makes you mad, try to remain calm. Speak in a firm but even voice, and avoid yelling or screaming.Try breathing deeply and counting to ten to calm yourself down.
Squeezing a stress ball during tense situations can help you keep your cool.
If you need to, excuse yourself to a separate room, such as a bathroom. Give yourself a minute to relax in front of the mirror.

, The child will need to know that their apologies do work. If the child apologizes, tell them that you forgive them. Thank them for the apology as well. This will show them how to react when others apologize to them.You might say, “That means a lot to me. Thank for you for apologizing. I forgive you.”

, If you take sides during sibling conflict, the child may be more reluctant to apologize. Instead, insist that both children apologize to each other. You may want to give them each some time alone before attempting the apology.You can say, “I know you both think that you were wronged, but I think you both owe each other an apology.”

Implement a token economy, if your daughter is preschool-elementary school aged.,
Help and encourage her.,
Praise her often.",How to Get Your Daughter to Do What You Ask1," This involves awarding her a small token, like a gold star, for specified behaviors. Upon collecting a specified number of tokens, she can trade them in for a larger prize, like a toy or special dessert.For example, if you want your daughter to complete her chores regularly, create a list of chores you want her to do, and put a star on it each time she completes one. Once she has earned a specified number of stars, say ten, she can trade them in for a new toy.;
, Recognize the difference between what your child can do on her own and what she can do with your help and encouragement.If you want her to start doing her own laundry, first have her do the laundry with you. After doing this a few times, she should be able to complete the task on her own.


A more knowledgeable other is required to help her develop new skills. If you are not skilled at the task yourself, you might consider enlisting a tutor. In this case a tutor is any person skilled at the task and not necessarily paid homework help.

, Praise is a powerful motivator for good behavior. No matter what age your daughter is, she will appreciate it when you acknowledge her efforts. Offering more praise than criticism will keep your daughter feeling positive and encourage her to keep up the good work.


When your daughter completes a task, tell her thank you and praise her for a job well done.
Even if your daughter's behavior has room for improvement, look for reasons to praise her and focus on those.

Ask her nicely to do what you want, and show gratitude when she does it.,
Negotiate with her.,
Trigger her empathy.",How to Get Your Daughter to Do What You Ask2," Parents often forget kids need to feel appreciated too. You probably don't enjoy doing things for your daughter when you feel like she doesn't appreciate your efforts. She probably feels the same way. Instead of demanding she do what you want, ask her to please help you. When she does it, be sure to sincerely thank her.


Showing gratitude towards your daughter will also increase her gratitude for all you do, so this is a great habit to develop., Negotiating may feel counterintuitive to if you have an authoritarian parenting style, but it is actually beneficial to children, especially adolescents. Negotiating models respect and trust, helps develop critical thinking skills and fosters responsible behavior.Before you enter into negotiations with your daughter, identify possible acceptable behaviors and negotiate to achieve compromise.


For example, say your daughter wants to stay out an hour past curfew. A compromise might be that she can stay out, but she must be at a designated friends house with parents home, and she must check in, at a certain time.
For negotiation to be effective over time, it is crucial that both of you adhere to the terms of the agreement. If she agreed to bring her GPA up to a 3.0 to receive a a concert trip, you must follow through. Failure to follow through will diminish your standing in future negotiations.

, Share your feelings with your daughter to help her understand why it's important to you that she do what you want. Explain to her that you are overwhelmed and need help or that you are frustrated by her behavior. When she understands how her behavior is making you feel, she will be more likely to change it.


If she doesn't seem to be moved by your explanation of your feelings or show of emotion, ask her to put herself in your shoes and explain how she would feel in the situation. This will help her to feel what you feel."
"
Set limits and offer choices.,
Put her in timeout.,
Ground her if she is an older child.,
Always punish reasonably.",How to Get Your Daughter to Do What You Ask3," Instead of ""laying down the law"" in order to have your child do what you want, it's better to set a limitation and offer a set of choices.In this way you acknowledge that your daughter has feelings about the matter and allow her to have some control over the situation.


For example, let's say your daughter acted out by scribbling with marker on the wall. Tell her that you see that she is angry, but the wall is not an appropriate place to scribble. Offer her the choice of coloring on paper or another acceptable surface.This strategy also works for older children. Let's say your daughter wants to go on an overnight trip out of town with her friends, but you think she is too young. Acknowledge her disappointment about the trip and tell her it's not appropriate for someone her age. Give her other other options instead, such as going on a day trip or staying the night at a closer location., This tends to work best for young children. When your daughter performs the behavior you want to stop, explain what she did wrong and send her to a designated area where she cannot play. In order for this to be effective, you should clearly explain what the child did, lay out the consequence, and tell her should happen in the future instead.


A good rule for putting children in timeout is one minute for each year. So if your daughter is 3 years old, she probably only needs a 3 minute timeout. This may seem an insignificant amount of time to you as an adult, but much beyond this and she will no longer realize she is being punished. Small children are easily distracted and move on quickly., Grounding school age kids from video games or television is often effective. Adolescents tend to respond to restricted participation in social activities and limiting internet and phone access. In this case it is also important to clearly explain to your daughter what she did wrong, name the consequence, and explain what should happen in the future instead.


You might consider grounding her and offering her to restore the privilege as soon as she has done what you want.

, Punishments must be age appropriate and relative to the offense in severity. Punishing too severely likely will backfire.


Very young children have very limited attention spans and may no longer make the connection between the punishment and the offense after just a few minutes.
Stripping teens of all privileges, especially for periods longer than a couple of weeks may leave you without leverage. If the teen has nothing left to lose, there's no incentive to following the rules.

Give your child a heads-up.,
Play up the benefits of the destination.,
Provide a choice.,
Make a ritual.,
Keep fun items in the car.,
Bring snacks, if appropriate.,
Offer them fun music or a movie.,
Distract your child from the power struggle.,
Consider a rewards system.,
Wait it out, if it will help.",How to Get a Child to Sit in a Car Seat," At least five minutes before your car trip, warn the child about where you'll be going, and let them know that means getting in the car seat.;
, If the journey isn't going to be fun, focus on the fun of the destination. If you're heading to the playground, this part is easy. If you're running errands or going somewhere else your child won't prefer, focus on any small enjoyable aspects of the trip like riding in the shopping cart or getting a lollipop at the doctor's office.

, Getting in the car seat may be necessary, but you can still provide a choice about how. For children who can talk and make choices, tell them: ""Do you want me to lift you in, or do you want to climb in yourself?"" or ""Do you want Mommy or Daddy to put you in?"" Giving them some control about the situation will make them feel more comfortable and help avoid a power struggle.

, To keep things light and fun, make a ritual or game out of getting in the car. For example, pretend to be an astronaut and do a ""safety check"" before counting down to ""lift off,"" or start a race for who can get in their seat first.

, Let your child play with some preferred toys or books while in the car seat. You can bring along the child's latest favorites, or you can keep some special ""car seat only"" toys and books for enjoyment only after buckling. If you're comfortable with it, you can also offer your smartphone or tablet for games.

, While you probably don't want to use snacks as a bribe, do bring along some snacks or drinks for longer car rides. Making car rides enjoyable (and avoiding thirst and hunger) will go a long way towards making sure children are compliant next time they have to buckle up.

, If your car has the option, remind your child of the fun music or videos that he or she can enjoy on the trip. Make it fun: sing along, laugh at the video, enjoy the ride.

, If your child starts to have a tantrum, do anything you can to break the pattern early on. Make a funny face, sing a silly song, do a dance, or show your child something really ""cool"" inside the car. Distraction can prevent a full meltdown, especially if the child is really just a bit tired or grumpy and needs livening up.

, If car seat tantrums are a common occurrence, you may want to implement a star chart or sticker chart system so that your child can earn a reward every time they buckle up without making a fuss. After a certain number of rewards, the child can earn a prize, treat, or special outing.

, Every child is different, but if yours tends to enter a power struggle but then get bored, just wait. Make it clear that you can't go anywhere or do anything fun until the child buckles up.

Get out of the aisle that has the item your child wants.,
Calm your child down if they are crying.",How to Get Kids to Behave in the Supermarket," Wherever you're going, it helps children to know how they're expected to behave, especially in public. Set some ground rules that you hold them to always, including at the supermarket. Be understanding and reasonably flexible, but don't allow bad behavior to become an exception or habit.;
, Tell them that you will be going on a trip to the supermarket, and you expect them to be on their best behavior.

, This is important too, because the child shouldn't have to be surprised an hour later when you say: ""It's time to go to the supermarket!"" If you can, inform them the day before so they'll know about it well in advance.


Since young children don't have a great sense of time, make sure you give them both a warning early in the day and a five or ten minute heads-up before it's time to leave. That way, they won't be surprised in the middle of something they were doing and won't unexpectedly have to interrupt a game, TV show, or other activity.

, Tell them that they need to be on their best behavior and reiterate any ground rules, like ""Ask before taking any items off the shelf"" and ""Speak without shouting.""

, It's okay if they are a few feet in front of you where you can still see them, but they shouldn't be in the next aisle over running around. If they get too far ahead of you, tell them: ""___(your child's name), come back here please!"" If they do not come back, catch up to them, and hold their hand.

, Keeping them busy with jobs to do is the best way to engage your child and prevent bad behavior. You can allow them to grab things that are on your list and put them in the cart for you.

, Realize that if you sometimes do buy your children snacks or treats at the market, they may want them next time, too. It's perfectly okay for them to request something (after all, they're unlikely to be able to buy it themselves). But if you feel like the requests are constant/unreasonable, or if they don't accept it when you say no, then set some rules. Maybe they can have one small treat once a week, or maybe they can only have a treat when they've earned it as a reward. Whatever rules you set are fine, but just stay consistent with them.

, Tell your child ""I'm sorry, we can't get that today."" Your child may be upset, but if you're consistent to the expectations you've already set, they'll learn that you mean what you say.

, If you still need an item that is in this aisle, grab it and then leave the aisle. This will eliminate the distraction of the item, and help them move on to the next task without prolonging their frustration.

, Acknowledge that they are upset, but tell them that they need to calm down. Speak in a low tone of voice. Let them know that it's okay to be upset; tell them you'd be upset, too, but that they can't throw a tantrum in public. Work on ways to handle tantrums if this becomes a problem.

Store art materials out of reach when they're not in use.,
Emphasize that all artwork is done on paper (or other approved medium) not on other things.,
Provide other outlets for creativity, as long as your child is old enough to distinguish between places where artwork is encouraged and places where artwork is not allowed.,
Make a wall just for drawing on.,
Teach the toddler to write on paper.

",How to Get a Toddler to Stop Writing on Walls," When they are in use, provide appropriate surfaces for drawing, and supervise. This is as much for the child's safety as for your walls.


A plastic tablecloth makes a good drop cloth (whether on the table or the floor), especially for messier art projects, such as painting.;
, Use short, direct language. When art work goes wandering, redirect the toddler. If the child persists, take away the materials immediately.

,

If weather is mild, have the toddler explore chalk art on the pavement or sidewalk outdoors. Funneling this creative energy outside can prevent it inside.






In snowy weather, build snow structures outside and paint with water and food coloring or watercolor paint.
Purchase bath paint or crayons, which can be used at bath time. It allows the child to draw on walls, and make bath time more fun.

,


Decide which wall is going to be approved for your toddler to write on. Measure this space's width, and about a foot over your toddler's head.
Take two to four pieces of large, white poster board, overlap them, and tape them together on the back side, so the finished piece will be about 2 inches (5.1 cm) short of what you measured.
Center the new piece on the wall of choice. Tape the poster board onto the wall, using the 2"" wide blue painters tape, (get at any hardware store). The tape should cover 1"" of poster board all the way around, and right up to the edge of door frame, or corner. The blue tape won't take the paint off when you take it down.
Cover the poster board with a layer of butcher paper or other large paper, if you prefer. This will make it easier to replace when it gets filled up.
Explain this is the wall they can write on, and not to write on or outside the tape. If they write on any other wall, they will be disciplined.
As the pieces get filled, you can now save your toddler's fine art work. (This can also be fun to use as wrapping paper, especially for gifts for grandparents!)

Give your child your full attention.,
Listen to others.,
Show regular interest.",How to Get Stubborn Kids to Listen1," It is important to model good listening behavior for your children by listening politely to them when they are talking, just as you would when speaking with an adult. Show your child what active listening looks like by giving them your full attention and acknowledging their requests. When your child comes to you, stop what you are doing, look them in the eyes, and acknowledge their feelings or perspective.If, for example, you are trying to get your child to try a new food, let them know that you understand what they are saying. Tell them, “I understand you think it will taste bad.”
The more engaged you become in the conversation with your child, the more likely your child is to mirror you and become engaged, themselves.
Allow your child to see you and know that you are fully interested in them and what they may be doing. Turn off any electronics (television, phones, radio, etc.) that might distract you. Also, put down the book or newspaper if your child wants to talk.
Allow for privacy between you and your child. Unless absolutely necessary, other people do not need to be involved in a conversation between you and your child. This is especially important if your child chooses to disclose something they find personal or upsetting. They came to you in trust. Honor that trust and allow for privacy.
Bring yourself down to your child's eye level when you are speaking with them. Don't tower over them and look down on them.;
, Whether you mean to or not, you may be showing your child that it’s alright to be stubborn when you talk to others. Practice listening to and compromising with others when your child is around. Give your conversation partner the same attention and positive attitude that you would want from your child.Show your child how to acknowledge others when they are speaking by looking them in the eyes and not interrupting them.
Demonstrate further acknowledgement by showing that you understand what they are saying. Try letting your conversation partner know, ""I understand you feel sad because...""
If there is a serious matter that you need to discuss that may not warrant a positive attitude or compromise, try to not have the conversation in front of your child if possible.

, Show your child good daily listening skills by taking time each day to show interest in what they are doing. Sit down with them, ask them questions, and offer your company or assistance to show them what it is to actively hear someone.If, for example, your child is playing with their toys, ask them, “What are you playing?” and “Can I play with you?”
Practice this every day to show your child how to build a connection with others.

,


Some people choose to tape only the ceremony, while others extend taping to the reception and pre-wedding events, such as the rehearsal dinner and engagement party.
Some video professionals will approach guests for on-camera interviews, asking them about their favorite memory of the couple or for marriage advice.

,, Better yet, ask someone who is already helping you with the wedding, such as the photographer or caterer.

Discuss your budget and ask about any extra fees for services in addition to taping your big day, such as extra DVD copies.

, While some prefer raw video, you may choose to edit the footage at a later date to create a finished product. Be aware that a professional video can take months to produce.

, Make sure it spells out how you should pay and the total amount due, any deposit required, cancellation policies, precisely what events the videographer will tape, how many hours the videographer will tape, and how many cameras the service will operate.

Keep things short.,
Give your child options.,
Present them with facts.,
Create games.,
Create incentives.,
Provide positive reinforcement.",How to Get Stubborn Kids to Listen2," If your child doesn’t immediately listen, it may be tempting to lecture them about what they should be doing and why it’s important. However, your child will simply tune out long lectures. If your child doesn’t listen the first time, give them a short, firm reminder of what you expect.For example, if you asked your child to put something away and they have not, simply remind them “Toys still need to be put in the toy box.”

, Forcing consequences on your child likely only makes them more resilient to what you ask. Instead, allow them to choose the outcome for themselves by presenting them with the choice between positive and negative consequences.If your child refuses to get ready for school, give them an option such as, “You can get get ready for school and enjoy your video games when you get home, or you can stay at home with no games or TV all day.”
Create incentives for your child to make the proper choice, and allow them to choose whether they want to comply or accept the consequences.

, When you give your child a command, you give them something to resist. Change your request from a command to a fact and let your child know what action should be taken to accommodate that fact.If it is your child’s chore to feed the cat, for example, don’t tell them “Go feed the cat now.” Instead, let them know, “The cat needs to be fed. It looks hungry.”

, If your child is resisting certain activities such as cleaning their room or doing their homework, you can try to create a game to motivate them. For example, you might create a beat-the-timer game to get your child to pick up their room.Reward your child for their participation in the game. This may be anything from a special treat to simply clapping and cheering on your child when they finish.

, Help motivate your child to listen by providing them with rewards or incentives for completing certain tasks. Think about those issues your child does not want to budge on, and create a rewards program to get them to participate.


If, for example, your child lags while putting their shoes on in the morning, you can provide an incentive such as letting them pick the music in the car that morning if their shoes are on before you have to ask.
Rewards can be anything that you think your child would enjoy, from a small treat to a special privilege. You can even work out a program where if your child does certain things a certain number of times, they get a special trip like to the zoo or the beach.

, Providing positive reinforcement is important for all kinds of kids, but it may be especially helpful for a stubborn child. Give your child affection such as with a hug, high five, or kiss on the cheek when they do a good job. Even smiling, winking, or nodding in your child’s direction can send some positive reinforcement their way. You can also try saying something like:

“Great Job!! I like the way you threw the ball”
“I see that you finished your homework. You are doing very good at staying on top of your schoolwork.”
“You showed a lot of responsibility when you helped your sister clean up her toys.”
“I see what a hard worker you've been, and I appreciate the way you always help me clear off the table after dinner.”

Keep calm.,
Minimize “no.” “No” is a powerful and important word in a parent’s vocabulary, but it’s most impactful when it is said sparingly.,
Finish the conversation.,
Use only compassionate and loving communication.",How to Get Stubborn Kids to Listen3," When your child is being stubborn, they may be testing you to see what they can get away with, and a screaming match reinforces that they have some control in those situations. Instead of fighting, try to stay calm and focus on making the goal happen, rather than showing your kid why they are wrong.If your kid won’t get dressed, for example, put your effort into getting them in their clothes rather than fighting with them. Lay their clothes out and offer to help them put them on.
Once the task is completed, you can work with your child to come up with ideas to help them get ready on time and/or express consequences as fits your parenting style.

, Try to minimize “no” in daily life and instead offer explanations or alternatives. This way, when you offer a strong or firm “No!” in critical situations, it holds its impact.If, for example, your child regularly asks to play games when they should be studying, let them know, “We can play after you finish your homework,” instead of simply saying “No.”
Reserve “no” for situations such as when your child starts verbally or physically fighting or practicing other disruptive or harmful behavior. Then, offer it as a stern command.

, If your child continues to try to push you and other methods of engagement have not worked, close the conversation. Let your child know, “This is not negotiable. I will not talk about this anymore.”Use a strong tone when communicating this message to your child so that they understand you mean what you say.
Stick to your message. Once you say you will not discuss something anymore, do not start to fight with your child about it. If they throw a tantrum, ignore them or work with them in accordance with your parenting style, but do not discuss the issue any further.
Don’t put your child on the spot. If there are any extended family and friends around, don't embarrass your child by putting him/her on the spot in front of others. This can potentially lead to a dysfunctional relationship with much resentment and hostility.
If it has been a long day, and your children have been very trying, and you feel you are at your wits end with anger, don't attempt communication at all until you are able to regain your composure. It is nearly impossible for anyone to respond in an appropriate and objective manner until then. It is acceptable to revisit the conversation later when you are not so upset.

, It is important to communicate with your children in a positive manner, and to model this type of communication to them. Always communicate with your children and with other people from a space of love and compassion.

Do not use negative words that will devalue your child's sense of self-worth or importance. For example, never tell your child they are stupid, dumb, or lazy. Don't even use these types of words in phrases that aren't targeted towards your kids.
For example, don’t say, ""Why did you do that? That is just stupid."" Never allow them to hear you say things like this to other people either.

, It is normal for the grooms family to bestow 8 gifts upon the brides family. these gifts can consists of almost anything. In return, the bride family also gifts the groom. Sometimes, a bride price is paid. This is money in a red envelope. The brides family also give her a 'dowry', which is a piece of land or amount of money for her to take into the marriage.

, For the Chinese people, it's very important to pick the right day for their wedding, or it might fail. They often go to a temple to see a monk.

Create and write down rules of behavior.,
Have clear routines for kids.,
Keep the instructions simple for kids to understand.,
Avoid giving orders from across a room.",How to Get Kids to Listen Without Repeating Yourself1," Kids are more likely to follow directions when there are clear rules that have been written down and discussed beforehand. Make a point to create house rules that help to guide your kids. This way, when they aren't listening, you can refer back to the rules already set in place.Consider posting on a whiteboard in a family room, kitchen, or open area of the house about rules. Be sure to do this from the time that your children are young. This will make it easier to reinforce the rules as they get older.
Make it clear about expectations to follow directions and instructions without having to repeat yourself multiple times. Consider rules like, ""After repeating the order three times, a parent will take action to set consequences such as time-out or taking away certain privileges."" Keep in mind that while staying strict to the rules and remembering them is important for organizing your household, and possibly the safety of children in particular situations, sometimes being too strict can have a reverse effect.
Try incorporating some positive rewards for your child as they get older to help motivate them, such as one hour to play their favorite video game or letting them pick out a movie to rent or buy.;
, Get your kids into a habit of following routines about playing with toys, cleaning, and personal hygiene. The more consistency that a child feels in their daily routines and how you will likely respond, the better they can understand what the expectations are.For example, if your child continues to forget brushing his teeth before bed, try to get the kid to repeat back what the expectations are for a bedtime routine. Ask them, ""What else do you need to do before getting ready for bed? Let's review your schedule.""
If you are strict sometimes and very lax in others, kids may become confused about expectations of what they need to do and when. Focus on consistency throughout.

, While you may want to give your kid a lecture or lots of details about why or how do something, kids need simplified instructions that are clear and concise in your expectations. Avoid giving too much or too little information that could just confuse your child.Hone in on the non-negotiables of the situation. Make it clear that if your child wants to argue back, that there are certain things that are set rules and expectations.
If you want your kid to put away their toys before bath time, make it clear and simple about what to do. For example, ""Before bath time, you need to put away your toys in the toy bin. If the toys are left out after I've asked you to put them away, I will limit access to them for a week."" For these types of punishments, make sure that you limit the time of the punishing action to match the age of your child. For example, a child who is four years old could have a time out for four minutes, while a child who is 10 could have a time out in their room for 10 minutes.
Ask your kid a question as part of your directive. This requires them to respond. Based on how they answer, you can better see if they are listening and if your instructions are clear. You may also want to have your child model this in front you to ensure that they understand.

, When you are giving orders to your child to stop what they're doing and do something else instead, don't yell orders from across the room or hall. Engage them by talking in front of them directly. This will make the request more meaningful and clear to a child. Maintain eye contact when giving orders. This can help you to understand if your child is paying attention the first place. If the child is small, then kneel down so that you can talk to them at their eye level.
You are more likely to have to repeat yourself if you are not present and engaged directly with your child. While it may take more effort to walk over to them and put down what you're doing, this will help to increase the effectiveness and communication in the long run.

Reward kids with positive feedback for following instructions.",How to Get Kids to Listen Without Repeating Yourself2," Kids may not understand your frustration about repeating yourself multiple times. However, keep in mind that for younger kids, repetition may be necessary to help them understand what you are saying. They may not know that this is part of what makes you irritated or annoyed with their behavior. Be calm and direct about how repeating yourself makes you feel.Sit down and talk with them about this specific expectation that you don't want to repeat yourself more than once. Ask them to repeat back what you said and the expectations so that it is clearer that they are listening.
Get them to understand your perspective that when you want or need something, it can be upsetting when it is not done. Ask them about their perspective on what you said.

, By making clear that there are consequences to their failure to listen the first time, you'll be able to better take action when they continue to ignore your requests. Be clear and consistent with the consequences, and make sure that they fit appropriately.Don't let your anger or frustration impact when or how you set consequences. Make them fair and understandable to kids.
For example, if it's time for them to get ready for bed, and they are still up watching TV. Make it clear that after you have repeated the request for them to get ready for bed twice, they will lose TV privileges for the rest of the week if they don't follow your orders.
Make sure to stick to this consequences and talk with your spouse or other children to make sure that the consequences are followed. Have a conversation with your partner about raising your kids and setting rules and expectations for them. This will help to ensure that you are both on the same page.

, When kids do follow instructions and orders, make them feel validated and reassured. Give them a clear sense that this is the expected behavior and response. Consider the following ways to reward them:Give positive feedback with words, such as ""Great job!"" or ""Thank you for doing what I asked! You are very good at following directions.""
Give them a hug and say, ""Thank you.""
Avoid using rewards that don't match the situation. For example, putting away toys before bed might not merit a trip to the ice cream shop, but you might reward this behavior with a bedtime story instead.

"
"
Avoid taking their behavior personally.,
Stop shouting to get your point across.,
Take a step back if you are upset.,
Be warm but firm in your tone.",How to Get Kids to Listen Without Repeating Yourself3," Children have not yet fully developed the same skills as adults. It may take them more time to learn and make decisions about what was asked of them. If your child doesn't immediately respond, don't immediately react as if it's an affront to you or your instructions. Understand that inappropriate or disrespectful behavior by your kids isn't about you. It's about them.
Focus your energy on what behaviors you'd like to see changed, both in your kids and yourself. Avoid focusing on changing their emotions or attitude, and instead address their behaviors. Do your best to educate your children about reflecting on their emotions instead of immediately reacting to them. Teach them to identify how they are feeling and why before responding to their feelings.
For example, if you're asking them to put away toys, and you become more annoyed as you ask them repeatedly, they may have an outburst of anger. Focus more on the behavior of putting away toys, rather than the end result of an outburst. Giving attention to an outburst, even if it is negative attention, will only reinforce the outburst.

, Shouting and yelling will likely make your child and you feel frustrated and helpless. Usually yelling or shouting happens when you feel at wits end, so you are finally taking action and setting limits. Don't let yourself get to this point.Focus on boundaries and how to take action before you become upset and angry about the situation.
Understand the yelling or shouting will likely lead to the child pulling away further. They may be more focused on your anger than the instructions you gave in the first place.

, Kids can sometimes push parents' buttons. You may feel yourself getting upset. Learn to step away from the situation briefly if you feel that you're getting worked up. By giving yourself some breathing room, you'll likely be able to handle staying calm better.


Step away from the room if you're able and the child is safe while you're away for a few minutes. Find a quieter space where you can close your eyes and clear your head for 30 seconds.
Do a brief breathing exercise. Slowly inhale your breath. Hold it for a few seconds. Then slow exhale your breath. This can help to calm you and clear to head for a few minutes.
Return to talk with your child when you are less upset.

, Set a tone that makes it clear that you are calm but firm, so that your child doesn't assume they can get away with things. Showing warmth and understanding will more likely lead a child to obey your requests and instructions in the long term without resentment. Teach them for feel empowered in making their own decision. While you want to give the instructions with consequences, it's important that they feel it's their decision to make. This helps to teach them better skills of self-discipline over time.
Show warmth in your tone by stating things like, ""I can understand that you'd like to continue playing with those toys. How about we put them aside for now, and you can come back to them later? I know you're good at following directions."" Even a simple ""I'm very proud of you will suffice.""

Ask them how they want to be involved in the wedding.,
Encourage their participation, but don’t force it.,
Let them make decisions.,
Plan to include them in pictures.,
Let them invite friends.,
Let them help plan a special event.",How to Include Stepchildren in a Wedding1," Some kids love the spotlight and would enjoy being a part of as many aspects of the ceremony and reception as possible. Other kids may want to take supporting roles. Once you have decided on the basics of your ceremony and reception, sit the kids down and ask them what they might like to do.Tell them your basic ideas for the ceremony, and which parts of the ceremony you would like them to participate in. Be sure to explain traditional wedding roles (like the wedding party, ushers, or flower girls) if they aren’t aware of them.
You could say, “I would like all of the kids to play a part in the wedding ceremony in some way. What kind of things do you think you would like to do in our wedding?”
Get their ideas. Ask the kids for their ideas about things they could do at the ceremony or reception. Try to incorporate at least one suggestion from each child. For example, your children may have food preferences or want cupcakes instead of cake. You could choose to have a cupcake station at your reception instead of a traditional wedding cake.
If they are old enough, have them look at wedding websites for ways kids can be a part of a wedding.;
, Remember, they did not fall in love with your spouse-to-be, you did. They may not be as excited for the wedding as you are. Try to understand where they are coming from, and do not force them to do something they may not want to. It may build resentment and make you get off to a rough start with your new, blended family.Figure out what, if any, wedding activities you want your child or future stepchild to participate in, and let them know your expectations. If the child is unwilling to participate, talk to them and try to understand why.
You could say, “I understand that you’re still upset that your dad and I divorced, and you don’t want me marrying Michael. You don’t have to participate in the ceremony if you don’t want to, but I want you to be at the wedding handing out programs, and I want you to participate in the family dance at the reception.”

, Give the kids some power and delegate responsibility. Give them control over an aspect of the wedding you think they can handle and don’t mind delegating. For example, you could let them choose:


Themes. You could ask the kids to choose a symbol that represents your new family, that could be incorporated into your wedding invitations, centerpieces, or favors. Maybe all of you love to go fishing and camping, and you could create your wedding with an outdoor theme, for example.
Colors. You could also ask the kids to decide what colors will be a part of your wedding. If there are kids from both you and your spouse-to-be, you could let each side of the family choose one color. Use both colors in your wedding as a representation of your families coming together.
Ceremony programs. Older kids could design a program on the computer, or they could draw a picture to be used on the cover. Most children could help you fold or assemble them, as well.
The menu. Have your children help you select the kids’ menu at your reception. You could even take them along to your tasting to help you make decisions!
Favors. Involve them in creating the favors that guest will take home with them. Older kids may even be able to handle selecting the favors and assembling them with minimal supervision.
Their outfits. For example, you could let your stepdaughter-to-be select her flower girl dress (you could narrow down her choices to two or three) and shoes.

, If you are hiring a photographer to shoot your wedding, make sure they take lots of family portraits and have experience working with kids. It will help send the message to everyone that they are part of the family. You will also have lots of beautiful family photos from your special day.


Talk to the kids about any fun photos they would like to take on the wedding, and make sure the photographer tries to incorporate their suggestions.
If you are taking engagement pictures before the wedding, include some pictures with the kids as well.
If you have a budding photographer or videographer in your family, consider giving that child a camera to help document the wedding.

, If it’s feasible and within your budget, let your kids each invite a few close friends to the wedding. They will have a lot of fun with their friends, and it helps them celebrate their new family, as well as the two of you.Be clear of your expectations ahead of time. For example, you may want your family to sit together during dinner, and the kids may have other responsibilities during the ceremony or reception that will take away from time with their friends.

, Before or after the wedding, plan to do something special with your new spouse and kids to help everyone bond and relax. Get their input on a special activity or getaway.


For older kids, you could let them do some research. You could say, “We would like to do a weekend trip with all of the kids after the wedding. Here’s our budget. Could you help us by making a list of places we could go with that amount of money?”
For younger kids, you could say, “Next weekend we want to go somewhere special with our whole family. Where would you like to go, to the zoo or the children’s museum?”

Put your children in charge.,
Give them roles in the wedding.,
Perform a family unity ceremony.,
Make a vow.",How to Include Stepchildren in a Wedding2," Make each child responsible for some part of the ceremony. These could be larger responsibilities or smaller ones, depending on the age and ability of the child. If you are looking for roles for younger children, they may do well being assigned simple tasks to give people something. For example, you could make children responsible for:Having guests sign a guestbook or photo mat. (Consider having your guests sign a family portrait to have your children feel even more included!)
Handing out ceremony programs.
Handing out bubbles or birdseed as guests leave the ceremony.

, If your children agree, have them play a visible role in the wedding ceremony. You could have your children in some or all of the following roles, depending on their interest, age, and ability.

Kids could serve as ushers at the beginning and end of the ceremony.
Younger children could serve as a flower girl or ring bearer.
Older child could do a reading or poem during the ceremony.

, There are many different ways a new family could express their commitment to unity in a wedding ceremony. A ceremony, or ritual, can help children understand and see your family’s values expressed outwardly, which can deepen family ties.You could perform a unity candle ceremony. This could be done in several different ways. The couple could light the candle first and then light the children’s candles, or separate candles could be lit ahead of time, given to each person in the family to use to light one, bigger candle together as a family.Have your children bless your wedding rings in a “ring warming ceremony.” Children bestow their blessings on the rings (perhaps a prayer or wish could be read aloud by the officiant), then pass them to the couple to exchange them.A sand ceremony has each member of the family pour sand or soil into a container, then mix it all together to signify coming together and blending.After you exchange rings with your spouse, you could present the children with a token to acknowledge your commitment to the new family. Some families choose a family medallion that can be worn as a necklace. You can find some examples of family medallions online.
You could also design your own ritual that expresses your family’s values.

, Just as you will make vows of marriage to your spouse, make a vow of commitment and love to the children who will be entering into your family. This will help children know that you are as committed to loving and valuing them as you are their parent.After exchanging rings, a special verse can be included to let children know that you both are committed to their future as part of a combined family. It could be something simple stated in unison, such as “I am marrying my soulmate, and I am also extending my love and commitment to each of you as part of my family from this day forward.”
You can ask your children to join you, or you can address them from their seats. Make the call based on your children’s comfort level.

These tasks can help children feel important and included, as well as giving you one less thing to worry about!If you did not have a guestbook or picture at your ceremony, you could put one out to sign at your reception, and put a child in charge of it.
Have your children come up with a playlist of their favorite songs, or the family’s favorite songs, for the DJ. An older child could even play DJ for the night if you are having a more informal reception.
A child could be in charge of a gift table or helping guests find their place cards.
The whole family could participate in cutting the cake. Some families have added cake toppers for each member of their family!
Older kids could make a toast, give a speech, read a poem, or say a prayer before the meal.

Tell the bride you are struggling financially.,
Explain to the bride that your disposable income is spoken for.,
Blame your spouse!",How to Get Out of Being a Bridesmaid1," Especially if you’re a recent high-school or college graduate, unemployed, or have just started a new job, claiming you’re too cash-strapped to participate is a valid excuse. Being a bridesmaid is expensive! On average, a bridesmaid will spend at least $1,500 by the time the bride says “I do.”You can’t afford to purchase the dress. Bridesmaid’s dresses are not cheap and if the bride chooses especially high-end couture you may not even be able to afford the fabric. Bridesmaids typically pay $50 to $250-plus for their dresses.You can’t afford to join in on the bachelorette fun. If you suspect your friend's sendoff will be elaborate, be honest with her. ""Jenny, you will always remember your bachelorette party and you deserve one that's truly epic. I simply can't afford to pay hundreds of dollars on airfare, hotel, dining out, etc. I know how incredibly thoughtful you are, and I don't want you to be tempted skimp on the fun to accommodate my finances.""
Be prepared in case she offers to pay your way. The bride-to-be might offer to subsidize your bridesmaid expenses so you can participate. If you truly don’t want to be a bridesmaid, have a reply ready in case she offers. “You are such an amazing friend to offer to pay my way. I am so touched, but I would feel guilty accepting your incredibly generous offer. After your wedding, once I’m back on my feet financially, let’s plan a girl’s trip!”;
, Even if you have a good job (and the bride-to-be knows it), you may not want to spend your income on bridesmaid duties. There are valid reasons why you may not want to allocate your disposable income to bridesmaid expenses:


You are trying to pay off your student loans.
Your car is on its last legs and you need to buy a new one soon.
You are saving up the down payment to buy a home.
You, your child, or your pet needs to have an expensive medical procedure performed in the near future.

, Tell the bride-to-be that your husband is the breadwinner, and he’s stingy. If you’re married and your husband makes the money, he has a say in how it’s spent. He may not actually care if you spend money on bridesmaid duties, but he’ll probably be fine playing along with your ruse because it will save both of you money. You could say, “Jim has been feeling stressed out at work and he’s worried his job may be in jeopardy. He has been strongly encouraging me to save money right now.”

Explain to the bride-to-be that you’ve already committed to another wedding.,
Tell the bride-to-be that you have a nonrefundable trip planned for the weekend of her wedding.,
Tell the bride-to-be you must attend a mandatory work event on the weekend of her wedding.",How to Get Out of Being a Bridesmaid2," Being a bridesmaid is expensive and time consuming. No one would expect you to be in two bridal parties at the same time. . You could explain it like this, ""I am so sad I can't be in your wedding! Six months ago I committed to being Tracy's maid of honor. I am already swamped planning for that wedding. I would love to be in both wedding parties, but I think I would let both of you down.""Your friend’s wedding will take place on the same day as another wedding. You’ve already RSVP'd to attend another wedding – on the same day. Note: if you are using this excuse, you probably won't even be able to attend your friend's wedding.

, Hopefully, she will not expect you to forfeit the money you’ve already spent on nonrefundable plane tickets or nonrefundable hotel or Airbnb deposits. If she does expect that, do you really want to be in her wedding?

, You can say, ""Julie, you know how much I love you and that I would be in your wedding if I could. Unfortunately, my hands are tied. If I don't attend this conference, I could lose my job."" If an out-of-state conference for work really does fall on or near the date of the wedding in question, consider yourself lucky!

If you have a baby or small children (or older kids involved in activities you must drive them to and from), blame your inability to participate on your kids.,
Explain that you have an untrustworthy teenager.,
Claim that your controlling spouse will get jealous.,
Explain that you’re dealing with aging parents who need regular assistance.",How to Get Out of Being a Bridesmaid3," No one can fault a mom from putting her children first!


Small children are always a great excuse. Claim that you are not comfortable leaving your baby or toddler with a babysitter. The bride-to-be probably does not want crying children getting in the way of planning for her special day. You could say, “I’m practicing attachment parenting with Emma and she has never been away from me for any considerable length of time. If I accepted your invitation to be in your wedding, I would have to bring Emma with me to the shower, bachelorette party, etc. I think we both know that would be a disaster!”

, Teens are demanding, busy, and often prone to getting in trouble. Explain to the bride-to-be that you need to keep a very close eye on your teen and don’t trust him to be left alone for long periods. You could say, “Zach has been making very poor choices lately, and I’m afraid of what could happen if I left him unsupervised while I was attending planning meetings for your wedding.”

, If you husband is the type who expects to come home from work and find dinner waiting on the table, period, serving as a bridesmaid could upset the family dynamic. Hopefully the bride-to-be will not want her upcoming marriage to ruin your existing marriage. Say something like, “I’ve been walking on eggshells lately with Rick. He is acting very needy, and I feel like I need to devote most of my time to him.”

, If you have a parent with an illness or disability, or who is in the early stages of dementia, the bride-to-be should understand the stresses you’re facing. Tell your friend, “My parents are not doing well. I’m the only person they trust, and I can’t guarantee they won’t have a crisis on the day of your bridal shower or wedding.”

"
"
Confide in the bride-to-be that you’re envious of her engagement.,
Tell her you have a debilitating social phobia.If the idea of standing in front of a crowded church with hundreds of eyes staring at you makes you nervous, you won’t be an ideal bridesmaid.,
Insist that you’re not confident in your ability to do a good job.Many brides spend an exorbitant amount of money to ensure their wedding day is perfect.",How to Get Out of Being a Bridesmaid4," If you are not in a happy relationship, you might have trouble being enthusiastic about your friend’s upcoming wedding. Explain that you’re afraid you’ll be Debbie Downer during this special time in her life.


You’ve recently ended a long-term relationship.
You’ve discovered your boyfriend has cheated on you.
You are single and wish you were in a relationship.
You are unhappily married, separated, or recently divorced.

, The last thing she wants is for a bridesmaid to faint and steal her thunder.

, Bridesmaids should have the skills, motivation, and punctuality to serve as Queen B’s worker bees.


Are you always late?
Do you have trouble taking direction and following instructions?
Do you easily become overwhelmed?
Do you hate participating in groups or being part of teams?

"
"
Meet all party participants.,
Get to know the other bridesmaids or groomsmen.,
Don’t compete.,
Be on your best behavior.,
You’re not the boss.,
Talk to, but don’t make passes at other wedding party people.,
Keep in touch.",How to Get Your Wedding Party Properly Prepped to Talk," If you’re the bride, groom, or maid of honor, provide some icebreakers, perhaps even a quick game to get everyone acquainted and more at ease. All the wedding events will be uncomfortable if you don’t meet the other attendants. If you aren’t formally introduced, make it a point to introduce yourself and explain how you know the bride or groom. Try, “Hi, I’m Rick. Dave and I grew up together in Ohio.” Do your best to remember everyone’s names by making mental notes of where they’re from or what they do.;
, Chances are you’ll be spending a good amount of time with these individuals from showers to parties, so you’ll want to try to make as deep a connection as possible. Ask about their relationship with the bride and/or groom and get them to tell some personal stories. Try to draw similarities wherever possible. If you went to college in Boston and one of the other bridesmaids live in a Massachusetts suburb, talk about any overlapping experience.

, Everyone wants the engaged couple to feel loved and special in the events leading up to their wedding and on their big day, but don’t compete to be the best bridesmaid or greatest groomsman. The wedding party is just that…a party comprised of several individuals, so don’t compete for attention and try to speak to everyone equally. The idea is to be inclusive, not inconsiderate, of all the ladies and gents.

, Certain wedding events, say a bachelor party in Las Vegas, can quickly get out of hand. Shots may get the party started, but they also can lead to a bad end. Limit liquor so you can keep your cool and keep relationships intact before, during and after the wedding.

, At the end of the day, the bride and groom have the final say in their wedding and everything leading up to it. Just because you’ve been named an attendant, doesn’t mean you get to make executive decisions and boss people around. If you feel left out of decisions because another individual is taking too much control, speak up. Say, “Kathy is my friend too, and I’d really like to help with this project.” Or, “Ben mentioned he wanted us to pick up his tux by noon, so we should adhere to his request.”

, We all know that weddings and pre-wedding festivities are a common place to meet potential love interests. But keep the flirting frenzy to a minimum until after the wedding. That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t converse; it just means you should establish banter boundaries.

, After the wedding, stay in communication with your new friends by sending an email or pictures of all the events. Even though you might all live in different places, electronic communication can be a great way to continue building relationships with fellow wedding participants.

the Governor
mayors
court commissioners

, You can get married anywhere in Utah, since a marriage license is good throughout the state.The amount of planning will depend on how elaborate you want your wedding to be.

Consider why you want your relationship recognized.,
Consult with a lawyer.,
Meet the requirements for a common law marriage.,
Find evidence of consent.,
File appropriate documents with the court.,
Attend a hearing.",How to Get Married in Utah3," New couples can’t “get” a common law marriage. Instead, you can ask a judge to recognize an existing relationship as a marriage. It’s cheaper and faster for couples to just get married by applying for a license and having a solemnized ceremony. Nevertheless, there are some situations where seeking recognition of a common law marriage makes sense: You are separating and dividing property.
You want to bring a wrongful death action for the death of your spouse.
You want to claim insurance, retirement, survivor, or other benefits.
You want to inherit property.
Other reasons. Note that you don’t need a common law marriage in order to decide child custody or child support issues. Instead, you only need to establish the father’s paternity, which he can do voluntarily. Alternately, you might need to file a paternity suit.

, Only a lawyer can provide advice tailored to your circumstances. You should find a lawyer and schedule a consultation. Discuss whether you should seek a common law marriage or whether you should simply apply for a marriage license. If your partner has already died, then you should discuss opening a probate case with the attorney. This can be complicated, and you may want to hire the lawyer to represent you.


You can find a lawyer by asking friends or family for a referral. Ask anyone who has been divorced or dealt with a family law issue.
Visit the Utah State Bar’s attorney directory and search for a family law attorney. The bar directory is available at https://www.licensedlawyer.org/.
If you are low income, you can seek legal aid or use the state bar’s Modest Means Referral Program, which is available at https://www.utahbar.org/modest-means-lawyer-referral-program/.

, A judge won’t recognize a relationship as a common law marriage unless certain requirements are fulfilled. Make sure you satisfy the following:are of legal age and capable of consenting
could enter a solemnized marriage (e.g., you aren’t too closely related)
have lived as a couple
have treated each other as a couple
present yourself to the public as a couple so that others believe you are married

, You’ll need to show the judge that both parties consented to be married. You can use the following as evidence of consent:written agreement
testimony from witnesses that they observed an agreement
joint credit and bank accounts
joint purchase and ownership of property
filing tax returns jointly
using one partner’s last name, or having the children use the last name
speaking of yourself as married when talking to other people
declaring a relationship in a deed, will, or other document while living together

, You’ll need to file a Petition to Recognize a Relationship as a Marriage in the county where you live. If you are seeking recognition of your common law marriage at the same time as a divorce, then file in the county where you are divorcing.


You can find forms for filing this petition at the Utah Courts website: https://www.utcourts.gov/howto/marriage/commonlaw/.
You’ll need to serve papers on your partner unless you are both filing the petition together.
Both of you can also agree by stipulation that you are married. Complete the Stipulation to Enter Judgment and file it with the court.

, You may have to go into court after filing your petition or stipulation. Talk to your lawyer about what you can expect. Generally, the purpose of a hearing is to allow the judge to make findings of fact and decide whether a valid common law marriage has existed.Your hearing should be uneventful unless someone disputes that you were actually married. For example, your partner might want to avoid a common law marriage so that you can’t get any division of property.

Make a gift basket.,
Give them a framed wedding invitation or picture.,
Create a recipe book.",How to Give a Low Cost Wedding Gift1," Assembling a personalized gift basket for the couple is a practical, meaningful, and inexpensive gift. There are so many different types of baskets that you can make. Simply pick a theme and then fill a basket with items to reflect that theme. For example, you could help the couple stock up on household supplies by placing different cleaners, tea towels, glassware, recipes, and small items in a laundry basket. You could also fill a picnic basket with a blanket, plastic plates and glasses and a bottle of wine so that the couple can go on a summer date.Other options include stocking their pantry with a variety of food items. This is ideal if the couple is moving into a new home.
You could also create an at home date night. Fill a basket with items to make a pasta dinner, a dvd to watch later in the night, candles, chocolates and popcorn.
Be creative and personalize the basket to the interests and needs of each particular couple.;
, Some of the most memorable wedding gifts are those that are not found on the registry. If you are on a tight budget and can not afford to give an expensive gift, try for something thoughtful. One great idea is to give the couple a framed gift, such as a copy of the wedding invitation. Simply purchase a shadow box and place the invitation inside.You can decorate the shadow box with flowers, ribbons, bows, and a photograph of the couple on their wedding day. Try and match the colours to those used at the wedding.
You could also give them a framed map of their love story. Print out a map and cut heart shapes around the location of their first date, the location of where they got engaged, the location of their wedding, and the location of their current home., Cooking meals together as a couple is an excellent way to bond and enjoy a date night at home. Help the newlyweds gather some family-favourite recipes by creating an easy do-it-yourself recipe book. Ask family members from both families to share some of their favourite recipes with the happy couple. You can also add in a few of your own personal favourites as well as some recipes from close friends.Be sure to write the name of the person who shared the recipe on each recipe card.
Organize the recipes into family categories. For example, “Smith Family Recipes,” “Au Family Recipes,” “Recipes from Friends.”
You could also use a more traditional organizational structure such as, ""Starters,"" ""Sides,"" ""Mains,"" ""Soups and Salads,"" and ""Desserts.""

"
"
Give them monogrammed linens.,
Order a personalized item.,
Give a gift certificate for something the couple can enjoy together.,
Offer your assistance.",How to Give a Low Cost Wedding Gift2," Newlyweds are often in need of towels, pillow cases, and sheets. These items can be purchased for a relatively low cost at certain big box stores, such as Walmart or Target. In order to personalize these gifts, you can take them to a seamstress and have them monogrammed with the initials of the happy couple.This is a practical and inexpensive gift that the happy couple will enjoy for years to come.

, A great way to give a personalized and inexpensive wedding gift is by searching online craft sites, such as Etsy. Many artisans on Etsy will create personalized items, such as pictures, coasters, mugs, glassware, decorative boxes etc.


For example, you could give the bride and groom a framed picture with their names and wedding date written in a creative font.
Alternatively, you could get them a personalized decorative pillow for their bedroom with their initials and wedding date embroidered onto it.
The options are endless, so try and look for something that matches the style and interests of the couple.

, Most people will give money or items off the registry. You can stand out by giving a gift certificate to something that the couple can enjoy together. You get to decide the amount you want to give, and the gift card will feel more personalized than just giving cash. It demonstrates that you have thought about something the couple will use and enjoy during their marriage.For example, you could give them a one year membership to a local museum or gallery that they like.
Alternatively, you could give them a gift certificate to one of their favourite restaurants.
You could also give a gift certificate to a local hardware or home store to help them with any renovations they may want to make to their house.

, If you are really strapped for cash, you can offer your time and energy to help the couple. For example, you could offer to take on a few of the stressful wedding preparation tasks. Alternatively, you could offer to pet-sit or house-sit while they are on their honeymoon. When they return, you could have their fridge and pantry stocked with homemade food.


If you have a unique talent, such as photography or wedding planning, you could offer your services for free, in lieu of a wedding gift.

"
"
Purchase small items from the registry.,
Give a nice bottle of wine.,
Buy a big ticket item with a group of friends or family.",How to Give a Low Cost Wedding Gift3," Most couples will be registered. Although registry lists are typically dominated by big ticket items, there will be a few smaller, reasonably priced options. Buy a few of the more inexpensive items on the registry. You can then package them together in a gift basket, or have them delivered directly to the couple’s house.By buying off the registry, you ensure that you are giving them something they actually want.
Smaller items on registries are often overlooked by most guests, so this is a great option when attending a wedding on a budget.

, If the couple enjoys wine, you could give them a personalized wine gift set that includes a bottle of wine to share on their honeymoon, a bottle for their 1st anniversary, and a bottle for their 10th anniversary. This gift speaks to the longevity of marriage and will make the couple think of you as they celebrate years of happiness together. You should be able to purchase three nice bottles of wine for around $100.Go to your local wine shop and purchase three bottles of wine.
Talk with the wine expert and ask them to recommend wine. Make sure that two of the bottles will taste better with age. Explain that you need one bottle that can be opened in 10 years and still taste amazing.

, If you are unable to afford one of the big ticket items on the wedding registry, you can always go in with a group of friends to purchase it. For example, the couple may have asked for a new mattress that is far too expensive to give alone. Try asking 10 other guests to each chip in a minimum of $100. This will allow you to save a bit of money, but still give a large and meaningful gift.This is a great idea for members of the wedding party.

Get your parents approval.,
Find your Local Spiritual Assembly.,
A Baha'i marriage ceremony can take place just about anywhere.,
The Baha'i marriage can be simple and free.,
Understand more about the vow of marriage.,
Integrate your ceremonies.",How to Get Married in the Baha'i Faith," To have a Baha'i marriage you need the approval of all living parents of the prospective spouses. Even if you're sixty years old and your parent is eighty they still need to approve of the marriage. This practice eliminates the grounds for complaints from the proverbial ""mother-in-law"" and actually makes sense I think because new families today often need the support of their in-laws anyway. There is no eloping among Baha'is.;
, Once parents approve of the marriage, the couple consults with their Local Spiritual Assembly and applies to have the Baha'i marriage.


Two individuals approved by the Assembly need to be present to witness the vows of the couple. The vow consists of the words, ""We will all verily abide by the Will of God"" spoken by both in front of the approved witnesses.
The couple must also fulfill the civil law requirements in the area in which they reside.

, Interfaith marriages are encouraged. .


If say a Baha'i were to marry a Christian and the Christian wants a church ceremony the Baha'i ""ceremony"" is held on the same day in another location but not mixed in with the Christian ceremony say in the church.

, The couple may want a modest wedding party which avoids the expense and helps the new family.

, Here are some important selections from the Baha'i Writings that apply to marriage.


Marriage, among the mass of the people, is a physical bond, and this union can only be temporary, since it is foredoomed to a physical separation at the close.Among the people of Baha, however, marriage must be a union of the body and of the spirit as well, for here both husband and wife are aglow with the same wine, both are enamored of the same matchless face, both live and move through the same spirit, both are illumined by the same glory.
This connection between them is a spiritual one, hence it is a bond that will abide forever. Likewise do they enjoy strong and lasting ties in the physical world as well, for if the marriage is based both on the spirit and the body, that union is a true one, hence it will endure. If, however, the bond is physical and nothing more, it is sure to be only temporary, and must inexorably end in separation.
When, therefore, the people of Baha undertake to marry, the union must be a true relationship, a spiritual coming together as well as a physical one, so that throughout every phase of life, and in all the worlds of God, their union will endure; for this real oneness is a gleaming out of the love of God.(Compilations, The Compilation of Compilations vol II, p. 441)

, With regards to interfaith marriages, I believe I read in the Aqdas that the ceremonies needn't be separate, provided the simple obligations of the Baha'i marriage are observed? Also, within the same text, I believe I read that the couple must pay a fee to the House of Justice pertaining to the marriage?Below is what reference.bahai.org has to say about this:""j. The Dowry:i. Marriage is conditioned on payment of a dowry.ii.


The dowry is fixed at 19 mithqáls of pure gold for city-dwellers, and 19 mithqáls of silver for village-dwellers, depending on the permanent residence of the husband, and not of the wife.iii. It is forbidden to pay more than 95 mithqáls.iv.
It is preferable that a man content himself with the payment of 19 mithqáls of silver.v. If the full payment of dowry is not possible the issue of a promissory note is permissible."" However, At present the Kitab-i-Aqdas dowry law is not binding on Baha'is outside of the Middle East.

Pick a date.,
Select an indoor venue.,
Select an outdoor venue.,
Consult a wedding planner.,
Choose a caterer.,
Plan your wedding décor.,
Figure out what you’ll wear.,
Find someone to officiate.,
Obtain a marriage license.,
Change your name (if you want).",How to Get Married in New Jersey," Choosing the date of your wedding will be the most important decision you’ll make when getting married. It will affect your venue, your attire and everything in between. Here are some factors to consider when picking a date for a New Jersey wedding.Weather – New Jersey has a moderate climate, with humid summers and cold winters. If you want an outside wedding, choose a date in spring or summer.Holidays – There are pros and cons to getting married around major holidays; your guests have more time off to travel, but the wedding will be much more expensive.
Dates that are significant to your relationship – if you and your partner have a special day or lucky number, consider getting married on or around that date.
Budget – if you’re working with a smaller budget, consider planning a winter wedding. Sunday and weekday weddings are also much more inexpensive than Friday and Saturday wedding dates.;
, Your venue sets the tone for your big day, so it’s important to select a site that fits your personality, your budget and your needs. Indoor wedding venues are popular because you don’t have to worry about weather, but they book up quickly (often up to a year in advance).If you’re looking for an elegant venue, check out Park Savoy in Morris County.
For a unique venue with personality, check out the Liberty Science Center at Liberty State Park.If you’re looking for something inexpensive and intimate, get married by your local county clerk.

, Outdoor venues are very popular, especially in the summer, but there are pros and cons to using one. You’ll need to have a backup plan, in case the weather goes sideways, but on the plus side, you’ll be able to save on decorations.


For a lakeside ceremony, try Indian Trail Club.For a picturesque outdoor wedding, try the Olde Mill Inn and Grain House in Basking Ridge.For a nautical vibe, check out Mallard Island Yacht Club in Ocean County.

, While you can absolutely plan your Jersey wedding yourself, a wedding planner will help connect you with vendors and realize your vision for your wedding day. They’ll also be instrumental in executing your ceremony and reception day-of.Wedding planners cost a lot of money, so check and make sure this expense is important to you before committing to one.
Some venues provide their own day-of coordinator, making a wedding planner superfluous.
Wedding planners will definitely save you time, but will probably not save you money. Weigh the pros and cons and make a decision that works for you and your partner.
The cost of a wedding planner will range, depending on what you are hiring them to do. If you are hiring them to consult, expect to pay between $40-$60 an hour, for a newer planner. For day of coordination, expect to pay around $1,000, depending on the size of your wedding. Full service planning will run you anywhere between $2,000 - $10,000., Some venues either provide their own food and beverage or make you choose from a list of pre-approved vendors, but some have no restrictions whatsoever. Narrow down your budget for food and alcohol and then find a vendor that meets your needs.Make sure your caterer has a license and liquor liability insurance (if they’re providing alcohol).
Ask for references or get referrals from your friends who have gotten married in New Jersey.
If you need to accommodate food allergies and restrictions, make sure your caterer can provide this service.
Check out “extra” pricing: will your caterer provide chairs and tables? Cutlery and napkins? Find out exactly what is included in your package and what you are expected to provide independent of your caterer.

, If you’re going a more traditional route, you may decide to hire a florist to decorate your venue. If you’re looking to save a little money or infuse your own creativity into the process, you may choose to DIY your décor and spend the cash somewhere else.Substitute white twinkle lights or ribbons for flowers.
Use candles and feathers to create your own centerpieces.

You may also choose your location based on price and available activities.Be sure to put in the time and research your locations. Create a list of what your top destinations offer and narrow it down. Read reviews and visit forums to find answers to questions that aren’t immediately answered on websites.

, Mexico is a great destination because it may offer a comparable alternative to a local weekend wedding. For the same amount of money that you spend on a wedding at home you may be able to spend an entire week at a Mexican resort. Mexico also allows friends and family to have a fun getaway around the joyous occasion or an immediate honeymoon for the newlyweds.Make sure you create a limit and are strict when noting your expenditures.

, Once you have chosen a location and created your budget, choose a date. Make sure that it gives you enough time to prep and gives your guest enough time to make an informed decision. Taking time off work and spending money to fly to a destination is a big commitment so give your guests time to process.Make sure you choose the best time of year to have a wedding at your location.

You should not have to focus on anything other than celebrating your marriage ceremony.It is not unusual to have an activity scheduled before or after the ceremony.

Get a physical assessment of the child.,
Calm down!,
Talk to your child about everything.,
Read as much as you can.,
Play games!,
Get the siblings involved.,
Involve your child in activities outside the home.,
Teach kids to calm themselves.,
Provide an emotional outlet.,
Make use of online speech aids.,
Develop a network of support.,
Take care of your emotional self.",How to Encourage a Child's Speech Development," This can rule out any potential health problems. Conditions that affect hearing or speech, itself, will obviously play a major role.;
, A stressed out parent or caregiver and child will not help the situation. Understand that every child works at their own pace. Some kids can start talking at one while others after four.

, Mention every every task and every item. Don't worry if your child does not respond. Receiving language input and interpreting it is important for each child. If a child understands, but does not yet respond, he or she is still putting the pieces together. For example: When making a salad, talk about the vegetables, their texture, what they are important for, and how you put the salad together. The child will start to learn each individual item and its purpose.

, Read newspapers, magazines, posters, books, and menus aloud to your child. Read a book throughout the day. When the child loses focus and concentration, it is alright to put the book down for a bit, but pick it up again throughout the day.

, Board games, ""I spy,"" and similar games are ideal. Pick any games requiring language use and actively involve the youngster. Pick out his or her favorites for repeated play and fold in a few new games each week or month. Talk with friends and neighbors about swapping games so that there is a greater diversity of activity for all the families in your network.

, Have them talk with and play with the child. Children sometimes learn faster from siblings or peers. Remember to reward the siblings for spending quality time with your child and strive to create interesting activities for them. They could go on a bug hunt and give a running commentary on how they imagine the bugs might look at the world, what might make them comfortable, and how to figure out where to look for different kinds of bugs—those within the soil, on plants, under rocks, and in the water. Next week that adventure could explore the variation of terrain around the neighborhood or the different uses of rock and building materials. Get ideas from all the kids and keep a running list of potential activities they might tap at any given time.

, Never use a language problem as an excuse to not engage them in classes and camps or involve them in play dates. Again, the variety is key. Stay attuned to the light within your child's eyes. When the light goes off and and you see the brightness of excitement, bank that feeling and capitalize on your discovery of something that really, truly engages your child.

, This is a critical coping skill, because, with a speech delay, they will not develop strong expressive skills. Their inability to express themselves will sometimes lead to frustration and cause them to act out. Teach them to deep breathe: In through the nose as if they are smelling a flower; out through the mouth as if they are blowing out candles. For the child with a speech delay, getting back on track can be a long process and teaching them to manage their emotions well will help them throughout their life.

, It sometimes helps to create images that your child can use to express feelings. For example, you could have a page of emotions—a sheet of paper that has different faces on it—a happy face, a sad face, a mad face, and so forth. They could point to the face that matches their feeling. Then you could work with them to display that emotion with their own expression. You are then in a position to work with him or her to attain a relaxed satisfaction or happiness. Better yet, have child can express himself or herself through art: They can sketch their emotion and you can interpret their sketch verbally. Soon they might develop a means of expression which serves to tap and release the well-spring of emotion within them.

, There is no real excuse not to make use of online resources—books, cards, worksheets—anything you might imagine is readily available. Such materials are ubiquitous.

, People backing you and with whom you share your daily travails and hourly triumphs empower you to offer positivity and support to your youngster. Listen to the story of your neighbors and community members. Take a break from your world and step into theirs. You will, no doubt, find that the vital energy within you builds and is amplified. The perspective offered by stepping into another's world-view acts gyroscopically to center your existence on what is most important—love and caring.


Don't forget the online community. There are thousands who walk shoulder-to-shoulder with you. Find a group of positive, supportive individuals and share your ideas and emotions. Avoid like the plague, though, those individuals who lie in the dregs and refuse to rise from the mire. You do not need any downward impetus. Instead, concentrate on elevating others and you will likely find that you are provided a boost in spirit. Explore the many ways of viewing and coping and use them to good advantage.
If you are far from others physically (off in the boonies with no internet), try journaling. Record your thoughts, emotions, and worries using free association. The mere act of recording helps to sort, settle, and provide insight. Too, you will build a record of your progress which will buoy you when you need it most.

, Build confidence in your ability to work through this phase proactively. If children have a speech delay it is not anyone's fault, but it is a reality that you can help to mitigate. Don't feel guilty or pressured for the child to be at a certain level by a certain age. Each child is unique and progresses in his or her own way in a time frame that is comfortable for them. You are in it for the long haul, so revel in the small advances and build a base of trust and understanding. This will, ultimately, be the springboard to their place in society. You may go two steps forward and one step back at times, but stay positive and trust that you are providing the best resources and emotional support that is available.

Attack the problem directly.,
Make sure you explain to your child, how important practicing piano is.,
Have your child practice for a certain short amount of time each day, soon it will become a habit.

,Give your child something to look forward to after playing the piano, for example a dessert after dinner; this will motivate your child to play

,
Make sure you speak kindly to your child.,
Keep in mind that if you follow step #4, your child is only practicing because of a reward - not because he/she wants to.

",How to Encourage a Child to Practice the Piano1," If you aren't afraid of ending up beating a dead horse, feel free to try this way.;
, Tell them that if they practice, they will get better, and that being able to play the piano will open many doors for them once they are older.

,,, Do not shout at them or threaten to cancel their piano lessons, because this will only make your child want to play piano less, and they will not enjoy their playing time.

Get your child to like piano music.,
As the parent, you should listen to that music too.,
Buy some music.,
Get him/her to know some music theory.,
Get him/her a teacher - and a good one.",How to Encourage a Child to Practice the Piano2," How? Make it a part of their daily life. You can buy CD's by great artists like Horowitz or Rubinstein and have your child listen to them. There's nothing better than the moment when your child says, ""Wow! I want to be like !"" When that happens, tell your child that the pianist put a lot of work into developing his skill. S/he should practice on his/her own then! If not, tell him/her that pianist practiced a lot too.

, If you listen to rap music, for example, your child is going to listen to rap music too. Then, he/she may get influenced by rap music. The result is his/her interest in piano will decrease, but you want him/her to stay interested!

, If your budget permits, you may want to consider buying some sheet music. If your child is interested in piano, s/he will be further spurred to learn when you spend your money on books for him/her. It's like getting a 1st grader to read. You buy the 1st grader a book and s/he reads it. There's no difference with piano music.

, Music is like a language. It's only interesting when you learn to speak it. That's what it was like to great composers like Chopin and Beethoven. Compare this to TV. Would it interest you if you watched the Spanish channel but understood no Spanish at all? Your child's interest in piano could be greatly increased if he/she understood what it was about.

, Find a strict teacher who at least has the knowledge to say, ""You need to practice at least an hour a day"". Once your child gets skilled at piano, he/she will want to continue! If you were really good at tennis, wouldn't you want to keep playing it given the opportunity to do so? With a good teacher, a child can progress extremely quickly. However, find a bad one, and you'll find your child making little progress.

Understand what Asperger's Syndrome is.,
Recognize the lack of inborn social instincts.,
Understand emotional problems.,
Watch for repetitive behavior, including stimming.,
Recognize straightforward, innocent literalism.,
Look out for lack of physical coordination.,
Be sensitive to sensory issues.,
Know your child's strengths and weaknesses.",How to Discipline a Child That Has Asperger's1," If you haven't already, do some research on Asperger's, its symptoms, and why people with Asperger's do what they do. Here's a quick list of the main elements of the disorder and their outward effects.;
, Most people don't need to be told how to make conversation or understand body language. But people with Asperger's don't naturally understand how to do things like that.


Effects of this include difficulty making friends, not understanding social cues, accidentally offending people, speaking in a monotone, and not showing body language. Also, a difficult time relating to others.

, People with Asperger's often have trouble handling their emotions and expressing them to others. Sometimes they can't even recognize their own emotions.


Effects include emotional breakdowns and problems with anger and stress.

, Patterns appeal to people with Asperger's in many respects.


Examples include pacing, rocking, hand flapping, and other tic-like motions
Autistic people also have special interests and near-obsessive adherence to routine.

, People with Asperger's don't tend to understand hidden meanings of any sort.


Effects include not understanding idioms and sarcasm, trusting anyone who seems nice, and being easier to deceive. Also, thinking a social rule in one area applies in all areas; for instance, they might think that since it's okay to get up and go to the bathroom any time at home, it's okay to do the same at school.

, People with Asperger's often have poorer control over their bodies than people without the condition.

, Often kids with Asperger's have unusual senses; their senses may be too strong or weak.


Effects include sensory overload (breakdowns when too much is going on), sensitivity to touch, etc.

, Everyone with Asperger's is different. Some understand sarcasm perfectly. Some have great coordination. It's important to know which aspects of Asperger's affect your child.


Understand, too, that your child might be ""camouflaging"" some of his/her weaknesses. Maybe they get overwhelmed emotionally, but are very good at hiding it. Maybe they feel extremely uncomfortable in social situations, but force themselves to do well. Things like these can wear out your child internally, so be aware that you might not be seeing the full impact of their disorder all the time.

Know when and when not to discipline.,
Be careful with your child's interest.,
Make it clear that you're punishing the behavior, not the child.",How to Discipline a Child That Has Asperger's2," If your child starts screaming when you want him to try on his new coat, don't spank him or take away his favorite toy! Maybe that coat feels like broken glass against his skin. Maybe he feels scared because the coat is not what he's used to. Make sure you understand the issue before acting.

, Maybe your child has just talked back to you, and you're about to send them to their room. However, their favorite TV show comes on in five minutes. Stop! To you it might not seem like a big deal, but that TV show might be the high point of their day. Discipline should be unpleasant, not devastating. Maybe say ""no dessert"" or ""no video games for the rest of the week"" instead.

, Children with Asperger's are often quite sensitive. Again, something that seems like no big deal to you might rock their world. It's possible that they might begin to doubt your love for them.

"
"
Give your child a break sometimes.,
Reinforce positive behavior.,
Read up on respectful parenting.,
Talk about how to handle difficult situations.,
Model good behavior.",How to Discipline a Child That Has Asperger's3," If you've just gotten back from a family reunion and your child doesn't want to go to school the next day, try to accommodate her. Let her stay home to recharge. If you can't, ask her teacher to give her some slack that day.

, Don't ignore the good things they do. Show that you care as much about the good as the bad. Put their interest to good use here: if they ace a difficult exam, praise them, and maybe make their favorite meal.

, Assume that your child is competent and wants to behave well. Treat them with dignity and take time to listen to them.

, Yes, your child needs to know what not to do, but they also need to know what to do instead. Teach them good ways to handle strong emotions, bullying, conflicts, and other difficult situations.

, Your child learns how to manage their emotions by watching you. When you're angry or stressed, behave the way you'd like them to behave.


It's okay to say ""I need a break,"" take deep breaths, or say that you're too overwhelmed to handle this right now.

Allow for your child to make simple choices, such as what to eat for dinner or where to go on a weekend.,
Encourage independence from caregivers and media.,
Provide items in your child's environment to stimulate their imagination.,
Brainstorm different uses for items with your child.,
Ask your child open-ended questions to stretch their understanding and help them to postulate ideas.,
Play with your child.,
Be prepared for ""messy play."",
Engage in story telling.",How to Develop Child Creativity," This encourages them to think independently, exercising an important aspect of creativity.;
, A child that is constantly entertained by others or the television will struggle to find things to do on their own without access to media.

, Drawing supplies, blocks, books, and random craft supplies can all contribute to elaborate dramatic play schemes.

, For example, a cardboard tube can be a telescope, tower, or person. Validate all of your child's ideas, praising him or her for such an impressive imagination.

,


Ask your child ""what if"" questions. ""What if people could fly?"" ""What if people lived in space?"" ""What if dolphins walked on land?""
Involve your child in figuring out ways to make an improvement upon something. ""How can we clean up the living room faster?"" ""How could we get water to the flowers without spilling any?"" ""What could we do to make the ball bounce higher?""
Being read a book is an excellent opportunity for a child to exercise their creativity. Ask your child what could happen next, or how a character feels (and why).

, Work together to establish dramatic play scenarios, using substitute items for props when needed. Pretend play allows for children to imagine life from a different perspective, an important building block of creativity.

, While it may seem that your child is playing in the mud simply to make more work for you, in fact there is a great deal that is learned by playing with such things. When they are finished playing, make it a rule that they have to help clean up. If faced with the choice of getting messy then cleaning it up and not getting messy at all, almost all children will choose the former option.

, Start a story and take turns building upon it. Follow your child's lead in what the mood of the story should be. Expect most stories to be more on the silly, impossible side. Since this is just a story, no idea is too far-fetched.

Know that all baby's learn to crawl differently.,
Give them a good surface to learn to crawl on.,
Schedule ""tummy time"" when they are around three months old.,
Keep their hands, feet, elbows, and knees uncovered.,
Put toys just out of their reach.,
Consider purchasing an infant crawling track.,
Be careful of your baby's new-found mobility.",How to Crawl1," Between six to ten months old most babies will begin to crawl and scoot around, but they may go about it in different ways. Some will place each limb individually, others will drag their bellies on the floor, and some move quickly to walking. There is no ""right"" way to crawl, so encourage your baby no matter how they choose to get around. Give your child time to develop on it's own -- almost all children will find a way to move once they get used to their limbs.;
, You want a smooth, clean, and easy to navigate. A thin carpet is best, as it will be comfortable if they fall, stay warm, and provide a light grip for them to push off from.Lay in front of them so that they can see your face. This will help encourage them and make them feel safe., In order to learn how to crawl, babies need to practice pushing themselves off of the ground, which they can't do if they are always on their backs. Make sure you supervise them on their stomachs, however, so they don't get into trouble or try to eat something they shouldn't.


One on their stomachs, place your hands on the soles of their feet. Encourage them to push off, getting used to movement while prone.Having them stretch for 10-15 minute on their stomach a few times a day should be enough to begin with. Just put then down and supervise as the learn to move.
If you are nervous, lay on the floor and then place them, stomach down, on top of you.

, Too much clothing restricts movement, and it makes the essential body parts slippery, making it harder to learn crawling., Oce they are a little older, between 3-6 months, try putting some toys just out of reach on the floor so that they have an incentive to move. While you of course don't want to be cruel, encourage them to push, scoot, crawl, or stretch out to get what they want. , These devices are soft and can be gently slopped down. The slight decline encourages movement, and helps your baby get used to moving their limbs without feeling too burdened by the weight., While watching your baby crawl is a joyous occasion, it comes with a new set of risks. Babies can now follow after toys or a parent and explore new rooms unsupervised. Make sure you baby proof anything unsafe or off-limits, and keep and eye on your child at every moment.


The International Association for Child Safety estimates that most accidents happen within six feet of the parent, so stay vigilant as they learn to move. "

Lay on all fours close to the ground.,
Learn the standard crawl.,
The bear crawl is a modified version of the standard crawl, but instead of using your knees you stand up on your feet with your butt in the air.,
Learn the army crawl.,
Learn the leopard crawl.,
Use an army crawl or low standard crawl to escape from smoke.",How to Crawl2," Crawling requires you to stay low, using all four limbs to propel yourself forward. Find a way to rest on your arms and legs so that you are comfortable and without pain.


For your upper half, you may place either your hands or your forearms on the ground, depending on what is more comfortable.
For your lower half, rest on your knees and shins, with your legs flat and your hips on the floor, or on the tips of your toes.

, From your comfortable crawl position, move each limb individually forward to move across the floor. Though you can go in any order you want, the typical pattern is:


Right hand forward
Left knee forward
Left hand forward
Right knee forward.

, It is mostly used in exercise regiments. , The army crawl moves you quickly while keeping you as close to the ground as possible. It is also a staple of some cross-fit workout routines because it accesses a lot of different muscles and requires good core strength. To army crawl:


Prop up your torso with your forearms and toes, picking your hips off of the ground.
Alternate pushing off of each forearm to propel yourself forward.
Keeping your legs straight, pick up or drag your opposite foot forward along with your arm.

, This is one of the fastest ways to crawl while still keeping a low profile. A hybrid of the army and bear crawls, it requires strength and coordination to pull of quickly.


Start on you hands and toes like your are preparing to do a push up.
Reach forward with your right hand while moving your left knee up towards your left elbow, along the side of your body.
Repeat with the other side.
Focus on keep your hands and feet straight and your back flat. , When there is a fire, hot smokey air goes moves to the top of the room while cleaner air rests along the floor. By crawling to safety instead of running you avoid breathing in dangerous amounts of smoke and carbon monoxide.


Do not focus on technique so much as staying low and finding an exit.
Try to keep your head between 12 and 24 inches off the ground. "

Tilt your head to the side to inhale.",How to Crawl3," Floating near the top, lay your body out in a long, streamlined position. Imagine that you are floating at the top of the pool and that your back is facing the sky.


Try to keep your body as flat as possible, but keep your feet underwater. , This is known as the crawl kick, or the flutter kick. You want to move your legs from the waist while leaving a slight bend in your knees and your ankles loose. Kick each leg individually and alternate one after the other. If you're having trouble, practice in the shallow end by pushing off the wall and using only your legs to keep moving.

, Keep your hand in the water for the entire stroke. Your fingers should be close together and your hand flat so that it pulls through the water like a paddle.

, As you finish your stroke near your waist, bring your arm out of the water, arcing it back towards your head as you get ready to repeat the stroke.

, As you are pulling your first hand to your waist, begin bringing your other arm in front of your head and make an identical stroke with your other arm.

, Look to the up out of the water and sideways as you arm reaches your waist, and breath in. Most swimmers suggest breathing every three strokes and developing a rhythm with each breath. Exhale into the water as you return your head. "

While weight-training is not advised for young children, you can employ exercises where children bear their own body weight more purposefully to improve coordination.


Try to incorporate play into your child’s strength-building exercises, for example, swinging on the monkey bars or doing a “wheelbarrow,” where you hold the child’s feet while they walk forward with their hands.
Tug-of-war, tumbling and tree climbing can also help your child build the muscle tone they need to develop better coordination.Improving muscle strength also improves bone strength, which will give your child better balance.;
, Endurance sports provide a different kind of muscle training than the short bursts of exertion that promote brute strength. Sustained exercises at lower intensity tone your child’s muscles to aid the difficult work of performing tasks fluidly.Swimming is a great endurance exercise to promote coordination because your child doesn’t risk falling and hurting themselves. Of course, always ensure your child is supervised. If your child is too young to swim, long walks or jumping rope can help build up endurance.

, Your child’s back and abdominal muscles support them in virtually every task they perform: getting dressed, climbing stairs and lifting a backpack, for example. Building your child’s core muscles will give their other muscles more support and control, increasing overall coordination.


If your child is an infant or toddler, increase tummy time to strengthen back muscles and improve head control.
If your child is a bit older, the “superman” stretch, where a child lies on their stomach and lifts their arms and legs off the ground at five-second intervals, can be a fun, superhero-friendly approach to core training., Gross motor skills are any skills that encompass large sweeping movements of the body. You can tap into some normal play activities your child already enjoys to elevate their gross motor skills.


For example, swinging on the swings and playing hopscotch both promote the kinds of large multi-muscle movements required to build coordination.
If your child has trouble propelling themselves on the swing or hopping well, try playing pretend. Ask them to mimic various animals with their bodies. While their squatting like a duck or pawing like a dog may not be much at first, they can incorporate more movements as they become increasingly coordinated. Make believe will feel more like fun than exercise, too., Fine motor skills are any precise smaller movements, such as picking up a pen, flicking a marble or wiggling toes into the sandbox. Fine motor skills can also be exercised well through play. Try playing with bubbles, for example. Ask them to try popping a bubble with each individual finger.Fine motor skills also help hone hand-eye coordination, a vital part of overall coordination. Try scattering some buttons of different sizes and have your child practice moving them from hand to hand then putting them into a shoebox with a small slit in the top. You can also ask them to try putting pennies in a piggy bank.
This process of using the eyes to guide and control the hands will give your child more precise coordination skills for handwriting and other important tasks.

, In practicing both gross and fine motor skills, it is important to vary your child’s routines in order to yield the greatest improvement in coordination. Our bodies can learn to master one movement, if it is performed often enough, but true coordination comes from switching fluidly between different individual skills. Varying your child’s movements and training routine will help them reap the most benefits from these exercises.

, If your child is particularly self-conscious about their inability to perform certain tasks, it can help them to practice body awareness through yoga or martial arts. These types of exercises promote focus and mindfulness as part of strengthening physical movements.Yoga can also relieve stress, allowing your child better focus when tackling difficult tasks.

, Your child’s inner ear can have a profound effect on their ability to balance properly. Particularly if your child’s trouble with coordination comes after a head cold or illness of any kind, you should have their hearing examined. A licensed pediatrician can look in your child’s ears and perform an audiometric test to ensure everything is functioning normally., Visual deficiencies can make good hand-eye coordination and finding balance very difficult. A licensed optometrist or pediatrician can perform a thorough eye exam to ensure ocular motility or other issues aren’t partially to blame for your child’s poor coordination.

, Studies show that children who have Sensory Processing Disorder have trouble integrating all the information received from their senses to produce coordinated movements. A pediatrician can test for this disorder, whose hallmarks include avoiding over-stimulating environments and using too much or too little force to pick up objects.If necessary, a doctor can refer you to an occupational- or physical-therapy professional to help outline an appropriate course of therapy to address your child’s specific coordination needs.
If your child has not already been diagnosed with Developmental Coordination Disorder—a marked delay in motor skills—talk to your pediatrician about it. Developmental Coordination Disorder differs from Sensory Processing Disorder in that it is not caused by any neurological or medical condition. Exercises and motor-control activities, such as those described here, can be of great help in improving Developmental Coordination Disorder."

Include downtime as part of your family's modus operandi.",How to Deal with a Lazy Child," This can vary from person to person; for the hyper-manic person, any form of sitting still is anathema, while for a chilled-out person, it might take doing absolutely nothing at all before the parent thinks that the child is being lazy.


Be careful that your own standards of how things should be done aren't blinding you to ""good enough"" standards. For example, perfect house maintenance is unrealistic in a house with kids, so learning to tolerate good enough standards of cleanliness can help ease any tensions that a few things left here and there might otherwise cause. On the other hand, an inability to push past your child's door to access his or her room is not only a fire hazard but is a sign of not doing enough to maintain his or her personal environment. Seek a good balance.;
, What sort of role modeling have you presented the child? In some cases, what you allowed the child to ""get away with"" by taking charge of everything may have led the child to believe that his or her behavior is acceptable even if it now drives you nuts.


Have you involved the child in household chores or not? Going about the house sighing that someone has to do everything, then doing everything without delegating it to all of the householders is a dead-set way to raise children who couldn't care less about the state of the house as long as someone else is dealing with it. This doesn't mean things are stuck in this rut; it does mean you'll need to expect more and weather some griping until a new routine becomes established.
Are you obsessed with always doing something? As an adult, you have a choice to be ""always busy"" and never switched off. Children and teens, on the other hand, need downtime to grow, to be creative and to just think. (Actually, so do you but as an adult, it is your choice to do pointless tasks instead of chilling.) Be careful not to confuse your inability to come down from a state of constant busyness with idleness in your normally developing child.
Is someone else in the household, such as your spouse or partner, setting a bad example that your child is following? In this case, you'll need to discuss this with the person concerned.

, Aside from the role modeling previously discussed, there are usually very good reasons behind a lack of will to help out with household chores. Some of these include:


Being tasked with a chore that really grosses out the child. For example, if your child hates touching, smelling or seeing certain things, some household chores can really upset him or her, such as cleaning the toilet, taking out moldy compost or feeding stinky meat to dogs. This doesn't mean your child shouldn't learn to overcome his or her squeamishness but it does mean that recognizing this possible driver can help you to see it isn't laziness but distaste (or even fear) causing the inaction.
A failure to comprehend the extent of what is expected. For example, you yell ""go clean your room"". The child hears ""pick up three items then you're done"". Children just don't view mess in the same light as parents until it is drilled into them, and even then, not being fussed is fairly standard.
The chore or action is ""boring"". So commonplace a reaction, this reason barely needs a mention, except that it is precisely the one major excuse you're likely to be given! Even here, a child is merely expressing the truth, one adults tend to suppress under the veneer of needing to get on with things regardless. Children are yet to learn the ability to forsake fun for things they don't want to do and you'll need to win them over with the ""team effort"" approach instead of singling them out for being difficult.
It's too hard! Listen when a child says this because it is probably true. Have you shown your child how to do the chore? Does your child have the right resources to complete the task? Is the task too physically demanding for the age and physique of your child? Children don't usually like owning up to something being difficult without good reason, so don't presume this is just an excuse; something real lies behind it.
The child is depressed or ill. In this case, it is really important to recognize that something is wrong. A depressed or sick child will not be trying to be difficult but is bogged down in whatever he or she is experiencing. Love and attention to the source of the problem is in need here.

, The concept of laziness is subjective and dependent on context. Care must be taken not to label the child as a lazy person; instead, focus on the specific actions that indicate a sloppy or unhelpful intent rather than labeling the child ""lazy"". In all probability, the child is inclined to be unhelpful in only some things and is very helpful in other ways; we are all a sum of many parts and labeling is dismissive and fails to acknowledge the whole.


Calling a child ""lazy"" all the time is unkind and can cause the child to feel demonized. Insults are not a good way to improve the motivation of any person. Constant berating for being a lazy child can leave permanent emotional scarring, along with embedding rebelliousness to do even less.

, Better late than never; all members of a household have a responsibility to participate in household maintenance and this is a good way to get them started and keep them motivated.


Create household chore charts. Put the names of every household member on the chart. That way, everyone can keep track of what is expected and can also motivate any one householder who is failing to keep up his or her end of the bargain.
Create homework schedules. If a child is failing to do his or her homework, spend some time working out a homework plan together. Make it clear that you will not stand over your child but you will check that homework has been completed at set points and you will speak to the relevant teachers about progress from time to time. This gives plenty of freedom for your child to develop his or her routine, knowing that out-of-the-blue checks are inevitable.

, Avoid general requests to do things around the house. Instead, replace these with a breakdown of exactly what you expect the child to do or achieve. For example:


Don't just ask a child to ""clean his or her room"" until saying this carries an implicit understanding of what is expected. At the start, state each task required, such as stating the tasks in this order:

""Pick up your clothes and put them in the basket.""
""Pull the sheets off the bed and put them in the washing machine.""
Wash the sheets and dry them.
Vacuum the carpet.
Throw out old papers.
Put dirty dishes into the dishwasher.


Provide a list if you expect a lot of things to be accomplished at the one time. Make it more interesting by asking the child to check it off and you'll add stars for each checked-off item, or provide some other incentive for an older child.
Space chores out over periods of time, throughout the week, in between things that are enjoyable. Loading an entire week's worth of chores into one chunk such as a Saturday afternoon or Sunday morning tends to make a young person who'd rather be using that time to do fun things rather miserable and disinclined to act.

, Related to the previous step is the need to be absolutely certain that your child knows how to perform a chore. If you expect a child to merely watch your vacuuming as a form of learning, without actually showing how all of the buttons work, how to zap in the cord, how to maneuver corners, stairs and other awkward places, etc., then the child is none-the-wiser.


Each task requires an initial training session, using words that the child understands and allowing the child to ask questions and test-drive the chore under your supervision. Do this before letting go and expecting that the child will be comfortable performing the chore on his or her own.
Don't be afraid to explain why you're doing things a certain way, explaining the benefits of your approach. At the same time, also acknowledge that there are other effective ways (especially if you see your child using them) that still get the same results.
Be prepared for mistakes in learning to do chores. Making a big deal out them contributes to inaction, as the child grows scared to try for fear of failure.

, Rather than getting annoyed that a child hates touching or smelling things, see what you can do to make it as painless as possible.


For example, find a toilet cleaner that smells divine and pretty much covers up the odors the moment it is used. Or, find a compost bin with a handle and a scoop that allows the child to avoid having to touch any gooey days-old rotting vegetable matter. Find a long-handled spoon for the dog food to prevent the stinky meat getting onto your child's hands. Always look for solutions that allow the chore to be done without being too gross.

, Most people don't enjoy chores, but some chores are easier than others. See if it's possible to allocate specific chores to the person who least minds doing them. For example, if Cassie likes mopping, Jay likes vacuuming and Chris prefers hanging out the clothes, enlist their support in just these areas! You can also try these other ways to make household chores more fun:


Use music. A lot of music playing loudly can energize everyone while doing chores. Let the children choose the mix for added fun.
Do chores as a team. Rather than having anyone sitting around, have the whole household get up and do the chores together. This can take away any resentment that Cassie is watching TV while Chris is vacuuming under her feet.
Do something fun after the cleaning, the putting away, the homework. Go for a walk somewhere together, have a ball game outside, walk the dog, watch a favorite show together, etc. By associating post-chore time with positive togetherness, you can reinforce that action is followed by a sense of fulfillment for the child.

, Notice the good things that your child has done and always be encouraging about these things. For things not done so well, or not done at all, explain how to do the things better or show how to do shortcuts or easy fixes; avoid scolding as best you can; mistakes are learning opportunities.


Occasionally give a tangible reward, such as a little money, an outing or a small gift. However, don't tie such rewards to any specific chore; it is best to state that these are for good participation in the household maintenance as a whole.

, One of the most brilliant motivators is money in exchange for work. After all, for millions of people worldwide, it works. It overcomes grumbling, fussing, excuses and more (just don't expect these to go away, it's just that they'll occur while work is taking place).


The important thing is to only give the pocket money if the chores are completed. Avoidance of completing chores is its own lesson here; no money brings its own consequences.

, Some things are intrinsic to well-being of the child and the smooth running of the household. Homework is one good example and taking care of one's own messes is another. For those things that really must be done by the child, refusal should come with consequences, targeted to the child's age. Consequences can include:


Removal of electronic items from their room or banning use for a set period of time. This includes video game consoles, MP3 players, iPads and other tablets, and computers for anything other than homework, etc.
Grounding. For teens, this one can have a very strong impact.
Exclusion from a special event planned for the family.
Non-purchase of something the child wanted. The child was promised the item, but hasn't lived up to the bargain for that item.


Try to focus on consequence invocation as a last resort. It is awful for everyone involved and it takes a lot of courage on your behalf to see it all the way through. Moreover, the more the consequence is focused directly on the offending problem (often digital devices in the current age), the more likely you will get good actions occurring, whereas taking away privileges such as going out can feel terribly punitive and somewhat unrelated to the ""laziness"". At the end of the day, weigh the need for tough love with the likelihood that the child will change his or her behavior for the better.

, A child needs to see that your family has balance and can chill out in addition to being busy. It doesn't do to suggest that life is one constant stream of doing all the time. There also needs to be room for the quiet moments, for reflection and for a snooze together here and there amid the busier parts of daily living.


Be less tough on yourself if you never give yourself downtime. You deserve a break, and it shows good role modeling to your child to see that you value yourself enough to relax in addition to keeping busy.

Change your tone.It’s okay to want your kids to succeed – in fact, that’s what every parent wants.,
Think about why you’re putting so much pressure on your child.Many people who were raised by parents who put too much pressure on them go on to place too much pressure on their own kids.,
Allow failure.If you’re in the habit of putting too much pressure on your child, the person who will probably be most horrified by the prospect of your child failing at anything is you.,

Highlight your child’s successes.Instead of putting too much pressure on your child before a big event, help them remember other occasions when they were challenged but successfully overcame a tough, high-pressure situation.,
Provide unstructured time for you child.It is important that your child is afforded the opportunity to explore, play, and use their imagination.",How to Avoid Putting Too Much Pressure on Your Kids," They might throw things and lash out at you or their siblings.


They may also be throwing tantrums because they don’t get enough attention and want more limits on their behavior. Tantrums might also be a normal part of their development (especially for teens), or an unconscious effort to test your patience or authority.;
, Compulsive exercise is exercise that pushes an individual beyond their healthy limits. Even if your child – usually a teen – feels worn out and exhausted, their compulsive behavior forces them to exercise more. Kids who spend more than 60 to 90 minutes each day engaged in physical activity are exercising beyond normal limits.


Kids who engage in compulsive exercise usually do so because their parents put undue pressure on them to succeed in some sport. Let your child know that sports and games are meant to be fun, and that if they don’t want to play their chosen sport, you won’t be upset. Tell your child, “It’s okay if you don’t win, or even if you don’t want to play anymore. I’ll still love you.”
Compulsive exercise puts your child at risk for injury.Encourage them to cease compulsive exercising as soon as possible.

, This is especially true in cases where parents are putting too much pressure on children to look slim or beautiful.


Overweight children are not necessarily suffering under too much pressure. They might have other medical issues, or may simply be malnourished. Talk to a pediatrician to identify the causes of your child’s weight problem.

, They may cry excessively, show a disinterest in friends, or demonstrate low levels of motivation. Kids with these problems might say they feel sad, empty, numb, or lonely. Have your child see a child psychologist if you notice or suspect these attitudes and behaviors.

, For example, you might hear your child say, “You are always pushing me too hard to get good grades” or “I wish you didn’t put so much pressure on me to win.” If you hear these or similar comments from your child, take them seriously.


Don’t respond with denial, anger, or sarcasm. Responses like, “Oh, so your failures are all my fault?” or “I put pressure on you to succeed and you should thank me” are not helpful. Instead, empathize with your child and acknowledge they are struggling to meet your high expectations.
Reflect on your behavior and think about how much pressure other parents place on their kids. Do you consider the amount of pressure you place on your child equal to, greater to, or less than other parents?

, Does their behavior suggest that they are under excessive pressure? For instance, do they engage in compulsive exercise and/or throw tantrums? Once you’ve identified behaviors that might suggest they are under pressure, think about whether you’re the cause. If you answer “yes” to any of the following questions, you are probably placing undue pressure on your kids:


Do you encourage them to win every football, hockey, or lacrosse game – no matter what?Do you consistently warn your child that if they don’t get better grades, they will not get into a good college?
Do you insist that your child become the best at everything they do?

, They might even respond to the mounting pressure by acting out in negative ways. In order to move forward in a productive way with your child, you need to acknowledge that the way you treated them led to a negative outcome.


Say, “I’m sorry for putting too much pressure on you. I love you and I’ve only ever wanted what’s best for you, but I see now that my approach was wrong. Can you forgive me?”

, The thing that will keep your kids from feeling that they are under too much pressure, though, is to let them know that even if they fail, or can’t do something well, you’ll stand by them and still love them.


Kids want love and affection. If they don’t get an “A” on their test, don’t tell your child that they need to do better. Instead, say, “I’m sure you tried your hardest” or “I’m happy you’re making progress.”
Get to know your child. What are your child’s limits? What are they good at? Offer words of encouragement if you believe they could do better. For instance, say, “You know I love you no matter what, but I think you could put more effort into this class.”
By challenging your child to be the best they can be while letting them know you completely support them, your child will experience just the right amount of pressure that they need to succeed.

, For other parents, they are motivated not by a goal of setting their child up for success, but by the pride they can gain by raising an all-star or prodigy.Reflect carefully on your own motivations for putting excessive pressure on your child.


Sometimes it’s hard to clearly identify why you want to place too much pressure on your kid. Talk to a psychologist about your reasons for doing so. Psychologists can work with you to help you explore thoughts, attitudes, and feelings you might not even be fully aware of.

, Step back and permit your child to take their next sports event or test review session into their own hands. Children who are not under too much pressure might fail, but in failing, they will learn important lessons.


After failing enough, or badly enough, your child will be able to identify if victory – however defined – is worth it.
Failure helps kids develop a sense of personal autonomy. Over time, your child will learn to perform in a way that pleases them, not others.

, They may, for instance, become fearful and forget what they studied, or freeze up on the field. To avoid these situations, teach your child to think of these situations as challenges and opportunities rather than high-pressure situations. When your child has a puzzle, game, or opportunity before them, they will rise to the occasion and give their best.

, For instance, if your child has a big test, you should say, “Even though this test is really important, if you don’t do well, it’s not the end of the world.”


If you want to provide more specific contextual advice to your child to help them feel less pressured, suggest that they could pick up extra credit assignments later.
In the case of sporting events, you might suggest that there will be other games down the line, and other opportunities to win.

, Reminding your child of how smart, wonderful, and skilled they are will give your child confidence and diminish their perceived feelings of stress and pressure.


Offer words of encouragement like, “You got this” and “I know you can do it.”

, To avoid putting too much pressure on your child, you should avoid constructing a rigid schedule of activities and events for them. If you don’t allow your child to do anything but study, do homework, or go practice their sport, they will become bored and feel trapped by the pressure of the situation. Unstructured time (either alone or with friends) allows them to unwind and reduces the amount of pressure they experience.


It’s best if at least some of this unstructured time is free of phones and other electronic devices. Take your child for a hike in the woods, or go for a canoe trip. Enjoying the great outdoors can help your child (and you) decompress.

Set aside time to teach new skills.,
Be patient.,
Avoid perfection.",How to Build Independence in Kids As They Grow Older1," Children will become more independent as they get older and learn how to do things for themselves. For example, they will learn how to put on their own clothes, tie their shoes, brush their hair, ride a bike, drive a car, etc. These life skills help them become less dependent on their parents and more self-reliant. In order to teach new skills you need to set aside time.For example, if your child is learning how to dress themselves this means you will need to set aside more time each morning to get ready. Wake up 15 minutes earlier to account for this added time.
You can also set aside practice time for skills such as riding a bike, reading, or driving a car. For instance, set aside 30 minutes each day to learn and practice new skills.;
, It is going to take time for your child to master new skills. Make sure you are patient and do not step in and complete the tasks yourself. Understand that your child is going to need additional time to complete relatively simple tasks. Be supportive and encouraging so that they gain confidence in their own abilities. This will help your child become more independent., You also need to let go of perfection in order to encourage your child to be more independent and do things on their own. For instance, when your child is learning to brush their hair it may not look as nice as when you do it. Do not critique your child because this can make them feel like they have disappointed you. Instead, be supportive and encourage them to continue trying.


You could say “You are doing a great job brushing your hair, I am just going to help you reach the back.”
Alternatively, if you have an older child who is learning to do the dishes they may not get them perfectly clean in the beginning. Instead of nitpicking every spot they miss, you could say ""Try using this sponge if you can't get all the food off."" This way you are providing them with guidance rather than criticism.

Answer questions.",How to Develop Your Children's Speech and Language Skills Through Play and Positive Daily Interaction," Be aware that children learn speech and language through listening, watching, exploring, copying, initiating, responding, playing and interacting with others. For those first few years most of the important interaction is going to be between the child and their parents, carers and maybe siblings. Finding time to spend with your children and have a shared focus is very important if you want to help them to develop their speech, language and social skills. One-to-one time will benefit your child in the long term.;
, You are doing your child a disservice if you have spare time, but put them in front of the TV. There are a few (and only a few!!) children's TV programs that are in any way educational. Your child is more likely to learn about things from one-to-one playtime with his parent or carer. TV and video games are passive entertainment and do not encourage any interaction. Studies now show that children who watch too much TV in their early years are more likely to have difficulties with attention and listening when they reach school age.

, There is also evidence to show that if the child uses a dummy/pacifier their speech can be delayed.Speech can be delayed because the child is speaking less and the development of the child's oral musculature may be affected by maintaining an immature sucking pattern, appropriate for an infant, but not for a child who is getting ready to eat and speak. .

, Building a language rich environment is about using every opportunity to use language, to interact, to share a focus, to talk, to take turns. Building a language rich environment is also about building a nurturing environment, giving your child love and affection and building their self-confidence. And finally, it is about building a learning environment, creating a place where love, language and learning can all take place together. So what do you do to create this environment? Well firstly look at yourself and how you are communicating:


Remember your language level - One of the biggest things to be aware of when using language around your young child is the level and complexity of the language you use. Think about their age and how much language they use. A young child will generally understand more words than he uses in speech. You can use a milestones chart to have a broad idea of your child's language level. Assuming your child is developing along normal lines think about where to pitch you language. For instance, if your child is aged 2 years and 6 months and is able to follow a short instruction containing 2 key words, be mindful of this when you talk to her. If you use long sentences she will not understand you. If your child does have difficulty understanding, just use key words, more intonation, and gesture, or point as you say the words.
When talking to your child, try to talk about things that are in context or that the child can see, so they can use these things as a reference. Talk slowly and put emphasis on the key words if they are in a sentence, and use lots of intonation to help emphasize meaning. Give the child more time to respond than you would with older children or an adult. Younger children may need a little longer to process your speech and formulate an answer of their own. This is even more important if your child has difficulties acquiring language. If your child has language difficulties, or receptive language delay, limiting your words, giving them lots of time to process language, and using lots of gesture is essential.

, You can enhance your child's development of language by sometimes taking a step back during play and letting them take the lead. This gives the child control of their environment and builds their confidence. Although you are still involved in the play you are not dictating what is happening. However, you can still be feeding language into the play as it is happening. So the takeaway here is not to feel you have to fill in any gaps of silence, just watch and listen and add language. For instance, if your daughter is playing with her dolls, just watch, add language to her words and dictate some of her actions.


Chloe: dolly tea
Mum: the dolly's drinking tea, and that one is having a sandwich
Chloe: sandwich
Mum: mmm sandwich, what's it got in it…jam, a jam sandwich mmm
Chloe: mmmm sandwich
Mum: mmmmm jam sandwich yummy
Chloe: more tea
Mum: more tea for dolly and teddy is drinking tea too
Chloe: cake
Mum: oooh, are they getting cake too, yummy
Chloe: yummy cake
Mum: yum yum yum eating lots of cake (rubs tummy)

This is a simple example and although mum is only adding a few new words she is acknowledging her daughter's words and she is expanding on her sentences. Chloe can hear her words being put into longer more grammatical sentences and a couple of verbs are added (eating and drinking). Chloe remains in charge throughout the game, she leads the game and the dictates what is happening. This situation allows her control so there is no pressure on her to communicate and the communication environment is a relaxed and nurturing place.



, Children do not learn language by having an adult continually asking them to name various items. Children learn by hearing words and linking them to things. So it is a good idea to feed language into play, rather than asking your child to name every toy they are playing with. Adding language is an easy thing to do and can be done in all types of different situations, not just play. You can comment on what the child sees, commentate on what your child is doing, or expand on what they have said e.g.:


Child: car
Adult: that's right, it's a car, a fast car; or
Adult: that's right, it's a car, a red car,and there is a blue car
Child: cat
Adult: yes, the cat is climbing (gesture the actions, and emphasize the key words cat and climbing)

, For instance, if your daughter is playing with her dolls in the dolls house, give a little commentary:


Jane: dolly
Dad: dolly's going in the house
Jane: sit
Dad: dolly's sitting down
Jane: drink
Dad: dolly's got a cup, she is drinking tea drink tea
Jane: tea
Dad: yes, dolly is drinking tea… and now she is eating cake

, The temptation here is to ask a question, such as “what is dolly doing” or “what is dolly drinking”. This immediately puts the emphasis on the child, and they then have to stop their play and respond. By just commenting, you are not putting any pressure on your child to communicate so the play is more relaxed. The child is also able to play on their own terms and control the game.

, The above examples show the importance of having a shared focus. This is important because not only are you giving the child a point of reference when you talk about things, but the child is learning listening and using attention skills. These skills are vitally important for the child when they attend school and the early years are key years for developing these skills. The best ways to develop these skills is to spend time with your child, talk and play with child, and have a shared focus.

, Share the moment and look at things together. Make sure you are at the child's level and have good eye contact. It is important to notice what interests your child and what they are focusing on, and then comment on it. This helps create a shared focus, shows the child that you are interested and allows them to link language to the things they are looking at when you comment.

, If you are able to acknowledge and understand your child's attempts at speech it encourages them to attempt more, and at the same time you are providing a good model of the speech. If you can't understand your child, repeat back her word, but at the same time point to things you think she may be trying to say. Most daily activities can involve a shared focus:


Shopping: tell your child what item you are looking for, that way you can turn your attention to the items on the shelves and name some of them. You can name them for your child, if she does not recognise them.
Reading books: this is an excellent way to have a shared focus. Look at the book, talk about the pictures and read the story.
Cooking: make a cake together, talk about the ingredients and what you are doing (stirring, mixing, pouring etc). Follow a recipe step by step (sequencing skills).
Toys: have a tea party with your daughter and her dolls. Describe what everyone is doing (but don't ask questions and let your daughter take the lead). Do the voices for some of the dolls and add language that way.

, Pretend play is another great way to develop your child's imagination and add lots of language at the same time. Letting your child lead the game also gives them a sense of control and can build self confidence. Here is an example of how a dad and his son pretend to be firemen and all the different ways that this can be educational for the child (see below):


Example 1. - Firemen - You are a dad and you have 15 minutes to spend with your 4-year old son. You decide to be firemen and imagine that you have got a call to put out a fire in a big building. Firstly let’s think about the Language we will be using:

Nouns: fire, fireman, hat, boots, hose, water, fire engine, smoke, ladder
Verbs: drive, climb, run, jump, smell
Adjectives: hot, wet
Prepositions: in front, in, on
Social skills: Turn-taking and shared focus
Self confidence: Let your son be the chief fireman, let him give you the orders
Affection: Give him a hug to celebrate when you put the fire out and save all the people
How easy was that! This is just one short simple little role play where a boy is playing, learning, listening and using language, building social skills, building self confidence, and bonding with his dad. Dad only needed 15 minutes out of his day to do it. It is not hard, you can do it in short bursts when you have little pieces of time.


Example 2. Dress up for the ball

Have a dress-up with your daughter and imagine you are going to a ball. Language used:
Nouns: dress, shoes, ball, make-up, hair etc
Verbs: dress, dance, fasten etc
Adjectives: pretty, elegant etc
Prepositions: on, in, under etc
Social skills: A shared focus, talking about the ball
These are simple examples and with a bit of imagination could be expanded in all sorts of ways, but it illustrates that it is easy to create playtime situations, that are fun and also can be used to positively promote speech and language skills, social skills and build confidence.



, Try to use body language and gesture when you speak. This helps the child understand what you are saying, but it may also teach them to do the same so that they can make themselves understood more effectively. Body language plays a huge part in helping others gain meaning from what we say, this is a good skill for children to learn, especially if their speech is not clear in the early years.

, Children are inquisitive and it is important to always take the time to answer their questions. Answering questions creates a 2-way communication process, because you both have a turn and you both have to wait and use good listening skills. Sometimes children go through a phase of asking “why” in response to everything you say. If this becomes a habit (rather than a genuine question), respond with your answer and then ask them a question. This creates a turn-taking opportunity and at the same time making the child to respond to a question. If you want your children to learn language and develop speech and social skills - TURN OFF THE TV AND TALK TO THEM AND PLAY WITH THEM!

Ask your child to help complete chores.,
Allow your child to fail.,
Set clear guidelines.",How to Build Independence in Kids As They Grow Older2," In order to build independence in your child, you should give them tasks and chores that they can complete on their own. This will help them learn to be responsible and less dependent. These chores should change as your child ages.For example, have your toddler or young child get dressed on their own, brush their teeth, or put away their toys.
Ask older children to do the dishes, fold laundry, or make their bed.
Get teenagers and young adults to help make dinner, shovel the driveway, or mow the lawn.

, Failure is an important aspect of life. If your child has experienced small failures from a young age, they will be less likely to develop a fear of failure. A fear of failure can lead to dependence because your child will be too afraid to do things on their own in case they fail.As a result explain to your child that failure is a normal part of learning and that they can overcome failure through hard work and problem solving.
This also signals to your child that you are confident in their ability to work through things on their own which will give them the confidence they need to become independent as they grow older.
For example, if your child is learning to ride a bike they may fall off multiple times causing them to feel defeated. You want to encourage them to get back on the bike and keep trying.

, As you give your children more responsibility, you need to set clear guidelines. This way your child will know exactly what they need to do and what the consequences will be for not completing their responsibilities. This will help your child understand that in order to be independent they need to take responsibility for their actions.For example, say to your child “It is your responsibility to wear your helmet while riding your bike. If you don’t wear your helmet then your bike will be taken away for the rest of the week.”
Alternatively, for an older child you could say “You are responsible for cleaning up after dinner. If you don’t do this, you will not be able to use your phone until your chores are complete.”

"
"
Give your child options.,
Teach about consequences.,
Give your child alone time.",How to Build Independence in Kids As They Grow Older3," In order to be independent, children need to be able to make decisions for themselves. You can help your child become confident with their decision making abilities, by allowing them to make small decisions while they are young. This teaches them that you value their opinion. As kids get older they will begin to make decisions on their own.


For a young child you could give two lunch options and ask which one they want. This allows you to control the situation, but still gives the child the opportunity to feel involved in the decision-making process.
For older children you can increase the importance of the decisions they make. For example, allow them to choose their extra curricular activities, or what courses they will take in high school. You can help guide them through the decisions by weighing out the pros and cons.

, When you are teaching your child to make decisions, you need to explain to them the consequences of their decisions. This will help guide your child to make good choices as opposed to rash decisions. As long as the decision will not impact the health and safety of the child, you should let them make bad choices, so that they can get a better understanding of the consequences.For example, if a young child wants to take ten dollars to school to buy a snack, you could suggest only taking 5 dollars because they may lose some of their money.
This way you are providing them with the potential consequences of making that decision, but ultimately leaving the choice to the child.

, Alone time is important for the development of independence in your child, primarily because it allows your child the freedom to problem solve and make decisions without your input or guidance. It also allows your child to become comfortable without having a parent around.For a young child, you can give structured alone time. For example, set up their toys in the living room and tell them to play independently while you make dinner. This will give them an opportunity to gain comfort on their own in a safe and controlled setting.
For older kids you can let them walk or ride their bike to school alone or with a friend. Make sure they understand all safety rules. This will help them feel more independent outside of the home.
For young teenagers you can try leaving them home alone. Begin by leaving them for short periods of time (10-20 minutes) and then you can increase the time as they become more comfortable.

"
"
Focus on their strengths.,
Praise their effort.,
Accept your child for who they are.",How to Build Independence in Kids As They Grow Older4," To help your child become confident and ultimately independent, you should focus on their strengths. Pay attention to the activities that they enjoy and help them find a way to incorporate these activities into their life. This can help to raise their self-esteem.For example, your child may excel at organized sports. Make sure they get an opportunity to take part in sports either through school programs or extracurriculars.

, When you praise your child’s accomplishments, you should always focus on rewarding their efforts rather than just the outcome. This way you are communicating to them that hard work and effort are more important than the actual results. It also helps them work towards goals. If your child understands that hard work is rewarded, they will be more likely to become independent and take on challenging tasks.Instead of saying “I am so proud because you got an A on your math assignment,” say “I’m proud of you for practicing your math problems. You are really sticking with it.”

, You can build self-confidence in your child by accepting them for who they are. Every child has their own unique personality. Embrace their difference and make them feel completely comfortable in their skin. Avoid being overly critical. This will give them the confidence they need to feel sure of themselves and will make it easier for them to become independent as they grow older.

Ask about special challenges.,
Inquire about their home discipline.,
Enforce your rules at your house.",How to Discipline Someone Else's Child1," Before having a playdate or inviting another child over, ask the parent if there are any challenges you might anticipate. The child might have food allergies, take a nap at a certain time, or have problems sharing toys. Briefly ask the parent ahead of time if there are any considerations or challenges you might face or your child might experience.Say, “Are there any things I should be aware of for your child’s diet or behavior?”;
, If a child is coming to play or stay with you, ask the parent ahead of time what kind of discipline they implement and how you might be consistent with it. This is especially necessary if the child is sleeping over or in your home for a few days or more. Notice if their discipline style differs from your own and find ways to compromise, as consistency is important to help the child learn.


For example, if the child has a timeout chair, establish a similar chair designated for timeouts.
Talk about any differences in discipline styles such as using physical force like spanking, utilizing timeouts, or taking away privileges. If the other parent has a different style, find a compromise.

, If a child is acting up in your house, enforce your own house rules, even if they differ from the child’s house rules. Don’t expect them to know your rules, though. If a rule is broken, calmly let the child know what is and is not allowed.Say, “I’m sorry, but we only eat food in the kitchen, not on the couch” or, “Our family takes our shoes off when we come inside the house.”
You may also want to let the child know about the rules of your house in advance. This helps prepare them in case they are different from the rules in their home. You can even write the rules out if you think it is necessary.

"
"
Ask the parent to intervene.,
Intervene in important situations.,
Make your presence known.,
Remain calm.,
Be fair.,
Redirect the child’s attention.",How to Discipline Someone Else's Child2," If the child’s parent or caregiver is present, let them know their child is misbehaving. Ask them to take action. Draw the parent’s attention to the situation without interfering yourself. If necessary, remove the child from the situation and bring them to their parent.Say, “I think your child is having a problem right now” or, “Your child needs some help.”

, While you may not want to step in for all situations, there are some situations in which you must intervene. Aggressive behaviors such as hitting, punching, kicking, biting, or using items as weapons that may hurt someone need intervention. Other problems such as yelling, screaming, or screeching and destructive behaviors like tearing apart the toy room should also be addressed. While you may not want to address all problems, do use discipline when it is warranted.Say, “This is not allowed” or, “It is not okay to do that.”
For example, if a child is about to throw something at another child, touch their arm and say, “Rocks need to stay on the ground. Please do not throw this.”
While it may be important to intervene in certain situations, remember not to use physical punishment as a means of discipline. Scientific data suggests that it may be ineffective, and the use of physical punishment may also cause resentment or action on behalf of the child's guardian., Whether in a big way or a small way, show the child that you are supervising and seeing things get out of hand. Give the child a glance. You can also cross your arms or shake your head in disapproval. These nonverbal behaviors are subtle interventions that show the child that you’re paying attention, yet you are not taking direct action at the moment. They may serve as a warning of intervention.If more intervention is necessary, use a calm but stern voice. Say, “This behavior is not tolerated.”

, You may have more patience with your own children yet little patience for other children. Keep your cool, even if the child is pushing your buttons. Yelling often leads to more yelling and hitting into more hitting. If you’re upset, take some deep breaths, count to ten, or walk away until you feel more collected.If you find it difficult not to raise your voice, sing what they are doing wrong. For example, sing, “Uh oh, you hit. We don’t hit in this house.”

, When handling discipline and consequences, be fair in what you give. Some situations may have natural consequences (like throwing a toy and having it break) while other may have logical consequences (like saying that if your child does not put away their toys, they cannot play with them). Decide what is best and whatever you choose, be firm. Don’t give in to negotiations or tantrums.Don’t give a large consequence for a small misbehavior. If you’re angry or upset, take a few moments to gather yourself before determining a consequence.

, Use a distraction or change activities if the child is having a problem with the current activity. It may be effective to change scenes entirely: move the children into a different room, go outside, or start an entirely different activity, like art or music.Say, “Let’s go downstairs for a snack” or, “I’d like you to work on these finger paints now.”

"
"
Praise their positive behaviors.,
Be impartial.,
Mention problem behaviors to their parent.",How to Discipline Someone Else's Child3," If you feel like another child is getting into a lot of trouble and you have to spend considerable time with them, focus in when they’re doing things well. Catch them being kind, sharing, or following directions. Reinforce these behaviors by giving verbal praise. You should also point and and reinforce the child's positive traits to help build confidence in the right areas.Say, “You did a great job putting on your seat belt without being told. I’m really proud of you.” You can also say, “Wow, I’m really impressed you picked up all these toys without being asked. I’ll let your parent know you did a great job.”
When giving a report to the parent, bring up the positive and negative behaviors.

, Especially if the child’s parent is a friend of yours, it’s important to treat their child impartially. Disciplining another child can damage friendships, especially if you have not discussed what is and is not acceptable between friends. If you’re intervening with discipline for an interaction between your child and another child, be cautious in how to move forward. Don’t immediately take your child’s side. Listen to both children, especially if you did not see the fight. Also, don’t make comparisons such as “Be more like this child,” as this can hurt the other child.Say, “Tell me what happened. You go first, then it’s your turn.”
When it comes time to talk to the parent, talk about the process. Say, “I asked both of them what happened, and they both said that Charlie hit first.”

, If a child has a major meltdown or behavior outburst, let their parent know. However, don’t have this discussion in front of the child. Be open to hearing feedback from the parent and ask them how they’d like future behavior to be handled.Say, “Your child had some problems today that I wanted to mention to you. This is what happened.”
Ask, “How would you like future problems to be handled?” This allows parents to provide ideas on how to handle certain problem behaviors that you may not work with regularly.

Set good examples.,
Open an interest-bearing savings account for them.,
Store your pocket change in a clear jar.,
Show your child that things cost money.,
Give them an allowance.,
Help them divide their allowance.,
Review the family budget with your children.,
Let them help with the shopping list.,
Teach them to comparison shop.,
Make a spending plan.,
Have them work for their allowance.,
Help them open a checking account, if possible.,
Warn them about credit and debit cards.,
Encourage them to get a part-time job.,
Let them pay their own way.,
Don't bail them out.",How to Teach Your Child About Budgeting," Pay with cash instead of credit cards. Don't buy things on impulse. Let your child watch you comparison shop. Bring them to the bank when you put money into your savings account. Explain what you're doing while you're doing it., Deposit the money they receive as gifts if they're very young. As they near the end of grade school, let them spend about 80 percent of what they receive. Save their monthly bank statements and create a graph to show them how the interest on their account is making more money for them.


If you don't have enough money for an initial deposit, store the money in a piggy bank until you save up enough., Choose glass or plastic as long as it's see-through. This will allow your child to see money accumulate over time. Point out each deposit and how it makes the pile of money grow larger., Have them take a few dollars out of the jar after you've let the money accumulate for a while. Bring it to the store to buy something for them. Then, let them watch you hand the money to the cashier to pay for the item(s). This visual demonstration will stick with them longer than a lecture will., Start with a small amount as soon as they're old enough to understand that money can buy things. Pay them their age (or half their age) in dollars (pounds, Euros, yen, etc.) each week. For example, if your child is five years old, give them $5 per week., Pay them in bills and coins that they can deposit into different containers designated for different purposes. Let them keep 80 percent of their allowance for spending. Then, have them put 10 percent into long-term savings for large purposes and 10 percent into short-term savings for smaller purchases., This is especially helpful if you're also trying to teach them to help cut down on expenses. Show them how much money you earn each week. Explain that they can't spend more than that amount.This step requires quite a bit of trust. Explain to your child that details of the family budget should not be discussed outside the family.

, Have them look in the kitchen cabinets and refrigerator to figure out what the family needs for the coming week. Then, review the list with them before going to the grocery store. While shopping, hand them a calculator to see how close you are to your budget as you add more items to the shopping cart.

If money is tight, try planning your meals around what's on sale and which coupons are available. Have your child look through store circulars and help you clip coupons., At the store, ask your child to find unit prices on items. Have them divide the price by the net weight or number of contents in the package. This will help them to become more frugal shoppers.For example, a 5-oz. bag of chips costs $3, while a 10-oz. bag costs $5. If your child does the math, they'll find that the $5 bag is the better bargain at $0.50 per ounce (as opposed to the $0.60 per ounce on the $3 bag).

, Explain what they can and can't buy based on how much they've saved. Tell them that they might have to wait to buy the things they don't really need if they come up short. Turn it into a math lesson as an educational bonus.For example, their account balance is $100, but they want a $60 video game and a $50 jacket. After some simple addition, they'll discover that they don't have enough money for both. They'll have to choose one or the other.

, Consider it a reward for doing their chores. Tell them that if they want to save up for shoes before the store's sale ends, they'll have to work harder for the money. This will teach them that they must earn money and not just expect it to come out of nowhere.Assign a different monetary value to each chore. It might help to pay more for the less appealing chores. Let's say your child hates washing the dishes but doesn't mind mowing the lawn. Pay them $1 more for dishwashing.

, Learning how to write checks, balance an account, etc. will lower the risk of budget shortfalls in adulthood. Start as early as possible, while your child is still at home and the consequences for mistakes aren't as severe. Set up the account with your child and monitor their spending habits.Not all banks allow underage teens to have checking accounts, but it's worth calling around to find one that does. If you hit this problem, give them control of their savings account., Emphasize that credit cards are borrowed money and that debit cards are automatic withdrawals from their bank account. Show your monthly statements to your child. Highlight the section on your bank account statement that itemizes debit card expenditures. If you keep a balance on your credit card, point out the information explaining how long it will take you to pay the balance off., This will teach them to manage their money and their time. Seek out local businesses that are willing to work with high school schedules. Help your child fill out job applications and make good impressions on prospective employers., While you shouldn't charge them rent just yet, remind them that luxuries are their responsibility. This includes expensive clothing, entertainment, and gas fill-ups. If they don't want to drive the family car, help them figure out how much they'll need to save until they can afford their own wheels. These lessons will prepare them for the responsibilities of adulthood., Most teens know how to keep track of money, but many blow through it before the next payday. If this happens with your child, allow them to experience the consequences of their actions. Remind them that you won't always be there in the future and to use this as a teachable moment."
"
Identify spoiled behavior.,
Ask yourself how you might be contributing to your child’s spoiled behavior.,
Break the cycle of saying ""yes"" when you should say ""no"".,
Get in tune with your child.,

Ignore complaints about what other children have and do.,
Don’t apologize for setting limits or saying no.,
Count your blessings together.",How to Unspoil a Child," Does your child regularly throw a tantrum or say mean things in order to get his way? Does she keep hounding you and asking for something even after you have said no? Does he act as if he expects things to always be his way, without ever having to do anything to earn it? Does she never say please or thank you for anything? All of these are the symptoms of spoiling.;
, There are many factors to consider, such as:


Are you afraid to say no to your child? Why? What happens when you do?
Do you find yourself regularly giving in to things you know you really should not?
Do you make a rule, a direction, or a give a punishment and then retract it if your child reacts negatively to it?
Do you frequently buy your child gifts that he or she does not need? Is it excessive? Has he or she become accustomed to this pattern?
If you answered yes to any of these questions, chances are you have contributed to your child’s spoiled behavior. Your child has learned that you don’t like saying no to him, that you are inconsistent with rules and regulations, and that he doesn’t need to do anything special or even behave well in order to get what he wants.

, It is simple, but this is an extremely hard habit to break. It is easier to give in to demands and avoid a tantrum. However, your child learns that he or she has the power of decision-making... not the adults.


When you start saying ""no"", be prepared for a big reaction. This is common. But if you give in to pleading, tantrums, or whines, the reaction will get worse and worse.
Once your children begin hearing “no,” they will become more accustomed to it. It is a fact of life that one cannot have everything, and either you teach your child that, or he or she goes into the world and has a much harder time of things.
Avoid lengthy explanations for saying no. You are in charge. There is nothing wrong with a short explanation, but do not get into lengthy discussions or you will give the impression that you are trying to convince the child rather than tell the child what the decision is.

For example, there is simply no way to convince a young child that he or she should not have ice cream for dinner. So do not go there.
Children will actually respect what you have to say more if you have good reasons for your decisions and you stick with them. , This can be difficult for parents who work a lot, but knowing the routines and rules of caregivers can be important for un-spoiling a child. If you and your child have built a relationship without good interpersonal connection, healthy boundaries, and proper roles, it is time to start addressing this.


If you have a caregiver who doesn’t enforce any rules while watching your child, this is something you’ll need to address with the caregiver. You are asking them (and possibly paying them) to watch your child and essentially to be the authority figure while you are working. This takes work on their part, and you don’t want someone who is lazy and has no rules while being trusted with the care of your child.
Even while both you and your child are at home, do you know what he’s doing while he’s in his room? Do you check occasionally to find out? Does he have his own TV and video games in there, and start watching or playing without permission? You may want to put the TV and video games in a family room instead.
Does your child leave the house to play with neighbors without permission? If so, you’ll need to stop this behavior right away, because it shows he does not respect you as an authority figure and it can actually be dangerous for him. A parent needs to know where their child physically is at all times., Every time your child asks for something, ask him to do something for you first. If he wants to go play with a neighbor, or wants to play video games, instead of just saying “go ahead,” ask him to clean up his room first, or to help you with the dishes or taking out the trash., One of the biggest reasons children become spoiled is because parents feel guilty for not spending as much time with them as they could. Between your work and the child’s activities (soccer, dance, etc.) and everyone’s social lives, it can be hard to do things as simple as eating dinner together as a family.


You need to carve out time for you and your kids to spend together, whether it’s eating a meal or just relaxing and talking. Your kids should spend time with extended family (grandparents, aunts and uncles, cousins) as well. Remember: jobs, activities, and friends may come and go, but your family relationships last a lifetime., Present your child or children with the guidelines for family life: the rules, expectations, chores, and so on.


Make clear where these rules are coming from. You are the adult, and you are helping everyone to become better. Rules help everyone know what is OK, and what is not. Explain that children do not have to like the rules, but they are expected to follow them., Include the when and how. Your child needs to know exactly what is expected. For instance, “I want you to throw dirty clothes in the clothes basket, not on the floor, every time you change,” and “I want you to put away what you’re playing with when you’re finished, before you start playing with something else.” You should always be as specific as possible., Once you have set rules, stick to them. If you do not, your child will simply learn that you can be successfully challenged, ignored, or bargained with.


Don’t second guess yourself. If you said, “Only one cookie” then start to think another one would maybe be okay, stick with what you said first. Even if having two cookies really is no big deal, kids might think that they can challenge you about everything.
When a rule is violated, give the consequence -- no unnecessary discussion. If, for example, your child does not clean his room even though he or she is required to do so and even though you gave a warning, then simply apply the punishment., Do not threaten to give a punishment you cannot or will not follow through with. Eventually your child will ""call your bluff"" and believe that you will not follow through on any consequences.


If you’re not sure what an appropriate consequence for a certain behavior is, say that you need time to think of the consequence. Consequences should be appropriate to the misdeed. For instance, if your child is being forgetful with completing homework, but is spending lots of time on her iPad, take away the iPad until you see an improvement with completing the school assignments. , Once you have said “no” to something or given a punishment for a particular behavior, do not go back on your decision. Stay calm, even if your child makes a scene. If you never give in, your child will learn that these tactics no longer work.


In public, this strategy can feel embarrassing and stressful, but it’s still better than giving in to bad behavior. If you must, leave the location and deal with your child at home, but do not go back on your decision., Make sure that you and your spouse or partner are on the same page, and let grandparents, babysitters, and other caregivers know what you are doing. It’s better if these people do not undermine your efforts by giving into extreme whining, excusing bad behavior, or showering your child with gifts., “Please” and “Thank you” should have been taught early in your child’s developing vocabulary. If they weren’t, it’s never too late to start. A simple way to teach a child to use these words is to use them yourself.


Say, “You need to clean up your room, please” instead of “Clean up your room now!!”
When your child is given something, prompt them to say thank you by saying, “Now what do you say?”Ask the other parent to help. If you made dinner, have your spouse say, “Thank you for making this, it’s very good… What do you say about dinner, kids?”

, When children are very small, it’s naturally fine to pick up after them. As early as possible, though, start teaching self-sufficiency and emphasizing the fact that every family member must contribute to the success of the household.


You might begin by teaching your child to pick up his or her toys after playing. As he or she grows, add additional expectations.

, It won’t work to expect your child to work hard if you don’t work hard yourself. Make sure your child sees you working and knows that you are often taking care of chores and errands when you would prefer to be doing something else.


Be polite in public. Say “please” and “thank you” to store clerks and servers at restaurants when you are buying things or ordering a meal. Say “excuse me” if you bump into someone accidentally, or if you need to interrupt a conversation or get someone’s attention., Bigger chores – cleaning one’s room, for example, or doing the dishes after a meal – can be overwhelming for children, so work together, at least at first. Doing so allows you to teach your child how to do chores properly. It also helps your them to feel more comfortable and capable.

, You are more likely to be successful in having chores completed if you follow a schedule for completing them. Children are less likely to complain once they realize that, for instance, they will always be expected to clean their rooms on Sundays.


Also, teach them that chores come before fun. If they have a responsibility to take care of that day, but Jake across the street called to hang out and play ball, have them complete the chore first and then go out and play., Children often struggle with patience, but they will be more successful in life if they learn that they need to wait and/or work for their rewards. Explain to your child that he or she cannot have what he wants immediately or all the time.


It can help to involve your child in planning something desirable, like a trip. Explain that you must first save a certain amount of money. Emphasize how much more rewarding the trip will feel because you waited and planned for it.
Let your child watch you not get everything you want right away. If you’re shopping and see a pair of jeans you like, but don’t think you should buy them, say, “Maybe I’ll just wait until they go on sale. I have other jeans that still look good.”, No matter what you can afford, it’s better not to buy your child everything he or she might want. In particular, try not to reward good behavior only with material items. Instead, reward your child with time spent together doing something fun.


Offer encouragement instead of gifts. If your child plays a great game of soccer, tell him how proud you are and how excited the coach was instead of buying a gift. If your child brings home an excellent report card, say you’re extremely proud, give her a hug, and offer to take her to a movie or to go on a bike ride together in the park instead of buying something., If your child is particularly invested in acquiring a certain material thing that is not a necessary item, use it as an opportunity to teach the value of a dollar. Help your child earn money through chores and save it. For more expensive things, you can require that your child earn and save a percentage of the cost and you will pay for the rest when you can., When your child says “but the other kids have . . .” or “but my friends don’t have to . . .” tell your child that he or she must follow the rules of your family. Emphasize the fact that you are doing what you believe is best, and that he should be grateful for what he has, because some kids also have less., If you can’t buy your child something because you can’t afford it, there is no need to apologize. Simply tell them the truth: “I’d like to buy it for you, but I just can’t. Maybe for a special occasion, like your birthday.” Or mention that they could save up for the item themselves.


Don’t apologize for applying the designated punishment for a bad behavior. Consequences are part of life, and your child needs to learn that he can’t act however he wants all the time. Learning to obey house rules now will help him to be able to obey rules at work and to obey laws when he's an adult.Save the apologies for when you've actually done something wrong (e.g. if you lost your temper and feel bad about it). Saying ""no"" isn't wrong; it's part of being a parent.

, Even if you’re not a spiritual or religious family, there’s nothing wrong with saying out loud things that you are thankful for. Kids may tend to talk about their toys at first, but encourage them to also talk about having each other, their pets, their health, their house, and their food.


Volunteer to help those less fortunate. Find out ways you can volunteer at a local animal shelter, homeless shelter, or soup kitchen. Or, make a list of items and organize a donation drive to bring necessary things to people (or animals) in need. It will make your children feel good about helping, and also cause them to be more grateful for the things that they have."

Have your guests dress for the theme too.",How to Plan a Medieval or Renaissance Wedding," Planning an outdoor wedding will open up your venue options and save you money, and you can use the natural landscape to create a medieval forest vibe on a budget.


Look for local gardens or parks that offer wedding packages. If a family member or friend has a large yard, ask if you can have the wedding there to save even more money.
If you’re planning a fall or winter wedding, check the weather before booking an outdoor venue. If there’s a chance of snow or bad weather, have the wedding indoors or plan accordingly.;
, Look for museums, bed and breakfasts, or historical landmarks that operate out of old castles. Call and ask if they do weddings. Your medieval celebration will be beautiful and authentic with a castle backdrop.

If renting out part of a castle is too expensive for you, look for smaller historic buildings that still offer a medieval-like atmosphere.

, The sprawling stone interior, stained-glass windows, and high vaulted ceilings will go perfectly with a medieval or Renaissance theme. Most cathedrals already have ornate interiors so you’ll save money on decorations., Many Renaissance festivals offer themed wedding packages that include traditional medieval food, music, and decor. Call your local Renaissance festival and inquire about their wedding deals if you're interested in an authentic medieval wedding ceremony without the hassle of organizing it yourself., Offer guests an array of meats, vegetables, dried fruits, and desserts so they feel like they’re attending a royal wedding., Opt for old-fashioned meats like venison and duck instead of chicken and fish for your entree. Serve the meat with common medieval vegetables like carrots, cabbage, and onion., Use black pepper, saffron, cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger to make your dishes taste like they would have in the middle ages. Use honey in place of sugar when you can., Offer tea and cider as non-alcoholic options. Serve guests their drinks in chalices for an extra medieval touch.If you want to offer guests a Renaissance-themed cocktail, make a rose soda using sugar, honey, water, and rose petals and mix in a spirit like vodka., Offer guests a variety of tarts, puddings, and custards with fruits like strawberries and figs. Serve dessert at the same time you serve the rest of your menu for a truly authentic medieval feast., Ask the baker to put a dragon or a crown on top, or ask that the entire cake be in the shape of a castle. Cut the cake using a miniature sword instead of a knife., Cover them with white or cream colored table cloths or use table runners to create the appearance of a royal feast. Sprinkle flower petals on the tables for an extra romantic touch. Have the wedding party share a table, with the wedded couple seated in the middle. You can also seat the wedded couple at their own, separate table that’s positioned so they can look out at all of their guests like a king and queen would., Candles will help create the pre-electricity, medieval vibe you’re going for. Use candelabras as part of your centerpieces or opt for smaller tea light candles and scatter them throughout your venue. Make sure the candles aren’t a fire hazard by placing them where guests won’t bump into them or knock them over., Use flowers that are earthy romantic colors like white, red, green, and pink. Make fresh floral table runners for your banquet tables. If you’re having a buffet-style feast, use some simple flower bouquets to enhance the presentation of the food tables.

Pink carnations symbolized marriage in medieval times. Use pink carnations in your flower arrangements to make your Renaissance wedding more authentic., Print your invitations on a scroll or parchment paper. Use a calligraphy pen with ink to give your invitations a genuine medieval look. Write your invitations using words that would have been used during the Middle Ages.


For example, instead of writing “You’re invited to our wedding” on the invitations, write “We request the honor of your presence as we celebrate our forever uniting in marriage.”
Make your invitations announcements of a royal engagement. For example, you could write “You and the rest of the kingdom are invited to this once-in-a-lifetime royal wedding celebration.”

, Find a long gown with a fitted bodice that is green or blue, and avoid wearing white. White was the color of mourning in medieval times. Accessorize the bride with a flower crown or a tiara.
Look online for a Renaissance-themed wedding dress if you’re having trouble finding one in stores.

, Find a high-collared jacket that goes to the knees and cinch it at the waist with a belt. Have the groom wear tights or tight-fitting pants with tall leather boots.

Accessorize the groom with a crown, cape, or faux fur jacket.
Grooms going for a medieval knight look can wear armor and a chain-mail shirt and pants. Attach a sword at the waist to complete the outfit.

, Dress them in long, ruffled dresses with puffed up sleeves. Make sure their dresses are a different color than the brides. Have them wear flower crowns and carry bouquets with matching flowers., Have them wear matching tunics cinched at the waist with rope or a belt. Give them swords and matching leather boots., On the wedding invitations, add a note about dressing up that says something like ""Wear your finest medieval fashions."" Check in with your guests before the wedding to make sure they understand the theme.

If you’re worried about guests not dressing up, have some spare costume items at the wedding just in case. Fill a box with flower crowns, swords, capes, and other medieval-themed props and leave it at the venue entrance so guests can pick something up as they arrive.

Keep in mind that hosting events in Hawaii are generally more expensive than hosting them on the mainland. Set up a budget so you know you will have enough money saved for a Hawaiian wedding.;
, Each island has something different to offer:


Oahu is where the capital, Honolulu is, and is the busiest of the islands, as most people who live in Hawaii live there. Consider this island if you have a lot of people coming to the wedding because it is easiest to travel to.
Hawaii is called ""The Big Island."" It is home to the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, so if you want your guests to be able to see an active volcano, The Big Island is ideal.
Maui is known as the most romantic Hawaiian island, so it would be suitable for a romantic Hawaiian wedding.
Kauai is known as ""The Garden Isle"" because of the lush vegetation. Consider this island if you relish a slow, laid-back atmosphere.
Lanai is called ""The Pineapple Island"" and is home to the most luxurious accommodations.
Molokai is known as ""The Friendly Island"" and does not house as many golf courses or hotels as the other islands. If you want the true Hawaiian experience, Molokai is a good choice.

, If you don't live in Hawaii but are planning a Hawaiian wedding, hiring a wedding planner who lives in Hawaii will lessen your workload. Your wedding planner will know of good venues, photographers, and caterers in the area.

, Traditionally, if you're going to have a Hawaiian wedding, you should get married on the beach. However, if you would rather have a church or synagogue wedding, explore different places of worship in the area and then find a reception venue nearby.

, Hire a band or DJ from Hawaii to play Hawaiian music and the popular Top 40 music.

, Serve traditional Hawaiian food and drink for an authentic Hawaiian wedding. Serve fruit that is native to the area, like pineapple, mango, and kiwi. Take advantage of all the delicious seafood and serve shrimp, sashimi, crab, and moi poke. You can also choose to have a traditional pig roast at your reception. Serve everything with some punch--alcoholic or non-alcoholic--and add some of the native fruit to the punch bowl.

, You can have a traditional wedding cake with Hawaiian designs and even have sliced fruit on the outside of the cake, placed on top of the frosting.

, Decide if you will just be inviting family or you will invite some close friends, as well. Maybe you want to open it up to all of your friends and family, in case they need an excuse to take a vacation. Either way, make sure you give your guests plenty of notice so they can save for travel and accommodations. If anyone can't or won't attend, don't be disappointed.

, Hawaii is a summer place, so wear white lightweight wedding clothes with leis for on your head and around your neck. Choose white comfortable wedding shoes for dancing.

Focus on making it fun and exciting.,
Kit out your kids.,
Choose plants that are easy to grow.,
Show your children the basics of planting seeds and seedlings in the ground.,
Include wildlife in your child's gardening experience.,
Show children how to grow plants from cuttings.,
Make things for the garden.,
Decorate the garden with your kids' art and craft efforts.,
Talk to your kids about the importance of native vegetation in gardens.,
Acknowledge the place of the digital era in gardening.,
Show kids how to compost.,
Keep gardening even when the season changes.,
Keep making gardening an exciting experience and be enthusiastic about it.",How to Teach Kids to Garden," When children realize how many interesting, intriguing and even gross things there are to be involved in, they'll be more likely to want to get involved. Whenever planning anything, work out the fun angle, to keep your children's interest engaged.;
, A big part of the fun is having the right tools and there are many gardening tools made just for kids, in their size, and in wonderful colors. Colorful tools, while not essential, are a helpful way to encourage kids to join in. Gardening gloves for kids often come in wonderful colors and patterns too and each child should have a pair of his or her own.


Buy a pretty watering can which suits the child's size and strength. This will encourage him or her to keep watering the growing plants.






Show children how to clean and put away tools after use. Make this easy and fun too––a bit of splashing about should be part of the cleaning chores.







, While it's important to involve your children in choosing the plants, make sure that the choice is from plants likely to be as trouble-free as possible, especially for beginner gardeners. Also choose a few plants that will produce a delicious edible harvest for your children to pick and take straight to the table from the garden. Some good starter choices include:


Sunflowers
Radishes
Squash

Tomatoes (from seedlings)
Lettuces
Peas and beans

Sweet peas, poppies, alyssum, marigolds, pansies or nasturtiums.

, Do the hard work of tilling the soil and adding the nutrients for them––they can learn about that later. For now, give them the joy of planting, watering and waiting for their little plants to sprout.


For very small hands, make the job even easier by planting the seeds in cardboard egg cartons. When it comes time to transfer the seedling (or the seed) to the soil, cut out each little egg holding portion and let your kids plant the whole thing into the ground. The carton will disintegrate and no seeds or seedlings get lost in the transition.

, Add a birdbath, bird feeder and feeders for any furry wildlife such as squirrels, hedgehogs, possums, or whatever it's okay to attract to your yard. If you have space, include a small pond for fish. Children will love the experience of seeing animals in the garden.


Tell children which animals should not be attracted to your garden! Help them to understand the beneficial role of animals in gardening, as well as pest problems.
If you have a large garden, you might include more pets, such as a rabbit or guinea pig enclosure, a goat or sheep, etc.

, This will amaze them endlessly, to see how you can take a cutting and get a new plant. Try plants that take easily to begin with, such as succulents, begonias, pelargoniums and bromeliads. They can experiment with harder ones as they become more experienced.

, Get crafty with the kids and recycle, repurpose and remake things that can serve as decorations or tools in the garden. There are lots of possibilities, including:


Turning an old tire into a garden bed or plant protector
Making herb or plant markers from iced confectionery sticks
Painting a planter or flowerpot container in bright colors and designs. Be sure to say how pretty their own flowers would look inside it.
Make a scarecrow to frighten away the birds; or make bird frighteners using old CDs, bits of unwanted foil and clothing, etc.
Make a dangling decoration from shells, beads and pebbles, using thread or fishing line.
Turn coconut shell halves into seedling pots––clean the inside, paint the outside like a face and anything that sprouts will seem like hair.
Make a bird feeder
Design a garden plan.

, After you've made the objects, or purchased some at the garden center with your kids' agreement, have the kids decide where they'd like the garden decorations to go. Encourage continued decorating projects, including removal of decorations that have become a little worse for wear over time.

, Explain that while it's fun to grow flowers and veggies, care needs to be taken to prevent non-native plants from escaping the garden and invading the local environment. Show them how to control weeds and how to keep strong growing plants under control. Explain to them why you cannot grow some plants in the garden, such as plants that are considered to be invasive species. Encourage them to learn as much as possible about native plants and how to care for these.

, Kids love computers and electronic gadgets and it can be hard to get them off sometimes. However, you can make the most of their affinity for all things electronic and have them download a suitable gardening app or two, and by doing research about their garden and its plants online. Gardening calendars are another useful tool found in many online gardening sites. And as the kids get older, help them to use the internet to search for harder garden projects, like making a sundial, building a chicken coop or rigging up a solar power warming pad. Encourage the exchange of knowledge online into real achievements in the garden––this is a good lesson in ensuring that they see the computer as a tool in wider life activities.

, It can be a lot of fun seeing kitchen scraps turn to fertile soil in time. Make sure that they don't get rostered to do compost deliveries every day though, or they'll resent it! Share the task around. Another great way to enthuse kids about compost and fertilizer is to get a worm farm. Show them how it works, how to feed the worms and how to handle them. They'll probably start naming the worms and wanting to see them regularly.

, Bring the garden indoors for winter, so that your kids can still enjoy the benefits of growing plants and learn how some plants can actually thrive in an indoor environment. Good choices include a small herb garden, a windowsill planter, a terrarium built in an unwanted fish tank, or a window box.


Another idea for an indoor growing project is to grow a bulb in a bottle. Fill a bottle with water and place a hyacinth bulb at the top. Task your kids to keep the water level topped off and to wait for roots to develop. As the roots come on, tell them to be patient for the flowers to appear. You get both a gardening lesson and a beautiful table centerpiece from the one project!

, Gardening is an experience for life and one of the lessons it teaches children is that there is a season for everything and that it all cycles again. Learning this can be highly beneficial, especially for children prone to spending a lot of time indoors and in cars going to other indoor places.

Venues can be expensive, and knowing how much money you have to spend on one will help you narrow down your choices and make a better decision. Keep in mind that some venues may not be available for weddings during the fall because it’s considered off-season.When you’re doing your research, call some venues to see if they have any special discounts. Some venues will give you a deal when you book a wedding off-season with them.;
, This will affect which venues you look at during your search. Ask yourself what the fall weather is like in the region the wedding will be in. If there’s a chance of snow, consider having the wedding indoors or moving the date to earlier in the fall., Make sure they’re in your budget. The internet is a great resource for finding venues in your area, and you can read online reviews for different venues you’re interested in. When you’re looking at different venues for a fall wedding, ask yourself if the venue can accommodate all your guests and if it’s easily accessible in case of inclement weather., Once you’ve done your research and secured a venue, you’ll be ready to start planning the rest of your fall wedding. Reserve a venue further in advance to ensure you get the dates you want., If you’re planning an outdoor fall wedding, start checking the weather forecast a month before the wedding date. If there’s a chance of cold weather, make the necessary preparations in advance so you’re not stressed out on the big day., With the right presentation, you can turn basic fall staples like pumpkin pie and squash into elegant appetizers and dishes for your fall wedding.


Instead of serving salad, try serving a fall-time soup like butternut squash soup. This will keep guests warm and happy, especially if you’re having an outdoor fall wedding.
Opt for darker meats like lamb or pork instead of chicken and fish for your entree. Serve the dish with a traditional fall side like mashed potatoes or glazed vegetables., Flavors like cinnamon, nutmeg, and pumpkin are fall favorites, and there are a variety of ways you can incorporate these flavors into cocktails to make fall-themed drinks. If you’re not serving alcohol at your wedding or you want a non-alcoholic drink option for guests, offer apple cider or ask the bartender to make some cocktails without alcohol.

If you plan on serving champagne at your wedding, add some pomegranate seeds to each glass to give them a fall touch.Hot toddies make a great fall wedding cocktail. You just need bourbon, honey, lemon juice, and hot water. Add a cinnamon stick for a fall-themed garnish.If you’re serving punch, add berries and cinnamon to give it a fall taste., Order a cake with fall colors like orange, red, and yellow. Ask if the bakery can add decorative leaves or fall flowers like mums made out of frosting. If you’re not serving cake or you want to offer guests more options, serve pumpkin pie and caramel apples., Finding flowers for a fall wedding can be a challenge because most popular wedding flowers are out of season during the fall. Find flowers that are in bloom in the fall that will also match your theme.


Mums, asters, and astilbe flowers are great flowers for decorating a fall wedding.Any flowers with red, orange, or yellow hues will go well with a fall theme.Don’t feel limited to using just flowers. Incorporating plants like ferns, lamb’s ear, or berry plants is a great way to work around the limited fall flower selection, and they’ll make your centerpieces pop., Nothing says fall more than pumpkins and gourds, and they’re cheap, so using them to decorate will help you save on your budget. Place them next to your centerpieces or use them to decorate the bar. Spray paint them gold or silver and place them around your wedding venue for an easy elegant decoration., Use tablecloths and napkins that are fall colors like red, orange, and yellow. If you’re having round tables, place artificial fall leaves around your centerpieces. If you’re having banquet-style tables, have a line of artificial fall leaves running down the center. Decorate each plate with a small fall-themed ornament like a crabapple or a gourd., If you’re planning an outdoor fall wedding, an elegant wedding tent will help keep guests warm. Ask the company you’re renting from if they offer tents with sides so your guests will be sheltered from any inclement weather., Rugs are a great accent to an outdoor fall wedding, and they’ll cover the fallen leaves on the ground which might get cold, wet, and slippery from snow or rain., If you’re planning an outdoor wedding and there’s a chance it will be cold, rent some portable space heaters in advance so you have them just in case. Strategically place them throughout the venue in the locations guests will be gathering., Print them on leaf-shaped paper or tie an actual fall leaf to the invitation with a red, orange, or yellow ribbon. Send them out in fall-colored envelopes., If you’re planning an outdoor fall wedding, know the weather forecast before selecting a dress. If the weather is going to be cold, choose a long-sleeve dress or prepare to have a jacket on hand for the reception.

, Look for dresses made of satin or silk, and avoid dresses in summer colors like bright pink or sky blue. Instead, opt for earth tone or light jewel tone dresses. If the weather is going to be cold and you’re having an outdoor wedding, keep that in mind when you’re doing your shopping., Textured suit jackets and pants are popular for fall weddings. If you want a unique look that goes with the wedding’s fall theme, opt for a brown or gray suit instead of the more traditional black tuxedo. If you’re planning an outdoor wedding and it’s going to be cold, have the groomsmen wear cardigans or sweaters over nice button-ups with ties."

Model being a good friend.,
Provide opportunities to socialize.,
Show them other friendships.",How to Teach Kids About Friendship1," Kids are always paying attention to the things we do and say whether we realize it or not. One easy way to teach kids about friendship, then, is to let them see you being a good friend. Modeling friendship will give them an example of how friends act and reinforce some of the things you teach them about friendship.


Let kids see you interacting with other people in a positive way. For example, allow them to overhear you greeting a friend or colleague warmly.
For instance, you might tell your kids, “My friend is a little sad, so I need to be a good friend and try to cheer him up.”;
, Children of all ages enjoy spending time with their peers and socializing is an important part of their development. By providing structured and unstructured time for kids to socialize you can teach them about friendship.These opportunities will give them real-world experience in making friends and maintaining friendships.


If you’re a parent, then set up a play date for your kids. Stay for a while to monitor how the kids interact and to meet the other parents.
If you are a teacher or mentor then try to encourage positive interactions between peers by assigning group activities and giving the kids opportunities to learn and play with one another.

, Just as kids watch adults, they also learn from other people and situations around them. There are examples of friendship all around that you can use to teach kids how to have positive social interactions.For example, if you’re watching TV with your kids, you might say, “ Wow! They seem like they’re really good friends. Look at how they act with each other. “

"
"
Talk about emotions.,
Discuss being loyal.,
Talk about how to support someone.,
Emphasize honesty.",How to Teach Kids About Friendship2," Explain that no matter how old you are, it is natural to have negative emotions and selfish thoughts. However, in order for us to develop friendships, we need to take control of these thoughts and replace them with love and empathy. Start talking to your children at an early age about emotions and self-control, and show them how to practice taking control of your emotions by acting as a positive role model on a daily basis.Children who are taught early about emotional self-control, and are exposed to positive role models, are better able to maintain that self-control, empathy, and problem-solving skills. This will ultimately help them to establish long lasting happy friendships.

, A large part of teaching kids about friendship will include talking to them about what it means to be a friend. When you talk to them, explain that being friend means sticking with the people you care about and sometimes even taking up for them.For example, you could say, “A good friend doesn’t stop playing with someone just because someone new comes around. They try to play with everyone.”
Or, you might tell them, “Sometimes friendship means standing up for the people you care about if someone else is bothering them.”

, When you explain what friendship means to kids, it can be useful to discuss how to be there for someone and support them.Let the kids know that friends are there for one another when things are fun and going well, but also when things aren’t going so well.


You might tell them, for instance, “Friendship means holding your friend’s hand or just listening to them when they’re upset.”

, It’s hard, if not impossible, to be a good friend If you aren’t being truthful with the people close to you. Explain to kids that a big part of friendship is being honest with others about how you feel, who you are, and everything else.For example, you might tell your kids, “Friends trust each other and are honest with each other about who they are, the things they do and don’t like, and more.”

"
"
Talk about resolving conflict.,
Give them feedback.,
Make use of teachable moments.,
Be authoritative rather than authoritarian.",How to Teach Kids About Friendship3," Kids are still learning how to monitor their emotions and handle situations appropriately. As such, there will be times that they don’t get along or act very friendly. It can be tempting to step in with a solution when you see this happening. Instead of trying to solve their problems for them, you can teach kids about friendship if you teach them to think critically and resolve their own conflicts.For instance, you might ask, “You have great problem-solving skills. What’s one way that you guys can all play the game?”
Or, for instance, you might say, “How do you think friends should handle a situation like this?”

, While kids can do a good job at using their problem-solving skills and resolving conflict, sometimes they may need assistance. You can teach them a lot about friendship and conflict resolution by giving them feedback about the situation and their behavior.For example, if two kids are arguing over a toy, you might say, “I don’t think this is the way you all really want to handle this. Let’s take a time-out and brainstorm solutions.”
Or, you might say, “I like how you guys are working together to come up with a fair way to handle this situation. That’s good problem-solving. Keep going!”

, Teachable moments are natural events and situations that occur that give you a real-world opportunity to teach or reinforce something you already taught. When you’re teaching kids about friendship, look for those moments in the day when you can emphasize something you’ve taught them about friendship.For example, if you’re out with your kids and notice some adults arguing, use it as an opportunity to talk about conflict resolution.
Or, for instance, if you’re watching a webisode together and see two of the characters disagreeing, you can talk to the kids about how the characters handled the situation.
You may also want to assist your child with reading body language. You can do this by showing them with your own facial expressions and body language and explaining, what they convey.

, Children who are raised by authoritarian parents are more likely to have low levels of esteem and low self-worth, as well as greater hostility, rage, and controlling tendencies. These can make it quite challenging for children to develop healthy, long lasting relationships with their peers. They may even lead to mental health concerns later in life.An authoritarian parent is one who usually avoids discussion of issues that may arise, and will more likely jump to control the particular behavior or situation through punishment.
An authoritative parent is one who approach issues with warmth and compassion. They gently guide a child with a behavioral problem through rational discussion, and provides explanation of the reasons for the rules.
Children who are raised in an authoritative environment have less aggressive behaviors, are more self-reliant, and have an easier time with developing great friendships with peers.

The bride should wear a kimono made of white silk. These can be expensive, so save your money before you make this purchase.
The groom should wear a haori--which is a type of shirt--and a hakama instead of trousers. These should both be in black.
Have the bridesmaids also wear kimonos. The bride will choose the color. Consider having each bridesmaid dress in a different color kimono.
Buy your kimono at least a couple of months in advance. Practice putting it on before the day of the ceremony, as it is difficult to get the fit right on the first try. Have someone help you if you are unsure of how the kimono should fit.
Change clothes during the ceremony. It's becoming common to wear a kimono for the wedding ceremony and a traditional white wedding gown for the reception, or vice versa.

, Serve traditional Japanese food, such as sushi, sea bream, or kombu soup. French and Chinese food is also often served at Japanese weddings. Try not to serve the courses in groups of 4, as this number has negative implications in Japanese culture.

Stack 3 cups on top of each other.
Take 3 sips from each of the cups, starting with the smallest cup and ending with the largest cup.
Have family members drink after the bride and groom so they are included in the new marriage.

Plan your outfits.",How to Plan a Civil Ceremony for Your Wedding," For most civil ceremonies, you would go to city hall. You can also go to a judge's chambers or a lawyers office. If you don't like these locations, you can really have your civil ceremony anywhere. If you'd rather have it outside somewhere, plan to find a venue like a public garden, a nature reserve or a public park.;
, You can find a judge to officiate or hire a pastor or rabbi if you would like a religious figure to officiate. If you hire a pastor or rabbi, they do not always charge a fee, but you can still give them a cash gift to thank them for taking the time to officiate. You will also need to talk to your officiant about the schedule for the ceremony.

, State rules vary, but you will probably need to get this within 30 days of your planned civil ceremony date. It will also cost about 50 dollars, and you may need to take with you a copy of your birth certificate or other form of identification.

, Most civil ceremonies are shorter than traditional church wedding ceremonies, but that doesn't mean you can't play specific music or have friends do a reading. Pick music that you like and choose readings that have a significant meaning to you and your future spouse.

, Your officiant should be able to supply you with some vow examples, or you can completely write your own. Start with traditional vows and edit them into something that is meaningful to the both of you.

, Even if you don't plan on inviting all of your friends and family, you will still need 2 witnesses to be at the civil ceremony to sign the marriage certificate.

, Aside from your 2 witnesses, you may want to invite close friends and family. Decide who you absolutely must have at your civil ceremony and send out invitations 6 to 8 weeks in advance.

, Since you're having a civil ceremony, you won't be required to wear the traditional white dress or tux. You may still want to dress up, however, so don't let the fact that you're having a civil ceremony hold you back. Make sure to tell your guests what the attire is so they know what to wear as well.

Send out your wedding invitations at least 3-6 months in advance if possible letting those you would like to be in attendance know about the cost involved in getting to the destination and what the the room rates will be once they are there.

",How to Plan a Destination Wedding," Consider whether you can leave much of the planning to someone else. If you like to control everything you do, including little details, a destination wedding may not be the best choice. If you are going to have a wedding away from your home, you need to trust the people handling your wedding arrangements at the destination you have chosen. Understand the following realities:


Destination weddings inherently involve more unknown factors and will require you to trust somebody else and their judgment in coming up with solutions for your wedding. For instance, you may have to rely on your decorator's opinion on the details for how you want your wedding to look.
Similarly, you may not be able to view the venue in person until a few days before the wedding, or the wedding itself. You must also be willing to rely on reliability of the company or hotel managing the venue.
You must be comfortable with knowing how to pick reputable vendors and know how to handle some degree of ambiguity.;
, If you're not careful, weddings, especially destination weddings, can get very expensive very quickly. Take into account all possible costs, writing down everything that will need to be paid for. Think about how much money you and your partner can afford to spend on your wedding, and talk about this with your parents or anyone else who might contribute to your wedding. Once you've figured out how much you can spend, prioritize your purchases so that you spend the most money only on the things you need most. Having a budget set from the beginning of your planning will ensure that you can follow through on all your plans., Or, opt in for an all-inclusive option which is likely to be offered by the hotel you are having the reception at. You'll need to let the experts handle all the particulars. Instead, enjoy some time with your relatives and friends and just have a hassle-free wedding.

, A destination wedding may not be suitable for couples who want a large celebration that includes many members of their families, distant relatives and friends. You will need to keep in mind that some people will not be able to afford the plane tickets, hotel stays, or even taking time off from work to fly out to the destination where you are having your wedding. If this happens, don't be disappointed.

, If you have decided that you won't have issues giving up some control of the details to somebody else and are thinking of smaller weddings, then start organizing your destination wedding. Prepare to enjoy the fun the destination wedding offers. Imagine all you can do with your loved ones while you are there.

, Talk to your partner and your families and decide on the best place to hold your wedding. Think about the cost of travel to each destination you consider, as well as accommodations for you and your guests once you arrive. Consider possible venues at whatever locations you consider before coming to your final decision.


Go online to look up reviews for your choice of destination. If only bad reviews exist, find another destination.

, Consider weather patterns at the place where you'll get married, and choose a date that will allow for the best possible weather.

, Figure out how many days you'll need for final set-up details, rehearsals, the wedding, the reception, and any other events you'll have.

,, Spend some time searching for the right people to help plan your wedding by looking online or learning from others' experiences. Choose vendors carefully. When you travel overseas, you will have to deal with people who don't even speak your language. Thoroughly study the profiles of the florists, photographers, DJ's and the caterers before making any payments. If wedding planner services are available in the country, you might want to consider working with them too, to be on the safe side.


Contact a wedding planner, venue organizers, an officiator, a band or DJ, a caterer, a cake baker, photographers, and transportation and security officials if needed, and look into decorations and clothes like a wedding dress.

, Make sure you comply with all laws and regulations for your home country as well as the country where your wedding will take place.

, Encourage your guests to do the same.

Shoot firecrackers.",How to Plan a Chinese Wedding," Family is very important in the Chinese culture, so make sure to include your parents in all of the planning and proceedings. Before you begin planning your Chinese wedding, talk to your parents and grandparents about what Chinese wedding traditions you should include in your wedding.;
, Do this with what's called ""bridal cakes."" This serves as your wedding announcement. Your bridal cakes should be sent to the friends and relatives you intend to invite to your wedding. Traditionally, the groom's family pays for these cakes, but the bride's family distributes them.

, Once you send out your wedding announcements, or bridal cakes, that is a signal for your friends and family to begin sending congratulatory gifts. The bride and her family are responsible for receiving the gifts.

, The bride should wear a red wedding dress at a Chinese wedding. This symbolizes love and joy. If you don't want a dress that is completely red, buy a traditional white wedding dress and add red embellishments.

, There are a couple of rituals that you can perform for a traditional Chinese wedding experience.


Bathe the bride. The bride's family should prepare a luxurious bath for the bride on the night before the wedding. Put pomelo in the water, which is a type of grapefruit. The pomelo is said to get rid of evil spirits.
Perform the hair combing ceremony. After the bride bathes, she should sit in a candlelit room so her mother can comb her hair 4 times. Each combing symbolizes something different. The first is for beginning to end; the second is for harmony from youth to old age; the third is for the hopes of many grandchildren; and the fourth is a wish for wealth for the couple and the hope that the marriage lasts many years.

,


The bride, according to custom, should serve tea to her parents on the morning of the wedding. This should be done in her home before the groom arrives.
Perform a tea ceremony at the wedding ceremony, in front of the guests. The couple should serve the tea to their parents as a sign of respect.

, The meal will last a long time (possibly 3 hours or more). Serve foods like fish and suckling pig.

, Hire a team of dancers to perform the lion dance. This may cost quite a bit of money, depending on how many dancers you hire and how much experience the dancers have.

, Time the firecrackers to coincide with the lion dance. In Chinese culture, people shoot firecrackers at a wedding as a wish of good luck for the newlywed couple.

Think about combining your wedding with other events.",How to Plan a Christmas Wedding1," As many events occur around the holidays, it may be pricier to book a traditional venue like a church. If money is an issue, look into alternative venues.If you're having a winter wedding in a warmer region, consider marrying in an outdoor park. Usually, the only fee required is a small registration fee.
See if you have space in your backyard or someone else's. It will not cost much money to have your wedding in your own backyard if you have enough space.;
, When planning the date, it's best to avoid marrying on Christmas day. Many people will have existing obligations and be unable to attend. Also, having people arrive on Christmas day means travel costs can skyrocket. Instead of a Christmas day wedding, plan your wedding around the season.Many people start feeling festive any time after Thanksgiving. You can try planning your wedding sometime between Thanksgiving and Christmas. This way, you can use a Christmas theme without inconveniencing your guests.
Try to pick a date that does not interfere too much with existing travel plans. If guests come from a variety of different places, many of them may already have tickets to other destinations on the days closest to Christmas. A wedding earlier in December may be easier for many people to manage.

, The time of day you have your wedding actually has a big effect on cost. If you're looking to cut down on the budget, a morning ceremony is a good idea. Rates go up for locations in the afternoon and evening, and breakfast and brunch catering services tend to be less pricey. If you're looking to save money, be open to the idea of a ceremony earlier in the day.However, there may be reasons other than cost affecting the time. If you have people who will be traveling the day of, a later ceremony may be a good idea as this will help make sure everyone arrives in time.

, There are likely to be a lot of parties and events going on during the season. You do not want your wedding to be a source of stress or scheduling conflicts. See if you can combine your wedding with other holiday events.For example, does your family throw a Christmas party each year? If people are already planning on attending that party, why not have your wedding before the party? The party can serve as a combination Christmas party and reception.

Pick your wedding colors.,
Be open to warmer wardrobe options for an outdoor event.,
Figure out how to stay warm in a wedding dress.,
Opt for velvet suits.",How to Plan a Christmas Wedding2," If you want a Christmas theme, you can go with classic Christmas colors like reds, greens, silvers, and golds. However, you do not have to limit yourself if you're not in love with classic wedding colors. There are many wintery shades you can opt for that will still reflect the season.Think about berry colors, like deep burgundies or purples. These have a Christmas feel without being too traditional.
Also, consider different shades of greens. You do not have to use the bright, primary green associated with holiday decorations. Softer, wintery greens can be a great wedding color as well.

, If you're doing an outdoor event, think about how to keep the wedding party warm. Even if you're in a warmer region, like California, temperatures can dip to the 50's in December. It's a good idea to plan on bundling everyone up a little.Allow members of the wedding party to wear fashionable coats as part of their outfits. Dressy blazers, cardigans, or pashminas can keep the wedding party warm while still keeping things classy.
Keep footwear in mind and allow people to wear warmer shoes. Requiring bridesmaids to wear heels even though it's going to be chilly out, for example, is a bad idea. Allow closed-toed shoes for the wedding party.

, Even for an indoor ceremony, you may want to dress a little warmer. Drafts and breezes can get in from outside and you'll be outdoors going to and from the wedding. If you're marrying in a colder climate, find ways to stay warm in your wedding dress.A long-sleeved wedding dress can make more sense for a winter wedding.
Wear tights under your dress if it's on the longer side. No one will notice and you will stay warm.
Instead of flats or heels, consider wearing fashionable boots on your wedding day.

, Velvet suits can keep you feeling warmer. Velvet is also a festive color that can keep the Christmas theme strong. If you're going to be wearing a suit on your big day, opt for velvet."

Think about including a Christmas tree.,
Go for sparkly, snow-related decorations.,
Choose Christmas-related food and beverages.,
Keep your options open regarding flowers.",How to Plan a Christmas Wedding3," As your wedding is Christmas-themed, a big tree in the center of the reception area can really make things feel festive. Christmas trees can be purchased in a variety of places around the Christmas season and are simple to set up on your own time.A fun way to combine the season and your wedding is to choose wedding-themed decorations for the tree. You can, for example, garnish the tree in black and white ribbons.
Give it a sentimental touch. Punch holes through various pictures of you and your spouse and then thread string through the holes. Hang these up on the tree for your big day.

, Incorporate snow into your decorations. Pick light white, gray, and ivory decorations that sparkle a little. This will remind guests of snow, which is often a staple of the Christmas season.Have glittery white vases holding flowers as the centerpiece of each table.
Use sparkly gray or white tablecloths for tables at the reception.
Crystal can also have a snow-like feel, so opt for crystal glasses, plates, and silverware during the reception.

, When choosing food and drinks, go with a Christmas theme. For the main course, pick a version of a traditional Christmas dinner. You could, for example, serve some kind of roast carvery style. For example, have guests have slices of a baked ham for dinner.If you're serving alcohol, pick Christmas-themed cocktails like mulled wine and spiked eggnog.
Keep your desserts in the spirit of the season. Go for flavors people associate with Christmas, such as nutmeg and peppermint.

, Flowers can be tricky for a Christmas wedding, as many flowers are out of season during the winter months. If you have your heart set on a particular type of flower, you may end up having to pay a very high price. Therefore, be flexible regarding flower choices.Have a long list of acceptable flowers on hand before visiting a florist. You may have to go with your second, third, or even fourth choice depending on the price and season.
It may be a good idea to go in without specific flowers in mind. Talk to a florist about affordable, in-season options. With flowers, the more flexible you are the better for a Christmas wedding.

Be aware of all December/January holidays.,
Allow for extra travel time.,
Provide Christmas-related gift packages if you want to thank your guests for attending your special day.,
Be courteous regarding costs of travel.",How to Plan a Christmas Wedding4," Not everyone celebrates Christmas. If you have guests who participate in other religious holidays around the Christmas season, be aware of this. You do not want to plan your ceremony on an important day of Hanukkah, for example.Read up on all holidays that take place around Christmas. Avoid picking a date that interferes with other holidays, especially if you know for a fact you have guests attending that celebrate holidays like Hanukkah or Ramadan.

, The weather can be unpredictable during December. Even if you live in a warm region, if you have guests flying in from Ohio, there may be flight or driving delays. When booking hotels, do so in a way that allows a little wiggle room. Make sure guests can arrive a few days prior to the wedding rather than the day before. This way, if there's a delay due to weather, guests will not be at as high of risk of missing your ceremony., When assembling gift packages, use your Christmas theme to your advantage. Give your guests Christmas related items.Give your guests Christmas-related snacks. Pack gift bags with things like hot cocoa and Christmas cookies.
Ornaments can be a nice touch. Try giving members of the wedding party ornaments with their names on them as a gift.

, Review average prices of hotels and plane tickets when picking your travel date. You do not want to force guests to spend extra money attending your wedding by planning your festivities on peak travel days. Try to find a date where cost of travel is reasonable as to not put your guests out."

You can have it in your backyard, a local restaurant, or a park.Have fun decorating. Add classics like checkerboard tables. Use something outdoorsy, like wildflowers, for centerpieces.
If you go this route, have a backup plan if you plan to have the dinner outdoors. It could always rain.;
, Bowling is a fun activity guests will enjoy participating in between food and drinks. If you or your spouse loves bowling, try renting a bowling alley for the night. You will have to rent several lanes to fit everyone and may have to talk to the manager about your plans.A fun twist can be having a bowling competition with prizes at the end of the night.

, If you live near a beach, consider having a rehearsal dinner there. This can be a great choice if you're doing a tropical themed wedding. You can allow guests to enjoy the waves while you serve a picnic dinner for everyone.Check the restrictions of local beaches regarding food and drinks.
Remember to have a backup plan in case it rains.

, Instead of traditional dishes, fondue can add extra fun to your wedding. You can provide cheese fondue for dinner and chocolate for dessert, giving guests the chance to sample various dips with meats, breads, and fruits.If you have a fondue dinner at home, you may need to hire a cleaning crew as fondue is messy.
Make sure to provide plenty of napkins.

, Include classic casino games at your rehearsal dinner, such as roulette and black jack. Invitations can be sent out on customized playing cards. You can also raffle off prizes or play bingo. You can deal cards yourself or hire a professional dealer for the night.Guests will be moving around a lot, so the event may feel less intimate. Consider having a sit down meal between the games.

, When deciding on events, consider your venue. Pick events fitting with the place you chose that would work into the general theme.For example, have guests play a round of golf for a rehearsal dinner at a golf course.
If you're doing something outdoors, like a picnic or beach dinner, play outdoor friendly games. You can play something like beach ball or corn hole at an outdoor rehearsal dinner.
If you're having a rehearsal dinner at a local entertainment center, think about having guests compete with things like arcade games., A wine or beer tasting can be a fun event for a rehearsal dinner.

, If you and your partner are movie buffs, this can work particularly well. You can rent a projector and show one of your favorite romantic movies during your dinner. Provide snacks, like classic movie candy and popcorn.Think about renting a popcorn machine for the day to get authentic movie popcorn.

, Games can be a great way to add fun to any event. Think about board games, especially group games like jenga. You can also opt to play something like charades or Pictionary.Try a trivia competition. You can have one act as the host of a trivia night or even go to a bar that offers trivia.
Try sports games. Bring some baseballs and gloves to your wedding and play baseball.

, A dessert buffet is a fun twist on wedding desserts. Place an array of delicious treats on a buffet in back. If you're doing a formal dinner, where guests are served one course at a time, a dessert buffet can be a fun treat after.You can make your own desserts or hire caterers.

, A rehearsal dinner has less strict requirements on invitations. You do not need to invite the entire wedding party. It's usually an intimate get together of your closest friends and family members, so invite people who make you and your partner happy. A small gathering of very close friends and family members will make for a fun rehearsal dinner.However, be careful not to snub anyone. If there is a friend or family member who will expect an invitation, always include them.

, Traditionally, toasts are given by the host of the event, the bride's father, and then the best man.However, there is no reason to follow this rule strictly. In addition to allowing the traditional people to toast, allow someone fun and funny to give a toast for your big day. For example, if you have a bridesmaid who does stand up comedy, ask her to give a toast.

, Wedding rehearsal dinners have a lot of formal rules and regulations, but you do not need to follow all of them strictly. In order to have fun, allow guests to relax a little. Emphasize your dinner is more about enjoying one another's company than following formal rules.Don't have a stringent dress code. Let guests dress however they feel comfortable.
Don't do a seating chart. Let guests sit wherever they want.
Avoid too strict of a schedule. Introduce toasts casually, while people are eating, instead of having a separate time altogether for toasts versus food.

Incorporate personal touches.",How to Plan a Backyard Barbecue Wedding Shower," Before you can plan the layout for your wedding shower, it’s important to determine how much space is available in the yard. In a smaller yard, it may be easier to set up one large table for all of the guests. In a larger yard, you may prefer to set up several smaller tables throughout the space for guests.In addition to the table(s) for guests, you may want to include a table for the gifts and one for the cake or desserts.
At a backyard wedding shower, it’s also a good idea to set up a drink station so guests can help themselves to cocktails and other beverages. You can use a table or a kitchen cart depending on the size of the yard.
It’s also important to make sure that there’s enough room for the grill at a barbecue wedding shower. Verify that there will be enough space around it for the cook(s) to work comfortably.;
, In addition to tables where guests can eat, you’ll want to include some other seating options so guests can mingle throughout the shower. Simple benches work well, as do folding lawn chairs.More formal outdoor furniture, such as a wicker chair or loveseat, is also a nice option.
If you want the barbecue shower to have an informal, picnic-like feel, lay down some blankets in the grass and add large pillows or cushions for guests to sit on.

, Depending on the time of day that you hold the shower and how shady the yard is, you may want to consider adding some type of sun coverings to protect guests from the harsh rays. Simple outdoor umbrellas work well, but you can also purchase small portable tents that you can place in extremely sunny areas in the yard.If the yard has no shade at all and you’re holding the shower in the middle of the day, you may want to rent a large tent to cover the entire area.
Make sure that the areas where you plan to keep the food and beverages are properly shielded too. Food can spoil more quickly when left out in the hot sun.

, Hopefully, you’ll have beautiful weather on the day of the shower, but it’s important to plan for poor weather just in case. Moving the shower indoors in the event that it rains is usually the easiest option if your house is large enough.A large rented tent can be an effective option if you want to hold the shower rain or shine.
You may decide that you want to postpone if the weather is bad. If that’s the case, list the backup date on the invitation so friends and family can keep that day and time available too -- and set a specific time for when you’ll decide to cancel the event, such as the night before or the morning of.

, Barbecuing food can be a time consuming process because you have to stand over the grill to ensure that the food doesn’t burn. You may want to hire caterers to handle the barbecuing so you can enjoy time with your guests and the guest(s) of honor.Many catering companies or barbecue restaurants are equipped to handle barbecues. They will supply the food, and in most cases, the grill equipment, so you only have to worry about having the room to accommodate them.
Catering the shower will obviously cost more than preparing the barbecue yourself, so it’s not the best option if you’re on a budget.
If you don’t want to pay extra for catering, consider asking a friend or family member who isn’t on the guest list to help with the grilling.

, No matter what type of shower you’re hosting, it’s usually easier to serve the food buffet-style. However, at a backyard barbecue event, it’s an especially good idea because serving guests one by one takes a long time. Set up a table or two to place the food, plates, and cutlery on, and allow the guests to help themselves.If you’re concerned about the food from the grill getting cold, use chafing dishes to keep the dishes warm. You can find chafing dishes, racks, and fuel at any party supply store.

, Because barbecuing the main course will take some time, it’s best to choose simple hors d’oeuvres or appetizers that don’t require much -- or any -- cooking time. For example, simple skewers with fresh vegetables, fruit, and cheese can be a tasty appetizer that you can prepare ahead of time. Your favorite dip or spread with an assortment of crackers or breadsticks also works well.Make a simple antipasto platter with fresh cheeses, salami, olives, and roasted red peppers, and serve it with crackers or bread.
If you want hot appetizers, consider making a couple of pizzas that you can cook right on the grill. Add your favorite toppings, and cut them into bite size pieces for guests to enjoy.

, Instead of the usual barbecue fare of burgers and hotdogs, opt for more sophisticated dishes, such as barbecued chicken, steak, brisket, or seafood. Kabobs that alternate meat with vegetables are ideal options too. If you’re going for a more casual shower and the guest of honor is a fan, you might even consider barbecuing some ribs.Any grilled meat dish can be simple but delicious if you find the right marinade. Search online for some recipes that the guest(s) of honor is sure to enjoy.
Make sure to have a vegetarian option on hand. Grilled vegetable skewers are usually the easiest way to go, but you can also grill whole portobello mushrooms to serve as “steaks.” Tofu steaks are another option.

, Because grilling the meat or other main course will require most of your attention, you may want to get some help with the side dishes. Visit your local grocery store or deli to purchase premade sides that are traditionally served at barbecues, such as coleslaw, potato salad, or pasta salad, so you don’t have to worry about making them yourself.If you want to make the side dishes yourself, prepare them the day before so you don’t have to worry about finishing them when you’re manning the grill.
If you want to have some warm sides, think about options that you can easily toss on the grill so you don’t have to run inside to the kitchen. Grilled corn is a classic barbecue side, as are grilled potatoes.

, It’s always fun to choose a signature cocktail for a wedding shower -- and rename it to celebrate the guest(s) of honor. Keep up the barbecue theme by choosing an iced tea- or lemonade-based option. Make sure to have a non-alcoholic option available as well, though.If you want the guests to mix their own cocktails, make sure to print out instructions and leave them at the drink station where they’re easily accessible.
You can get the best of both worlds by making an Arnold Palmer, which is a mixture of lemonade and iced tea, and adding your favorite spirit, such as bourbon or vodka. Mix up a batch without the alcohol too.

, You’ll want a special dessert to celebrate the guest(s) of honor’s upcoming wedding, but it doesn’t necessarily have to be a cake. Consider playing up the fun barbecue theme by opting for a pie instead. You can go classic with a cherry or apple pie, but it’s best to choose the guest(s) of honor’s favorite.If you prefer a cake for the shower, you may also want to make mini pies for the dessert table. Heart-shaped hand pies are an ideal option.
If the guest(s) of honor isn’t a fan of pies, cupcakes are another sweet option for a barbecue wedding shower. Make a large display of them to present to the guest(s) of honor, and then serve an individual cupcake to each guest.
Cookies are another delicious option for the dessert table. Sugar or butter cookies with the guest(s) of honor’s monogram(s) in icing can be a fun touch.

, You may have decided that the barbecue aspect is the theme of the shower, but you don’t necessarily have to decorate with that look in mind. If the guest(s) of honor has a particular interest that you want to emphasize, incorporate that into the shower’s decor.A tropical or luau theme can be fun for a backyard barbecue shower.

, To make the backyard shower feel special, it helps to create a defined entrance to the party. You might decorate an arbor or trellis with balloons or flowers, or place a wooden sign with the guest(s) of honor’s name in the ground at the backyard gate to help welcome guests.Even placing simple potted plants or flowers in an arrangement at the gate can help create a defined entrance for the shower.

, To play up the barbecue or picnic feel of the shower, gingham tablecloths and napkins are an ideal option. Customize the look to the event that you’re celebrating, though, by using gingham in a shade that corresponds to the couple’s wedding color palette.If you want to fully recreate the wedding’s color scheme, incorporate solid pops of the other shades in the palette for the shower decor through plates, cups, balloons, and other small touches.

, With a shower that takes place outdoors, you want to take advantage of the lovely scenery in the yard. Large, ornate floral arrangements aren’t necessary if there is greenery and flowers in the yard. Instead, gather simple bunches of flowers that you can place in small jars or vases on the tables throughout the shower.For the most elegant, cohesive look, choose flowers that are similar to those growing in the yard.

, If you’re holding your backyard barbecue shower in the evening or at night, you’ll need some lighting. Wind strings of twinkling lights through the trees and bushes, or hang them over the area where you’ve set up the tables. Paper lanterns can also add color and light to the event.For a simple, elegant look, white string lights are the best option. If you prefer a most festive feel for the shower, choose multicolored or colored string lights.
Candlelight is also effective mood lighting. Scatter votive candles on the tables throughout the yard.

, To make any shower special, you should include items that celebrate the happy couple. Place photos of them on the gift or dessert table or hang monogram letters on a fence or wall to make the shower feel more personal.Create a fun garland from photos of the couple by using small clothespins to attach the pictures to ribbon or twine. String the garland across the yard or in specific areas, such as over the dessert table.

Customize your cake.",How to Personalize Your Wedding," Remember that, above all, this is your day. Speak with your partner and try to settle on a theme that seems fun and interesting to both of you - a common interest or something you are both passionate about. You can structure your wedding around virtually anything., Your decorations, location, and even attire can all be themed around your favorite book series. Programs can have your favorite quotes and you can dance to the soundtrack of your favorite film for your first dance.


Make it medieval with Lord of the Rings or Game of Thrones.
Embrace fantasy with Harry Potter or Alice in Wonderland.
Go futuristic with Star Wars or Star Trek.

, And also the places that you’ve been! A travel themed wedding could be a cute way to go through all the special locations and moments in your relationship while also showing where you want to go next.Programs could be made to look like maps and each table at your reception could have an object related to future destinations.

, Get decorations that show your team colors and maybe even divide your guests by who likes who. Some sport arenas and gyms are even available for booking wedding venues, so you could have a sport themed wedding in that kind of stadium., If you and your partner are really interested in music or theater, you could hold your wedding ceremony on the actual stage of a theater.Setting up the venue is easy because there is already a middle aisle to walk down and plenty of seating. Programs could be made to look like performance programs and you could hold your first dance right there on stage.

, Use traditional clothing and foods from your heritages to create an interesting clash of cultures.The rich history and traditions of your families will combine and your older family members are bound to love it. Serve dishes from both of your heritages at the reception, regardless of how well they go together.

, There is nothing wrong with choosing to hold a simple traditional wedding! It may not be the most unique and original starting point, but your wedding is what you make of it. Even if you do not want to have a particular theme, there are still so many other ways to add your own personal twist to the ceremony or reception., Depending on how many people you plan to invite, this may become physically exhausting. Handwritten invitations are immediately more personal than any typed font could be - it’s your own personal font! Agree on a format, split a stack of invitations with your partner and start writing. They will not all look the same, but that’s the point! Each invitation will be one of a kind.If writing the full invitations by hand is too time consuming, you can always type up the actual invitation and only write the name and address by hand.

, Envelopes can take many forms, both manufactured and homemade. The invitation itself can be folded into a type of envelope, but it’s recommended to place it inside of something else to avoid being damaged. But why use regular envelopes when you can make your very own personalized invitations!Create your own personalized envelope by vertically folding a standard sheet of paper into three equal sections. Unfold the paper then fold the two long edges in by an inch. Refold the bottom third onto the middle third and glue it in place on the edges. You now have a sealed pocket in which to place your invitation, then fold the remaining third down and seal it in place with tape or glue.

, If you are feeling more tech savvy and want to avoid the whole process of mailing invitations, create a website for your special day and share the link with those you want to invite.The website should contain details regarding time and locations of the ceremony and receptions. It should include further information for expected attire, parking, and a gift registry. You can include an option on the site to RSVP for themselves and whoever they are permitted to bring.


Certain websites like The Knot have resources that can help you create your own site regardless of technical skill.

, The location of your wedding ceremony is important for many reasons, but it also lets you build on your wedding theme. Churches are the default option for many weddings, but choosing a unique and special location can add a more personal feeling to your ceremony.


For example, rustic themed weddings can be held in the countryside or on a farm while nautical weddings could be held on a beach.

, Go back through your relationship and see if there are any special moments that happened in a place that you could revisit and could hold the venue. If you like the idea of revisiting important locations but none of them seem to work, you can always turn it into your wedding theme and include references to important places as decorations or table centerpieces.


Special locations can include where any of your first moments happened, like where you first met or went out.

, Depending on where you choose to hold your wedding, seating could either be troublesome to find or automatically included. Churches are convenient for that reason because they have pews to hold many people, but there are other spaces that have just as much seating. For example, some theaters, schools, and sport stadiums are available to book for your venue.


If you want to hold your wedding outdoors, get creative and make the seating part of the theme! Hay bales, for example, can be used to reinforce a rustic theme and provide interesting places to sit.

, Decorations are where your theme really shines. The three greatest places to decorate at a wedding are the aisle, the altar, and the tables at the reception.For the aisle you can roll out a red Hollywood carpet or attach beautiful bouquets to the end of each row.
The stage or altar that you are getting married on should be simple enough that all the focus is on you, but have enough character so that all the picture will be uniquely yours.
Table centerpieces at the reception are limitless when it comes to decorative potential. You could use simple items like candles, river stones, or vases with flowers, or you could place a prop or item relevant to your theme on each table.

, Vows are a perfect way to add a personal tone to the ceremony and be yourself with your partner. If you want to write your own vows, agree on a format beforehand with your partner so they match in terms of tone. You can make them funny or personal and sentimental. Just be creative and read other vows for inspiration., If you happen to have a close mutual friend who is a talented singer, consider asking them to sing at your wedding. If you have a close friend who could not be a part of the wedding party but you still want to include, offer to let them read a particular passage from a religious or otherwise significant text., It’s a relatively simple process to become an ordained minister. If you and your partner have someone special that you would love to officiate your wedding, they can! It’s a quick and free process to become an ordained minister online and in return they’ll be able to officiate weddings and sign the marriage license.


Be careful, though, as some states do not officially recognize marriages officiated by someone who became a minister for a day to do so.Check your state’s requirements to ensure that you can pursue this option.

, One of the best parts of any reception besides the music and conversation is the food. If you have a particular food in mind, chances are you will be able to find someone willing to cater it. Many business and restaurants have special catering deals, so scout around and see who you could afford.If you have a close friend who is a great cook, consider asking (and paying) them to cater your wedding. If they could not feasibly cook for your entire venue, they could also just cook for your rehearsal dinner instead!

, You can start off your first dance by dancing to a classic wedding song like “Amazed” or “At Last” then switching halfway through to a more exciting and modern song instead!If you want to really impress your guests, consider taking some dance lessons with your partner before the wedding and impress everyone with your new skills.

, Obviously choose a flavor that you and everyone else will enjoy, but take some creative liberties with ordering or making a very unique cake. Custom wedding cakes can come in any size or shape, so browse several sites and try and find one that is fun and has something to do with your theme.


Cakes can be customized using little decorations and cake toppers that relate to your theme. If you cannot find official toppers, you can just use figurines or make your own references by drawing them in frosting.

,, (keep in mind the flower should be completely under water and the glass beads should hold its place)

,,, Take about 3-4 petals and place them on the square candle plate surrounding the vase and candle holder.

These are available at every jewelry counter for sizing rings.Your ring should fit your finger comfortably. It needs to be snug enough so that it stays on, but loose enough to slide off at the knuckle.;
, The size of your finger changes very subtly, depending on the time of the day, what you've been doing, and the kind of weather. Fingers are smaller in the early morning and when cold.


Try to measure your finger a couple times at different times of day, to make sure you get an accurate sizing for your ring.
Don't use string or a measuring tape to try to measure your finger size. This can be pretty inaccurate, and lead to ill-fitting rings.

, The following sizes are should be the width of your finger. If, after using the ring-sizer, you find that you're comfortable between two, always go a size up.

, Most rings can be resized by professional jewelers, if you find the ring has become tight over time. If you return it to the place where you purchased it, they'll often do it for free.


Milgrain and some other types of Tungsten rings can't usually be resized.

, Traditionally, wedding bands and engagement rings are worn on the left hand in Western countries, but some Eastern Orthodox people choose to wear wedding bands on their right hand. Generally, though, rings can be worn on both hands and the symbolism of ring placement is increasingly flexible.


According to some the right hand represents the active hand, symbolizing work and activity, while the left hand symbolizes emotions, beliefs, and character., In astrology and palmistry, the little finger is thought to represent persuasive character and persuasiveness, but it's also a just free finger that really makes an attractive ring pop. Sometimes, a ring on your little finger and look jaunty and fun, especially with a wide band.

, The middle finger is usually an uncommon finger to wear rings on, because it interferes with your ability to use your hand, often. If you do choose to wear a ring on your middle finger, make sure it's a small and thin band.


For some people, it's also problematic to wear a ring on the middle finger because it can be used for crude gestures. So, drawing attention to the finger can be undesirable for some people.

, In most western countries, the wedding band and associated rings are typically worn on the third finger, or the ""ring"" finger. Typically, this is done on the left hand. If you're concerned about giving people the wrong impression, but like wearing a ring on your ring finger, wear it on your right hand.

, The index finger and thumb are surprisingly comfortable places to wear rings. Typically, royal crests and other large stones were worn on the index finger to draw people's attention. Wearing a ring on these fingers can make a statement in a big way.It's thought to be a sign of wealth in some cultures.

, Rings should be used to highlight the color scheme and formality of an outfit that you're wearing. Also, you want to wear the same color rings as you are with your necklace, bracelet, earrings, or whatever other jewelry you're wearing.


If you're wearing a silver necklace and silver earrings, for example, you don't want to wear all gold rings.
Determine which rings are appropriate based on how casual your outfit is, what other jewelry you are wearing and how these rings can be mixed.

, These rings are larger and bolder than the average ring. These are meant to be worn alone, not combined with other rings.


Wedding or engagement rings are often ""formal"" looking however most fashionistas agree that they can be worn with any other rings. Most rings that have precious stones should be reserved for dressy occasions.

, Bands are casual, but can also be considered formal as well. Always appropriate, these rings are simple or decorated metal rings. These can be worn with other rings on the same hand.

, Stackable rings are a new fashion where several rings are layered on the same finger to create a cluster effect. Precious stone version should not be mixed with rings on other fingers, whereas casual version are appropriate to mix.

, You don't want to be wearing too many rings all at once, or wear too many rings on one hand. Balance them evenly, so you're not wearing three rings on one hand and none on the other.


In addition to this, you want to space them out on your fingers. If you don't usually wear rings, try only wearing one for a while as a small accessory.
One who chooses more minimal style can stack on many rings on both hands without over-doing it. For example, a simple silver band next to tiny, delicate silver midi ring worn at the first knuckle can be stylish.

, One who chooses to wear larger rings, like cocktail rings, should provide a balance by choosing one statement piece and either wearing it alone, or pairing it with more understated and delicate jewelry.


Mixing metals is certainly acceptable, but sticking to just two tones at once is a safer bet. Wearing gold, rose gold, silver, and gunmetal rings all at once seems a little cluttered.

, If you are attracted to dramatic fashion, choose something larger and interesting. If you are more of a minimalist and like clean lines, choose smaller, more delicate rings. There's no wrong way to wear a ring.

Create a guest list.",How to Plan a Brunch Wedding1," Talk with your fiancée and consider your finances when making this decision. Estimate how much you can afford to reasonably spend on the entire wedding and reception. Once you have this overall amount, break down the costs into various categories, such as food or entertainment. Brunch weddings are generally more cost-effective than their evening counterparts.Estimates for brunch weddings range from $17 to $85 per person generally.
Make sure to negotiate for discounted rates with all of your vendors as you are not using what is considered a “prime” time slot.;
, Get out a journal or pad of paper and make a note of every wedding-related task that comes to mind. Include everything from the mundane, like pet feeding plans, to the complicated, such as choosing a caterer. If you like, organize these tasks according to time sensitivity and then check them off as they are completed.Look online for some great wedding planning lists to get you started. Use this as a jumping off point and then customize them to suit your particular needs.

, Choose a location that is within close driving, or even walking, distance from your wedding site. This will make it easier for your guests to move from one place to another. It is also possible to have both events take place in one location, especially in the case of a brunch wedding at a restaurant or at someone’s home., This is the standard window for a brunch wedding and gives you enough time for an early or mid-morning wedding followed by a reception. Keep in mind that a ceremony at 9 a.m. or 10 a.m. may require that you and your guests get up quite early, depending on the event details. You may also want to offer some light breakfast foods to keep your guests from getting too hungry between events.
Also, consider the travel time table of your guests. Those coming from out-of-town may need to get a hotel room or other lodgings for the night before. A Sunday or Saturday brunch can work particularly well for those persons who have to travel, but must be back at work on Monday., Talk with your fiancée, consider your budget, and the type of wedding that you would like to have. Write down the names of those persons who you would like to invite and consider their scheduling needs. Some people who work weekends may have to send their regrets, for example.

Consider that the more voices you have in the wedding planning process, the more conflicting opinions and ideas you will have to navigate and compromise between.;
, The number of people included in your wedding party will be impacted by what their roles will be during the ceremony. Do you intend to have all members of the party stand up with you during the exchange of vows, only the maid of honor and best man, or will all of them be seated for the ceremony?, While you can do whatever you want with your big day, generally speaking the larger the wedding, the more attendants you will have. Additionally, a more formal wedding typically has more attendants, while a semi-formal wedding may only have a few, and city hall wedding may have just one pair or none at all.There are no exact guidelines, but typically large, formal weddings will have anywhere between five and ten pairs of attendants, while smaller weddings or more informal weddings will have one to five pairs.

, One of the first things you need to do once you have decided what role your wedding party will play in the ceremony is contact your venue. They may have certain limitations regarding how many people can fit at the altar or whatever the vow exchange is to take place. Likewise, seating space in the first row may be limited if you plan to have your wedding party seated during the ceremony.Ask the venue outright, “Are there any restrictions regarding how many people we can have standing with us during the ceremony?”
Smaller venues and public venues such as a city hall might not allow anyone except the partners to be married to stand during the ceremony.

, If you plan to have your bridesmaids carrying bouquets and boutonnieres for the groomsmen, remember that you assume the cost of those floral arrangements. Likewise, traditionally gifts are given to both bridesmaids and groomsmen as a thank-you for their time and effort, and transportation for photographs, which will add additional expense onto the wedding.Speak directly with your florist about package deals for bouquets and boutineers, and get an estimate of how much it will cost to provide arrangements to your wedding party before you set your size.
Likewise, look online or in bridal stores for gift ideas for the wedding party to get a sense of what the expense for those items will be.

, Your wedding party size will be determined in part by your wants and needs, and in part by the ability of the people you ask. If you have a friend or relative with whom you are close, but you know they do not have the time or the finances to dedicate to being in the wedding party, do not ask them to participate in that way.If you truly want this person included but finances are an issue, consider being willing to subsidize costs like the dress or suit, as well as their portion of any parties you expect them to attend.
You may also consider a different role for this person in your wedding, such as acting as an usher or having them do a reading during the ceremony.

, You may have a certain group of friends and family members that you want up there with you, but remember that your partner may have family members they want to involve, as well. If you are considering a gender-traditional wedding party and your partner has a brother or sister that will not fit on their side, talk to them about if they want their sibling involved as one of your bridesmaids or groomsmen., You do not need to invite someone to be in your wedding party simply because they asked you to be in their wedding. Likewise, you do not need to invite someone simply because they are related to you or have known you a long time.If you have a close friend or family member who is not in support of your relationship, it may be best to not request they be in the wedding party, regardless of how close they are to you. Your party needs to be there for both partners.

, Try to only bring in people to your wedding party who will be supportive, responsive, and communicative. These people will have their own responsibilities during your wedding, and you want to make sure they are ready and willing to handle them.


If a close friend is critical of your partnership, consider whether they can set aside their own feeling in support of you and your partner. If they can't, there's no need to include them, regardless of how long you have known them.
Likewise, if a close friend or family member has a history of being flaky, it may be wise not to trust them as a part of your party. Party members will have to assume certain responsibilities, and they need to be able reasonably handle these.

, Friends tend to be more understanding of not being in a wedding party comprised of only family. If you are worried about offending close friends because you had to make some difficult choices, consider restricting the wedding party to family including siblings, cousins, and other close family members., Instead of a full wedding party, you may decide to only have one honorary pair of attendants, such as a maid of honor and best man. This can be a happy balance for couples that want the help and support of close friends or family, but do not want the stress or cost of a large wedding party., There are a number of reasons to not have a formal wedding party, from sparing other’s feelings to keeping costs low for your big day. Not having a wedding party can be an easy way to save stress and money, if either are a concern. Additionally, it saves your potential party members time and money leading up to the wedding.You may still ask a friend or family member to be involved in the planning process. If there is someone you want involved, let them know that you value their time and input, and would like their help in your wedding planning process.

, You may decide against having certain people stand up with you during your ceremony or in photos, but you may still decide to ask people who are special to you to wear a certain color or attend a rehearsal dinner. Decide what parts of the wedding party you want to keep and ask people close to you to participate., If you decide against having a formal wedding party, there are still ways you can honor those important to you during your wedding. You may ask certain people to still be in photos with you, or you could have a portion of the reception where you and your partner thank the people who supported you and helped get both of you to the altar. You may also invite your close friends and family to a rehearsal dinner-style event as a way of thanking them for their help and support.

Even though you are choosing a brunch wedding, the standard needs of a photographer and entertainment will need to be arranged well in advance., Look over the space and try to envision it during the late morning hours. Estimate whether or not the lighting will be sufficient or if you will need extra illumination. Consider what the temperature of the space will be when filled with people – will it be too hot or too cold? If you are considering an outside space, begin to think up a back-up plan in case the weather turns bad., Brunch weddings are often considered less formal, as they are early daytime events. However, use the décor to send a message of festive formality by including fine china or specialty linens. Go with high-end, natural items, such as rattan chairs.Also, don’t be afraid to embrace rich colors that fit the season. For example, for a fall brunch wedding, consider incorporating deep reds and rich brown tones., If you want to include a dance floor or DJ, go ahead and do so. However, it may take some additional persuading to get people out on the dance floor and some just won’t participate at all. Give your guests other activities to do, such as completing a customized scavenger hunt, working on personalized crossword puzzles, or posing with funny props in a photo booth or against a backdrop., On the invitations, encourage your guests to dress up by mentioning “Mid-Day Brunch Formal” or “Garden Party” attire. The wedding party can go as formal as black tie or as casual as you choose. Coordinating on the basis of colors or patterns is always a fun idea with everyone wearing a shade of red or a type of polka dots., Transitions in brunch weddings can be difficult as guests do not always know where they should be and when. To address this, have a clear plan regarding how you would like the party to unfold and on what timetable. When you and your partner decide to leave it might be a good idea to suggest additional afternoon activities for your guests to pursue, such as taking a tour of the area."

Consider a cocktail brunch or buffet.,
Include morning cocktails.,
Include ample non-alcoholic drink options.,
Get creative with the dessert options.,
Give some thought to current food and drink trends.",How to Plan a Brunch Wedding3," Early in the morning people may not have an appetite for heavy food offerings. Go with fruits, yogurts, poached salmon, various tarts, quiches, omelets, and the like. If you want to get creative, do a play on traditional lunch foods by serving breakfast pizza, for example.Providing a variety of food options will also help to satisfy those with specific dietary requirements, such as vegetarians.

, Seated meals are usually more appropriate for evening weddings, so it is best to go with a cocktail setting, where guests can choose from a variety of small bites, or a traditional buffet-style meal. Both of these options are low-key, but can be made more formal with small touches, such as black tie brunch servers., If you choose to offer alcohol, make sure to include it alongside food options. Go with morning themed beverages, such as mimosas, bellinis, and flutes of champagne. Tie in the fruit that you serve by including fruit garnishes in the drinks, like fresh berries.You will likely save some money on alcohol by having a brunch wedding, as people tend to drink less in the morning and mid-day.

, It is important to offer a wide array of non-alcoholic drink choices for your younger guests or those choosing to abstain. Again, go with beverages that suit the morning period, such as teas, coffees, smoothies, juices, lemonades, and milks. Spike these drinks with fruit for an extra punch, like watermelon lemonade or raspberry tea., Feel free to offer a traditional wedding cake.

Shade the whole area.",How to Plan a Beach Wedding1," If there is a particular foreign or faraway beach that strikes your fancy, you can plan a destination wedding. Be aware, however, that attending this type of wedding may be inconvenient and expensive for your guests.If you live near the beach, consider having your wedding close to home. Your guests will appreciate the convenience and lower cost, and you will probably have a bigger turnout for your event.Local beach wedding. If you live near a coast, this is the simplest type of beach wedding. You can plan the wedding on your own, or hire a wedding planner.
Resort destination wedding. Resorts like Sandals or Dreams will usually help you plan a simple or an elaborate wedding.
Professional destination wedding. These can be held in the U.S. or in your favorite vacation destination. You will need to hire a professional wedding planner. It's usually a good idea to find a planner who is local to the area you plan to hold your wedding.
Public U.S. beach. You can usually hold a wedding ceremony on any American beach, as long as you check with the local authorities and procure any necessary permits.
Private U.S. beach. For a smaller wedding of 50 or fewer guests, you may be able to find a private homeowner who will let you use their personal beach. Try checking Airbnb to see if there are any hosts in your chosen area who will rent you their beach.;
, If you hold your wedding during the day, the water will make a beautiful backdrop for the couple. If you plan an evening wedding, you probably won't be able to see much of the sea.Some beaches can get very hot during the middle of the day, which won't be comfortable for you or your guests. Try planning your ceremony at a cooler time of day, like the morning or late afternoon.

, Any time you plan an outdoor event, you should come up with a contingency plan in the event of rain or high winds.If you choose a resort hotel, try to reserve a meeting room in advance, in case you need to use it.
If you had planned to have the wedding on the beach and the reception at home, you may need to hold the ceremony in your house, as well.
Rent a tent. If the weather is windy, but not dangerous, you could set up the altar, walkway, and guest seating under a large temporary tent. Many companies rent tents for this purpose.

, If you are holding your wedding at a beach resort, ask the manager if the beach will be reserved for you alone. If not, you may be able to pay extra to have the beach all to yourself for the length of the ceremony.Lack of privacy is one of the downsides to having your wedding in a public venue.
If you are only able to rent a portion of the beach, try creating privacy by erecting screens on both sides of the ceremony site. Stick tall bamboo poles in the sand and string fine wire or clothesline between them. Drape sheer white fabric over the clothesline or wire.
If you will be renting a large tent, this will create some privacy as well. Arrange the outdoor altar and guest chairs so that the tent is between the ceremony area and the public area.

, If you don't already have a favorite color scheme in mind, consider a color palette that is currently in style. Pale colors often work best for beach weddings, but you can choose any color scheme you like.Stark black and white can be very dramatic, but dark colors will be uncomfortable in the heat.
Currently, the most popular colors for bridesmaids dresses (in general) are: mint green, coral, emerald green, bright purple, pale pink, pale beige, dark blue, black, white, and grey.
Teal, purple, and green works well for an evening wedding by the sea.
Silver, ivory, and beige create an elegant effect.
Coral, fuchsia, and navy are great for a nautical theme.
Sea glass blue with ivory and green can work for a formal or an informal beach wedding.
Marigold (orange), gold and white is a great color scheme for late summer beach weddings.
Canary yellow with tangerine and peach creates a vivid, colorful look for an outdoor wedding.

, A unity candle is a traditional approach, but outdoor weddings can cause breezes that blow out the candle flame before the ceremony is complete. There are many options for a beach wedding.A unity candle is a large candle with multiple wicks, that is lit by the bride and groom (and sometimes by the couple's children, as well).
A sand ceremony is appropriate for a beach wedding. Find a beautiful vase or canister, and have the bride and groom contribute a handful of sand as a symbol of their commitment. It's best to avoid glass containers at a beach wedding, as unexpected gusts of wind can topple and break them.
A handfasting ceremony is a romantic way to symbolically join together husband and wife. The ceremony officiant or an older relative can give a short speech while the bride and groom hold hands. They will then loosely wrap a beautiful silk cloth or ribbon around the couple's wrists.

, Certain types of flowers are more likely to wilt and droop, and won't hold up for the length of your wedding ceremony. Be sure to tell your florist or wedding planner that you will be having a beach wedding, so you can select flowers appropriate to the occasion.Flowers that wilt easily include: freesia, bour varia, and poppies.
Flowers that do well in the sun include: plumeria, chrysanthemums, and orchids.

, If you can't imagine your wedding without a stunning gown and impractical high heels, consider creating a simple walkway that leads to the altar.Buy sections of plywood at a hardware store, and arrange them to make a path down the aisle.
Cover the walkway with sand, so the guests won't be able to see it.

, When arranging the seating, be sure to include some kind of shade for your guests. You could rent a tarp for this purpose. You could also poke bamboo poles into the sand and drape a light-weight white fabric over them to create a beautiful canopy."

Wear your wedding band on your ring finger.,
Wear your wedding band and engagement ring on separate hands.,
Alternate between your wedding band and engagement ring.,
Wear your wedding ring on whichever finger you want!",How to Wear a Wedding Ring1," Your ring finger is the finger next to your pinkie on your left hand. This tradition originated in ancient Rome, where is was believed that the vein in the ring finger ran directly to the heart. The Romans called this vein the ""vena amoris"" or vein of love and wore their wedding bands on this finger as a way to signify romance.This is a pretty cute reason to wear your ring on your ring finger. Here are some ways to do it:


Place your wedding band on your left hand ring finger and wear it alone.
Try wearing your wedding band and engagement ring together in the order you received them. This means that the diamond ring goes on the bottom and the wedding band on top of it. This is the traditional way of wearing rings, but it may not work for every ring style.
Wear them together with the engagement ring on top instead. Maybe your rings look nicer or fit better this way. Some people prefer to wear their rings this way because they feel that wearing the wedding band on the bottom keeps it closer to the heart.;
, Place your wedding ring on your right hand ring finger and your engagement ring on the other, or the other way around. This is a less traditional option, but there are many good reasons to wear your rings this way. Here are some things to consider:


This arrangement may be more comfortable for people with shorter fingers or who don't like having more than one ring on each finger.
This can be a nice way to display your rings if you don't have a matching set or if your rings don't fit well next to each other.
Perhaps both of your rings are simply so stunning that they need to be displayed alone and without distraction.

, Though both rings are intended to be worn, and most women do, some choose not to wear both of them at the same time. Here are some things to consider:


One ring may be very expensive and you might like to reserve it for special occasions.
Some people are more comfortable wearing just one ring at a time, but still want a chance to wear them both. Alternating rings can a nice compromise.

, You're married now, you can make your own decisions about these things! It's your ring, wear it how you want. Here are some things to consider:


Engagement rings are mostly worn on the ring finger of the left hand. Most people who wear their engagement rings stick to tradition.
Promise rings are often worn on the ring finger of the right hand.
Though there may be an “official” way of wearing your rings, this is the 21st Century and you can make your own way of doing things. Your ring is beautiful and will look amazing on whichever finger you prefer to wear it.

Choose the right silhouette for the bridal gown.,
Choose an appropriate material for the bridal gown.,
Skip the veil.,
Try an updo.,
Go barefoot.,
Dress male wedding party members in casual clothes.,
Choose appropriate dresses for the bridesmaids.,
Wear sunscreen.",How to Plan a Beach Wedding2," A huge, flouncy, complicated wedding gown can be extremely heavy and could even cause heat stroke if the weather is warm enough. A simple gown of a light material is best, and it will be easier to keep it clean and out of the sand.A column dress is a simple sheath that can be worn in many lengths, from full length to above the knee. These can be fitted loosely, to skim the body (best for larger figures), or snugly, to hug the body (best for tall, narrow figures).
An A-line gown is shaped like an inverted V, and is flattering for all figures. A gown with simple, uncluttered lines is best for a beach wedding.
A sleeveless gown with open shoulders is a good choice for beach temperatures. A halter top neckline is very appropriate for a less formal beach wedding.
Beach weddings are the perfect time to try a casual, bohemian dress in a short or maxi length. Try an unstructured babydoll silhouette, or a layered look with a crocheted top layer that shows a glimpse of skin.

, Heavy materials like brocade, jacquard, or velvet will be very uncomfortable at a beach wedding. Choose a lighter fabric that allows air to circulate, which will keep the bride from overheating or perspiring on her big day.If you like structured fabrics, try organza, or its slightly sturdier cousin gazar. Other good formal choices are shantung (a nubby, raw silk) or taffeta (a crisp, elegant material that rustles when it moves).
For a soft look, try chiffon (a transparent fabric usually used for sleeves and outer layers), georgette (a heavier version of chiffon), silk crepe, or lace.
Jersey is a stretch material that travels well because it does not crease easily. It tends to be very form-fitting.
Tulle can give you a lovely “ballerina” look, especially in a lovely tea length that would be convenient to wear on the beach.

, A long veil can be difficult to manage if it is windy on your special day. Unless you really need to wear a veil, try a fascinator or an arrangement of fresh, cut flowers in your hair., For a beach wedding, you will want your hair to cooperate and to look good for as long as possible. If it's very windy out, long hair or complicated styles might not last very long. Ask your stylist to arrange your hair in a tight, stylish updo that won't come undone in the wind. You could leave a few tendrils of hair loose, to soften the overall effect., The easiest way to have a beach wedding is for all parties to go barefoot, and then put your shoes on later, for the reception.If you can't stand the idea of going barefoot, simple, flat sandals are the next best thing.
If you do choose to go barefoot, consider laying out a fabric runner along the aisle to protect your feet from hot sand.

, A tuxedo is simply too hot and uncomfortable to wear at a beach wedding. Arrange for the groom, groomsmen, and ushers to wear light, breathable fabrics and save the tux for the reception.Try a lightweight suit made of seersucker, linen, or cotton.
Skip formal suits or tuxedos – choose an un constructed style that will be comfortable on the beach. A nicely fitting pair of slacks with a coordinating sport jacket would be appropriate for both groom and groomsmen.
Choose colors that match your color scheme, or go with neutral colors such as cream or off-white, almost any shade of blue, or a pale grey.
Ties will be uncomfortable in hot weather. Consider dressing up suit or sport jackets with a crisply folded pocket square.

, Because a beach wedding is an informal occasion, the bridesmaids can choose their own dresses or they can wear dresses to match your chosen color scheme.For design coherence, you have three main choices: have your bridesmaids wear matching dresses; let your bridesmaids wear any dress they like; or ask your bridesmaids to choose a style that flatters them, but in your chosen color.
Choose lightweight, comfortable fabrics such as cotton, linen, organza, or silk crepe.
For a formal beach wedding, select matching dresses in a more traditional silhouette. Sheath dresses are very popular, with a sleeveless or off-the-shoulder neckline. Skirt length can be anything from maxi to mini.
For a casual ceremony, bridesmaids can wear almost any style of dress that flatters them. The bohemian look is very popular currently, so you might try babydoll dresses or short, light dresses with halter tops.

, Wear a strong sunscreen like SPF 50, and reapply frequently. If you are having your makeup professionally applied, be sure to tell your makeup artist that you need to wear sunscreen. She may have some tips for you, or she may want to use different products that will stay put when applied over sunscreen."

Ask “why.” It’s helpful to know why those close to you have these big expectations about your wedding.,
Put yourself in their shoes.,
Seek a resolution.,
Clear the air about size or scope early on.",How to Manage Others' Expectations of Your Wedding1," Instead of speculating or silently brooding about their reasons, simply ask them why. Getting to the bottom of their expectations can provide you with an opportunity to explain yourself, bringing you all to a resolution sooner.

For example, if your mother is irritated because you’re not having any bridesmaids in your wedding, you could say, “I feel as though you are upset about me choosing not to have bridesmaids. Why are you having such a strong reaction about it?”
Once you get an answer, you can choose to explain your choice in a respectful manner. After that, the situation will likely resolve and you can get back to enjoying planning your wedding.If she keeps bringing it up, just gently remind her that you already discussed the issue in full and that it is not helpful to keep bringing it up.;
, Are you the bride, but someone else is acting like a bridezilla? Instead of writing them off or lashing out, take a minute to see their perspective. Perhaps they are upset about something else going on in their lives and are, unfortunately, taking it out on you. Having a conversation about it can help to save your relationship, and wedding planning.

Be sure to use a tone of concern and love, and avoid making judgmental or accusatory comments. Suggest some steps they can take to take care of themselves and avoid taking their problems out on you.
You could say, “I’ve noticed you’ve been very upset and vocal about some of my wedding planning decisions. Can we talk about what is bothering you?” Extending this olive branch may be just what this person needs to get over their issues and ultimately allow you to enjoy your relationship with them again., Instead of just dwelling on the problem, question how they would resolve the issue they bring up. If your sister refuses to sit at the same table as your brother, ask her what she would like you to do. Perhaps she has a suggestion that you haven’t thought of. If she doesn’t, tell her that she and your brother need to work it out on their own.

For instance, say “I realize you would rather not sit next to our brother, but I can’t figure out a seating arrangement that works. I was hoping that you could come up with one that will make everyone satisfied, or that you and our brother can talk and work out your issues on your own.”
Saying this shows her that you are aware of her discomfort and that you have attempted to resolve the problem. It also relieves you of the issue and puts it in her hands.If they refuse to work together to find a resolution, then you can also say, ""I will be very sad not to have you there, but I understand if that is your choice."" This keeps the responsibility on them and off of you. Remember that you are a planning a wedding, not acting as a family counselor.

, If some of your family members or guests have shared the expectation that you will be having a lavish affair in which no expenses are spared, you may need to alert them about your plans for a simple, low-key event. You can even enlist a few close friends and family members to help spread the word about the type of event you are striving for. This may help to prevent some stress for you.

Pull aside loved ones either separately or as a group and explain your decision. Say something to the effect of, ""I've heard rumors that Jennifer and I are having a top-of-the-line wedding that would make most celebrities jealous! That's not true. In fact, what we want is a quiet, simple evening with our closest friends and family. We'll let you know about attire, but there's no need to order any high-end couture.""

Wear it on your left hand.,
Flaunt the ring on your right hand.,
Stack it on top of your wedding band.,
Choose to wear it on any finger you want.,
Wear it around your neck.",How to Wear an Engagement Ring1," The ring is typically worn on the third finger of the left hand. This is the most common way to wear an engagement ring in many countries, especially in Western cultures. This dates back to the highly romantic idea that this finger has a vein that leads directly to the heart. That isn’t true, but it’s a nice thought for when you’re looking down at that pretty ring of yours., Wearing your ring on the third finger of your right hand is absolutely acceptable as well. The right hand is actually the traditional hand in countries like Russia, Greece, and Columbia. Wearing your ring on your right hand doesn’t have to signify your culture, though. It can simply be a personal preference., Once you’ve decided on the hand you’ll wear your ring on, consider how you will wear it after the wedding ceremony. You may decide not to have a wedding band, and that’s okay! If you have a wedding band, you will typically wear your engagement ring on top of it., There are traditions, but in the end, the choice is yours. Wear it on whatever finger feels the most comfortable. This could be your index or middle finger. If the size of the ring is the reason why you need to wear it on a certain finger, you may want to consider resizing it.

, Sometimes wearing the engagement ring on your finger isn’t the best option for you. This could be because of your career, a physical reason, pregnancy, or simply because you don’t like to wear anything on your fingers. Choose a chain that you like and slip the ring onto the chain. Wear it around your neck as you would any other necklace. It will be even closer to your heart.You can also look into companies like Ring My Neck, which makes necklaces specifically for engagement rings.

Take a stand.,
Stop sharing wedding details.,
Ask your fiancé for help.",How to Manage Others' Expectations of Your Wedding2," There’s only so much one person can take and you can only be so accommodating. If you’ve had it with people meddling in your wedding, let them know their opinions are no longer welcome. It may seem harsh at first, but you’ll likely find that your relationship will stay intact if you remain respectful.

You could say, “I know that you have my best intentions in mind and you want us to have the best wedding possible, but my fiancé and I are set on what we’d like to do. Trying to meet everyone’s expectations is too stressful for us, so please keep your opinions to yourself.” You may listen to objections in the initial conversation, but then repeat this phrase as many times as needed if they continue to press you. You may meet initial resistance at first, but chances are you’ll work it out and have a great wedding because of it., If someone seems to have an opinion or suggestion about every wedding detail you share, stop talking about the wedding to them. It’s likely that what they say is taking a toll on you and ultimately making planning your wedding less enjoyable. If they don’t know what’s going on with your wedding, however, they won’t have anything to talk about.

There’s a chance they’ll notice that you have ceased communication about your big day with them. If they question it and you don’t want to make things awkward, simply tell them you have decided you want to make the wedding details a surprise from now on., If you aren’t getting through to the culprit, ask for some reinforcement from your fiancé. This is particularly helpful if the person in question is a friend or relative of your future other half. They may have a better chance of making an impact with the person than you do.

The key to making this work without upsetting your fiancé is to avoid speaking negatively about the other person. You could say, “I know you are close to this person, but they are not respecting what I say about the wedding. Perhaps you could tell them how to step back a bit. I think it would be more meaningful if it came from you.”
Keeping things respectful will likely encourage your fiancé to take charge and can keep things peaceful between them, you, and the third party.You may also consider who the person is likely to listen to. For example, they might listen to one of your siblings, one of your parents, a friend, or one of your future in-laws.

Draw the line where it matters.,
Be willing to make concessions.,
Allow them to become involved.,
Be considerate of who's footing the bill.,
Give those who help the acknowledgement they deserve.,
Prevent fires from starting.",How to Manage Others' Expectations of Your Wedding3," Voicing your own desires clearly and early is central to minimizing backlash later. However, no matter how thorough you were at sharing your own expectations, you are bound to get interference on some aspects of your wedding. If it's really significant to you and your fiance, and your personal beliefs, don't budge if you're footing the bill.If your parents demand that you get married in a church and you dreamed of an outdoor wedding, you will have to let them down firmly, but gently. Say, ""Mom, Dad, I understand how much you want us to be married in the church. We know it's tradition in our family. But, we're a new generation and we want to start new traditions. Since I was younger, I have envisioned my wedding being outdoors in the fall. Can you please support our decision not to get married at the church?""
You may also get them involved in other ways, such as by asking them to help you pick the perfect outdoor location. This will help to show them that you do value their opinion.

, A common point of contention involves one or both families wanting a religious or traditional ceremony when the couple wants modern and secular. It's mainly up to you and your future spouse as to whether you want to consider your parent's wishes. Just know that effectively handling this dilemma requires tact.

You may have no interest in having a traditional affair, but it might help to ask your parents what aspect of a traditional wedding is important to them. Some things you may be willing to make allowances for, while others you may not. For instance, if your mom is deeply invested in you being married by your family priest, and that's okay with you and your fiance', then make a concession., Although it may sound counter-intuitive, involving the person who has the most expectations with your wedding plans can actually get them off of your back. The key is to make them believe they are helping you make decisions with what is going on. Keeping them in the loop on the small things allows you to make the decisions on the big details.

Take the person with you to help make small choices like table settings or interviewing DJs. Doing so will make them feel involved, and they may back off on inserting themselves into other responsibilities.You could even assign them a small project that you don’t care too much about and give them full reign over it. This will help them to feel like they have some control and it may help to prevent them from nagging you as much.

, You may have no interest in listening to other's opinions about your wedding planning, but if your parents, friends, or other family members are pitching in financially, it's only appropriate to let them have a say.

For example, if the bride's parents paid for the wedding (which is still tradition in many areas), you might sit down early on during the wedding planning and have them voice their expectations. You might say, ""Since you all are paying for the majority of the costs, do you have any specific details you would like to have included?""Keep in mind that they might initially say they want to leave everything up to you, but then voice some strong opinions later on.
Once they have voiced their expectations, be sure to say ""So, is every decision besides the venue open for Patrick and I to decide?"" This settles any further disputes about who is dictating what moving forward.

, Although you should only do something you and your fiancé are comfortable with, allowing someone who has helped you to have some input in your wedding-making process is quite courteous. Finding a way to acknowledge them may also be helpful if you think they are looking for some kind of recognition.

For example, if a friend of yours has gone above and beyond when helping you with the wedding, include them in the wedding party, make them an usher, or even ask them to perform a reading during the ceremony. This small gesture can prevent hard feelings from forming., Although someone’s expectations may not fit into your big picture, making small sacrifices can benefit you greatly. Bending a little bit here and there could stop a potential disaster from happening. You’ll likely find that giving in some is nothing compared to having a peaceful and enjoyable wedding.

For example, if you know guests who do not get along at all, like divorced couples, it will likely behoove you to set them far apart from each other, even if it disrupts your entire seating arrangement. Putting this little bit of effort and compromise in now could prevent an embarrassing firestorm during your wedding later."

Keep your ring clean.,
Take it to a jeweler once a year.,
Take it off before intense exercise.,
Avoid applying lotion and perfume when you wear your ring.,
Think carefully before resizing.",How to Wear an Engagement Ring2," A buildup of oil and dirt will prevent your ring from looking as shiny as it could look, and you may want to keep it ready to show off at a moment’s notice! To clean, put the ring into a mug filled with warm water and a few drops of dish soap. Let it soak for a few minutes. Then, scrub it with a soft-bristle toothbrush and then dry it with a soft cloth.It’s recommended to clean your ring once every few weeks.

, Bringing your ring to the jeweler once a year is recommended so that a professional can determine if your ring is in good condition. Usually, the jeweler will check the prongs to make sure that your stone isn’t close to falling out. If you don’t want to take your ring to a jeweler just yet, take a look at the prongs yourself.To check the prongs yourself, make sure that one of the prongs isn’t shorter than the others. Then, shake the ring while holding it up to your ear to check that nothing rattles.

, Intense exercise could mean tennis, bicycling, lifting weights, etc. The stone could pop out with a lot of fast movement. Also, using equipment, like weights or ropes, while wearing the ring could dent and scratch it.You should also avoid wearing your ring at work if you handle heavy machinery.

, We all want to smell great, but smelling like a fresh rose isn’t worth damaging your beautiful ring. The oils, chemicals, and alcohols in these products can damage your ring after a while. The gem could become clouded, and the metal could become dull. It’s okay to wear lotion and perfume, but make sure it doesn’t come near your ring., At some point, you may feel the need to resize your ring. It could feel too loose or too tight for a number of reasons, like pregnancy, a change in weight, and temperature. Think of all the reasons that could have caused this, and consider if these changes are temporary before going to the jeweler. If the ring stays too loose after a long time, then it is a good idea to take it in.Getting your ring sized in the afternoon or after exercise to accommodate swelling is ideal.
It’s recommended to get your ring one size up from what you need if you live in a tropical environment.
Leaving the ring loose for too long can cause excess wear on the stone.

Have your ring insured.,
Put your ring in a designated spot.,
Leave your ring at home when you travel.",How to Wear an Engagement Ring3," A lost, stolen, or damaged ring is a nightmare, but that doesn’t mean it’s a problem that can’t be solved. Your partner may have already gotten insurance. If not, this is an important first step after receiving your ring. Many companies will allow you to add the insurance for the ring to your homeowners or renters insurance., You might never want to take off your ring, but the time will probably come when you have to. Designate a place to store your ring safely. This will take the stress away from frantically trying to remember where you put it last. Keep a ring box in your bedroom, and a ring dish in the kitchen.Make sure the ring dish is kept far away from the drain.

, This isn’t necessary, but it can be a good idea when leaving for a trip where you will be moving around a lot. Moving from place to place, especially when going to the beach, may result in a lost ring in the whirlwind of the fun (or business). Consider going without a ring or wearing an inexpensive ring during the trip.The ring can also be damaged when lifting bags or using bags that roll.

Take the time to really give it some thought.,
Pick a purity ring.,
Wear your ring with pride - you've done something beautiful and uplifting.,
Finally...you should make your ring an important part of your wedding ceremony; discuss exactly how you will do this with your pastor or priest, it will be wonderful and inspiring to let everyone know what you've achieved and they'll be so proud of you.",How to Wear a Purity Ring," Make sure you're are dedicated enough to wait. If you're already thinking about sex all the time and you don't plan on staying pure, you shouldn't wear a purity ring. Don't make a promise to yourself you know you won't keep. But if you've decided that you are going to wait for sex until you get marriage, and you want the world to know it. then move on to the next step.;
, When you have decided, discuss it with your parents. They will be thrilled with your choice and will want to support you all the way - and they will probably want to buy your ring for you. It doesn't need to have Bible passages on it; a popular phrase engraved on purity rings is ""True love waits"". It's plain, sweet, and simple, and it states exactly what sex should be about: love. Make sure, however, that it doesn't look too much like a wedding ring; you don't want people to think you're already taken! If you really want a ring specially made as a purity ring, search in Christian stores, such as Bereans, or go online. They have a wide variety of rings you can choose from. There are also groups and events, such as True Love Waits and the Silver Ring Thing, that you can look into.

, When people ask what it is, boldly say ""It's a purity ring. It symbolizes my virginity, and that I won't be having sex until I get married."" If you're too shy, or you don't want to be that bold, simply tell them what it is.


Be prepared for some negative attention. Friends may tell you ""sex is just sex"", or that abstinence will lead to marriage failure. Just remember that abstinence is your own personal decision, and that you know in your heart that it is what's right for you; others will choose to engage in sexual activity, just as you choose to abstain.
Be prepared too for feeling like you're somehow missing out. In your late teens or early 20s most of your friends may have lost their virginity. Stay true to your beliefs - many of your friends will secretly be regretting that they didn't. They will admire you for what you've achieved even if they don't say so
Society is sex-obsessed, so protect yourself from temptation, there are things you don't want to know about yet. Review your TV viewing to avoid smutty programmes.
Ask your parents to install parental control software on both your PC and phone. This will block access to sex-related stuff, as well as things like violence and drugs and so it will keep you safe online. (Again, your parents will be delighted to help you here).

, Keep it safe and precious after you have exchanged it for your wedding ring. You can then save it for your own daughter as a really beautiful present..

, Once you meet the ""right"" family the magic will happen. Try to find a family that has similar values and outlook as yours.

Think about how much personal contact you would like between the birth and adoptive parents.

Ask questions.,
Don’t feel pressured into either type of adoption.",How to Choose Between Closed or Open Adoption in Arizona," In a closed adoption, the birth parents have no right to communicate with the adopted child or the adoptive parents. There are some benefits to closed adoptions, including the following:Adoptive parents never have to worry about the birth parents interfering in their lives.
Birth parents can move on with their lives without being contacted by the adoptive parents.;
, There are also some disadvantages to a closed adoption, which you also need to carefully consider. For example:The adopted child won’t be able to find or communicate with their birth family.
Adoptive and birth parents can’t get information from each other.
Adoptive parents aren’t involved with selecting the child. Instead, in many cases, your adoption agency will select the child.
Adoptive parents must generally wait longer for a child because most birth parents tend to choose open adoptions these days.

, However, you should also consider what will happen when the child reaches adulthood. It is very common for adoptees to want to find their birth parents. You need to understand that a closed adoption makes that difficult.


For example, Arizona seals adoption records and will unseal them only in very limited situations. In order for an adoptee to find a birth parent, the birth parent has to register with a mutual consent registry.If he or she doesn’t, then the child won’t be able to get identifying information about the birth parents.
Accordingly, you might want to choose an open adoption so that the child will be able to find his or her birth family later in life.

, In an open adoption, birth parents and adoptive parents stay in contact. The birth parents may visit the child or write them letters. There are many advantages to an open adoption:The child will have contact with the birth family when he or she grows up.
Adoptive parents can be more open that the child is adopted.
Adoptive parents can get more information from the birth parents. For example, many diseases are genetic. If the child becomes sick, then the adoptive parents can get family medical histories from the birth family.
A birth mother is less likely to change her mind since she knows the adoptive parents.

, Open adoptions also carry some negatives. You should consider these along with the positives. For example, the following problems sometimes arise with open adoptions:Adoptive and birth parents might want different amounts of communication. For example, the birth mother might want constant visitation, or want to visit at inconvenient times.
Some birth mothers aren’t committed to giving the child up and might see an open adoption as a chance to maintain a “halfway” parental relationship.
The child might not want any contact with his or her birth family. Also, the birth parents might not want the child to find them.
Some adoptive parents don’t see themselves as the “real” parents if the biological mother or father is involved.

, Not all open adoptions are the same. Instead, birth parents and adoptive parents agree to the types of information they will share. For example, you might agree to the following:Use a third party to exchange information. This is called a “semi-open” adoption. You might choose a third party intermediary to act as a go-between in case you have questions or want to share information. However, neither side has the other’s identifying information.
Exchange names and email addresses. This way, everyone can contact each other.
Share your mailing address and phone number. Adoptive parents and birth parents might want to share pictures, letters, or phone calls. Birth parents might also write letters to the child.
Fully open the adoption. In this situation, the birth parent can visit the child in-person. Sometimes, adoptive families also allow extended family, like grandparents, to visit.

, You should take some time to consider whether or not you want an open adoption.Make some time to think through the following issues:


Do you want the birth family (or adoptive parents) having contact with you? Can you handle the other side being intrusive?
Are you prepared to follow through on your promises? You shouldn’t choose open adoption if you can’t meet your obligations to keep the birth parents informed.
Are you prepared to get legal help? In Arizona, open adoptions are considered contractual. This generally requires that you get legal assistance

, Ask your adoption agency if they could put you in contact with people who have undergone an open adoption. They should be able to give you one or two references. You can call them up and ask your questions. For example, you might ask the following:


Have they had any problems with the birth parents or adoptive parents? If so, what kinds of problems? How were they resolved?
Does the child like being in contact with the birth parents, or is the child confused or unhappy?
If they could adopt all over again, would they still choose an open adoption? If not, why not?
Can you call back later if you have more questions?

, You might need to talk over open and closed adoption with a lawyer. Only a qualified lawyer can provide the detailed information you need to make the right decision. You can get referrals in the following ways:


Ask other people who have adopted a child if they would recommend their lawyer.
Ask your adoption agency if they can recommend someone. Often, they have a lawyer on staff or contract regularly with a lawyer.
Get a referral from the Arizona Bar Association, which has a “Find a Lawyer” feature.Type “adoption” in the “Your Legal Need” box.
Find free legal aid. If you don’t have much money, you might be able to qualify for legal aid. You can find legal aid providers near you by visiting the Legal Services Corporation’s website., You should schedule a consultation with the attorney once you have a referral. Ask how much they charge for the consultation and also ask what you should bring with you, if anything.

, At the consultation, you should analyze whether open or closed adoption is more appropriate for your situation. You should also write down your questions ahead of time so that you can be sure to ask them. For example, you might want to know the following:


What kind of open adoption arrangements are available?
If your child has a medical emergency, is there any way to get medical information from birth parents if you choose a closed adoption?
If you choose an open adoption, can the lawyer help you draft a contract? How much would that cost and what pay arrangements are available?
Does the lawyer have strong feelings about open adoptions?Since he or she has handled many adoptions, you should ask for their perspective on open adoption.

, Your lawyer should not pressure you to choose any type of adoption. However, some adoption agencies have preferences.The agency may prefer open or closed adoptions and try to persuade you to choose the one they prefer.


Because this is an important choice, you shouldn’t let an adoption agency influence you. Instead, you might need to pick a different agency.
Ideally, you should research agencies ahead of time and find out if they have a preference. You could then avoid them and pick an agency that is happy to do either an open or closed adoption.

Be resolute in your decision.,
Be sure both of you feel the same way.,
Face any commitment issues you may fear.",How to Show Commitment when You Don't Want a Wedding Ring1," While rings are symbolic as a sign of unity, they are also bedecked in traditions that may or may not be applicable to you. Not everyone appreciates the symbolism of rings, nor even using symbolism as part of their wedding ceremony. If you are not a traditionalist, if you have thought carefully about the purpose and intent behind your marriage, rings may not not feature highly as an outward display of your commitment. Bear in mind:


Rings don't make the commitment, you do. There is nothing to say you have to have rings.
Rings can be annoying to some people, who will accept them as part of the ceremony but then rarely wear them again. This can be the case with people who don't much like jewelry, who do a lot of sport or outdoor activities or who don't like the look of wedding rings. In some cases, it concerns modesty, about not wearing jewelry for faith or environmental reasons. Whatever reason, there is no point getting something that will never be appreciated afterward.
Temporary rings might work for some couples. For example, a ring woven from flax or other plant material could be used during the wedding as a token gesture that does not need to be worn after the wedding. This might be nice if the plant has some meaning (cultural or personal), if you're both nature lovers or if you simply love plants!
;
, It wouldn't be fair to the other partner if he or she does want a ring but you insist on no rings because you don't want one. It is acceptable for one partner to have a ring while the other partner does not. After all, in many Western weddings, rings for the man are a recent addition.If one of you does want a ring and the other does not, you can still incorporate this as part of the marriage ceremony.


In some cases, brides prefer a charm bracelet, to which charms are added as important life events occur as a couple, such as births, major transitions and promotions. This might be a suitable alternative where one person in the couple wishes to have something to show outwardly that isn't a ring.

, In some cases, it may seem like wearing a ring turns into publicly displaying a binding object. If your reason for not wearing a ring has anything to do with being afraid of commitment or feeling as if you're going to look like someone you don't feel you are, perhaps you have commitment issues that go to the heart of the marriage. If so, ask yourself:


Are you ready for marriage and the long-term commitment it entails? Be honest with yourself!
Is the ring a tangible sign of deeper concerns? If so, consider talking all of your concerns through with your partner and/or someone you trust to divulge such confidences with.
Be sure about getting married. You need to push past your commitment issues before making a commitment.

Search the Internet for information about Jewish wedding rings and bands.,
Follow tradition.,
Decide if you would like a ring with a Hebrew phrase engraved around it.,
Visit a jewelry store (local or online shop) that carries Jewish wedding bands.,Think about purchasing matching bands, with identical phrases and designs.",How to Select and Buy Jewish Wedding Rings," Don't be afraid to take your time and decide carefully. Examine your married friends' hands when you're with them. If you start paying attention to people's Jewish wedding ring designs, you will probably get a clearer idea of what you want. You might even ask them where they got their rings.;
, According to Jewish tradition, a Jewish wedding ring should be solid all around, with no gems, and nothing cut out of it. Anything may be engraved on it on the outer band, as long as the band is solid (the inner band may not be engraved). This symbolizes the wholeness and eternity of one's commitment to one's spouse., Some popular verses from the Song of Songs that are in vogue right now are ""Ani L'Dodi v'Dodi Li,"" which means, ""I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine."" This is a very beautiful statement of your love for your partner. Other phrases are things such as ""Ze Dodi Veze Re'ei"" (This is my beloved and this is my friend). Another is ""Matzati Et She'ahava Nafshi"" (I found, him (her) whom my soul loves). Also, from the Book of Ruth, ""Ba'asher Telchi Elech"" (Where you will go, I shall go)., Look at various wedding band designs to determine which ones you would like to purchase. Try it on, to see if the band or the inscriptions look good on your hand.

Consider what other cultures do.,
If you really want a physical symbol, but find rings uncomfortable, consider other forms of jewelry.,
Show your love with art.,
Give each other a special, unique love token instead of a ring.,
Have your wedding license or contract document framed.,
Reaffirm your love regularly.",How to Show Commitment when You Don't Want a Wedding Ring2," There are some cultures that do not value the use of wedding rings. Read up on other alternatives offered through various cultures. A simple online search using a term such as ""Which cultures do not use wedding rings"" will give you quite a few returns.


In some cases in India, a bride and groom will put the emphasis on having a big wedding rather than on having rings––then the whole town, and more, know that you are married. In these conditions, why do you need a ring? (That said, wealthier Indians do tend to make the ring part of the wedding commitment, as part of adopting Western wedding traditions.)
The Amish receive a clasped hand blessing as part of their ceremony but do not wear an outward symbol of their union, especially not jewelry.Some communities do use different dresses or colors, or long beards, to symbolize married couples though.

, Would you be more comfortable with a chain around the neck symbolizing your love? Chains, just like rings, are also a symbol of attachment/commitment. You and your partner don't even need to wear the same ""type"" of jewelry, as long as the two pieces have something in common (text, style, little sign).


For those who undertake a lot of manual or mechanical labor, wearing the ring around a necklace is often considered a preferred (and safer) option.

, What about getting a tattoo? Maybe you'll think: ""I don't have tattoos, I'm not a tattoo person"" but this reason makes it different. In general, you do not want tattoos because you think that your tastes will change. But don't your wish your marriage to last forever? The tattoo doesn't have to be fancy. It can be your lover's name on some discreet part of your body: around the ring finger, on your side, or why not hidden under your hair, like a secret? Be creative. Nobody has to see it. It's just for you and your lover.


The infinite symbol is a popular tattoo for married people to use.
Instead of a tattoo, consider a second piercing, either in the ear or somewhere else prominent. When people ask about it, you can proudly proclaim it's because you're married!

, Make something using your own creativity that expresses your commitment. For example, it might be a small booklet of the 10 Reasons I Love You, or a heart shaped craft item or a photo album of the two of you having good times together. Really, the sky is the limit on how to personalize this aspect and it's entirely up to you as to how to turn it into a marriage commitment token.

, Display it proudly in your home where people visiting will see it.


If the original license is not so flash, in some countries, you can upgrade to a prettier official document than the regular signed ones for a small fee; whether or not this is needed or can be done depends on where you get married.

, Rings are not the marriage. Marriage is about the effort of maintaining an intimate relationship and being there for one another through thick and thin. One way you can make a commitment statement is to promise one another to reaffirm your love for each other on each anniversary of your wedding, using words, poetry, images, or some other self-created way that requires personal effort to restate what you love about your partner. You could even make this reaffirmation public by throwing a small party at home or simply having a few friends and/or family over to witness your reaffirmation. Some couples even like to renew vows as if they're having a wedding all over again, perhaps at long intervals such as each decade or on specific long-term anniversaries.

Enjoy the party!",How to Throw an Engagement Party," Traditionally the parents of either the groom or the bride will host the engagement party, but it is also common for the couple themselves to host the party. Other options include a friend of the couple, both families co-hosting the party or even the groom planning the celebration.


Since it is not always customary to have an engagement party, the couple may not even know that there is interest in giving them one. It also isn't the type of party that a couple could ask someone to do for them, so letting them know you are interested in throwing the party will open the door for them to talk to you about what type of party they are interested in. This will help you to get a tentative guest list from them.
While the best man or maid of honor can throw the engagement party, it is usually better for the families or the couple themselves to throw the party since the maid of honor and best man will have to organize other parties later on.
If the couple is announcing their engagement for the first time, then they likely will host the event.;
, The engagement party is usually held one to three months after the proposal but this will depend on the individual circumstances of the bride and groom. If the couple plans to have a short engagement then the party should be sooner rather than later. If it is too close to the time of the wedding then it can feel like an early wedding shower and this is not what you want.


Nine to eleven months before the wedding is a good time for the engagement party.
Holding the party on a weekday rather than a weekend can significantly reduce the cost of the celebration.While many parties are held in the evening, the engagement party could also be a breakfast or brunch event, a mid-day pool party or held during happy hour at your favorite bar. Be creative.

, The engagement party does not have to be costly. It should be a fun and happy celebration so it can be as relaxed or high-energy as you choose. Some prefer to hold just a small get-together while others prefer to hold an evening filled with dancing and music.


A formal dinner party would be more expensive than a backyard barbecue but either are acceptable for an engagement party.
Set a budget that includes all aspects of the party: invitations, food, drink, entertainment, decoration, venue and favors.

, The purpose of the engagement party is to bring together the bride and groom’s friends and family so that they can all meet one another. The engagement party is usually an intimate occasion and it is usually inappropriate to invite anyone who will not be invited to the wedding. Get lists from the bride and groom of close family and friends.


If you are on a tight budget, reduce the guest list by inviting only immediate family members and close friends.
Sometimes you can invite people to the engagement party that are not invited to the wedding. This is especially true nowadays when many couples live and/or host their weddings far from friends and families.
If the engagement party is going to be a surprise, make a guest list including the family members and close friends. Ask two or three other people to review the list to make sure you don’t forget anyone.

, The venue can be anything you choose: your own home, a park, the beach, a restaurant, a hall or a bar for example. Remember your budget and the theme of your party when deciding on a venue.


Consider having the party at a place that is special to the couple. For example the location of their first date, a park they enjoy going to or some other location.

, Gifts can be a source of confusion for guests and it is important to inform people ahead of time if gifts are accepted or not. Many do not accept gifts at their engagement party and the invitations should read “no gifts please” to clarify this fact.


If you do choose to accept gifts then you should expect low- to mid-range priced gifts and can register for these. The location of registration should be marked on the invitations in this case.
If you have requested no gifts yet guests bring them, wait until after the party to open them so that other guests do not feel uncomfortable.

, Throwing a party can be a lot of work so try to find a few other people in the planning and preparation. If you already know the members of the wedding party then you can involve them in the engagement party.

, These should be sent out around one month to six weeks before the party. Invitations can be elaborate but it is also perfectly acceptable to send email or another kind of electronic invitation. This will also reduce the cost of the party. They should be kept with the theme of the party.


Invitations should be sent out four to six weeks before the party.
The invitations do not have to match the rest of your stationary, especially if you have not decided on a theme or color palette yet.
You can include a return card for RSVPs or not depending on your preference.

, It is not necessary to provide party favors but if you do want to then you can choose something small like baked goods or treats. You may also choose to give a small gift to your wedding party to show your appreciation.

, If you choose an outdoor location like the beach or a park for the party, make sure you have a back-up plan if the weather does not agree. You do not want to wake up to rain and have nowhere to host the party!

, If you are hosting the party at your home or another outdoor location, make sure you give yourself enough time to buy the food, drinks and any other goods you might need such as plates and cups.

, Ensure that there are places for the guests to sit and eat. If the party is hosted at a private residence then make sure the yard is tended to, the house cleaned and that the AC/heating system is working.If you are accepting gifts, make sure there is an area to put them.

, Depending on the size of the party and the venue you may need to arrange special parking areas. Make sure there is space for the guests to park their vehicles to avoid traffic jams.

, Pick a theme that excites you and makes you want to party and have fun. The theme can go along with the theme of the wedding (if you know it already) or it can be different. The engagement party is meant to be fun so choose a theme that means something to the couple or reflects the two families being joined together.


An example is a manga-inspired party for a couple who share a love of anime.
If you plan a low-key wedding then you do not want your engagement party to upstage your wedding. Keep it low-key as well.
Even if you plan a laid-back engagement party, having a theme and coordinating color palette can help keep things together.

, Keep the decorations simple such as streamers and balloons. Photo boards of the couple are also great decorations and a fun way to show off the couple. Flowers are great centerpieces and can be as simple as a sunflower or hydrangea.


If you have a theme then you can tailor the decorations according to the theme.

, Whether you will host the party at a restaurant or private home, you can plan a menu according to the theme and preferences of the couple and their families. Be careful of any allergies or food specifications of your guests.

, You do not have to have a cake but if you do want one, putting a picture of the proposal on the cake can be a great idea. Alternatives include ice cream sandwiches, assorted baked goods or seasonal treats like candy apples or cotton candy., Most engagement parties will have music and this can come from either a playlist you create on your computer or hiring a DJ for a few hours. The entertainment does not have to be expensive or extravagant; remember that the party is meant to introduce your families and friends together so they should be able to talk to one another.


You could also hire alternative entertainment such as a slideshow or video of the proposal, magicians, circus performers, or live music. Better yet, you can host the party in a location that already has such entertainment.

, A fun idea would be to prepare a few games to play. The games should be fun, simple and get everyone involved. For example, you could hold a “team scavenger hunt” to get the two families acquainted.

, If you are not having a DJ, which isn’t necessary, create a playlist of songs to play during the party. Think about what people might like to dance to, or what would be most fun for the party. You can also include songs important to the couple.

, Ask for marriage/relationship advice from the guests. Leave out a book for all the guests to write their advice in. This is a nice keepsake for the couple to read through after the party.

, Throwing a party takes a lot of energy and work. Make sure you get enough sleep the whole week before the party- you want to be able to enjoy the party once it happens!, The engagement party is an opportunity for friends and family from both the bride and groom’s side to meet one another. Make sure you introduce people to one another to help people mingle and interact.


Don’t let forgetting someone’s name prevent you from introducing the guest. Just politely ask for their name and apologize for forgetting. It is better to ask then to not introduce the guest.

, Everyone will want to greet the lucky couple and give them their congratulations. Make a little space near the entryway so that everyone can have their time to speak to the couple.

, As the host you may be very busy organizing things at the party so ask someone else to take photos for you. Alternatively you can ask all the guests to take pictures and post them on social media using the same hashtag so that you can download and share them.


Another idea is to leave out disposable cameras for all the guests to take pictures with.
If you have the budget, hire a professional photographer to take pictures during the event.

, When everyone is happily eating food and have had a chance to mingle a bit, ask for stories about the couple. These stories can be funny, romantic or surprising. Even the couple can share a few stories, for example how they met or the proposal story.

, As the host you would usually be expected to welcome everyone and give a toast to the couple. Others may also be interested in making a toast so try to find out ahead of time if others would like to do so.


It is traditional that the father of the bride gives a toast although this is not required.

, Some people may make inappropriate remarks about the couple, exes or other topics. Similarly if someone is making a very long speech then you should be prepared to encourage them to finish. Prepare a few alternative topics or conversation starters to avoid these situations.

, The most important part is to enjoy the party. An engagement party should be a happy and fun celebration of the couple beginning their wedding preparations together. Make sure you have energy and are not too stressed to have fun during the party.

Since some states either do not permit same-sex foster parents, or do not have laws prohibiting discrimination against same-sex couples, you must understand your state's laws before going further.You can use national websites such as adoptuskids.org and the Child Welfare Information Gateway at childwelfare.gov to find details and contact information for your state and local foster care agencies.
In states without any laws prohibiting discrimination against same-sex foster parents, the attitudes and politics of the area where you live may determine your ability to foster.
Some states, while not specifically addressing LGBT foster parents, will not certify homes in which non-related adults live together. This prohibition applies to all non-married couples.
Additionally, many states will not allow two people who are not married to apply jointly as foster parents. However, one person still can apply to foster as a single applicant.
Keep in mind that if you do not live with your partner, your sexual preference technically should have no bearing on your application to become a foster parent. Similarly, if you are married to your partner, regulations that prohibit unmarried adults from becoming foster parents shouldn't apply.
In addition to contacting your local foster care agency, you may want to look for LGBT adoption and fostering groups in your area. These groups can provide you with information and resources on how to approach and handle the application process.
Know your rights in your state, but also be aware of the prevailing attitudes in the area where you live. For example, if you know that you live in a part of the country that is relatively socially conservative, be prepared to face reluctance or even outright discrimination from people you contact at your local foster care agency.
In many cases it may be best not to advertise your status from the beginning. If you simply call and say you want to be foster parents, you may get a different response than if you say you are a same-sex couple who wants to be foster parents.;
, In most states, once you've reviewed the laws and educated yourself about foster care, you must attend an orientation meeting to meet the caseworkers and other professionals who work in your local foster care agency and find out more about the foster care system.At the meeting, you'll receive information about the types of children in foster care and the roles and responsibilities of foster parents.
The caseworker in charge of the orientation meeting also will provide brochures and written information to prospective foster parents, as well as explain the rules and the specific procedure for applying to become a foster parent.
Bring paper and a pen to the orientation meeting and be prepared to take notes. If there's something you don't understand, ask about it.
Particularly if the prospect of LGBT foster parents is not addressed in any of the foster care literature, you should ask about same-sex foster parents in your area.
Find out if there are currently any LGBT foster parents in the system, how many there are, and whether they faced any additional hurdles in being approved as foster parents.
In some parts of the country, you should prepare to be asked additional questions about why you want to be foster parents – especially if you and your partner attend the orientation meeting together. Focus on the needs of the children in foster care. You also might mention the LGBT youth in foster care who could use strong role models.

, All states require potential foster care parents to take classes and become licensed as foster care providers. These training courses educate you on the challenges faced by children in the foster care system and may provide you with basic skills such as CPR and first aid.These classes typically are offered free of charge by your state's foster care system. If you are not available at the dates and times the classes are offered, you may be able to take similar classes through a private agency or nonprofit organization.
Be prepared to take between 10 and 30 hours of classes before you are licensed as foster parents.
Some of these classes teach basic parenting skills, while others focus on how to interact with children who may have experienced emotional or physical trauma, or have particular mental or emotional challenges.

, After you've completed your training, you will be assigned a caseworker who will guide you through the remainder of the application process and complete a home study, if required by your state.In some states, you may meet your caseworker and begin the application process while you're still in the process of taking the required classes.
Your caseworker will be a family caseworker, and his or her job is to shepherd you through the application process and do everything possible to assist you in becoming licensed and certified foster parents.
It's important to have a strong, positive relationship with your caseworker. In this regard, you should be open and honest with him or her about your sexual orientation. Lying about it or sweeping the issue under the rug just to get approved may come back to haunt you later on.
If you are assigned a caseworker who is uncomfortable working with same-sex couples, you may want to request a different caseworker be assigned to your case.
Keep in mind that the caseworker may not express their opinion outright. However, your caseworker is supposed to be your advocate throughout the process, working for you to get you licensed if you meet the state qualifications. If you don't believe your caseworker is on your side, request to work with someone else.

, To complete your application to be foster parents, you will need documents that prove your age and income. Your caseworker may provide you with a checklist of the documents that must accompany your application.The purpose of the required documentation is to verify that the information included in your application is accurate and to demonstrate that you and all adult members of your household are of good moral character and fit to serve as a foster family.
In addition to documents, you typically must provide reference letters from your employers as well as others who can testify to your moral character and fitness to be foster parents. Church and community leaders who know you well often provide excellent character references.

, The foster care agency's written application requires contact and biographical information about you and everyone living in your household, including children. If you and your partner are applying jointly, you must both complete all other questions, and provide information about your education and employment history.Make sure you answer all questions on the application completely and honestly to the best of your knowledge. If you're unsure how to answer a question, ask your caseworker for assistance.
Additionally, if you have any concerns about the answers you've supplied and how they will potentially affect your approval as foster parents, you should bring your concerns up with your caseworker. He or she will be able to explain more about the application process and how the information is evaluated.
You typically will have to pay an application fee when you submit your application, usually under $100.

, All states require foster parents to pass criminal and child abuse background checks. Many states have other background checks and requirements, such as medical clearances and environmental health inspections of your home.Typically all adults in your household must get fingerprint checks and criminal background checks from federal, state, and local law enforcement authorities.
In addition, all adults must have clearance from your state's child abuse registry, which lists everyone in the state who has been convicted of child-abuse related crimes, including misdemeanors.
If you or your partner have lived in another state, you also may be responsible for getting background checks from those other states where you lived as adults.
Any required medical clearance requests must be completed by a licensed physician. Your state's medical clearance process may require you to get a physical or other medical exams. Typically you will have to pay for any exams yourself.
Regardless of whether your state requires a home study, your home may be inspected for environmental health and safety, during which the inspector will assess whether you have the appropriate smoke detectors, alarms, or fire extinguishers.

, Many states require foster parents to complete a home study similar to the one that adoptive parents must complete. A home study is a series of interviews in your home conducting by your case worker, who will walk through your home and talk to everyone who lives there.The home study can take between three and six months to complete. If you are planning on being registered for fostering only, and not for adoption, you typically don't have to pay any fees for completion of the home study.
The caseworker will interview the members of your household as well as neighbors, family members, and other people you've listed as references.
Many LGBT couples believe they should take steps to remove gay-positive books, posters, or other materials from their homes prior to the home study. However, this isn't strictly necessary.
Instead of trying to convince the caseworker that your home is similar to the home of a heterosexual couple, you should strive to present your home as it looks every day, and as it likely will look when you have foster children staying with you.
Keep in mind that there are many LGBT youth in the foster care system who would benefit from strong, stable same-sex foster parents to guide and advocate for them.

, It may take several months for your caseworker to get back the results of your background checks and complete the report on your home study. During that time, check in regularly to find out about the progress of your application.If you have any questions or concerns, be sure to bring them up with your caseworker as soon as possible. Keep in mind that the caseworker typically isn't looking for reasons to reject you. Rather, they want to do everything in their power to get you approved.
You also can use the time while you're waiting for the caseworker's final report to network with other foster parents. Ask your caseworker if there are other LGBT foster parents with whom you can connect and learn more about the experience of being same-sex foster parents.

, Once all of your information has been received, your caseworker will produce a report which determines whether you are eligible to foster. Typically you will meet with your caseworker to go over the information in the report and plan your next steps.The report details the decision the caseworker has made, and the reasons for those decisions. If there's anything with which you disagree, or if you would like to provide any additional information or documents, let your caseworker know.
If you were approved as foster parents, the report will include information regarding the types of children who would be the best fit for your home and family environment.
If the caseworker does not recommend you for licensing, despite the fact that you have completed all required training and meet your state's qualifications, find out your state's process for appealing the decision.
Keep in mind that if your state has no laws prohibiting discrimination against same-sex couples who want to foster, fighting a discriminatory denial may be an uphill battle. Focus on the fact that you meet all qualifications and there is no legitimate reason you have been denied a foster care license.

, After you've been approved to foster, you will meet with another foster care agency worker, typically called a placement coordinator. This professional will discuss with you the types of children in need of foster care and get a sense of the types of children you're comfortable with and equipped to foster.If there are children you're particularly interested in fostering, let the placement coordinator know.
For example, if you prefer to foster LGBT youth, the placement coordinator can note this preference and use it to identify children best suited for your home.

, Placement coordinators carefully evaluate the profiles of children in need of foster care and attempt to place them with well-matched foster parents. It may take weeks or even months before you are contacted about a possible placement.Keep in mind that if you're not comfortable having a child in your home, you have the right to decline the placement.
If the placement coordinator contacts you with a potential placement, remember to ask questions about the child and any challenges or issues the child may have.
If you accept the placement, the placement coordinator will work with you and the child's caseworker to move the child into your home.

Making efforts to reunify the child with their parents;
Providing the child with a positive role model; and

They will determine whether you meet the minimum requirements necessary to become a foster parent.If you do, you will be contacted with the good news and you will be given the opportunity to move forward in the process.

, Once you have been selected, you will have to be trained. Your training will start with a 35-hour competency-based training program called PRIDE training.

The training classes are taught by Child Protective Services staff and real foster parents.The classes will provide you, the prospective foster parent, with information about caring for foster children.Specifically, you will discuss child attachment, loss and grief, discipline and behavior intervention, effects of abuse and neglect, sexual abuse, working with the child welfare system, and the family effects of fostering a child., This training will discuss the approaches to infection control to treat all human blood and bodily fluids.This includes providing a basic understanding of bloodborne, common modes of their transmission, and methods of transmission., This training will discuss the safe and effective use of psychotropic medications by children.In order to be successful, you will need to complete the training, get at least 70% of the questions right on your post-training test, print the certificate you receive, and provide it to DFPS.

, The last step in training will be a home study.A caseworker will visit your home to discuss your personal history, family interests, childcare experiences, the types of children you would fit in with, and your strengths and skills.In addition, the caseworker will check your home to make sure it meets the requirements about comfort and safety (e.g., adequate bedroom space and safety precautions for younger children).

The child's strengths and needs;
The skills you have as a foster parent; and
The child's prospects for permanency with family placements., Once a child is found that fits in with your situation, they will be placed in your home. The child will be brought to your home and you will be responsible for them at that point.

, Once the child is in your home, you have the responsibility to care for that child for an indeterminate amount of time. Be sure you understand what needs to be done if you do things with the child like go on vacation. If you have any questions or concerns while the child is in your home, look here for great resources and information. Do not forget to stay in contact with DFPS staff and be sure to fill out any and all required forms.

Adopt.",How to Become a Foster Parent in New York," A foster parent provides nurturing care and a stable home for children who cannot currently live with their natural parents. Typically, children are removed because of abuse or neglect. Because the child probably suffers from trauma due to being separated from his or her home, a foster parent needs to provide patience, love, and affection in addition to food, shelter, and clothing.You will also need to make sure that children get the mental and physical health care that they need.
Foster parents must also accommodate children’s ability to visit parents or siblings.
A foster parent manual is available here for you to read. It provides a comprehensive discussion of foster parent responsibilities.;
, In addition to accepting a child into your home, you will need to be comfortable letting case workers inside as well. Case workers visit foster parent homes on a regular basis, to check up on the child and to assess the living quarters.

, Aside from the satisfaction of knowing that you have provided a service to the community and the foster child, foster parents are also reimbursed for the cost of caring for the child. Counties set their own rates, which vary according to the child’s age and whether the placement was an emergency.Payment will also depend on whether your home is identified as providing Basic, Special, or Exceptional services, which is determined according to the needs of the child. A Basic home provides services for a child with no identified special or exceptional needs.To qualify as a Special or Exceptional home, you would need to undergo special training and participate in case conferences.The state also provides a clothing allowance and transportation costs for the child to visit other family members and for some appointments. Child care allowances may also be available, depending on the county, for foster parents who have to work outside the home.If the child is the right age, then he or she may be eligible for free or low-cost daycare or Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) benefits.

, Foster parents have many rights, including the ability to accept or reject the placement of a child in their home. Other rights include:Limit the number of children that can be placed with you.
Receive information on each child that is placed with you.
Expect regular visits from the caseworker.
Participate in regular conferences in the foster home to discuss the child’s plan every 90 days or less.
Receive training on how to meet the child’s needs.
Participate in Service Plan Reviews and Family Court permanency hearings on the child.
Have your personal privacy respected.

, Before applying to become a foster parent, you should check to see that you satisfy the criteria necessary for certification: Each foster parent must be over 21.
Each member of the foster household must be in good mental and physical health, free of communicable diseases. Physical handicaps or illnesses will not automatically exclude a foster family but will be part of an individualized assessment. The Department may require a written report or physical examination from a physician to help it decide if the foster parent can provide adequate foster care.
Employment of the foster parents outside the home must be approved by the agency, unless only one of two foster parents works outside the home.
Marital status may be a factor. Changes in marital status must be reported to the agency.
Ability and motivation. The agency will explore your ability and motivation to become a foster parent. Often, this will happen during a home assessment, when you can meet and talk with a Department representative.

, The best way to understand what being a foster parent is like is to talk with other foster parents. If you do not know of any, then contact your local Department and ask if they can give you a referral of someone to talk to.

, Begin the process of becoming a foster parent by contacting the Department of Social Services in your county. A listing of county offices can be found here.


Once you contact the Department, a representative will talk to you about fostering and explain the certification process.
To be certified, you will need to undergo: a State Central Register of Child Abuse and Maltreatment check, a criminal history check, and a home study.

, Another step in the certification process is to complete forms so that the Department can check whether you (or anyone 18 or older in the house) is the subject of an indicated child abuse maltreatment report filed with the State Central Register (SCR) in New York State.The Department will also check the registries of any state where you lived in the five years preceding the application.
The Department representative should give you the forms.

, As part of the application process, you will be required to undergo a criminal background check to see if you have any record. The Department will also need a set of fingerprints to conduct these checks.In some counties, your fingerprints will be taken at the local Department of Social Services office. In other counties, you will be directed to local law enforcement for either digital or ink-based prints.
If you have people who are frequent visitors to your home, then they may also be required to undergo a background check to ensure that they are safe to be around foster children.

, The Department representative will be checking to see that you have sufficient space. In particular, the representative will want to see the child’s sleeping quarters. New York has specific rules regarding sleeping quarters:


Separate bedrooms are required for children of the opposite sex older than seven unless the children are siblings or half-siblings.No more than three people may occupy any bedroom where children sleep (unless the children are siblings or half-siblings).No child over age three can sleep in the same room with an adult of the opposite sex. Nor can children sleep in the same bed as an adult. Each child must have a separate bed or crib., New York regulations require an adequate supply of safe water for drinking and other household use.

, The representative also wants to see that the home is sufficiently clean, so that physical well-being and comfort are assured. You should begin by storing piled up clothes, books, magazines, and other objects. Throw out any trash or unsafe food.


Clean the entire home, not just the child’s bedroom. The Department representative will want to see that the entire house is clean.
Pay particular attention to the bathroom, as the New York regulations specifically require that bathing and lavatory facilities be kept in a sanitary condition.Scrub toilet bowls, showers, bathtubs, sinks, and tiles. Replace missing tiles and dirty shower curtains.

, Your home must also be safe. Check to make sure you don’t have exposed wires or easily accessible medication or cleaning supplies. If you do, address these problems.


Hire an electrician if necessary to shield exposed wires and hire a carpenter to fix rickety stairs, including broken bannisters.
Keep medicines in medicine cabinets and cleaning supplies or poisons out of the reach of children.
Store dangerous implements (like guns, knives, bows and arrows, etc.) with friends or family. You should also consider leaving them with family or friends since Department representatives will be coming to your home after the foster child is placed with you.

, You should have at least one working smoke detector.Put in new batteries if you need to; the smoke alarm must work. Also make sure you have a fire extinguisher that is handy.

, As part of the home study, you will meet with a representative and answer questions on a variety of topics so that the representative can get a sense of the applicants’ character, motivation, and willingness to cooperate with the agency.Common topics of discussion include:


Your experience raising children.
Any experience with issues of child abuse or neglect.
Your approach to discipline.
Awareness of the potential impact of foster parenting on your family’s current lifestyle.
Awareness of the importance of providing a safe environment for children.
Your ability and interest in being a partner with the agency in carrying out permanency plans for the child.
Your self-assessment of your ability to provide children with a stable and meaningful relationship.

, Part of the application will include providing three references from people who know you and can tell the Department about your character. The agency will seek signed statements from these people that attest to your judgment, moral character, and ability to establish meaningful relationships with children.The agency may also seek to interview your references in lieu of a signed statement.

, Potential foster families are required to undergo a training program prior to accepting any children into their home. These programs cover a variety of topics, including training on the documentation you must keep, the agency’s expectations, the benefits you and the child are eligible for, the types of behaviors to expect from the foster child, techniques for managing the child’s behavior, and other pertinent issues.Some foster parents are offered more specialized training, and some must refresh their training each year.

, Once all training and investigations are complete, you will be ready to receive your foster child. You probably won't have to wait long for your initial placement. The need for foster families in New York is great.


The length of stay will depend on circumstances, but could be as little as one night.
In rare circumstances, the child may remain in foster care and with the same foster family for greater than one year.

, Know that adoption is an option if the natural parents are unable or unwilling to correct the issue that caused the foster child's removal. The home certification standards are the same for adoption as they are for foster care.If you become interested in adoption, you should meet with a family law attorney to discuss the process. Contact your state’s bar association, which should run a referral program.

Follow the contract.",How to Become a Surrogate Mother in Florida," There are two primary types of surrogacies: gestational and genetic (also commonly called “traditional”). In a gestational surrogacy, an egg and sperm join to form an embryo. This embryo is then implanted into the woman who will carry and bear the child. With a gestational pregnancy, the surrogate is not a biological parent of the child.With a traditional surrogacy, the surrogate is impregnated through artificial insemination. In other words, the donor’s sperm fertilizes the surrogate’s egg. In this situation, the surrogate is also the biological mother of the child.Both types of surrogacy are allowed in the state of Florida provided the surrogacy contract comports with the state statute.;
, Florida has two statutes that cover surrogacy: one for traditional (or genetic) surrogacy and one for gestational surrogacy. You should read the Florida statutes so that you understand what is required of surrogates and what is allowed or disallowed as part of a surrogacy contract.


The applicable statutes are available at this attorney’s website.

, In Florida, it is illegal to pay a fee for a child. In fact, paying or receiving fees that are unrelated to the pregnancy may be a criminal offense. However, certain surrogacy expenses related to the pregnancy can be compensated. You can be reasonably compensated for the following expenses:legal
medical
psychological or psychiatric
living expenses
wages lost due to the pregnancy
inconvenience, discomfort, and medical risk

, If you haven’t been pregnant before, then you should try to read up as much as possible on how pregnancy will affect your life. This impact includes time missed from work for appointments with the obstetrician or for childbirth. Even if you have had normal pregnancies in the past, you may encounter complications, which could result in hospitalization or bed rest.


Also, think about how attached you might become to the child. Many women grow very attached to a child that they have nurtured in the womb for nine months. Giving that child up can be emotionally challenging. At the same time, backing out of your surrogacy contract could be stressful and emotionally taxing on the intended parents as well. You should think carefully before deciding to become a surrogate.
If you have children, you should also consider how the pregnancy will affect them.Think about how you will explain to your children that the child you are carrying will not be returning home with you after you go to the hospital for delivery.

, In Florida, you cannot advertise your services as a surrogate. Instead, you must work through either an attorney or an agency. An attorney can be invaluable throughout the entire surrogacy process, so you may want to think about hiring one even if you decide to carry for friends or family or work through an established agency.


Visit wikiHow’s How to Find a Good Family Law Attorney for tips on how to find an experienced family law attorney.
Ideally, you should hire an attorney who has experience with surrogacy. You can check the directory of the American Academy of Assisted Reproductive Technology Attorneys, which is a national organization of attorneys dedicated to advancing best legal practices with respect to assisted reproductive technology. Check the directory at their website for attorneys in Florida.

, Often, surrogates carry a child for couples they have known for many years. Sometimes, they are even family. If you have been approached by a friend or family member about acting as a surrogate, then you should think over how comfortable you would be birthing a child that you will probably see regularly.

, You can also find prospective parents through an agency. The state does not maintain a centralized directory of surrogacy agencies. Instead, you should search for them online, by searching for “surrogacy center” and your state or county. Agencies may have detailed requirements that you must meet in order to become a surrogate. For example, they may require that you:


be a U.S citizen or permanent resident currently living in the United States
be a non-smoker and be physically, medically, and mentally healthy
be between 20 and 42 years of age
have already given birth via a healthy pregnancy to a healthy child

, Before becoming a surrogate, you should attempt to find out as much as you can about either the intended parents or the agency as possible. A surrogacy contract is a written agreement and can become the basis of litigation. You should know who you are entering a contract with.


If you are working with an agency, check the Better Business Bureau and the Chamber of Commerce in the area where the agency is located. You may also want to check with the Florida Attorney General to see if any lawsuits have been filed against the agency by the state or other parties.
You should also do your own investigation of the intended parents, even if the agency does its own investigation. For tips on how to do a basic background check, see wikiHow’s How to Do a Criminal Background Check.

, You will need to sit down and come to an agreement with the intended parents about a variety of issues. In addition to compensation, you should be sure to come to agreement on the following before drafting a contract:


All parties should agree on what optional testing should be performed (such as amniocentesis) and when it should be done.
All parties should agree with what will be done in the case of a complication or birth defect.
Discuss the maximum number of attempts to achieve pregnancy.Decide whether or not you must use particular doctors or clinics chosen by the intended parents.

, If you decide to work through an agency, then the agency should have its own contracts. Because surrogacy contracts are so complicated, you should work with the agency’s contract, suggesting additions or deletions.


If you decide to carry for friends or family, then you should each have an attorney. Florida law requires that each party have a different attorney, so that there will not be a conflict of interest.Florida law also allows your legal expenses to be paid by the intended parents. Accordingly, you should not be without an attorney because it is too expensive.

, Make sure that everything has been included that you and the intended parents have reached agreement on. Also ask your lawyer if he or she can think of anything else that should be included.


You should give your lawyer a couple weeks at least to review the contract. If you need more time, then tell the intended parents that you are waiting to hear from your attorney.

, You should never sign a contract unless you fully agree with everything within its four corners. If something has been left out of the contract, or if there are terms written into the contract that you disagree with, then you should take the time to speak to the intended parents or the agency about it.


Sometimes, oral promises are made that are not reflected in the contract. For example, a contract may not have a provision explaining who will pay for an amniocentesis test. The intended parents may say, “Oh don’t worry, we’ll pay. Just send us the bill.” However, problems can arise if you have a dispute as to who should pay. A court may or may not find an oral side agreement valid. Accordingly, make sure the contract contains all relevant terms.

, If you undertake a traditional surrogacy, then you will need to consent to terminating your parental rights. This requirement only applies in a traditional surrogacy.


Under Florida law, you can rescind your consent within 48 hours of birth., Once you have become impregnated, then you should follow the contract. A failure to follow the contract could open you up to a lawsuit filed by either the intended parents or the surrogacy agency. If any unforeseen complications arise in the pregnancy which were not dealt with in the contract, then you should speak to your lawyer and raise the issue with the intended parents.

, Although there is no charge to attend orientation and training for foster care or adoption, there are costs associated with the qualification process, as well as costs after you are licensed.


To complete your application process, you may have to order as many as three criminal records clearances for yourself and any co-applicants, one criminal records clearance for any other adults living in your house, pay an application and materials fee, complete CPR and first aid certification, and get other required health screenings.These costs usually don't add up to more than a few hundred dollars.If you become certified through a private agency, some of the costs you incur during the application process may be reimbursed after you become a licensed foster parent.State law imposes certain minimum personal, safety and space requirements, which may necessitate some renovation to your house.For example, all foster homes must have a working smoke detector in the hall outside each bedroom. If you have a pool, it must be fenced or have a locked cover so that it is inaccessible to children under 10. If you decide you want to be a foster parent, your licensing worker will note any hazards or concerns when she conducts her home visit.
You also must have phone service and a working phone that is unblocked and accessible at all times.Foster parents do receive a monthly payment from the California Department of Social Services to help feed and clothe the foster child as well as meet any other material needs the child might have.Basic foster care rates range from $657 to $820 a month.The child also receives medical and dental insurance through Medi-Cal.Emergency foster parents receive a higher monthly payment because the needs of the children in emergency foster care are greater. Specialized care increments may add between $79 and $840 a month depending on the child's needs assessed by that child's social worker.Foster children also receive an additional clothing allowance each year.

, Generally, a foster parent is expected to provide a stable and supportive temporary environment for children until the problems with their birth parents are resolved.California recognizes several different types of foster homes, which provide different services and care for children.
For example, emergency foster homes provide children under 12 with temporary care when the children's living situation puts them at immediate risk. Parents in these homes work with social workers to stabilize and assess the child's needs over a 59-day period.

,


In many cases, as a foster parent you will be working with a child's caseworker to reunite that child with her parents.Foster parents become members of a team that works to care for the child – a team that typically includes the foster parents as well as social workers, other professionals, and the juvenile court system.
Foster parents must be willing to accept assistance and guidance from social workers, who may know the child's situation and understand the child's needs better than they do.

, Because foster parents are expected to provide stable, loving homes for troubled children, the state imposes certain minimum requirements.


Generally, foster parents must pass a criminal background check and have a regular source of monthly income to pay all personal and household expenses.California state law requires foster parents to be at least 18 years old; however, most counties and private agencies set a higher minimum age. For example, Families for Children requires foster parents to be at least 25 years old,and San Bernardino County looks for foster parents who are at least 28.Foster parents may be single or married, but if living with an unmarried partner the relationship should be stable.Foster parents may own or rent their home, but they must have at least one spare bedroom and the home must meet all state health and safety standards.All foster parents must have a clean driving record, own a car large enough to transport the family, and carry insurance on that car., Each county has a social services office that will guide you through the process of becoming a licensed foster parent.


Alternately, you can become licensed through a private adoption and foster care agency.For example, Families for Children is a state-licensed private agency that provides adoption and foster care services in 35 Northern California Counties in the Sacramento, Chico, and San Francisco Bay areas., Thoroughly read the initial materials given to you to decide if being a foster parent is right for you. The licensing worker will answer any questions you might have.


Some counties have orientation meetings where the foster care system and the licensing process are fully explained. If your county has these meetings, going to one is an opportunity not only to ask questions but also to meet other families who are considering being foster parents.

, Many counties and private agencies have parenting classes that will teach you how to parent children who have been abused or neglected.


For example, Sonoma County has a free nine-class series that prospective foster parents can attend that not only teaches them about parenting about also about the court system, and helps them decide if they want to become foster parents.
Foster parents licensed through Families for Children, a state-licensed private foster family agency in Northern California, must complete 12 hours of pre-certification training and 12 hours continuing education each year after certification.After being licensed, you may be required to take continuing education classes. For example, Sonoma County expects licensed foster parents to complete eight hours of continuing education each year.

, Before you begin your application, read through it and make a list of any information or documentation you will need.

, Foster parents must be screened for tuberculosis various communicable diseases.


You also must be able to demonstrate that you have adequate physical and mental health to care for children., All foster parents must be certified in CPR and basic first aid.

, When you apply for a foster care license, you must demonstrate that the car you plan on using to transport your foster child is large enough to accommodate them, insured, and that you or anyone else driving has a current license and a clean driving record., There typically are no fees to file your application. Fingerprints and child abuse clearances are obtained through the state's LiveScan process., A social worker will schedule a visit to your home to check for adequate bedroom space and ensure you meet the minimal requirements for safety and comfort established by state law.


For example, two children may share the same bedroom if they are of the same gender, but a boy and a girl cannot share a room unless they are both under four years old. Each child also needs closet and drawer space for clothing and personal possessions.
Children cannot share bedrooms with adults, although exceptions may be made for infants or toddlers under two.
The social worker usually will make two visits before licensing a home. In the first visit, she will make note of anything that doesn't meet the state standards, and tell you how to make changes so you are in compliance. On the second visit, she will recheck those areas she'd noted before to ensure they've been brought up to standard.
During the home study, the social worker also will interview you to learn about your lifestyle, background, and your ideas about foster parenting. These details will help her match you up with the right children, so be sure to mention anything that might be of importance.

, You may be asked to sign forms granting permission to review your criminal background or other personal information, or provide additional personal or employment references.

, Once completed, the rest of the licensing process takes between two and four months, depending on the county where you live and the number of applications received.

, Once you get your license, you will work with employees in the state social services department to decide what types of children would be best suited for your home.Some foster parents may be placed with a child immediately after being licensed, while others may have to wait a few months before there is a child that fits their home.

, With each child placed in your care, you are responsible for keeping accurate records and providing documentation and reports to social workers and others on a timely basis."

Avoid foster parent burnout.",How to Become a Foster Parent," The foster care process is usually administered by the state, which means it changes based on where you live. Contact a local foster care agency to learn more about what it takes to adopt a foster child, and what it's like. There should be an orientation which you can attend which provides you with an overview of the process.;
, There is no single prototype for the ""perfect"" foster parents. In fact, they come in many shapes and sizes. But there are several things that set outstanding foster parents apart from the pack:


Family stability and personal maturity
Being a steady advocate for children
Being a ""team player"" with your family and your welfare worker, There are several misconceptions about who you need to be or what you need to have in order to become a foster parent.


You do not need to be married in order to become a foster parent
You do not need to own or live in your own home
You do not need to be wealthy
You do not need to already be a parent or have kids of your own
You do not need to be young
You do not need to be a stay-at-home parent

, Before you officially begin the application process, states usually make you complete a pre-service training class designed to teach you about the sorts of challenges foster youth routinely face.These are free through your state agency and are usually scheduled at times that will work for people who work 9 to 5 jobs. These classes usually run 4 - 10 weeks, but states will vary.

, After you've completed your pre-service training, you'll be asked to start the (sometimes labor-intensive) process of filling out paperwork and due-diligence. During this phase, you may be asked to provide:


Income verification through your employer. (Again, you do not need to be wealthy to become a foster parent, and many expenses associated with the raising of foster youth are reimbursable.)
Criminal record screening at all three levels — local, state, federal
Letters of reference from your employer as well as from personal acquaintances
Age verification by birth certificate or other legal means

, After the pre-screening and pre-service training have been completed, you get to meet your caseworker. It's very important to get off on a good footing with your caseworker; be honest, open, and thoughtful about your experiences and your motivation behind becoming a foster parent. After you meet your caseworker and complete an interview with her, you'll be expected to do the following:


Be responsive to the caseworker's requests in a responsible, timely, and open manner. Honor your caseworker's requests for documents and information.
Pledge to maintain confidentiality about children in foster care as well as the details surrounding their family.
Accommodate your caseworker on required home inspections and criminal background checks.

, In some states, a home study is required. A home study is a document your caseworker compiles intended to learn more about you, your family history, and your personal relationships. A home study is conducted through a series of questions and interviews, and can last anywhere from three to six months. Generally, a home study includes:


Family background and any relevant parenting experiences
Education and employment
Personal relationships and social life
Information about your home and the neighborhood you live in
Your reasons for wanting to foster parent and your readiness to do so

, It can take upwards of a year from when you first contact the foster parent agency until you are given a foster placement.During the waiting period, while your caseworker is making their determination, it's a good idea to stay busy and receptive to any questions your case worker might have.


During this time, do as much research as you can about the types of issues foster children will have. Some come into the system abused — sexually, mentally and physically — and this presents serious issues for the both the foster youth and parents.
Contact your state foster parent association and talk to other foster parents for insights and advice. Network with them and find out firsthand what's it's like to be a foster or adoptive parent.
If a caseworker comes to you with questions which you think may put your eligibility in doubt, never lie. If your caseworker believes you to be deceptive or dishonest, your eligibility will suffer. Most issues that come up can be worked around. The best policy is openness with your caseworker.

, Your local agency will require a number of safety features in your home, such as smoke detectors, fire extinguishers, and the like. Don't let a simple oversight derail your plans so late in the game! Follow the safety recommendation for the child's sake and for yours.

, Your placement coordinator should give you information about how other children in your home could be affected by the placement, and what the chances of the child returning to its birth family are. It's important to remember that upwards of 50% of foster youth are reunited with their birth families after being placed in foster care — being a foster parent often doesn't last long!


If you are feeling weary, unsure, or unwilling to accept the placement, know that you have the right to back out of the placement request before it's finalized., While there are no requirements to be a foster parent concerning age, race, preference, gender, or religion, you must be able to financially support yourself and any members of your current household. Make sure you understand the financial responsibilities of being a foster parent.


In most states, foster children are covered with Medicaid cards, which includes medical, dental and counseling services.
If the child needs daycare, this is a cost you'll probably be responsible for. Again, this differs from state to state; some states include a monthly stipend for childcare.

, A few sets of clothes for the age group you are willing to care for, age appropriate toys, food, hygiene items, etc.

, Understand that the initial transition can be quite rough for the foster youth; not everything is going to be rosy right from the get-go. But with a little bit of gumption and a lot of patience and love, your foster youth should ultimately understand that your intentions are pure and that your love is real.


Form emotional bonds with your foster youth, but don't expect them to stay for very long. Foster care can last a matter of weeks or months, but it rarely drags on forever. More than half of foster youth are eventually reunited with their natural parents.
If reunification with their birth parents is no longer possible, you may be able to adopt your foster youth. This may only happen after the legal rights of the parents have been officially severed.Continue to work with your caseworker to help meet the day to day needs of the foster youth. Stay in touch with your caseworker. They will help you better provide for your foster youth, if only with moral support.

, Give yourself some TLC. In order to physically, emotionally, and psychologically provide for your foster youth, you need to provide for yourself. To help avoid burning out, enlist the help of babysitters and respite care.


In most states, babysitters 18 or older can legally sit foster youth, although your particular state may have a provision against it. Ask your caseworker for more details if you are unsure.
Respite care is a temporary handing over of the foster youth to another caregiver in order to give the foster parent(s) a break. Again, check with your caseworker for more information about respite care.

Community organizations recruit prospective foster parents, provide training, place children in foster homes, and provide support and manage the cases of children who have been placed.In Florida, a foster parent must apply to adopt his or her foster child once the child becomes eligible for adoption.;
, A foster parent provides care and a home for children who cannot live with their natural parents or family, either because the family is unable to provide care or because the state has removed the child because of abuse or neglect. The foster parent must also work with health providers, case workers, and a court-appointed legal representative (guardian ad litem). Ultimately, a foster parent provides a stable and nurturing environment with some outside assistance, including training and periodic reviews.


Foster parents receive a small stipend to help pay for the child's needs, but foster parenting is not otherwise a paid position., You can find contact information for each community-based agency here. Contact one of the agencies that serves your geographic area and inform them that you are interested in becoming a foster parent. The agency will guide you through the necessary paperwork and help you to meet the requirements.


If there is something special about your family that would make your home a good fit for a child with particular needs, discuss that possibility with your agency representative. For example, if your family is able to foster a particular cultural background, or has experience caring for someone with special needs, you may be a good candidate for a certain placement., The requirements to become a licensed foster parent differ from state to state. In Florida, foster parents must meet the following minimum requirements:


Be at least 21 years of age;Have at least one adult in the home who speaks English;Be able to pass a criminal and child abuse background check;;
Be able to safely care for a foster child in your present circumstances;; and
Have enough income to support your family without depending upon a stipend from the foster care system, child support payments, or alimony/spousal support., You will need to attend a free orientation, at which you will receive information on becoming a foster parent and have an opportunity to ask questions.Ask your community agency for upcoming orientation dates and locations.

, Parents also receive training in safety precautions, plus CPR and first aid., You community agency will perform a background check. The check is intended to uncover any past history of child abuse or criminal activity.You may be disqualified for violent crimes, drug offenses, felony theft, a DUI within the past five years, or if you are currently on probation.Other adults in your home and any potential babysitters may be required to pass a background check as well., Your agency may require that you provide references from employers, friends and family, and your children's school or daycare.The agency may wish to contact them directly, or just have them fill out a questionnaire.

, Your home must meet certain safety standards, such as having a fire extinguisher and locking up any firearms.There are also occupancy and space requirements. For example:


There can be no more than five children in a single home;
There can be no more than two children under two years of age in the home;
Each child must have his or her own bed;
Children older than twelve months cannot share a room with the foster parent(s); and
Children of different sexes over three years of age cannot share a bedroom unless they are siblings and the agency grants permission. , After you have finished your training and received your first placement, ask you caseworker to answer any questions you have about the child's background. You should also ask for instructions about what you might need to purchase (from clothes to diapers and baby wipes) or any steps you will need to take to enroll the child in school.Also ask:


Why is the child in foster care?
Does the child have any learning disabilities or emotional issues?
Has the child been in foster care before?
Are the child's medical shots up to date?
Does the child have any allergies or other medical concerns?

, Smile, speak in a soft voice, and let your foster child address you with the name that makes him or her comfortable. The child may prefer to call you by your first name instead of ""Mom"" or ""Dad."", Whether the child has his or her own bedroom or shares it with another, the room must be 40 square feet per child who sleeps in it.Before your foster child arrives, make sure that you have a bed and enough space to store personal belongings. Consider having a nightlight available as well, and encourage the child to display photographs of his or her birth parents and anyone else important to him or her., Your foster child may have particular needs related to emotional, psychological, behavioral, and/or developmental issues. These needs commonly manifest as PTSD, adjustment disorders, anxiety, depression, ADHD, and Oppositional Defiance Disorder.Be prepared to be patient and provide comfort, encouragement, security, and normalcy.Mental health resources are usually available to foster children through a social worker or counselor. Ask your caseworker about scheduling counseling and who you can call for assistance in an emergency.

, Early on, give your foster child a tour of your home and spend some time explaining the rules of the house. Turn this into a conversation by asking the child about his or her expectations in your home. Keep taking time to talk and ask questions to learn more about your new foster child.Open communication promotes a stable and healthy relationship.

They take care of the child until the child can safely return home. Foster parents teach children skills and offer encouragement.Foster parents must also be engaged in the child’s case. Accordingly, they attend school meetings, court hearings, provide transportation, and stay in regular contact with the caseworkers and service providers.
Most children return to their families within a year, although it may take longer in some cases.;

You cannot be licensed until the agency reviews the results.
You should discuss any criminal convictions or guilty pleas with the licensing agent. The rules are somewhat complicated. Not every conviction will disqualify you.For example:

If the offense was a misdemeanor and at least three years have passed since the end of your prison or probation sentence, then you could still qualify for a license.
If the offense was a felony but at least 10 years have passed, then you may still qualify.


However, convictions for homicide, assault, spousal abuse, rape, sexual assault, or drug offenses can prevent you from being licensed.Discuss any convictions with the licensing worker.

, You should ask people that you know if they are willing to serve as personal references for you. Only name them as a reference if they confirm that they can give a strong reference. Ask your licensing worker how many references you will need.

, You will need to have a “Medical Statement” form completed for all members of the household. Give the form to your licensed physician or other health care professional to fill out. You must complete this form within six months prior to the agency’s recommendation for certification.The medical statement form is here.

Broken windows. Replace broken windows. Also make sure that windows have screens.Cracked stairs, bannisters, and railings. Replace or mend, and make sure that they are sturdy.

Medication and chemicals. Store these securely and out of the reach of children.

, You must make sure that you have both smoke detectors and fire extinguishers in the house., You must obtain an approved inspection by either a State-certified fire safety inspector or the State fire marshal’s office. This inspection will certify that the home is free from hazardous conditions.You must obtain this inspection within 12 months prior to the initial recommendation for certification by the agency.

, The home study involves more than assessing the physical space. The worker comes to your home to conduct in-depth interviews with all members of the family.The licensing worker will discuss a variety of topics with you. For example, you may talk about your own childhood experiences and family relationships, your feelings about neglectful or abusive parents, your approach to discipline, and how you deal with stress.The home study is a great time to ask questions and raise concerns about becoming a foster parent.Always communicate freely with your licensing worker.

, Being licensed does not guarantee the placement of a child. Instead, a license makes a placement possible. However, the demand for foster parents in Ohio is great.


During your home study, you will be asked what ages and sex of children you are willing to take. The agency matches available children to foster parents based on your preferences., Effective foster parenting requires open communication between foster parents and caseworkers.

, Children, and the complications that come along with them, are never a “sometimes” proposition. No matter where the children call home, parents and stepparents must be prepared to make many of their life choices based on the needs of the children.

, Caring relationships take time to develop, so good stepparents allow their stepchildren plenty of time to adjust to their presence in their family.

, While stepchildren should not be forced to feign love for a stepparent, they should be expected to behave in a respectful manner.

, One of the most important rules of being a parent is to practice kindness and consistency. Good parents (and stepparents, too) understand the value of providing kids with a solid home base.

, Parents do not get to choose the type of children that they get – so good stepparents learn to accept and appreciate their stepchildren for the exceptional individuals that they are and to celebrate each child’s unique gifts.

, House rules can be difficult for children to accept, but when they are presented by both the children’s parent and stepparent, kids realize that they will be required to comply.

, A parent should always be allotted time to spend with their children, without it causing difficulty in their marriage. Confident stepparents realize that their spouse’s love for their children in no way diminishes their relationship.

, In many cases, stepchildren have already had to endure the painful break-up of their parents’ relationship. They do not need to relive that pain by witnessing the demise of their parent and stepparent’s marriage.

, This rule applies just as equally to natural children.

, Kids should not be subjected to disagreements between their parents and should be shielded as much as possible from adult problems.

, Learning to choose battles wisely and to avoid petty arguments is a sure sign of a good stepparent.

, Childish or selfish behaviour has no place in parenting.

, Children need to live by a reasonable set of rules, so good stepparents find the strength to take a firm stand when the welfare of the children is at stake.

, Natural children and stepchildren should be expected to adhere to the same set of house rules and must be afforded the same privileges.

, Treating the children’s other natural parent disrespectfully is hurtful to the kids and is never okay.

, Kids have more family than only those who live in their household, so concessions must be made to see that the children have access to their other family members.

, While kids should not be allowed to treat other family members unkindly, they should be allowed and encouraged to express their emotions, knowing that their feelings will be taken seriously.

, Being a good stepparent (or parent) often requires a great deal of patience. Kids, though wonderful, can be trying at times and smart stepparents know when to take a step back and a few deep breaths.

, The most important of all of the rules – this one is a gentle reminder about what is truly important in any family, and that is love. The most precious bonds are not those of matching strands of DNA, but of a life shared.

According to the United States' requirements, at least one member of a married couple must be a U.S. citizen. Additionally, to adopt internationally, the United States requires that each prospective parent must be at least 25 years old.The countries from which you wish to adopt will also have their own eligibility requirements. You can find a list of these requirements, recorded by country, at the State Department’s website at http://travel.state.gov/content/adoptionsabroad/en/country-information.html.
For example, if you wish to adopt a child from Croatia, the Croatian government requires the parents to be between the ages of 21 and 35. The parents must also be at least 18 years older than the child they wish to adopt. Same sex marriages are not recognized in Croatia, so same sex couples are not eligible.;
, Adopting internationally will usually require the assistance of an adoption agency both within the United States and the country from which you wish to adopt. Most licensed agencies in the U.S. can assist in finding a licensed agency in the other country.To identify an adoption agency to help you with an international adoption, visit the Child Welfare Gateway. This is a service of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. You can access information about the Child Welfare Gateway at https://www.childwelfare.gov/nfcad/. Then select your home state and “Private Intercountry Adoption Agencies.”
To ensure that an adoption agency is licensed, contact the agency direction and request its license number. The agency should readily provide this information. Then contact the state licensing authority and check that the agency’s license is current.The Child Welfare directory will identify agencies that are “Hague Approved.” You will need this if you are adopting from a country that is a party to the Hague Convention.If the country from which you wish to adopt a child is not a party to the Hague Convention, then the agency does not need to be “Hague approved.”

, Before you make a final selection regarding an adoption agency, ask the agency for at least three referrals. A reputable agency should be able to provide this easily. Call the references and ask how satisfied the families were with the agency’s handling of their international adoption.

, If you work with a qualified international adoption agency, then the agency’s own lawyer will handle most legal issues that arise. However, if you wish to go through the process without an adoption agency, or if you want to have the extra support and experience as you work through the process, you may wish to consider hiring your own attorney.


The American Academy of Adoption Attorneys lists qualified and licensed international attorneys who may help you.Once at the website, you can click on “Find an Attorney” and search by state.Call an attorney near you and inquire about his or her experience. You will want to hire an attorney with significant experience particularly in international adoptions, not just domestic adoptions.

, If you wish to adopt a child from a country covered by the Hague Convention, you will need to participate in 10 hours of training.The Hague Convention covers over 75 countries. A list can be found at the State Department’s website at http://travel.state.gov/content/adoptionsabroad/en/hague-convention/convention-countries.html. If the country you are adopting from has not joined the Hague Convention, then you will only need training if your state requires it. The agency you are working with should be able to help you understand your state’s requirements., Adopting a child internationally requires many forms and documents. In addition to the time it will take you to complete all the paperwork, each form must be reviewed by the appropriate governmental agencies, in both countries. You will need to allow plenty of time. An international adoption can take over a year to complete from start to finish.A rough outline of the basic steps is as follows:


Complete a dossier - two to four months
Apply to the US government for approval - two to four months
Submit your dossier to the foreign country - four to six months
Wait for a referral - up to eight monthsVisit the child in his or her home country - one month or more
File your dossier in the United States - one to three months.

, A home study is a necessary part of the adoption process, to determine your suitability for adoption. The results of this study will go to the United States Customs and Immigration Service (USCIS) and the other country’s adoption agency. Therefore, you will need to prepare for the study well before you hope to complete the adoption. If the child comes from a country that is party to the Hague Convention, then you will need to file the home study together with your initial application. If not, then you will have a year to submit your home study., As part of the home study, a licensed social worker will visit and determine the safety and comfort level of your house. This includes the overall cleanliness. You should remove trash, clutter, accumulated newspapers or magazines, or old toys or clothes. Make sure that the bathroom and kitchen are in very good condition. Make sure you have sufficient hot and cold water and repair any loosened tiles or broken shower curtain rods.


Make sure that your home is well lit and ventilated. Put screens on the windows and replace broken light bulbs.
Look for and correct any safety concerns. Move through your home and look closely for anything that might endanger a child. Conceal exposed wires and repair broken or loose banisters and steps. Keep all firearms (if you have any) locked, and store chemicals out of the reach of children.
Find out about bedroom requirements. Some states require that each child have his or her own bedroom. Some states may limit the number of children who can share one bedroom. Check with your adoption agency for your state’s requirements.

, This will generally be a licensed social worker or other state employee. The evaluator will meet with you, walk through the home checking the cleanliness and safety, and will want to interview all adults who live in the home. Each country will have its own precise requirements for the home study. During the home study, you should be ready to discuss your reasons for wanting to adopt as well as your strengths and weaknesses as a parent. Be prepared also to discuss any domestic violence or sexual abuse that you have either suffered or witnessed, either as an adult or as a child. The evaluator will be considering all available factors in determining your suitability as an adoptive parent.
Always be truthful. If you try to hide information that you think could be harmful to your application, such as an old arrest record, the cover-up will appear worse than the event itself. If you had a problem like that earlier in life, explain it openly, and explain how you have grown and learned from it.

, Each adult who lives in the home will need a criminal history check. You must disclose any arrest or conviction, or your application may be denied., All international adoptions will begin by submitting a dossier to the central adoption agency in the country from which you hope to adopt a child. This dossier will usually take several months to complete. Your local adoption agency will be able to help you in compiling the information for it, so you will satisfy the requirements of the other country. A typical dossier includes:the home study
medical reports
information on finances and employment
copies of important documents, such as birth certificates and marriage certificates
certificates that show completion of any required adoption education
letters of reference

, Part of the adoption process will require a visit to the child’s home country, so you will need your passport. If you have a valid passport but need to renew it, you can do so by mail. See the State Department’s webpage at http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/passports/renew.html for more information.



Get a US Passport also contains helpful tips and information if you do not yet have a passport and need to get one.

, You will need form I-600A or I-800A from the USCIS to complete this step. This is an application for a finding that you are suitable as parents to bring a child into the United States. You can apply for this pre-approval by completing specific forms. The form you use will depend on what country you are adopting from.


If the child’s home country is not a party to the Hague Convention, then you will need to fill out Form I-600A, Application for Advance Processing of an Orphan Petition.Make sure to complete the form accurately and completely. Your adoption agency or attorney may be able to help you.
If the child’s home country is a party to the Hague Convention, then you will need to complete Form I-800A, Application for Determination of Suitability to Adopt a Child from a Convention Country., After the pre-approval, you will need to complete the formal petition for adoption. This will be either form I-600 or I-800, depending on the child’s home country. You can download either form from the USCIS website or you may be able to get the forms from your adoption agency.


Use Form I-600, Petition to Classify Orphan as an Immediate Relative, for a child from a non-Hague Convention country.
Use Form I-800, Petition to Classify Convention Adoptee as an Immediate Relative, for a child from a Hague Convention country., Adopting a child from another country is not a precise process that you will be able to plan exactly. There may be delays along the way, so you will need to plan some additional time. Your adoption agency will help you decide how much time you should need, and then you should be prepared to spend a few extra days.

, This step will differ from one country to another. From some countries, you may know very little, if anything about the child you seek to adopt, until you get there. However, for other countries, you may already have the child’s name, photograph, medical history and other information before you decide to travel., To bring your adopted child back into the United States, you must get a physical examination of the child in his or her home country. The examination must show that the child is free of certain infectious or contagious diseases, before you will be allowed to travel back to the U.S., Depending on the country, you may need to attend a formal hearing in court to get final approval of the adoption. Check with your adoption agency to determine whether this is a requirement for the country from which you are adopting. The agency should be able to help you with scheduling the hearing and understanding the protocols for it.

, In some countries, you may be required to file certain registration materials with an appropriate government agency before you can leave the country with the child. Find out from your adoption agency how to accomplish this registration and be sure to complete the process before you leave the country. #Obtain a US visa for your adopted child. Before you leave the child’s home country, you will need to visit a U.S. Embassy to complete paperwork and be interviewed. This is the procedure for obtaining a visa for the child’s travel and entry into the U.S.If you are adopting from a Hague Convention country, you will need to submit the visa application before completing the foreign adoption. From a non-Hague convention country, you will complete the adoption process first, and then apply for a visa. Consult with your adoption agency for information on this process.

, This step may not be required, if your adoption in the child’s home country was considered legally final. However, you have the option of re-adopting in a U.S. court, if you wish. This may be a good idea, if you want to have a state-issued birth certificate or if you want to rename the child.To adopt in the U.S., either your lawyer or adoption agency will file a petition with the family or probate court in your home state. A hearing will probably be scheduled, which you would need to attend.

, In many cases, parents with newly adopted children, particularly from another country, may wish to seek counseling for themselves or for the child. Depending on the child’s age, he or she may experience some difficulty adjusting to your culture, which will likely be very different from what he or she grew up with. In addition, you may want some help in learning how to support your child’s native heritage.


Check with your adoption agency to find out what additional services they offer after the adoption is complete, or if they can refer you to to another appropriate state agency.
For example, you may be able to find a support group in your area of other parents who have adopted children from the same country or same part of the world., Again depending on the country where the child was living before the adoption, you may need to submit occasional reports about the child’s health and welfare. Find out from your adoption agency or attorney if these requirements apply to you."
"
Adopt a child with special needs.,
Confirm the child meets additional eligibility requirements.,
Contact the adoption assistance specialist in your state.,
Negotiate an adoption subsidy agreement.,
Finalize your written agreement.",How to Apply for Financial Adoption Assistance1," Financial adoption assistance is available to prospective parents who are adopting a child with special needs, as defined by state and federal law. Specifically, the child must meet all three criteria:The state must determine that the child cannot or should not be returned to the birth parents' home.
The state must find a specific factor – or combination of several – that makes the child difficult to place with adoptive parents. These factors may include the child's age, the fact that the child is a member of a sibling group that cannot be separated, or the child's disabilities or medical issues.
The state must attempt to place the child without financial assistance and fail. It's not necessary for the state to shop around for parents while the child remains in foster care to satisfy this requirement. It's enough if the state asks if you can adopt the child without assistance, and you are unable to do so.;
, If the child qualifies as a child with special needs, he or she must meet one of six additional criteria for you to be eligible for federal adoption assistance.A child is eligible for federal assistance if the birth family meets the income guidelines for AFDC assistance. However, this requirement is being phased out under 2008 legislation.
As of 2016, the child must be at least four years old to qualify for federal adoption assistance if the birth family does not meet the income guidelines for AFDC assistance.
By 2018, all children with special needs will qualify for federal adoption assistance regardless of age or the birth family's income.
A child with special needs also qualifies for federal adoption assistance if he or she has been in foster care for at least 60 consecutive months, regardless of the child's age.

, You can find the name and contact information for your state's adoption assistance specialist on the U.S. Department of Health & Human Service's child welfare website.You also may be able to find this person by contacting your state's department of social services or visiting its website.
The adoption assistance specialist will work with you to determine the best programs available for which you and the child you're adopting qualify, since you can only receive federal or state adoption assistance, but not both.

, If you qualify for federal adoption assistance, you must work with your state or local adoption agency and any other agencies that are involved in the adoption to determine how much assistance you will receive, and for how long.You typically must first fill out a standard form requesting adoption assistance. A caseworker will be assigned who will review your request and work out an agreement with you.
The agreement must specify the amount of adoption assistance payments and any other services the government will provide, along with the dates that each type of assistance will be provided.
Because you are receiving federal assistance, the agreement will remain in effect under the same terms regardless of whether you move to a different state, or live in a different state than the child you're adopting is from.
You also must negotiate conditions under which the assistance may be increased or decreased. Including these conditions in the original agreement may eliminate the need to renegotiate the agreement later if the situation changes.

, Once you've negotiated your adoption subsidy agreement, it must be put in writing and signed by all involved parties. Once signed, the document becomes a contract that is legally binding on all parties.Your final written agreement will outline your responsibilities as an adoptive parent, including any financial reporting or recertification requirements for continuing to receive assistance.
Under federal law, the agreement must remain into effect until the child turns 18, or 21 if he or she has a mental or physical disability that requires continued assistance.
Generally, the amount of assistance you receive under an adoption subsidy agreement cannot exceed the amount a foster family would receive to care for the child.

Contact your local department of social services.,
Apply for reimbursement of non-recurring expenses.,
Evaluate state eligibility requirements.,
Complete your adoption assistance agreement.",How to Apply for Financial Adoption Assistance2," Even if you're adopting through a private service, a caseworker at your local department of social services will be able to help you determine if you're eligible for state financial adoption assistance.Many states offer financial assistance to families that don't qualify for federal assistance.
Typically state adoption assistance must come from the state that originally had custody of the child, so if you are adopting a child from another state you should contact the department of social services in that state.

, Most states allow reimbursement for some or all of the expenses you incur as a result of the adoption process itself, up to a maximum amount.Most states allow reimbursement of up to $2,000 of non-recurring adoption expenses per placement, provided those expenses cannot be paid or reimbursed by another source.
Reimbursement typically can only be requested after the adoption has been finalized. Speak with your adoption social worker about getting a reimbursement request form.
Any reimbursement is paid to you, not to service providers. You must pay the expenses and then apply for a reimbursement.
If you live in a different state than the child you're adopting, you should check with the department of social services in the child's home state to get a reimbursement request form.

, Typically, states provide some financial adoption assistance to adoptive families who don't meet the requirements for federal assistance but still need financial help to adopt a child.The child must qualify as a child with special needs, as defined by the state's law. There may be additional requirements not present under the federal definition.
For example, many states require the child to be over a certain age, typically at least eight years old.
Most states also categorize children as having special needs if they are racially mixed or a member of a racial or ethnic minority, or if they have physical or mental disabilities.
While some states provide assistance for children in licensed private adoption agencies, most require the child to be in the custody of the state or a public adoption agency.

, If you qualify for state assistance, you must sign a written contract outlining the amount of assistance you will receive and any conditions that must be met to receive that assistance.Your final adoption assistance agreement will include the amount of financial assistance you will receive from the state, as well as the provision of any medical, counseling, or other services.
Many states evaluate adoption assistance agreements periodically while they are in effect to reassess the needs of the child and the family's situation to determine if circumstances require an increase or decrease in state assistance.
Some states may offer additional specialized or exceptional rates based on the needs of the child.

Consider joining an adoption support group.,
Claim the adoption tax credit.,
Evaluate medical assistance programs.,
Apply for education assistance.,
Renegotiate your adoption subsidy agreement.",How to Apply for Financial Adoption Assistance3," Adoptive parent support groups give you the opportunity to share and network with other adoptive parents, as well as learn from their experiences.Support groups provide informal networking opportunities for adoptive parents and can connect you to other post-adoption resources for financial assistance, training, and other services.
Your state also may offer additional services, such as family, adjustment, and crisis counseling.
Many states also offer respite programs, through which free care is provided for the child to give the parents an afternoon or morning off.

, You can deduct adoption expenses including agency fees, court costs, attorney's fees, or other expenses directly related to the adoption of an eligible child and apply the amount as a credit toward your federal tax liability.You may be eligible to claim the adoption tax credit even if you didn't adopt a child with special needs, or the child was not eligible for either federal or state financial adoption assistance.
The tax credit covers non-recurring expenses you had to pay to adopt the child, and does not cover expenses related to the child's care such as money you paid to buy clothes for the child, or furniture for the child's room.
The tax credit is non-refundable, which means it only applies against your tax liability. However, you can carry over unused credit amounts for up to five tax years after the year in which the adoption was finalized.

, States have a variety of resources to assist parents who have adopted a child with ongoing medical needs, including physical, mental, or emotional disabilities.If your child qualified for federal adoption assistance, he or she automatically qualifies for Medicaid. These benefits are nationwide.
Many states also offer counseling services for children with special needs, regardless of whether the child qualifies for either federal or state financial assistance.
In most cases, medical assistance will be negotiated as part of your adoption assistance agreement. However, your child may qualify for additional assistance such as counseling or crisis intervention under some circumstances.

, If you adopted a teenager, that child may qualify for assistance that will pay his or her tuition and other educational expenses at a community college or four-year university.Children over the age of 13 who were adopted from foster care are considered independent students for the purposes of federal financial aid, which means the income of you or your spouse is not considered in determining that child's eligibility for grants and loans.
Many states also offer tuition waivers for adopted children who previously were in foster care, and who want to attend a state-supported public college or university.
State governments and nonprofit organizations also offer scholarships and grants for children previously in the foster care system who want to continue their education beyond high school. These grants and scholarships may be applied to tuition and fees at public or private colleges and universities, as well as community colleges and trade schools.

, If your child requires additional medical, mental health, or special services than he or she needed when the adoption was finalized, you may be able to get more financial assistance.If you were receiving the maximum amount available according to the amount a foster family would receive, but the state has increased its foster care board rate, you may be able to renegotiate to receive assistance at the new, higher rate.
You also may want to renegotiate your adoption assistance agreement if it didn't include medical assistance and you now require it.
This may happen if your adopted child is newly diagnosed with a condition that he or she suffered from at the time of adoption, and requires additional medical treatment or services as a result.

Decide with your family what information about the adoption is private and what is not, and who it can be shared with.,
Be prepared to put up healthy boundaries about the adoption, even with immediate or extended family members.,
Keep calm when a situation arises.,
Give helpful, polite answers if you desire.,
Try ending the conversation.,
Think out some tactics to circumvent other inappropriate questions.,
Tailor your responses depending on who is asking.",How to Answer Rude Questions About Adoption," Don't forget to honor your adopted child's wishes on the subject. Recognize that it is perfectly alright to be fine sharing information with close friends, but not with recent acquaintances or strangers. And, in some cases, certain questions cannot or should not be answered at all. Things you might consider when setting your comfort levels include:


Why an adoptee's parents decided to place a child up for adoption or what caused them to be removed from parental custody.
Information on the biological parents.
The details about the child's conception.
What your child can understand and process healthily.
Any arrangements with the birth parents. For instance: an open adoption in which the child has an ongoing relationship with the birth mother may be quite different than a traditional closed adoption, where there is limited or no information about the birth mother.
Ask your child what they comfortable in sharing or having shared, if they are old enough to do so. Some children prefer to be private about information about adoption. Even if the adoptee is quite happy with being adopted, it still may not be something he or she wants to discuss in length with everyone.;
, Sometimes people get nosy about things that are not pertinent to a child's current life, and then make assumptions or conclusions which are unfair. It is often easy to overshare, which might pass on information which could be misused or abused by other people.


Not all families have this problem. Ideally, your family would be accepting and nurturing to a child no matter what the circumstances of the adoption were, but sometimes this is not the case.

, Remember that many people just do not understand how adoption works, and that the media—especially movies—makes adoption out to be something it is not.

, Most people who ask inappropriate or ignorant questions are genuinely unaware that their questions are out of line. Giving them a gentle education in understanding adoption will go a long way to a better grasp of reality. You might be the only teacher they have, and most people are observant enough to catch your re-wording.


Correct their adoption terminology, giving more accurate titles to the various people in the adoption story.
For example: make a point to call the person who gave birth to your child their ""birth mother"" instead of ""real mother.""
It might feel great to give a sarcastic answer such as, ""Of course I'm her real parent, do I look imaginary to you?!"" However, this is likely to leave the person asking the question without any new information about adoption.

, If you do not have the time or the desire to go into detail, you certainly have the right to shut down the conversation. A few good ways to do so include:


""Excuse me, I need to get going. I hope you have a good day.""
""That isn't something I feel comfortable talking about right now.""
"" The birth mother requested that we wait until my child is eighteen to give her that information, and I have to respect this request.""

, There is no one right response.—Work with what feels right with your personality and situation.


If asked: ""How much did he cost?""

""Do you mean how much it cost to adopt him? Finances are not really something I'd like to talk to a stranger about.""
""Some days—my sanity! But really, she is priceless to me!""
""Why do you want to know? Are you looking to adopt?""


Another example: ""Why didn't you adopt from our country instead of overseas? There are children without parents in our nation!""

""Oh, are you thinking of adopting?""
""This is my daughter, and no matter where she was born she is my child and I love her.""
""I'm aware there are children locally without homes, and it was a difficult decision, but this seemed the right decision for our family.""


If you adopted someone outside your race: ""Why didn't you adopt someone of your own race?"" (Although this is more typically couched in terms such as ""someone who looks more like you."")

""I took one look at her picture and fell in love.""
""That was not really a factor for me in adopting this child.""
Give a blank stare. Sometimes being silent lets the other person consider the foolishness of the comment. Not every ignorant comment merits a response, either.



, For instance, your father-in-law will warrant a different kind of answer than another parent at the park. Make sure that if someone in your family frequently asks troublesome questions that you talk to them privately and tell them how they are not being very thoughtful or considerate about your child's feelings.

Watch for new behaviors.,
Look for a decrease in old behaviors.,
Maintain contact with the parents of your child's friends.It may also be a good idea to make friends with the parents of you child's friends and even parents of kids your child does not hang out with.",How to Find out if Your Child Is Hiding Something1," It requires a lot of energy for adolescents to keep undesirable behaviors hidden from their parents. The bigger the issue your child is hiding, the more likely it is that there are questionable patterns in his behavior that point to the misdeed. Below are some new behaviors you might observe in your child:Sudden surge in phone calls; talking for longer durations (possibly in hushed tones).
Increase in TV watching.
Increase in online web browsing time (possibly being used to chat with others or research a secret topic).
New friends being mentioned that you haven't met.
New style of dress.
New words or phrases.
New interests (i.e. music, leisure activities, movies, etc.).
More irritable.
Rolling eyes.
Stomping off after talking to you.
Constantly demand privacy when he/she hasn't before.;
, Just as new behaviors may pop up in a secretive child, you may also notice a decline in his/her normal behavioral patterns. Perhaps your child was once very respectful, and now he/she mouths off at any chance. Your child may no longer do the following:Make good grades in school (loss of interest in academic success).
Participate or put energy into extracurricular activities.
Want to eat dinner with the family.
Eat the same amount she used to (indications of high stress or depression).
Sleep for the same times she used to.
Tell you where she has been.
Talk or openly share details about the day like she used to.
Spend time with the family — he/she may spend more time with friends or alone in his/her room.
Let a younger or older sibling come into his/her room.
Share possessions (strange signs of possessiveness to certain objects).

, Doing so keeps you in the loop and gives you access to a buddy system for gaining information about your child and his/her friends.

Understand what’s happening at school and at home.,
Make consistencies between home and school.,
Redirect their attention.",How to Get Kids to Act Equally Well at Home and School1," Your child may respect authority or want to avoid trouble at school, yet may perceive less risk or threat at home. Perhaps your child enjoys getting praise and positive feedback from teachers and works hard to achieve it, yet could use more positive praise at home. Think about what problems exist at home and what contributes to them. You may need to offer your child more praise for when you catch them being good or following the rules.Be aware that your child may be getting more praise at school than at home. Make sure to acknowledge the good things your child does to balance anything you correct them on.
Often, problem behaviors at home indicate a power struggle. If your child tends to get their way when they tantrum or throw a fit, they’ll rely on this technique to continue to get what they want at home yet know it won’t work at school.;
, If your child is succeeding in one environment and not the other, see about making consistencies between both environments. Connect with your child’s teacher and see what systems they implement in the classroom and make a similar system at home. Replicate consequences and expectations so your child has a near-seamless transition from one environment to the other.Ask their teacher for feedback for when your child is doing well and when they are struggling with rules or behavior.

, Teachers often redirect their students’ attention so they stay on task and don’t disrupt other children. Kids may start to tune out “Stop” or “No” or “Don’t do that,” so focus on purposefully redirecting their attention to a different task or activity. Replace their behavior with a positive behavior.If your child is running around the house, ask them to walk like they’re crossing a high, rickety bridge.
If your child is fighting with a sibling, ask them to play with the dog or start a puzzle.

"
Keep your door open.,
Attend to your child.,
Look for conversation openers.",How to Find out if Your Child Is Hiding Something2," Your child should know that she can come to you at any time to talk. You might think your child already knows this, but reminding him/her on occasion may be helpful. This should be done with no pressure, not after a room search or questioning.


Simply say ""I understand that you may be going through things that are confusing or troubling. Growing up can be hard. You can always come and talk to me about anything — no matter how small.""
When your child does open up, reinforce this behavior by affirming it: ""I know that must have been hard for you to talk about. I really appreciate you trusting me to tell me about what's going on with you.""

, Parents are often juggling a dozen tasks at once, which means you may miss opportunities to have meaningful conversations with your child. When your child decides to talk to you, aim to listen.


Monitor your nonverbal body language to ensure that it is open (i.e. arms and legs uncrossed), that you are oriented towards him/her, that you make regular eye contact, and that you make expressions to show you are listening, such as nodding.
When you fail to attend to your child when he/she is trying to talk to you, you send the message that what he has to say isn't important.This may cause him/her to keep things to himself/herself in the future.

, When your child has the need to talk to you, try to make yourself available as soon as possible. You've learned that your body language can signal a disinterest in what your child has to say. This is also true when you miss conversation openers.Consider this scenario: Your teenage daughter comes home upset. You ask what's wrong and she starts talking about a fight with her best friend. You realize that she is only upset about ""teenage drama"" and you slowly tune her out or half-listen. If she notices that you are not engaging in the conversation, she will shut down.
Use even the simplest conversations as a way to connect with and get closer to your child. If she feels like she can talk to you about the little things, she may be more confident that you'll listen in on the big things.

Search his room.,
Check their computer and/or phone.",How to Find out if Your Child Is Hiding Something3," As an adult in your household and primary protector of your children, you have an obligation to know what your children are up to. You never know whether you need to be protecting your child from someone else or from himself. It may feel deeply wrong to snoop around your child's room. But, if you suspect he is hiding something — and he is unlikely to fess up on his own — taking a look around his bedroom might be the only way to shed light on the situation.


If you decide to search, look in drawers beneath or between clothes, under the bed, in between notebooks, CD or DVD cases, in backpacks or duffel bags, in pockets of clothes hanging in the closet, inside books with pages cut out, inside the trash can, and under loose floorboards among other places.Your child's room is a sacred domain to him, and having privacy here helps him learn to set boundaries with others. That's why snooping around in your child's bedroom should be done as a last resort — when signs have pointed to there being something amiss, or when you have clearly found evidence., As a part of your search, you might want to do a cursory glance at any electronic devices your child uses. Look through your child's tablet, laptop, and/or cell phone.


Be on the lookout for any social media apps that you have not given your child permission to use in addition to messenger apps. Your child could be communicating with people who are posing as teenagers and are in fact child predators.
Be very wary if your child has many password-protected apps. Furthermore, if your child is adamant about not handing over passwords, this might be an indication that she is hiding something in her phone or computer. You may have to install monitoring apps on these devices to keep a closer eye on your child's usage.
Certain apps are now being designed to help conceal photos, videos, messages, and other apps that your child does not want you to see. These include Vaulty and Hide It Pro. Stay on top of new apps such as these and beware if you find them in your child's phone. "

Be straightforward and explain the need to search.,
Know the tell-tale signs of a lie.,
Refrain from passing judgment or lecturing.,
Use the time that your child is talking to learn as much as you can.",How to Find out if Your Child Is Hiding Something4," Tell your child your reasons for searching his room and be upfront if you found any questionable evidence.Don't try to set him up in a lie by asking if he is doing anything wrong; he will probably lie to protect himself. If you found unsettling evidence, present it to your child in a straightforward manner and ask him to explain it.


For example, you might say, ""You have recently been being very secretive and staying out late. I searched your room because I wanted to make sure you are not involved in anything that can be harmful to you or others. During the search, I found this... Can you explain why you have it?""
When you follow this method, the practice is upfront and honest and your child understands that it is happening as a result of his own actions.

, If you suspect that your child is lying, explain to her that lying is unacceptable and outline the repercussions (e.g. loss of privileges).Here's how to spot a lie:Surprised expression (i.e. raised eyebrows, open mouth or dropped jaw horizontal wrinkles across forehead, etc.) when a certain subject is broached or question is asked.
Fearful expression (i.e. open mouth with tension, brows drawn together, raised upper lid, but tense lower lid, etc.) when a certain subject is broached or question is asked.
Relief when the subject is changed.
Answers that sound rehearsed.
Answers that dodge the initial question.
Answer that give a surplus of detail to fill the silence.
Discrepancies in how she says she feels versus her facial expression and body language.

, There are times when your child may inadvertently share details about himself or his friends that you find alarming. You immediately rush to telling your child why this is wrong. Unless your child tells you information that is life-threatening, pass up the lecturing and listen instead.

, Then, if you must go back to something she discussed, frame it as a nonjudgmental question that is seeking for understanding rather than a nagging statement.


For example, ""You mentioned Randy may be using drugs. What is your opinion on that?""
Asking your kid a question helps you to determine his frame of mind without doing unnecessary nagging that causes him to shut down. This also gives your child the opportunity to show that he is capable of making responsible decisions or reading dangerous situations.

"
"
Create routines.,
Make clear rules and expectations.,
Be consistent.",How to Get Kids to Act Equally Well at Home and School2," If kids do great at school all day then fall apart once they get home, it may be that they need some structure at home. School tends to be very structured, from when children arrive, eat, play, and do work. Having a routine at home can give your child a sense of security and build self-discipline. Kids sometimes fear the unknown, so having something they know they can rely on every day can be comforting and help them feel more secure and, by extension, better behaved.Have a morning routine before school and afternoon and night routine after school. Consider having a routine for the weekends, too.
For example, teach your child that first they get out of bed, put on their pajamas, brush their teeth, then eat breakfast, in that order.
However, keep in mind that children need some unstructured time as well. Be willing to let your child run around and do what they want after school to release some energy. Having too much structure can also prevent a child from following their instincts and making their own choices., Schools often have a list of rules and classroom guidelines hung somewhere where all children can see. Many elementary school classrooms have behavior charts for all the children. Consider implementing a similar system at home so that house rules can be easily referenced and followed. When children know what rules they need to follow and what consequences result when they break a rule, they can set clear boundaries for their actions and begin to self-regulate their behavior without adult intervention.Create house rules and consequences together as a family. Let the children have some input as to what rules are important to follow and what should happen if someone breaks a rule. You always have the final say, so don’t be afraid to add your own rules or modify existing ones.
For younger children, make the chart visual with colors or pictures. Display house rules somewhere it can be easily referenced.

, Often, parents will make rules and enforce them for a time, then forget about them or gradually let problem behaviors slide. When you implement routines, structure, and rules, commit to enforcing them consistently. If you have more than one child, make sure everybody follows the rules and faces consequences for breaking them. Decide on consequences for breaking the rules before rules are broken so that both you and child will know what to expect.Consistency creates fairness for both parent and child. When you are consistent, siblings can’t accuse you of favoring one child over another or giving smaller consequences to one child and larger consequences to another.
Make sure that you and your spouse are on the same page regarding the rules as well.

"
"
Motivate them through privileges.,
Communicate with the teacher.,
Ask them about school.,
Explore learning or attention problems.",How to Get Kids to Act Equally Well at Home and School3," Taking away things that are fun in order to change your child’s behavior usually backfires. Instead, use fun activities and extras to motivate your child. For example, if your child gets zero warnings or discipline at school, they can watch 30 minutes of TV or play with a friend.Let your child know what they can earn through good behavior at school. It might be dessert after dinner, time on the trampoline, or playing video games. Make sure it’s exciting and motivating.
Remember that positive reinforcement is much more effective than negative reinforcement.

, Check in with the classroom teacher about how your child is doing. Perhaps you can do weekly phone calls or ask the teacher to send home brief notes about behavior during the day. Work with the teacher in order to help your child succeed and create a united front.Set up a meeting with the teacher to talk about behavior concerns and how you each can support your child in following good behavior.
Use a behavior journal to communicate with the teacher and ask to use it everyday. That way, good behaviors can be celebrated at home and bad behaviors can be dealt with appropriately.

, Communicate your interest in how school is going. Your child may be acting up due to boredom or because they’re struggling to understand. Falling behind or being ahead of the class can create boredom, frustration, and anxiety. These feelings can be confusing for a child and lead them to act out in class or with their peers.Ask them about schoolwork. Say, “Tell me about your classes. What’s easy for you? What’s hard for you? What’s in like when you don’t understand?”
When asking about peers, say, ”Tell me about your friends. Is it easy or hard to get along with kids at school?”

, If your child is experiencing significant problems at school, you may want to see the school psychologist or a behavior specialist. Some behavior problems can result from learning problems or difficulties with attention, like ADHD. Kids with ADHD might be inattentive, easily distracted, fidgety and hyperactive, and have poor impulse control. These deficits can affect school and/or home environments differently and interfere with prosocial behaviors.Children who suffer significantly with behaviors at school may have problems with learning and express their frustration through being loud, obnoxious, or aggressive. Schedule testing with a school psychologist if you have learning concerns.
Be sure that your child gets enough exercise. They might be fidgety and energetic due to a lack of movement or diet.

"
"
Play with your child.,
Give them an outlet for stress.,
Talk about problems.",How to Get Kids to Act Equally Well at Home and School4," If problems are happening primarily at home, it might be because your child wants your attention and is expressing this desire in an annoying way. Set aside some time each day just for your child. Read a book together, play a game, or do an activity that’s special just for you two.Let your child know that you’re attentive to them. Put away your phone and laptop and spend some quality time just the two of you.
Keep in mind that kids may misbehave due to a lack of attention. Bad attention is still a form of attention.

, Some kids may have pent-up energy when they come home from school and go crazy in the house. Give your children an outlet for stress that helps them and keeps them safe. For example, let them jump on a trampoline for 15 minutes after school. Teach your child to use deep breathing to help calm them down.Enroll your child in kids yoga or meditation classes to help them cope with stress in a calm and relaxing way.

, Let your child know that they can talk to you about any problems they are having. Create safety for them by showing them love and being close to them. Show that you care and that they matter. Listen to your child speak and respond lovingly and in a supportive manner.Don’t laugh at your child or talk down to them.
Children may feel uncomfortable if asked about their problems. Ask a positive question, such as, “What’s one thing you’d do to make school more the way you wanted?” or, “What kinds of things do you notice in kids you want to be friends with?”

, At times you can learn a thing or two, and make them your friend. Make them really happy, in a good way.

, Reward them with healthy food, five dollars, or more computer or tv time. Just don't reward the child too much, they can get fussy sometimes when rewarded a lot. Tell them that a reward comes when doing something right in life.

, If you discipline them, do it, but just have patience. Don't harm them, because their children, and don't know the world yet.

, Tell them the good things that happen when doing good things. They should try to like being good, not doing it for the reward of it.

Decide what deserves time-out.,
Connect time-outs with behavior modification.,
Establish a space.,
Have a timeframe.,

Another tactic is to let the child self-regulate.,
Stay calm.,
Eliminate distractions.,
Create quiet.,
Tell them it’s over.,
Have a conversation.,
Practice positive reinforcement.",How to Do a Time Out," At a point when you are not angry, sit down and decide what actions you believe warrant a time-out. Remember that time-outs are supposed to help kids modify their actions, so look at behaviors that are truly negative, such as physical violence or unprompted emotional outbursts.Many parents find time-outs useful for actions of defiance such as biting, hitting, throwing, taking something with force, or open defiance.
Be consistent with your time-out practices. If an action warrants a time-out once, it should warrant one every time even if you’re at a friend’s house or in a public place.;
, Make sure that your child knows what you expect from the time-out. Start by verbally letting the child know, “You are being asked to go to time out so that you can calm down and make more appropriate choices.” Then follow that up with action.When you ask your child for behavior modification, one of a parent’s stronger tools is taking away positive reinforcement. This means temporarily stopping not only praise and affection, but perhaps breaking all communication for the duration of the punishment.
You may choose to not play with, talk to, or look directly at your child while they are in time-out. This helps reinforce the idea that you do not approve of their current behavior. Do not, however, turn to physical reinforcement or criticism. Simply do not provide a response.

, For a time-out to be effective, it should be quick to enact and easy to monitor. Designate a time-out area that is easy for your child to get to and for you to monitor. Instead of sending your kid to their room, opt for a chair at the kitchen table or a bench in the corner.Avoid sending your child to a time-out in an area that you can’t actively monitor. This gives them more freedom to bend the rules of the punishment.
Have time-out in an area that is not filled with extra stimulation. Avoid areas where your child has toys, or where technology such as TVs or computers could be easily accessed.

, A timeout is meant to help a child calm down after erratic behaviors and allow them to reflect on their actions. Leaving a child in time-out for too short a time may not allow them to settle, while leaving them there too long may cause them to move from reflection to resentment.


Some experts recommend a minute for every year of your child’s age. So, for example, a five year old would spend five minutes in timeout. Older children,

, Tell them, “stay here until you feel you can improve your behavior.” Allow them to come out when they think they are ready, and if the negative behavior continues, place them in a timed time-out., A misbehaving child is often seeking a response from their parent. Avoid raising your voice or arguing with your child, and inform them calmly but sternly, “You need to go to time-out right now.” Then specify what action, exactly, motivated the time-out.There is no need for further discussion before time-out starts. As soon as you call it, have your child go to the space you designate and sit quietly for the amount of time you designate. Arguing will only create a power struggle that may undermine the timeout.
Remember that the object of this is not to hurt or humiliate your child. Making a scene or making threats can undercut the effectiveness of the time-out.

, When you send your child to time-out, take away any potential distractions such as toys, phones, games, or anything else they may have. Time-out should be focused on quiet reflection, and anything that may distract from that should be taken away.Let your child know, “You can have your toy back when you’ve calmed down and thought about your actions.”
If your child tries to find other ways to distract themselves during time-out, such as playing with items on the table, take the items away.

, Your kid should be instructed not to talk during their time-out, and you should avoid speaking with them. Turn off the TV or any other loud distractions, and let your child know that time-out won’t end unless they are able to keep quiet and calm down.If your child refuses to be quiet, extend the time-out until they quiet down. Do not officially start your monitoring of the time until your child is quiet and ready to accept the time-out.

, Once your child has lasted for the amount of time you designated for time-out, let them know that the punishment is over. Tell them, “Your time-out is over now. You can come here or you can stay there.”Give your child the option of continuing to reflect if they so want. They may still be processing or considering their behavior when the time-out ends.

, Once your child comes out from their time-out, follow up with them and talk to them about when went on. Ask your child, “Do you know why you got a time-out?” Help them work through what parts of their behavior were negative and how they can employ more constructive behaviors in the future.Now is the time to work with them to help create better behaviors in the future. Make it a collaborative time where you can both agree on better future actions.
Do not simply tell your child what went wrong and how they should fix it. Instead, help them figure it out themselves by asking questions such as, “Why do you think this behavior is wrong?” and having an honest conversation.

, Once the time-out is over, practice actively showing your child love and support. This lets them know that care about them and value their happiness. It also reinforces the idea that time out is for behavior modification, not to hurt them.Providing your child with plenty of positive reinforcement also helps make future time-outs more effective, as lack of positive enforcement is a crucial part of time-out.

Welcome your child home.",How to Adopt Through an Agency," Although you may end up adopting a child from elsewhere, an agency that services your local area is the best place to begin the process.


Keep in mind that even if you end up adopting a child from another state, you typically must get approved to adopt in your own state first.You can search the U.S. Department of Health & Human Service's national directory of foster care and adoption agencies online at https://www.childwelfare.gov/nfcad/.
AdoptUSKids, a project of the U.S. Children's Bureau, also has a map available at http://www.adoptuskids.org/for-families/state-adoption-and-foster-care-information. Clicking a state or territory brings up a list of applicable adoption resources, including agencies and instructions on how to get licensed to foster or adopt in that location.Once you've found an agency you're interested in using, you can contact the agency itself to find out more about the adoption process and resources available in your state.;
, Your preferences regarding the age of the child, the level of involvement from the child's biological family, and the level of overall control you want to have over the process can help you determine which agency would be a good fit for you.



Private adoption agencies often have a shorter wait time than public agencies, depending on the type and age of child you want to adopt and how you feel about adopting a child with special needs.In many states, using a public agency is only an option if you are able and willing to adopt a child with special needs.If you want to adopt a newborn or infant, you probably will have better luck using a private adoption agency than using a public agency. Because children available to adopt in public agencies typically come through the foster system, they tend to be older.However, you should keep in mind that there are few costs associated with adoption through a public agency (apart from the typical expenses necessary to bring a new child into your home), while adoption through a private agency can cost tens of thousands of dollars., Each state has its own requirements to become licensed for adoption, but costs vary widely among state and private agencies.


Private agencies do tend to cost more than state agencies, but you get a lot more control over the process and have a lot less uncertainty than you may have with a state agency.In contrast, public agencies typically only charge a few hundred dollars for application processing and background checks. You may have $100-$300 in additional adoption-related costs such as fees for medical exams, court filing, and fingerprinting.If you adopt a child with special needs, you may qualify for a federal tax credit that covers most if not all of your adoption expenses. Some states such as California have similar tax credits as well.Contrary to popular belief, you don't have to be wealthy to adopt a child. Even if you want to use a private agency, many have sliding fee scales to make their services more affordable for qualified adoptive parents with lower incomes.Most agencies don't expect you to pay the entire cost of the adoption up-front, and typically have payment plans available in which you can pay the fees over time while your application is being processed.You also may want to consider getting a loan to cover adoption-related expenses, particularly if you anticipate the expenses will be reimbursed later by your employer or that you will qualify for a tax credit., Agencies typically hold orientation meetings to provide a more in-depth explanation of the application process and introduce you to other adoptive families.The local agency you contact typically will invite you to attend a meeting and let you know when these meetings are held.
At the meeting, caseworkers or other presenters will give you more information about the process of adoption, the children in foster care, and the roles and responsibilities of adoptive parents.Pay attention and take notes during the presentations. Be sure to write down any specific information such as who to contact and how to get an application.You may want to write down a list of questions you have before you go to the meeting, so you can make sure they all are addressed and you have all the information you need.

, Because your family will play a significant role in the application process, it's important to make sure they understand your desires and preferences early on.


You may have to educate your friends and family about adoption. Make sure you have all the information you need to answer any questions they may have.
Close family members should understand that they likely will be contacted by a caseworker from the adoption agency at some point during your application process.
You also may want certain friends or family members to write reference letters for you to include as part of your application.

, If you've decided to adopt with a state agency through the foster care process, you typically must complete a number of classes to learn about the system and the needs of the children.


Keep in mind that some state agencies require you to be approved both for fostering and for adopting, since you will be caring for the child for several months before the adoption is finalized, during which time the child will still be considered a ward of the state.Many adoption agencies – both public and private – also require you to complete adoptive parent education or training classes. In some cases you may have to pay a fee for these classes.Training typically consists of between four and ten classes, during which you will learn more about the adoption process, the people in the agency, and how to handle the special needs of adopted children., You will have to provide thorough personal and financial information on your application.


You will have to provide verification of employment and income. Although you don't have to be wealthy to adopt a child, you must be able to show that you earn enough money to cover your own expenses as well as the additional expenses that come with having a child.You also must include proof of your age. Each state requires adoptive parents to be at least a certain minimum age, and you must demonstrate that you meet that requirement.Often you also must include letters of reference from your employer and from other people who know you and can testify to your character and fitness to be a parent., Once you've completed your application, it will be reviewed by caseworkers to determine if your family is ready to move on to the next step.


In addition to details about your personal life and background, you also may be asked about your experience working with children, your reasons for pursuing adoption, and your understanding or experience with children who have special needs.
Make sure you've answered all questions on the application completely and honestly, and that you've included all documentation requested by the agency.You also typically must sign a confidentiality agreement through which you agree to maintain the appropriate level of confidentiality regarding details you may learn about children and their birth families., The agency will assign a caseworker to work with you and guide you through the application and home study process.


Generally there are two types of caseworkers – those who work with families who want to adopt children, and those who work with the children themselves. Your caseworker is there to evaluate you and ensure that you will provide a good home for a child.It's important to maintain a good relationship with your caseworker – he or she is on your side, and wants to do everything possible to help you find the right child to adopt.
As the application process unfolds, your caseworker should be your primary contact for any questions you have or any additional information you want to include for consideration in your application., In most states you must complete criminal and employment background checks before you can be approved to adopt.


The exact background checks required vary among states, but generally, you must fill out forms to get full criminal background checks, and you must provide details about your educational and employment history.Typically you will need to request criminal history records from the FBI and any states in which you've lived. You also may be required to get specific clearances from child abuse, domestic violence, or sex offender registries.Many states also require criminal background checks of any other adult, including your spouse or other family members, who will be living in the same house as the adopted child or who will be frequent visitors.What convictions will bar you from adopting a child depends on your state's law, but generally, you will not be approved to adopt a child if you were convicted of any crime that required you to register on sex offender or child abuse registries.Many states also bar prospective parents from adopting if either parent has a felony conviction in the past five years involving violence, physical assault, or drugs and alcohol.Aside from serious or violent felonies, sex crimes, or crimes involving domestic violence or child abuse, having a criminal history including minor brushes with the law such as misdemeanors shouldn't cause the agency to ban you outright from adopting a child.If you have any questions about your criminal record and its impact on your ability to adopt, you should talk to your caseworker.

, Your caseworker will conduct a home study to further evaluate your family's fitness to adopt a child.


You will need more documentation for your home study than you needed for your application, because your home study is an in-depth evaluation of your home life and personal history. You'll need documents about your family background, your relationships with family and friends, your social life, and your daily routine. This typically includes legal documents such as marriage and birth certificates or divorce decrees.Provide documentation or evidence of your participation in community or religious organizations, if you have it. For example, you could show your caseworker certificates of participation for community events.
You also may need to get health exams and reports for yourself as well as your partner or any other adults who live in the household. Generally, the agency wants to make sure that you don't have a serious health problem that negatively affects your life expectancy, and that you have enough energy to take care of a child.Keep in mind that if you've decided to use a private agency, you probably will have to pay additional fees for your home study. These fees can range from several hundred to several thousand dollars.In addition to evaluating your paperwork, the caseworker will visit your home to see the space you have for the child and assess the safety of your home., You and anyone else living in your home will be interviewed regarding the potential adoption. Your caseworker wants to know that everyone is eager to adopt and that you will provide a good home for the child.Expect the caseworker to ask you questions about your childhood, how you were raised, and your relationship with your parents. He or she also will ask about your current home life, your relationship with your spouse and the extended family, how everyone feels about the prospect of adoption, and what adoption means for you.The caseworker also will ask you how you would bond with your child. S/he wants to understand your support system and how you would react to problems or handle any difficulties or insensitive questions that may arise from other people who discover your child is adopted.Make sure you answer the caseworker's questions as openly and honestly as you can, and don't worry about giving a ""wrong"" answer. It isn't a test – the caseworker is trying to develop a profile so he or she can match you with the best possible child that will fit your lifestyle and the personalities in your home. The best way to ensure the caseworker achieves this is to be honest and true to yourself and your desires and interests.
For example, if your ideal night would be spent curled up with a book next to the fireplace listening to soft classical music, it would not be wise to tell the caseworker you have an active lifestyle and enjoy frequent sporting events and camping. Although there are a lot of kids who enjoy outdoor activities, that type of child probably would not be as happy and comfortable in your home.
Your caseworker may visit your home more than once to talk to you and members of your family. He or she will be gathering information about your home and neighborhood, your community, and your relationship with neighbors and other families in your area.The point of the home study is not to eliminate families who aren't highly educated, wealthy people with large houses. You may be approved to adopt even if you have a small home or rent an apartment – the caseworker only wants to be sure that you have the financial means to support the child and provide him or her with a loving and supportive home environment., After your home study is complete, your caseworker will compile a report for review by the agency. Keep in mind that your caseworker is typically looking for ways to get you approved to adopt a child, not reasons to reject your application.If you have any specific concerns about things you think might cause the agency to disqualify your application, it's important to bring those things up to your caseworker. He or she may have tips for you, and if nothing else the agency will take your concerns into consideration when reviewing your home study report and application.After your home study report has been reviewed, you will find out if you've been approved as an adoptive family. Your caseworker will explain the next steps to find children waiting for adoption or evaluate possible matches.You also may want to join a local support group for foster and adoptive parents. Your caseworker will have information on groups available in your area., You should review your caseworker's report so you can address any gaps or correct any discrepancies.The home study itself may take as long as six months to complete, and the caseworker will produce a lengthy report that analyzes your home life and the resources you can provide for a child. These details will be used to help match you to a suitable child who will best benefit from what you have to offer.Keep in mind that your home study report will be shared with other caseworkers who work with children available for adoption, so you want to make sure it accurately reflects the type of child you want.
If there are any relevant activities that your family enjoys or information not included in the report that you think should have been, you can bring this up with your caseworker and have it added to your report.Some agencies also may share your home study report with a child's birth family. If you're concerned about the confidentiality of any information contained in the report, you also should bring this up with your caseworker.
Additionally, if a significant period of time elapses after your home study is completed and you haven't received any information on potential matches, you may want to review your home study report again and update any information it contains.For example, you may have gotten a job promotion since the home study was completed, or you may have moved to a bigger house.

, Once you're approved, you can set up a family profile to make your information available to more caseworkers who are looking to place children.Photo-listing services such as AdoptUSKids allow you to create a profile and search for children using a number of different filters such as age, number of children in a sibling group, or geographic location.Having a family profile means your information will be available to caseworkers looking to place children. You also can send inquiries directly to a child's caseworker if you find someone you're interested in adopting.

, Once a caseworker identifies your family profile as a possible match for a child, he or she will provide you with summary information about the child or sibling group available for adoption.The policies on matching children with adoptive families vary widely among states, and sometimes it can take months or even years before a caseworker finds a child that seems suitable for your family.
Your caseworker will be actively searching for children, and you can take part in this process by searching the profiles of children on registration networks as well. If you find a child in whom you're interested, your caseworker can send information about your family to the child's caseworker for evaluation.
If your information matches the needs and wishes of the child, the caseworker will request more information including your full home-study report so he or she can more fully evaluate the match.
If the child's caseworker decides you're a potential match, he or she will send you additional information about the child. You can review that information and let the caseworker know if you remain interested in adopting that child.

, Before the adoption is finalized, you may have a number of visits with the child or sibling group to get to know each other and figure out how well the family will work together.


If your family is selected as a match for a particular child, you will be introduced to the child.These meetings may initially take place in a public place rather than in your home, and typically involve caseworker supervision.
Make sure you're taking an active part in planning the visits, and understand who will cover costs for travel, activities, and accommodations.Talk to your caseworker about how the child is being prepared for placement in your home. This will give you some idea of the child's understanding and expectations.

, Once you've chosen a child and completed all the paperwork and legal requirements, your newly adopted child will come to live with you.


Keep in mind that the child may live in your home for several months before the adoption is fully approved and court papers have been signed and entered finalizing the adoption.In some states, the arrangement may be observed or supervised for as long as six months before a court will formally approve the adoption.At a minimum, the child's caseworker typically will want to meet with him or her at least once a month for the first few months of the placement.Your caseworker typically will give you information about post-adoption resources, such as medical and financial assistance, that are available to you.Before your child arrives, you need to make arrangements for medical care for the child, and enroll him or her in school or other activities."

Resist the urge to yell or get visibly angry.,
Pick your battles.,
Be consistent with the things that you reprimand your child for.,
Discipline your child with logical consequences for his actions.,
Do not blame your child, but make him understand that what he has done is wrong.",How to Discipline Your Bipolar Child1," Your child learns by observing your actions. While you might sometimes feel like yelling or showing your child that you are really angry, you should try to stay calm in the face of his bad behavior. When you yell and get angry, you are showing him that it is ok to sometimes act out in that way.Instead of yelling or showing your anger, calmly approach your child and tell him—again calmly—that his bad behavior has made you really upset.;
, It is important to remember that it is not necessary to correct every single thing that you child does wrong. When you constantly are telling your child he has done something wrong, or disciplining him for a bad behavior, may cause your child more stress. When a child with bipolar disorder gets stressed, it is more likely that he will act out.Take a step back and consider what things your child does need to be controlled, and what can be ignored. Sometimes little moments of acting-out that don’t affect anyone can be ignored. Talk to your partner and make a decision about your child’s specific actions and which ones you want to discourage.

, Once you decide which behaviors you are going to discourage, reinforce, or ignore, you need to stick to that decision. Bipolar disorder can often create a feeling of needing control or consistency so when you are consistent with your disciple, your child will understand what is happening better than if you sometimes disciplined his behavior and sometimes ignored it.Remember that, like children without bipolar disorder, your child will most likely test the limits of your disciple. Try to be as consistent as possible and continue to discourage or encourage as different behaviors occur.

, Children who have bipolar disorder tend to show a heightened awareness of fairness, particularly when it comes to discipline. Like any other child, your bipolar child probably won’t like the disciple you dish out, but he will be more likely to accept it if he thinks it is fair. Come up with logical forms of disciple that relate directly to your child’s bad behavior. Think of this as a consequence that ‘fits the crime’.For example, if your child is handling a toy really aggressively and starts banging it on the ground, tell him that it is going to break and that he will not get a new one if it does break. If it does break, tell him again that he is not going to get a new one, and take the broken toy away.

, If your child understands that a certain type of behavior is not simply “bad”, but rather that it affects others in a negative way, he will think twice before behaving that way again. Children can find it challenging to put themselves in another person’s shoes and understand how their words or actions might be hurtful or harming to those around them.


You can use dolls, drawings or any other sort of creative, playful activity to reenact the situation. You child is likely to show you a lot more about his feelings when playing, as opposed to talking. Act out the ‘bad’ thing that your child did, and then show him how is action affected you or others around you.
You can also use exaggerated facial expressions to make your child understand how his ‘bad’ actions made you or someone else feel .

Don't forget that, above all else, an autistic child is a child.,
Be patient.,
Stay positively focused.,
Handle meltdowns with care.,
Do not yell at your child.",How to Discipline an Autistic Child1," Any given child has their own preferences, quirks, behaviors, and reactions. Any child has things they don't like, and things they do. Being autistic doesn't change this. Any discipline techniques you use should approach difficult behavioural situations with understanding. Focus on providing your child the support they need to control themselves and turn ""naughty"" behaviour into more constructive actions.


Like any child, autistic children can misbehave. Children don't always follow the rules, and sometimes all kids have trouble controlling themselves when they're upset. Being autistic shouldn't constitute a ""free pass"" from following the rules, but on the flip-side, autistic children also shouldn't be punished for how they express themselves. True discipline involves teaching self-control and how to get your needs met in a constructive way.;
, While at times you may become frustrated when trying to understand your child’s behavior, it is important to remember that patience is key. With time, with use of the strategies covered below, your autistic child will learn better ways to behave. This won't happen overnight.


Remember that autistic children experience challenges such as sensory problems and barriers with communication. This can be very frustrating for them sometimes.
Keep in mind that autistic children's listening body language may look different from the listening body language of non-autistic children. Stimming, looking in other directions, and not appearing to respond doesn't necessarily mean that they aren't listening.

, Remember that a lot of ‘discipline’ involves encouraging the correct behaviour in your child, as opposed to punishing the wrong behaviour. Work with your child to identify what is not acceptable and present them with alternatives that are (covered below). The more you reinforce the good behaviours, the more frequently it will be applied by your child. If the behaviours continue, it is beneficial to see a behaviour specialist to bring up your concerns., A lot of what you might think of as ""bad behaviour"" in autistic children comes in the form of meltdowns. This can be particularly difficult to react to with younger children or others who don't use verbal communication to express when they're upset. What may look like a ""bad behaviour"" tantrum in some can actually be an attempt to express their needs, deal with unsettling sensory experiences, or handle stress.

Ideally, you want to create a plan to help teach the child to avoid meltdowns themselves. Classic ""disciplinary"" tactics that focus on punishment, like time-outs, can make things worse by upsetting the child further and removing any sense that they have control over their decisions. Instead, teaching a child to take a “break” and introduce self-calming techniques empowers the child to manage their time and emotions and encourage the child to self-regulate.

How to Deal with Autistic Children's Meltdowns and How to Reduce Meltdowns and Tantrums in Autistic Children can help further with meltdowns in particular.

, Shouting at your child, trying to control them, or displaying too much of authority can make him/her anxious and confused. When facing anxiety, children may become very restless and agitated. They can start showing temper tantrums, yelling or screaming. Therefore, it is important to keep your voice lowered, even if you are very frustrated.It is okay to buy yourself time. Try saying ""I'm really frustrated. I need some time to figure out what I'm going to do about this.""They might also show self-harming behaviors like banging their heads against something. Discuss replacement behavior with a therapist, so the child has an alternate way to relieve stress.

Give your child positive reinforcement by focusing on the things he has done right.,
Use your emotions as a teaching tool.,
Remind your child that the mood swings are not his fault, but that he is still responsible for his actions.,
Set up a routine schedule for your child.,
Create rules that your child understands.,
Get your child involved in an activity where he can release his pent up energy.,
Be supportive of your child.",How to Discipline Your Bipolar Child2," The flip side of disciplining your child for bad behavior is making sure that you reinforce good behavior. Make sure that you praise the things that your child does well, good behavior he displays, and when he avoids doing things that you have disciplined him for previously.You can reinforce good behavior with verbal praise, physical affection, gifts, and treats.

, The emotions that you show help your child figure out proper responses for everyday occurrences. When you smile, your child knows that thing making you smile is a good thing. You can use your emotions as a way to teach your child that some behaviors and actions are bad.To do this:


Smile, laugh and exaggerate your happiness to show your pleasure when your child does something good.
Show tiny emotion when your child does something wrong, and explain why you are not reacting happily to what he has done. Your child is more likely to not repeat an action when the response is not intriguing.

, Using logical explanations about responsibility can go a long way when trying to help a child with bipolar disorder understand that something he has done is wrong. Remind your child that he is not to blame for his mood swings, but that he is responsible for how he acts and treats other people.


Sit down with your child and calmly explain that he is responsible for what he has done and will have to face the consequences, such as not getting a new toy because he broke the last one during a fit.

, As stated above, consistency and feelings of control go a long way with children that are dealing with bipolar disorder. They also tend to become bored more quickly because they become wrapped up in their changing emotions. Creating a structured, healthy environment for your child will help him to feel in control and less stressed, both of which are factors that can lead to mood swings.You do not need to schedule every second of every day, but giving your child a rough outline of each day can help. For instance, meals at specific times each day, followed by an hour of play and then a nap. You will have to create a specific child depending on his daily activities.

, Along with a schedule, you can also create rules with your child that he can use as a guide for his behaviors and actions. Bipolar children often have a hard time focusing, so giving him rules that he can refer to when he needs to will help remind him what is and is not okay to do.


You should outline the things that your child can do, and the things that are considered ‘bad’. At this time, you should also discuss what will happen if the bad behavior occurs. Write all of this down, and ask your child to carry the piece of paper with him at all times.

, Just like adults, bipolar children need to decompress and release the tension and aggression that has built up inside them. Activities like sports are a great way for your child to let out his excess energy. Exercise also releases endorphins, chemicals that make you feel happy.


Ask your child to pick a sport that he is interested in trying and then sign him up. Allowing him to pick the sport will help him stay interested in it.

, While discipline is a necessary part of raising a child, you must always make sure your child knows that you love and support him. While he will have moments of meanness that cause you frustration, it is important to remember that it is his condition that causes him to be this way. Show him your unconditional love, in the face of ‘bad’ behavior.

"
"
Have a set and established routine and structure.,
Use ""picture schedules"" to create order.,
Be consistent with the schedule.,
Adapt the schedule in small ways as your child grows.,
Ensure there is sufficient supervision for your child.,
Resolve any sleep or medical problems.",How to Discipline an Autistic Child2," Create set places where activities occur. A general routine within your child’s life is essential for them to make sense of the world and feel secure. When you create a routine, you will also be able to narrow down the reasons why your child might be acting out.

, Picture schedules help to explain which activity the child will do next. Picture schedules are wonderful tools parents can use to help guide some autistic children through different activities they will undertake during the day. It helps improve structure in a child’s life particularly when children with autism can have difficulty keeping an overview of their daily activities. Some ideas for ways to use picture schedules include:


You and your child can keep track of tasks by “ticking off” completed activities.
You and your child can keep a clock or a light-up timer near the activities to determine the time frame for each activity (if this helps the child).
Help your child to design and draw these pictures so that he or she feels more of a connection with the images.
Keep the images in a book or on a board or wall so that your child can refer to them when he or she wants to.

, This helps the child feel secure. If a change needs to be made, give the child warning and an explanation, so it feels less jarring. Work together with other caretakers (such as teachers and therapists) to create a consistent system., While the schedule should remain relatively consistent, this does not mean there is no room for development of your child’s activities and discipline as your child makes their natural progression in development and growth as an individual.


For example, you may have scheduled exercise as the after lunch activity. However if your child gets a sore tummy every time, they may begin to act distressed before each exercise session. This does not mean that you must follow through with the scheduled activity in fear that it will ‘confuse’ your child if the schedule gets changed. Instead, things can be modified to best meet the needs of your child. As such, the schedule can be changed so that exercise comes before lunch. Discuss the change with your child so that (s)he understands it.

, This includes recognizing when and where your child needs “down time” (for example after school). Down time is particularly relevant when your child feels there is too much going on and their senses have been overloaded. When your child becomes distressed or upset because of this over-stimulation, this indicative of the need for down time. Simply take your child to a safe, quiet place and allow your child to ‘relax’ in a simple environment under casual supervision. An example is letting the child draw in a quiet room while you sit nearby reading a book.

, If your child is not getting sufficient sleep or is suffering pain or ill health, it would be natural for them to express their distress which may be misconstrued as “problematic behaviour”.

"
"
Create a direct relationship between the discipline and the problematic behavior.,
Have different grades of discipline.,
Know that consistency in discipline is essential.,
Choose the discipline forms that you think will work best for your child.,
Avoid disciplines that avoid physical pain, such as spanking, slapping, or exposure to intense stimuli.,
Criticize the behavior, not the child.",How to Discipline an Autistic Child3," It is very important to discipline your child immediately after the bad behavior has occurred. Sometimes, it is smart as a parent to pick your battles. If you wait too long to administer the punishment, your child may get confused about what they are getting punished for. If the time has passed where the child could not attribute the punishment to the specific behavior, it is better to let the matter go.If your child learns well through visual tactics, create a series of pictures that explains how their bad behavior leads to punishment and good behavior leads to rewards. Doing this will help your child understand the relationship between bad behavior and discipline.
Also explain the relationship between good behavior and its positive consequences, such as ""If you put your toys in the box, you'll always know where to find them, and the family room will look nice and be easy to use."" This helps the child envision alternatives to bad behaviour and understand why they are expected to do something.

, Do not rely on one single punishment or type of punishments. There must be a scale whereby the punishment is administered according to the severity of the behavior.


Give a verbal warning to give them a chance to correct themselves. ""Jacob, no hitting.""
Try natural consequences—if the child throws their toys, they must pick up the toys.
Consider loss of rewards or privileges, such as no TV time. (Make sure that this does not interfere with their special interests, as this may cause too much distress to be effective.)

, Your child needs to make the association that unwanted behaviour will lead to unwanted results and that these undesirable outcomes will be followed up no matter who administers the discipline., Once you have worked to understand what discipline would work best for your child, pick several and stick with them. For example:


Refuse to give in to bad behavior. This gives the child the message that their behaviour is not acceptable. Clearly explain that it is counterproductive (for example, ""I can't understand you when you shout. Would you like to calm down for a while and then tell me what's wrong?"").
Patiently remind the child of self-calming strategies to use, such as taking deep breaths and counting. Offer to use the strategies together.
Use the loss of rewards as a consequence. If a child is behaving inappropriately, the loss of a reward could be considered a form of punishment by that child.

, Responding to violence with more violence can reinforce in your child that it is okay to become violent when feeling upset. If you are very angry with your child, perform the same self-calming strategies that you would like your child to use. This encourages the child to mimic you when she feels angry or frustrated.

, Avoid labeling the child as “bad’ or “wrong”. Point out the incorrect behaviour to the child in an encouraging way to promote corrective action. For example, say to them:


“I can see you’re really upset about that, but yelling won't help. Would you like to do some deep breathing with me?""
“Why did you throw yourself on the ground? Were you upset about the grocery store?”
“Hitting other people is never okay. If you're angry, use your words, tell an adult, or take a break to cool off.”

Create a reward system that directly relates to good behavior.,
Rank the activities your child likes the most, and which ones she likes the least.,
Be open to new ideas about disciplining and rewarding your child.,
Set up a reward system.,
Praise your child.,
Give your child sensory rewards.",How to Discipline an Autistic Child4," Similar to punishment, your child needs to have an understanding that as a direct result of their appropriate behaviour, they receive a reward (such as praise or gold stars). This, over time, creates behaviour modification and can help discipline a child.

, Grade the degree in which your child likes different activities or rewards from those they like a little bit to those they like the most. Create a list to keep track of this ranking. You can use these activities to reward desired behaviour in children or when they stop a particular negative or inappropriate behaviour.


Though this may initially sound like a “bribe”, it is in fact not so when applied correctly. The application of the reward system needs to be based on rewarding the correct behaviour, not for stopping bad behavior.
Use this technique casually and sparingly. For example, ""I'm really proud of how you handled yourself in that noisy store. We have some free time this afternoon. Would you like to read picture books with me?""

, Each child is different and each autistic child is different. What may be considered a punishment or “boring” for one child could be the ultimate reward for an autistic child, and vice versa. Therefore it is essential to be creative and open to new ideas about both punishment and reward concepts in the area of discipline.Qualification: always think carefully about discipline before implementing it. Would you be comfortable doing the same thing to a non-autistic child? If not, then that discipline practice may do more harm than good.

, There are several ways you can do this, but two of the top reward systems include:


Creating a behaviour chart in which good behaviour is rewarded through a sticker or mark on the chart. If the child receives enough marks on the chart they get a reward. Offer to involve your child by letting him/her place the sticker.
Token reward systems are a very common system that is implemented. Essentially, good behaviour is rewarded with a token (sticker, a chip etc). These tokens can then be changed at a later time for rewards. This system is often designed through a contract with the child as to their behaviour and as such can be difficult to implement for much younger children.

, Speak clearly in a quieter tone when rewarding your child. Being too loud can overstimulate or upset them. Praise the effort as oppose to the outcome. This includes praising them for working towards achieving a goal. Recognising your child’s persistence and efforts is of more value to your autistic child than the result.


If your child doesn't understand spoken words, add a small reward with your praise.
Showing sincerity and delight in your child’s correct behaviours increases the frequency of those behaviours.

, These are sometimes more difficult to administer as rewards, but a great reward includes one that also correctly promotes sensory activity. However, be careful not to overstimulate your child, as this may upset them. Rewards could include:


Sight: Something the child likes to look at e.g. a new library book, a water fountain, animals (fish especially are good), or watching a model airplane fly.
Sound: soft calm soothing music of simple gentle instruments e.g. piano, or singing a song.
Taste: This reward is more than just eating. It includes tasting different foods they like--an assortment of sweet fruits, something salty and any variety of something which your child views as pleasurable.
Smell: have different smells for your child to distinguish: eucalyptus, lavender, orange, or different flowers.
Touch: Sand, ball pit, water, food packaging e.g chip packet, bubble wrap, jelly or play dough.

Use “no” in moderation.,
Give plenty of time and attention to your child when he or she is behaving well.",How to Discipline a One Year Old," Most one year olds share many common characteristics, but every child is unique. To discipline your child well, you need to understand his or her behavior and learn to predict his or her reactions. Pay attention to what your child likes and dislikes.;
, One year olds will not be able to adhere to many complicated rules, so set a few simple, safety-related rules instead. Have reasonable expectations: your child is really still a baby.

, It is hard to explain causes and consequences to a one-year-old child, but now is the time to start trying. Explain positive consequences, and reward good behavior. In addition, explain negative consequences, and punish (in an age-appropriate way) bad behavior.

, Your one year old will not learn the rules if they vary from day to day. Stick to them consistently.


Both parents need to enforce the rules if a one-year-old child is going to learn them. Be sure that you and your partner are on the same page.

, One year olds do not understand the concept of punishment because they have not mastered cause and effect. With lots of repetition, though, they can begin to understand rules and learn lessons.

, Children can begin to learn, at this stage, that their behavior affects other people. For example, a one-year-old child can learn, with repetition, that throwing food makes you angry. Explain these dynamics as often as possible, in a calm tone.

, Because a one year old can only be expected to follow so many rules, you should emphasize those that relate to safety. Explain unsafe situations as they arise, and set rules. One year olds can start to learn that safety-related rules are non-negotiable.

, Children often learn more from positive reinforcement than from punishment. Praise your child whenever he or she behaves well or does something nice. One year olds can learn to repeat behaviors that make their parents happy.

, Whether your one year old can use words or not, he or she does communicate with you. Pay attention to your child’s moods and behavior, and change your approach as needed.


To communicate better with a one year old, try looking into his or her eyes and paying attention to his or her signals. Try using some simple sign language, too.

, Remove items that should not be touched. You will be fighting a losing battle if you expect your one year old to refrain from touching dozens of forbidden objects in easy reach.

, If a child touches something he or she should not or does something against the rules, do not punish immediately. Instead, offer an alternative: children are easily distracted with other safe and interesting toys. Punish only if the unwanted behavior persists.

, One year olds may not be able to understand you completely, but you should still state the facts behind why something should not be done. Repeat these explanations frequently.

, No matter how frustrated you become, breathe deeply and stay calm. Children are better prepared to hear what you say if you are calm and rational.

, Discipline is important, but one year olds can only be expected to follow so many rules. Be consistent with safety-related rules, but know that you do not always have to “win” with other things. A little food on your child’s clothes or on the floor won’t hurt anything, and neither will a cookie or a piece of candy from time to time.

, It is difficult to get good behavior from any one year old, but it’s almost impossible if your one year old is overly tired, hungry, thirsty, or nervous. Anticipate your child’s needs, and you will have a better chance at seeing good behavior.

, If you pay attention, you may notice that certain situations upset your one year old and make bad behavior more likely. Avoid these situations when possible, and when there’s no way to do that, try to help by bringing a favorite toy or keeping your child occupied with a song or snack.

, One year olds do not understand cause and effect well, and yelling will only frighten and upset them. Your child will learn to be afraid of you but will not necessarily learn how to behave.

, They are not “bad” – they just don’t know better.

, For the word “no” to have maximum impact, reserve it for times when it is really necessary – as, for example, if your child is doing something dangerous. Otherwise, frame your sentence as a positive: say, “color on the paper!” rather than “no! Don’t color on the wall!”

, If you only pay attention to your child when he or she is doing something wrong or dangerous, then your child will learn that that’s the way to engage you. Spend time just learning, playing, and exploring with your child when he or she is behaving well.

Remember that your children are still young children and need your love and care, no matter how much they scream ""NO!"",
Empathize with them but always come back to the point, question, or order.",How to Discipline Children Who Do Not Respect Authority1," in your face and cover their ears. Remind them you love them no matter what (especially if they deny it), and maintain that outlook so your children become more comfortable with you. Remember that connection brings trust, the basis of respect.;
, Do this even if they are being difficult and argumentative. 


For example, if your girl is being difficult when she needs to clean her room, say something like, ""I understand you want to go outside and play than clean your room - cleaning is no fun! But it's one of our rules and when you're all done, you'll be able to play.""  
Remember not to force more chores onto them, especially if you made a promise. They may think you are unreliable and you will slowly lose your connection with them.

Keep in mind that autistic children think ‘concretely’.,
Understand the purpose behind your child’s behavior.,
Figure out what specifically is causing the bad behavior.",How to Discipline an Autistic Child5," This means they often take things literally and as such you need to be careful how you speak to them. Before you can discipline your child, you must understand why your child is acting out. If you don’t understand the cause, you may discipline them in a way that, to them, actually reinforces the bad behavior.


For example, if your child is acting out at bedtime and you are not sure why, you may choose to put her in time out. However, a “time out” could in fact be rewarding the child if her goal is to put off going to bed for as long as possible. Through discipline without understanding the cause, you are actually showing her that if she misbehaves at bedtime, she will get to stay up later.
Sometimes children act out because of an external stressor that they don't know how to handle (e.g. screaming and crying because of loud music that hurts their ears). In these cases, it's best to remove the stressor, discuss coping and communication strategies, and forego punishment.

, When an autistic child displays a bad behavior, that behavior is actually serving a purpose. By understanding your child’s purpose, you can figure out how to prevent the unwanted behaviour and work towards replacing it with more appropriate actions.


For example, your child may want to avoid something or a situation so they may “act out” to avoid the situation. Or, they may be trying to get attention or gain something else. Sometimes it can be hard to tell which is your child’s end goal--you will have to observe your child to fully understand.
Sometimes children act out without any particular goal; they simply don't understand how to handle their stress. Sensory issues, hunger, sleepiness, not enough down time, etc. may be the cause of this.

, One key clue to figure out which your child is doing (avoiding a situation or seeking attention) is if your child consistently “misbehaves” given a particular scenario. If the child is behaving ‘unusually’ for an activity they typically enjoy, then this could be indicative they they’re seeking more attention.For instance, your child may “act out” when it is time for a bath. If she does this right before or during bath time, you can conclude that she is acting badly because she does not want to take a bath.

Establish easy-to-follow rules and stick to them.,
Always stand behind your limits and never cave in.,
Be consistent.,
 Remember that you still need to tell your child how you feel.,
Add a note of positivity so your child doesn't feel overly bad about what they've done.",How to Discipline Children Who Do Not Respect Authority2," Your child likely just feels chaotic that you don't have set rules and tries to create their own, causing further problems.

, You want to make sure your child understands that rules are rules and they are there for a reason.

, Always follow through with punishments. If you'd like, set up a punishment table or area. This way, the child will always knows what he or she are going to get, instead of having erratic punishments.


Although it's likely you may think erratic punishments may be easier to control, pre-planned punishments will give your child a sense of what is going to happen, rather than feeling out-of control.

, For example, let your child ""Honey, I understand you don't want to take a bath right now, but it makes me feel bad. Besides, it's time. Let's go play in the bubbles!""

, For example, you could say ""Honey, despite the fact that you didn't clean your room thoroughly, I did notice that you picked up your toys and put them in the closet. I appreciate that."" After all, making mistakes is just a part of them growing up!

Treat your toddler with respect if he/she does the same to you.,
Set milestones.",How to Discipline Children Who Do Not Respect Authority3," They will learn to expect this if they act good, and will likely want the attention, and this will make them more compelled to follow directions.

, If your children act good for a week, give them a treat to reward them for their hard work. After a month, maybe buy them a toy they've wanted, and so on. Beware; only do this until you feel they are ready to continue without physical encouragement. After all, every time you behave well, you don't get a treat!

Understand babies and toddlers.,
Change the environment.,
Say ""yes."",
Redirect your baby's attention.,
Teach ""gentle hands.""",How to Discipline a Stubborn Child1," The first three years of life are known as a ""critical period"" in child development, since a baby's brain is constantly growing and learning, storing information that he will use for the rest of his life.Baby behaviors that might seem like stubbornness or even naughtiness are actually their natural processes of learning about cause and effect.


For example, if you are in the habit of just saying ""no"" or making an angry face every time your baby does an unwanted behavior, it is possible that the baby is simply repeating the behavior to see if your reaction stays the same. By varying your response to the behavior, your child will see that he cannot always get the response he wants and he will try different behaviors.;
, If your baby is stubbornly touching the same breakable item every day or refuses to stay out of the kitchen cabinets, instead of punishing or disciplining the child, rearrange the home to make it safe and accessible for her. After all, it is her home too, and she learns best when she can explore it.


Babies learn by exploring, and are not trying to be naughty by getting into things. Move your breakables and ""babyproof"" your home rather than trying to squelch normal learning behaviors. Check out this helpful wikiHow article for advice on babyproofing your home.
As your baby grows, you will discover new areas that need to be made safe for her. This is all part of structuring her environment so that she is safe and has the most potential to learn and play without risk. You should begin babyproofing your home before your child is mobile (usually around nine or 10 months old)., Most babies and toddlers spend their days hearing ""no"" after ""no,"" and rarely engaging in the behaviors they choose. After you have changed your home environment to make it safe, make it your goal to say ""yes"" as often as it is safe and possible to do so. Saying ""yes"" will let your child take charge of his learning experiences and explore things that are interesting to him.Let your child spend time outside, doing arts and crafts, or splashing in the tub as much as possible. Creative and physically-expressive activities will help to use up some of that toddler energy, helping him sleep better which in turn results in a more compliant and less stubborn child.

, If your baby is headed for a behavior that is off limits, say his name and then redirect his attention to a toy or distraction that he enjoys. Keep an arsenal of strategies ready to redirect your baby's attention at a moment's notice.For example, bring his favorite small board book, snack, or small toy in your purse when you leave the house. Keep the object hidden in your purse until you need it. If you and your child are at a friend's house and the child is headed toward an electric cord, say his name and then ask if he wants his ball. The distraction is likely to catch his attention and divert his behavior.

, One of the most common bad behaviors that babies and toddlers repeat is hitting, biting, or kicking. They do it to see what type of reaction they will get, not to hurt you or others. It is important that you teach your child how to interact with others in a safe way.


When the baby hits you, take hold of the hand she used, look her in the eye, and say, ""We don't hit. We use gentle hands."" Then, still holding her hand, use it to softly touch your arm or face (wherever she hit you), saying, ""Gentle hands. See? Gentle hands."" You can also use your hand to touch her gently, to show her the difference between hitting and a soft touch.Use this same technique to teach a baby or toddler how to safely interact with pets and younger babies.
You can also try reading simple board books to her, such as ""Hands are Not For Hitting"" by Martine Agassi and Marieka Heinlen, to model appropriate behavior.

Think of discipline as teaching.,
Follow through with consequences.,
Create routines.,
Watch your responses.,
Learn to negotiate.,
Understand pre-puberty.",How to Discipline a Stubborn Child2," Rather than simply providing negative consequences for behavior (punishments), discipline is a way of turning misbehavior into teaching moments.When your child refuses to cooperate or repeats the same bad behavior, your end-goal should be to teach your child to cooperate and not repeat the bad behavior.


Consequences for bad behavior should not be arbitrary or punishing. Consequences should be connected to the behavior. This is why time-outs are often very ineffective with children who are stubborn; the time-out itself is unrelated to the negative behavior and feels more like a punishment than a consequence or disciplinary measure. If there is no way to make a consequence, you can take away a privilege, but try to teach a lesson that connects the choice the child made to their loss of privileges.For example, if your child plays video games longer than he is supposed to, the consequence can be that he loses his privilege of playing with friends that evening. This makes sense, since he won't have time to play with friends.

, If you say that a certain behavior will result in a particular consequence, you have to follow through. Do not make idle threats, as your child will learn that you are inconsistent at best and a liar at worst.If you tell your child that she has to pick up her room before she can go to a friend's house, don't give in if she hasn't done the requisite cleaning when it's time to leave. Consistency is key!
Because consistency is so important, it is vital that you never set a consequence that you can't keep. Often it is best to not do this in the moment, as you might be frustrated. For example, if you have to say, ""If you do that one more time, I'm going to…"" the odds are good that you are already frustrated and likely to overreact. Instead, try to set boundaries pre-emptively. If you know your child is likely to continually get out of his chair at dinnertime because he often behaves that way, before dinner you should tell him that you want him to stay in his chair, and let him know what the consequence will be if he doesn't (for instance, dinner will be over, or he won't get dessert).

, Structure and predictability are important to children and tweens, helping them know what to expect and avoid unpleasant disruptions to their day.Establish daily and weekly routines so that they know what to expect. Moreover, consistent daily routines improve children's behavior and school success.Set and stick to a strict bed- and wake-time each day. Be sure that your child is getting enough sleep, as a lack of sleep is linked to behavioral problems. From ages three to 12, most children need between 10 and 12 hours of sleep each day (including any nap-times), but many children resist early bedtimes and nap times even if they actually need the sleep. If your child seems grumpy or tends to have disruptive behaviors toward bedtime, this is a sign that he is not getting enough sleep.Give your child plenty of warning if you need to change the routine, but reassure them that you will get back to the routine as soon as possible., Many stubborn children and tweens are highly sensitive and tuned in to your demeanor and tone of voice when you discipline them. They are likely to mirror your responses to them, such as eye-rolling, sighing, yelling, or exasperation.It is normal for parents to become frustrated and even angry when dealing with a stubborn child. The key is to control these emotions and not allow them to influence the way you interact with your child.
Pay attention to the types of things that seem to set you off when dealing with your child. Perhaps you are easily angered because your child makes a mess, talks back to you, or is not compliant. The things that frustrate you most often point to areas where you feel a lack of control. Dealing with your own issues (from work, childhood, or other relationships like your marriage) can help you to react more positively to your child., Past generations of parents were advised to never give in to their children's demands, for fear that doing so would cause the kids to lose respect and forget who is in charge. But today's psychologists recognize that children need to feel that they have some control over their lives, and parents shouldn't try to dominate every decision.When a choice is not a question of your child's health or safety but rather a question of her opinion or preference, it is ok to let her have her way.


For example, you might prefer that your children wear prim and proper clothes when out in public, but your child might have a different sense of what is stylish and comfortable. As long as your child is clothed, choose your battles wisely when it comes to things like this that don't really matter but might give your child a sense of control that she is lacking.

, Sometime around the age of ten or eleven, children begin to experience hormonal shifts leading to puberty. These shifts often result in emotional outbursts, unexpected stubborn behavior, and sometimes, withdrawal.


Children at this age often test the limits of their independence. This is a normal and healthy part of growing up, even though it can be frustrating to parents who are used to being in control.It is important to let them feel that they have some control over decisions that affect them, so let your child help plan the menu for the week or pick out his next hair style.
Remember that your child is first and foremost an individual. Stubbornness is just one part of a complex personality, and that stubbornness might actually be a good trait. As you can teach your child to stand up for himself and his friends, to resist bad influences, and to always do what is right, stubbornness will be a key proponent of his development into a healthy human being.

Understand puberty.,
Set clear boundaries and consequences.,
Take a break.,
Get help for destructive behavior.",How to Discipline a Stubborn Child3," Teenagers experience huge hormonal shifts; acute stress in their interpersonal lives due to budding romances, friendship turmoil, and bullying; and a growing sense of independence. Unfortunately, they still lack emotional maturity and their brains are still developing to understand long term consequences of their behaviors.These factors make a volatile environment for many parents of teens, who struggle with their children's stubborn and rebellious attitudes on a regular basis.


Puberty is a process lasting several years, not a one-off experience, and it usually starts between the ages of 10 and 14 for girls and 12 and 16 for boys. During that time, changes in behavior are typical for both genders., Just like toddlers and children, teenagers thrive in an environment with clear expectations and boundaries for their behavior. While many teens will test the limits, they crave consistency on your part. Create and enforce family rules with clear consequences.Let your teen give input on the rules and consequences, and put them in writing. This helps your teen to feel like you take his opinions seriously and that he has some personal investment in behaving well.For example, if your child runs up his cell-phone bill by using too much data, the consequence might be that he has to pay the bill or that he loses his cell phone for the following week.
Be consistent, but be willing to make adjustments as necessary. If your set of rules and consequences is not working for the family, sit down with your teen and reconsider other options. Also, be willing to relax your rules on occasion if your child is responsible and respectful (for example, letting him stay out late for a special event)., The teenage years can be especially trying to a parent's emotions. Volatile, emotional teenagers often do and say things to hurt those they love and get a reaction. But yelling at one another and letting your emotions get out of control is counterproductive to effective discipline.


Prepare responses ahead of time. If your teenager tends to say hurtful things during arguments, prepare your response ahead of time to prevent yourself from saying something hurtful back. For example, you can simply say, ""That was hurtful. Let's take a break and revisit this issue when we're calmer.""
Take a time-out if you need to. If you find yourself becoming overwhelmed with your teen, tell her you need to take a break and come back to the discussion later. Be sure to follow through and sit down with her when you are more clear-headed so she knows that you will not let issues slide.

, If your teenager's behavior is not just stubbornness but veers into the area of self-harm or harming others, it is vital that you seek help from professionals.


A psychologist can help you determine the best course of action for a self-destructive or otherwise troubled teen, who may be experiencing early symptoms of mental illness or depression."
"
Know the difference between punishment and discipline.,
Understand the role of the home environment.,
Separate personality from bad behavior.,
Learn to ask ""Why?""",How to Discipline a Stubborn Child4," A parent's job is to raise a successful, kind, and healthy adult person, not just to manage the day-to-day behavior of a child. Discipline should be seen as a way of teaching a child to regulate her own behaviors so that she can someday manage on her own.


Punishment is using painful or unpleasant words or experiences with the goal of stopping an unwanted behavior. It can include physical punishments like spanking, emotional or verbal punishments like telling your child she is stupid or you don't love her, or imposing penalties and/or withholding rewards. Physical and emotional punishments are cruel and teach children that you are not trustworthy and that they are not valuable. Many times, physical and emotional punishments are child abuse and are illegal.You should NEVER resort to using physical or emotional punishment on your child.
Punishing your child for breaking rules is not generally an effective way to teach actual life lessons. Instead, it just engenders bitterness toward you as the enforcer and in some cases backfires altogether by causing your child to rebel even further.
Discipline, on the other hand, helps a child learn life lessons by teaching her how to solve problems, cooperate with others, and ultimately meet her own goals by getting what she wants the right way.

, A home life that is stressful, tense, or volatile can contribute to behavior problems in children, who often mimic the behaviors they see in their siblings and parents and who often feel a lack of control when their home life is disruptive.


Homes characterized by noise, overcrowding, a lack of order, and general chaos tend to produce children who have disruptive behaviors, hyperactivity, and inattention.Similarly, children experiencing stressful life events (like moving to a new home, the birth of a new sibling, or parental separation or divorce) are more likely to experience difficulty in school performance and behavior.These children often ""act out"" in defiant and stubborn ways.
Dealing with the environmental factors that contribute to your child's behavior is vital if you want your disciplinary methods to be effective. After all, even if you successfully discipline your child today, if the environmental factors causing him to misbehave are still present tomorrow, the problem will persist.

, Some children are naturally more strong-willed than others, with personalities that predispose them to need more control in their daily life. Other children are compliant but might act out to get your attention or because of other frustrations in their lives. Determining the root of your child's stubbornness can help you deal with it.


Naturally stubborn children respond best to consistency and less well to long, drawn-out explanations of what they did and why it was wrong. They often act out for the reaction you provide, so stay calm and try not to give them the reaction they seek.
Extreme cases of stubbornness, anger, or sudden mood swings might signal an underlying mental condition such as Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD). Treatments for ODD include therapy and possibly medication to treat the chemical changes that cause outbursts., At any age, stubborn behavior can surface if there is something going on with the child physically or emotionally, or if she is dealing with a matter that is outside of herself. Your child may be feeling powerless, in pain, exhausted or hungry, or frustrated. If your child is being stubborn, you may simply want to ask: ""What's going on?"" and listen to what she says.Some things to consider:


Physical growth can be a particularly uncomfortable experience at all ages. Toddlers grow teeth, which can be painful. Older children might get growing pains in their legs, or even headaches or stomach aches.
Children are often sleep-deprived. A growing body of research indicates that our children are walking zombies, and more research indicates that emotional regulation can be affected even after only one night of poor sleep.
Physical needs, such as thirst or hunger, can make kids of any age seem difficult and stubborn, but it's really because their bodies and minds need fuel to deal with that particular situation.
Sometimes, kids can seem stubborn if their emotional needs are not being met. Moreover, they might seem stubborn if they are frustrated because they don't know how to express how they are feeling.

Timmy, please do your homework. If you don't do it by tonight, your iPad will be gone.
Richard, please don't watch Futurama. It is rated TV-MA and if you continue to do so, your TV privileges will be taken away.
Courtney, if you watch Drawn Together, your iPhone will be taken away from you.

, You should start with a mild form of punishment and to went over stricter punishments, if this failed. (If you want a picture, imagine a ""punishment-stairway"", which you should go up.)

,


You should give him/her some extra chores, too.This can also apply if they are suspended from school.There will be bigger consequences if your child/children misbehaves after such measure.

,
You can reduce and/or take away some TV or video game privileges.
Consider spanking, if you use it as part of your regular disciplinary approach. Opinions on spanking differ from culture to culture and family to family, but if it's part of your preferred disciplinary method, follow through as you usually would, if they repeat their behavior. Spanking is sometimes recommended for older children, but do not be abusive towards your child by causing injuries!
If you're unsure what to do, you can read up more on How to Give a Spanking and How to Punish a Child in the Right Way.

,


Example:If Grandma/Grandpa is more likely to be sympathetic and let your child watch TV all day,that won't work.
If you should leave your older child alone,take any power cords and electronics with you so can prohibit him/her from watching TV or playing on the computer.

, Consider examples such as:


Dale, since you passed your spelling test, I will buy you an iPad, but I will set a few restrictions before you use it. It doesn't always have to be physical rewards, words of encouragement and appreciation go a longer way.

Set up your home to prevent the need to discipline.,
Have lots of things for children to play with.,
Bring toys and snacks with you when you leave home.,
Work with your child to create age-appropriate rules.,
Choose rules carefully and don’t make too many rules.",How to Discipline a 4 Year Old1," You can create an environment in your home that saves you and your child from the needing to work on discipline unless it is necessary. By setting your home up so that it is safe and child-friendly, you will prevent having to create too many rules or say “no” too often throughout the day.


Use child-proofing devices to keep cupboards closed.
Close doors to rooms where young children won’t be safe if they are on their own.
Use child-proof barriers or gates to block unsafe areas like stairs.;
, Young children love to play, and playing is important to their healthy development. You don’t need to have expensive toys – children can have a wonderful play time with cardboard boxes, inexpensive toys, or pots and pans. Sometimes the simplest things can spark children’s imagination, so if you cannot afford expensive toys, do not feel guilty., Children can misbehave when they are bored or hungry. Be sure that you leave home with toys your child enjoys playing with and with snacks that are healthy and appealing., Children who are four years old will probably enjoy being active participants in creating rules. Take the time to work with your child to make rules that are reasonable. This will help your child to have a clear sense of your expectations. Because they participated in creating the rules, they will be more willing to follow them and you will be helping them to learn self-control. , Children this age will be overwhelmed if there are too many rules to remember. A four-year-old might ignore rules if there are too many, or could feel frustrated – and act out that frustration – trying to follow too many rules.


Work with caregivers to help them understand the rules you and your child have agreed upon. "
"
Do not use punishment – especially corporal punishment.,
Understand why children misbehave.,
Be flexible.,
Be consistent with rules.,
Share stories about rules and routines.,
Guide children to change their behaviour.,
Use age-appropriate ""consequences."",
Give positive feedback for a job well done.",How to Discipline a 4 Year Old2," It used to be more common to teach children how to act by punishing undesirable behaviour. Experts in early childhood development – brain scientists, education experts, and psychologists – now agree that punishment is not the best way to help children learn desirable behaviours. Children grow up healthier and happier when they are disciplined using more positive methods.The science is in on the efficacy of corporal punishment: spanking or otherwise hitting children, including young children, does not work and has all kinds of negative effects. Reliable scientific studies have shown that spanking or other forms of hitting children can alter their brain development, predispose them to mood disorders later in life, and actually keep them from learning how to control their own behaviour., Young children might misbehave because they are hungry, tired, or bored. Or, they might not understand the rules that you have set out for them. Children might also misbehave because they are confused or because they do not want to stop doing something.


If a child asks you questions about the rules you have set up, then that is a clue that they do not understand what is expected of them. Take the time to help the child understand what is expected of them. Use clear and simple language, and be prepared to patiently repeat the information now and later on.

, Four-year-olds need you to be flexible and patient. It is absolutely normal for children this age to not be able to follow rules all the time. When children make mistakes, the best tactic is to be supportive instead of angry. When a mistake happens, turn this into a learning opportunity for you and your child. Talk with your child about what she or he can learn from the experience and why it is important for them to follow the rule in the future.Be supportive and respectful when your four-year-old makes a mistake. Children this age are not capable of acting perfectly. They are learning what rules are and how to follow them – making mistakes is a normal and important part of the learning process.If your child makes a mistake – for example, going into a bedroom and waking up a family member who is sleeping, even though the rule is to allow that person to sleep in after working late – understand that your child is truly not capable of doing things perfectly. Affection for their family member might overwhelm their desire to follow the rules at this age. Patiently talking with your child is the best approach., If you allow something one day and not the next, a four-year-old can easily be confused. This confusion can lead to behaviour that you see as misbehaviour – but is just your child’s response to a situation that they do not understand.


If you decide that after-preschool snacks should be fruit or vegetables only, when you have allowed candy or other “treats” in the past, then be sure to talk with your child about the change and then stick to your plan. Going back to cookies and milk will confuse your child.
Four-year-olds who are confused about a rule might start to ignore a rule. Remember that this is not the child’s fault. It is important to be consistent so that your child is able to understand what is expected of them., Four-year-olds love stories, and stories are an important way for young children to learn about themselves, others, and the world. Stories can help children to cope with the feelings they have and help them to know that they are not the only one who has a particular type of experience. Sharing stories with young children can help them to feel that their caregivers understand how they feel.


One classic children’s book about rules is “Where The Wild Things Are,” by Maurice Sendak. The main character, Max, breaks the rules in this book. Children may enjoy discussing this story and applying Max’s situation to their own life experiences., When you need to intervene to help a child to change her or his behavior, start by giving the child the time she or he needs to respond. Your voice should be calm and firm, and you should go to your child and bend over so that the two of you can communicate directly with eye contact. Then tell your child what you would like her or him to stop doing, and what she or he should do instead.If your child will need to stop doing something they enjoy, be sure to prepare them for the change. For example, let them know that bedtime is coming in five minutes so that they have the time they need to prepare for the change.

, The most effective use of consequences is combined with reasoning, or verbally helping the child understand and connect his actions to the given consequences. However, this is not enough. Consequences must be consistent and followed through with in order to be effective in changing behavior.""Time-outs"" or using a ""naughty chair"" are popular ways to help children understand consequences and to calm down when they have misbehaved.

Choose four or five rules that, if broken, will result in the child having to sit in a calm boring spot for a ""time-out"" or time on the ""naughty chair."" Make sure the child understands in advance what rules will result in a time-out.
Each time the child breaks one of the rules, assign them - in a calm and neutral manner - to their time-out space.
Experts recommend no more than one minute per year of a child's age for time-outs (i.e., a maximum of four minutes for a four-year-old).
When the time-out is finished, praise your child for successfully completing their time-out.Another possible ""consequence"" some parents use is removing the object or stopping the activity involved in the child's undesirable behavior. Remove the object temporarily or stop an activity and move on to doing something else.If you choose to use consequences, then make sure to follow the child's undesirable behavior immediately with the consequence. Four-year-olds are not able to ""connect the dots"" otherwise., When your child cooperates, always be sure to praise him or her. All children, but especially young children, benefit from having their accomplishments praised. This builds their self-confidence, but is also a positive way of reinforcing the correct behavior."

While you may have a lot of stressors on your life, try to pause a take a few breaths when your child does something bad. This will help to keep you from losing your temper and yelling.


Collect yourself by removing yourself from the situation. You need to calm down so you can think and act better.;
, It is your responsibility as a parent to begin with managing your own emotions rather than solely your child’s behavior alone. Evaluate yourself and determine if you need a timeout to control how you are feeling.


Step out of the room and practice some breathing exercises. You can also try meditating to take your mind off of your frustration.

, Perhaps you feel like your child will hear you better (and understand your message more clearly) if you raise your voice. However, this is not the case; your child may be more upset when you yell, and may not understand why you are doing so.


Yelling can lead to feeling guilty and feeling like you could have handled the situation better.

, Understand the power of words. There is a great impact on how the words are spoken with what you are really trying to say. Even if you are simply instructing him/her not to do something, yelling your thoughts can make the words seem more hurtful than you mean them to.

, If you feel like you need a little extra support to keep yourself from yelling, talk to friends or family about how they deal with frustrating situations.


If you don’t feel like you have anyone you want to talk to, consider talking to a therapist or joining a support group where parents can talk to one another about their experiences.

, If you find yourself yelling, stop yelling and take a couple of breaths. Apologize for raising your voice, and then calmly explain to your child why his or her actions frustrated you. Put the emphasis on the action, rather than on your child., Make sure that your child knows what you expect of her, and that you will be upset if she does not act or do what you would like her to. Explain to her in detail how you expect her to behave, and why you expect these things from her. For instance, you expect her to keep from calling another child names because it is important to treat people the way you want to be treated.

, Set an agreement with your child; you could even put an agreement into writing outlining how you expect your child to behave.


One such consequence could be sitting in the ‘timeout’ chair for a certain length of time. Another could be having something taken away, such as a favorite toy or a device of some kind.

, Remind him/her of your agreement and remind her that you expect him/her to behave well. You can also remind him/her of the consequences of his/her actions, should he/she choose to continue behaving poorly.


A warning could be saying that your child has to the count of three to stop doing whatever bad behavior he/she is doing. If you make it to three and she doesn’t stop, enact the consequence.

, Because you have already decided what the consequence should be, and your child is well aware of the consequence, simply move right into reprimanding your child in this way when he/she behaves badly. If you have given him/her a warning, but do not follow through with the consequences, your child will think that she can get away with acting badly.


Remind your child of your agreement. Be firm, yet fair and do not make the consequence harsher than you have already agreed on.

, You can make your child listen to you even without having to yell. First, make eye-contact with your child, as this is a way to let her know that what you are going to say is important. Then calmly discuss with him/her what you want her to do.


Squat down so that you are at eye level with your child.
If you are reprimanding a teenager, sit your child down and sit across from him/her so that you can look him/her in the eye.

, If your child repeats the same bad behavior, talk to your child about why he/she is acting this way. Maybe there is an underlying cause making him/her feel like he/she has to hit his/her brother or sister, or steal cookies.


Often, kids will behave badly to simply get your attention. If this is the case, make sure to give her plenty of attention when she is behaving well.

, While consequences are necessary for bad behavior, positive reinforcement is necessary for when your child behaves well. Give her hugs and kisses when he/she does something good, and tell him/her about how proud of her you are. This positive reinforcement will make him/her much more likely to stick to the good behavior.


Decide whether to give rewards for good behavior. Sometimes, giving rewards can make children think that they should only act nicely in order to get rewards. Instead, praise your child rather than giving him/her actual toys or candy.

, Children often mimic their parents or guardians. Because of this, it is important to act like how you want your child to act. If you continue to yell, chances are that your child will think that yelling is an ok thing to do.


Demonstrate the behaviors you expect of your child, like sharing and being nice.

, Listening to your child, and spending family time can help to build trust and respect between you and your child.


Do activities together than you both enjoy, like going to the zoo or spending time drawing or playing make believe together.

Choose not to spank.,
Tell your family and friends.,
Learn about childhood development (see links below).,
Try varying techniques.,
Find support websites to help you out.,
Keep at it.,
Review the results Review your child's latest behaviors, consider what is working and what is not working, and adjust your techniques.

",How to Discipline a Child Effectively Without Spanking," This may seem obvious, but there is a world of difference between choosing to spank under certain circumstances and declaring to yourself and others that you will never spank your children.;
, The best way to promote non-spanking discipline is to let others see your child's good behavior. Provide your family with alternative methods of discipline if you feel somebody else may spank them.

, If you know what your child can feasibly understand at any given age, and how they process information, you will be better prepared to know when discipline is necessary and when it's best to just ignore certain behaviors.

, Some may work better for you and your child than others.


Natural Consequences. The basic concept behind this method is to let nature run its course when appropriate. Some examples: If your child leaves his toy outside it may get lost or ruined. If your child leaves his umbrella at school, he will get wet the next time it rains. If your child forgets her lunch, she goes hungry until she gets home.
Logical Consequences. Provide a logical consequence when there is no natural consequence (as in the case of sibling A breaking sibling B's toy when sibling B is far younger) or when the natural consequence can be too dangerous (such as the case of a child trying to run out in the middle of the road). Tell your child what the consequences are for continued bad behavior. Missing out on things, such as a bedtime story for very young children, or a planned activity for an older child, can often be worse than a smack.
Distraction. With toddlers and young pre-schoolers, distraction can be an effective tool in redirecting attention from something that they want to do (that is inappropriate) to something that is appropriate. For example, if a child wants to jump on the lounge, suggest going outside and jumping on the trampoline (to allow them to jump appropriately)or going for a walk to the park (fulfilling the desire to be physically active), or even something completely unrelated like making playdough (this can be less effective if the child wants to physically unwind). You can use alternatives for anything inappropriate/undesirable that the child wants to do or have and the closer your alternative is to what they are wanting, the more likely you are to succeed in changing their focus. The key is to make the distraction sound as enticing and exciting as possible (and don't draw attention to the undesired activity/object - you are trying to make them forget about that!).
Positive Discipline. A technique that sees misbehavior as an opportunity for teaching new behaviors. (After your child has learned her toy is ruined, you could show her how to organize her things.) Also includes setting positive examples in the way you, the parent, act, and eliminating negative language. So instead of (or in addition to) saying, ""don't do that"", provide some direction by saying, ""Why don't you do this instead.""
The Reward System. Intended as a supplement for other methods of discipline, the reward system relies on you going out of your way to praise positive behavior (for example, thank your child for helping with something, comment on how nice and quiet your child has been for the last half hour, etc.). It's very easy to overlook when your child is being good, but it is generally all the times he or she is not being bad.
The Point System. Give points for good behavior and take away points for bad behavior. In some households, accumulated ""points"" are traded in for rewards. In others, privileges are based on behavior, and dropping below a certain point level may cause a loss of privileges. Be careful that the child doesn't start to do things only for the points rather than because it's a nice thing to do.
Combine the techniques or create new ones that work for you.

Make your expectations clear.,
Ask questions.,
Actively listen.,
Choose the right time.",How to Discipline a Teenager1," One of the keys to having a positive relationship with your teen is good communication. You need to be able to talk to one other and make your feelings and desires clear. If you are able to communicate effectively, you might find that you need to discipline your teen less frequently. An important component of good communication is a clear explanation of your expectations.Let your teen know exactly what you expect from him or her. For example, maybe you are focusing on helping them succeed in school. Let your teen know which grades you consider acceptable. Maybe you are aiming for them to get all A's and B's.
Tell your teen your expectations and explain that you will help him or her meet them. If you are focused on better grades, explain that you need your son or daughter to study at least X amount of hours per week. Or make a requirement that all homework is done before they hang out with their friends.
You can also set expectations for non-tangible outcomes. Maybe you feel your teen has developed an attitude problem. Set clear expectations that they are to speak respectfully to all members of the family.
Try putting your expectations in writing. This will help reinforce the words you are saying.;
, As a teen, your child is starting to spend more and more time away from home--and you. School days are longer, there are more activities to join, and more friends to hang out with. To develop a strong relationship with your teen, it is important that you know what is going on in their life. In order to do that, you need to ask questions.Ask questions that require more than a ""yes"" or ""no"" answer. You'll get more descriptive answers. Instead of ""Did you do your homework?"", try, ""What have you been working on in English class?""
Set aside time each day to talk to your son or daughter about how things are going. It can be casual, but make sure to ask questions to see how they are doing. You could say, ""How are you feeling about your big soccer game coming up on Saturday?""

, Communicating effectively is a great way to strengthen your relationship with your teen. It's not enough to just ask questions, though. You need to actively listen to what they are saying. There are many things you can do to become a better listener.When your teen talks, try restating what they say. For example, you could say, ""I'm hearing you say that you are frustrated that your friends all have later curfews than you."" This will not only show that you are engaged in the conversation, but it helps to clarify any issues.
Offer feedback. When you are talking to your teen, it's a good idea to offer your initial feelings on a topic. For instance, you could say, ""I'm not against giving you a bigger allowance. But we'll need to talk about an increase in responsibilities, too.""
Give validation. Let your teen know that you acknowledge their feelings. Be specific, saying things like, ""I understand that you are really sad that your dad moved out. That is totally normal.""

, Good communication with your teen can be challenging, partially because they might not always be in the mood to talk. Try to choose a good time if you need to have an important discussion with them. Don't wait until right before bed or as he or she is headed out the door to school.Consider talking while you are doing an activity together. While you're cooking dinner together would be a good time to check in with them.
If your teen seems resistant to talking, consider choosing a different time for your conversation. You want it to be constructive for both of you.

Be empathetic.,
Communicate your expectations.,
Be authoritative, not authoritarian.,
Consider the age and temperament of your child.,
Teach your child natural consequences.,
Teach your child logical consequences.,
Teach your child positive discipline methods.,
Have a reward system in place for your child.,
Avoid lectures or threats.,
Give yourself a break.",How to Discipline a Child," Don't show anger or be harassing on little mistakes. If you want your children to be well-disciplined, then you have to be consistent about your several basic rules and then teach expectations as you do day to day parenting on new situations. Remember, often children make better choices and have better ideas than you. You have to listen or it will break their confidence and make them confused and sad.


If your children know that you're liable to overlook their bad behavior if you're tired, distracted, or because you sometimes just feel sorry for them, then they won't know how to properly act every time. Though it may be hard to be consistent about your expectations, especially after a long day, this is the only way to ensure that you are taken seriously and that your child will understand your guidelines.
Once you've worked out a system of discipline, keep it consistent. For example, if every time your child breaks a toy, then he/she has to earn a new one by helping out around the house, don't give in one time when she breaks a toy just because you really feel sorry for her on that particular day.
Be consistent even if you're in public. Though this is easier said than done, if you normally don't let your child go to McDonald's more than once a week, don't let the child go just because he/she's throwing a public tantrum. Though it may be embarrassing to suffer through a public tantrum, it's better than teaching your child that he/she can always get what he/she wants if he just waits to throw a tantrum in public.If you and your spouse and partner are raising the child together, then you must present a united front to your children and should be consistent about your system of punishment. Don't have a bad cop and a good cop parent, or the child may favor one parent over the other, and this may cause a problem in your relationship with your significant other as well as with your child.;
, Remember that your child is a real human being, no matter how young your child is, or how frustrated you may be. If you want your child to respect your authority, then you have to respect the fact that your child is an imperfect human being with his/her own wants and needs, and that he/she needs love and respect from his/her parent or parents. Here's what to do:


If you're really angry for your child for his/her behavior, then take some time to cool off before you say anything. If you walk into a room and find that your child has spilled a glass of soda on your new white rug, don't start disciplining the child immediately or you may shout or say something you regret.
Don't call your child bad names, or that will only lower his self-worth and will make him feel worse. Instead of saying, ""You are so stupid,"" say, ""That wasn't very smart behavior, was it?""
Try to avoid any situations where you act inappropriately and have to apologize for your behavior later. If you do, apologise to the child and tell him/her that you shouldn't have done it. If you apologise for your actions they will too.
Be a good role model. Behave the way you want your child to behave, or you will be sending mixed signals with your own bad behavior.

, Being empathetic is different from being sympathetic. Being empathetic means being able to appreciate your child's struggles, problems, and feelings, and considering why your child might be acting out. Being sympathetic means feeling sorry for your child when your child is upset during bad behavior, and wanting to rescue your child from his problem. Here's how to be empathetic:


Talk to your child about how she might be feeling. If he/she broke his/her favorite doll after aggressive behavior, sit down and tell him/her that you understand that he/she must be upset because he/she broke is/her favorite toy. Show that while this behavior was inappropriate, you still understand that he/she is upset.
Try to understand the reasons for your child's bad behavior. Maybe your child is playing with her food at a family function because he/she's bored out of her mind because there's no one his/her age to talk to; maybe he/she's throwing a tantrum about not getting the toy he/she wants because he/she's upset that his/her father is away on a business trip.

, It's important to let your child know exactly what you consider good and bad behavior, and what the consequences will be for that bad behavior. Once the child is old enough to understand your needs, you should make it clear that if he/she does one thing, that there will always be the same consequence. Here's how to communicate your expectations:


If you're trying a new discipline technique, explain it to your child before the bad behavior happens, or the child will be confused.
Take the time to talk to your child about his good and bad behavior. If the child is old enough, make him/her feel included in understanding what went well and what did not go well for him/her, and how you expect him/her to act.
If the child is old enough, the child can choose the rewards for good behavior, if they are appropriate.

, An authoritative parent has clear expectations and consequences but is still loving and affectionate toward his or her child. This parent leaves room for flexibility and discusses problems and their solutions with a child. This is the ideal parenting style, though it is challenging to pull off all the time. The authoritarian parent also has clear expectations and consequences, but he doesn't give much affection to the child or explain the reasoning behind the behavior. This can lead the child to feel unloved and to not understand the importance of certain rules.You should also avoid being a permissive parent. This is the kind of parent who lets the child do whatever he/she wants because he/she loves the child too much to say no, feels sorry for the child, or just thinks the child will develop and internal system of discipline later.
Though it may be easy to be a permissive parent, this can have negative effects on a child, especially when that child reaches adulthood or adolescence. If the child is a teenager, or even an adult, who thinks that he'll always be able to get what he/she wants, then he/she will be hit with a rough reality check.

, No two children are the same, and it's important to consider who your child really is when you dole out a certain punishment. As your child gets older, you should also update your discipline system to fit a more mature child; on the other hand, you should avoid giving young children the same discipline you would give to an older, more capable child. Here's what to do:If your child is naturally talkative and loves to be social, find a way to work with that behavior. Though you can discipline your child for talking out of line, you shouldn't try to turn your child into a shy, quiet child if that's not who he/she is.
If your child is exceptionally sensitive, you shouldn't indulge this behavior too much, but recognize that he'll need extra affection from time to time.
If your child is 0-2, you can remove tempting bad behaviors from the home, and firmly say no when the child misbehaves. For toddlers, time out can be an effective way to communicate that they've acted out of line.
If your child is 3-5 years old, then he/she is old enough to be told which bad behaviors to avoid before they happen. You can tell the child what the right thing to do is instead. For example, you can say, ""You shouldn't boss the other children on the playground around. Instead, you should be kind and understanding with them, and you'll have more fun.""
Children from the ages of 6-8 can understand the negative consequences of their behavior. They'll see that if they spill on the carpet, they'll have to help clean it up.
Children from the ages of 9-12 can learn from the natural consequences of their behavior. For example, if your child didn't finish his/her book report the day before it was due, she'll have to deal with the bad grade.

, Having your child understand the natural consequences of his/her bad behavior is a great way for him/her to flex his/her disappointment muscles, and to see that his bad behavior can make him/her feel sad and regret. Instead of bailing out the child in certain situations, let the child deal with his negative actions on his/her own. The child should be at least six years old to understand natural consequences.If the child broke a toy or ruined a toy by leaving it out in the sun, don't run out and get the child a new toy. Let the child deal with not having the toy for a while, and the child will learn to take better care of his/her things.
Teach the child responsibility. If the child didn't finish his/her homework assignment because he/she was too busy watching television or playing computer games, let the child learn from the disappointment of the bad grade instead of rushing to help him with his/her homework.
If the child wasn't invited to a birthday party of another child in the neighborhood because of his/her misbehavior, let that child see that he/she would have been invited if he/she had treated the child differently.

, Logical consequences are the consequences you decide will follow the child's bad behavior. They should be directly related to the behavior so the child learns not to do them again. Each type of bad behavior should have its own logical consequences, and the consequences should be clear well ahead of time. Here are some examples:


If the child doesn't pick up his/her toys, he/she won't be able to use them for a specific period of time.
If the child doesn't finish his/her chores or homework, he/she won't be able to play video games for a period of time.
If you catch the child making or watching something inappropriate on the computer, then using the computer will be withdrawn for a specific period of time or his/her Internet accounts will be taken down.
If you catch the child watching something inappropriate on TV, then TV privileges will be withdrawn for a specific period of time.
If the child isn't respectful to his/her parents, teachers, etc., then he/she won't be allowed to go out with his/her friends for a specific period of time or until he/she understands respectful behavior.

, Positive discipline is a way of working with the child to reach a positive conclusion that can help the child understand his/her bad behavior and avoid future bad behavior. To positively discipline the child, you should sit down with the child and discuss the bad behavior and what can be done next.


If your child lost his baseball bat because he was irresponsible, sit down and talk to him about why it happened. Next, ask him what he could do without the bat, and how he expects to play without it. Maybe he can play with a friend's bat until he earns another bat. Let the child realize the consequences of his bad behavior and to work with you to come up with a solution.
In the positive discipline method, time out is considered a place that makes the child feel ashamed and angry, but not quite cognizant of his/her bad behavior or determined to change it. In this method, the child isn't sent to time out, but to a cooling down place, which is filled with pillows or the child's favorite toys, until he/she is ready to discuss the behavior. This teaches children and important life skill: to learn to reign in their emotions and to take some time to reflect instead of acting irrationally.

, A system of rewards should also be in place, so there are positive consequences for the child's positive behavior. Don't forget that reinforcing good behavior is just as important as disciplining bad behavior. Showing the child how to act appropriately will help the child see what he should not do.


A reward can be a simple treat for doing something right. If your child knows he'll be able to have ice cream after he finishes his healthy meal, he'll be more likely to cooperate.
You and the child can decide on the rewards together, when it's appropriate. If the child wants a new toy, and you can talk about how the child has to be kind and respectful to his parents for a full month to get it.
Don't use rewards to trick the child into good behavior. The child should understand that the behavior is good, and not just be nice to get a toy.
Praise your child as often as you can for good behavior. Your child shouldn't only hear you comment on his behavior if it's bad.

, Not only are these methods ineffective, but they can make your child resent or ignore you, and to be mentally and physically hurt by your words and actions. Here is why these methods are not recommended:


Children tend to tune out lectures if there's no meaning behind them. If you're lecturing the child about how he/she shouldn't have lost his/her toy while getting him a new one, he/she'll understand that your words aren't important.
If you threaten your child with things that won't happen, like saying that your child will never get to watch TV again if he doesn't clean his/her room, then the child will see that you don't really mean what you say.
Spanking before the age of ten is a good idea, as it guides your child in the right direction and gives him/her something to remember as being a well-disciplined child. It may be hard to at first, but after a while you should realize you have to do it less and less as the child grows more mature and responsible. After the age of ten, though, it is a good idea to start grounding/taking things away from him/her for periods of time. This will show him/her that he/she has gotten older and doesn't need physical reinforcement to know what to do.

, Though it's important to be a role model and to find a number of discipline methods that work for your child, remember that no one is perfect and that you can't be a model parent all the time. No matter how hard you try, there will still be some times when you wish you had acted differently, and that's okay.


If you've done something you regret, apologize to the child and let him understand where you're coming from.
If you're having a tough emotional week, lean on your partner if you have one, and have him or her do more work on the discipline front until you feel a bit better.

Have positive expectations.,
Talk to the children’s parents.,
Create routines.,
Use incentives and reward systems.,
Encourage good behavior.",How to Discipline a Group of Children1," Show the kids in your group that you believe in them. Interact with them in a warm, friendly way, and get to know each of them as an individual. Look for the best in them, instead of waiting for a reason to discipline them.If you are a teacher, make every child feel like a valued member of the group by greeting them by name when they enter the classroom.
Put a positive spin on things. If one child is frequently boisterous, say something like, “Hannah, I’m glad you have so much energy today! Now let’s focus on doing our worksheets before we go outside.”;
, Make sure that you and the parents of the kids in your group are on the same page about discipline. Talk about the standards of behavior you expect in your group, and discuss the ways you typically discipline children in your care.You should ask the parents how they discipline their children at home. They may be able to provide suggestions that work well for their individual children.

, When kids know what to expect every day, they’re less likely to misbehave. Establish a predictable schedule in your classroom or daycare. Give the kids a heads-up several minutes before you transition from one activity to the next.For instance, announce, “Okay, five more minutes on the playground, and then we’ll go back inside for story time.”
Make sure to balance hands-on activities with quiet activities in your schedule.

, Encourage cooperation and good behavior by creating goals and rewards for the whole group. Measure progress in a way that’s easy for the kids to follow, like putting stickers on a chart or filling a jar with marbles.For instance, you could let each child put a marble in the jar when they finish reading a book by themselves. When the jar is full, take the whole group on an outing to the library.

, Notice when a child in your group does something thoughtful or kind. Give them a high-five or a few words of praise, and tell them why you’re proud of them. Positive reinforcement will make kids want to continue behaving well.For example, say, “Jesse, it was nice of you to share your candy with the other kids. I’m proud of you for being so generous.”

Promote accountability.,
Avoid punishment.,
Set boundaries.,
Give your child agency.",How to Discipline a Teenager2," Sometimes communication breaks down and you will find it necessary to discipline your teen. There are several methods to discipline your child, and you should think carefully about what will work best for your family. One effective form of discipline is to hold your child accountable for all of their actions.If you have clearly laid out your expectations, your teen knows which behaviors you expect from them. If he or she is explicitly disrespectful, let them know that now they must be held responsible.
You can try saying, ""I explained to you that it is not OK to swear at your younger brother. You know that behavior like that results in the loss of a privilege.""
By focusing on your child's actions and knowledge, you are making it clear that she is accountable for her actions.

, There is a difference between punishing your teen and disciplining her. The term ""punishment"" is inherently negative, whereas discipline can be constructive. For example, discipline is a way of helping someone stick to the rules, whereas ""punishment"" is more of an act of retribution. Explain that by disciplining your teen, you are teaching her that there are benefits to adhering to guidelines and consequences to ignoring rules. You can add that this is the way the world works, so you are providing good training.You will at times have to place restrictions on your teen, but you can do so without giving the negative connotations that typically go along with punishments.
For example, avoid ultimatums. Many teens see ultimatums as a direct challenge and a path to punishment, so avoid saying things like, ""Get better grades or else!""
Don't make threats about vague punishments. Instead, tell your teen that you are going to impose the restrictions that you both agreed upon.
Be flexible. Maybe you have told your son or daughter that they cannot see their friends for two weeks because of their low grades. If they come home with several ""A"" papers or quizzes, you might consider showing that you appreciate their actions by lifting the restrictions a few days early. Show that discipline is reasonable.
Be stern but respectful. Your teen is a young adult, so don't speak to them like a young child. Avoid mocking or being sarcastic.

, Let your teen know the actions that are and are not acceptable in your home. It is important to clearly define boundaries so that they know exactly what they are and aren't allowed to do. If you feel strongly that they need to avoid all alcohol, make that clear.You can set boundaries regarding your teen's social life. Explain that they are only allowed to stay out until a certain hour. If you need them check in with you throughout the evening, for example, make that clear.
Let them know that you will be monitoring their online activities. Teens should enjoy some degree of privacy, but it's ok to let your son or daughter know that you will be checking in on them periodically to make sure that they are safe.
If you allow your teen to date, make sure that you set boundaries for the relationship. For example, explain that your son or daughter and their boyfriend or girlfriend can't be in their bedroom with the door closed. Do not just straight up disagree with your teen's choice of a boyfriend or girlfriend because 'they look like a criminal' or are a bit quirky, for example. First impressions aren't everything, but if your teen's boyfriend or girlfriend is a bit over controlling or making inappropriate talk or gestures, then it might be a good idea to talk to your teen about your concerns.
Explain to your teen that boundaries are for their safety, and to help teach them responsibility.

, Sometimes it can seem like your teen is struggling against you. Remember that teens are at a point where they are trying to establish more independence and autonomy. Allow your teenager to be an active participant in setting boundaries and choosing appropriate discipline. Giving them agency will make them more invested in the process.Have your teen help you make a list of appropriate guidelines to live by. You could set things like curfew, car privileges, or expected grades.
Don't be afraid to negotiate. Respect their opinions on the issues, and they will be more likely to listen to yours.
Have your teen suggest a consequence. If they come home late one Saturday night, have them tell you what they feel is an appropriate disciplinary action.
Typically, when you give a teen more responsibility they begin to behave in a more mature way.

"
"
Consider the situation.,
Use empathy.,
Ask for advice.",How to Discipline a Teenager3," At times your teen may be difficult to handle, but it's important to remember that they are dealing with a lot. Their hormones and body are changing, which can cause mood swings. They are also trying to more fully develop their identity, and may be dealing with pressures from school or their friends. When disciplining your teen, it's key to consider the context.Have they been rude and moody lately? Try to figure out if something outside the house is bothering them. Have you noticed their best friend doesn't stop by as often? Consider that your teen might be going through a stressful time and try to cut them a little slack.
Are their grades slipping? Take a few days to watch their habits. Teens need a lot of sleep, so maybe you need to help them get more rest so they can better concentrate.
Before deciding on discipline, consider all of the components of the situation.

, Being empathetic means that you are thinking about, or sensitive to, what someone else is feeling or thinking. When disciplining your teen, try to place yourself in their shoes. When choosing the right course of action, take their emotions into consideration.If your son or daughter reacts badly to not being allowed to go on a road trip with friends, try to think about what they are feeling. They are likely worried about being teased, or are maybe suffering from fear of missing out. You don't need to back down on the rules you've set, but you can offer compassion.
Try saying, ""I imagine you're feeling pretty frustrated that you won't be going with your friends. Is there something else fun that you and I could do this weekend instead?""

, Dealing with a teen can be difficult. You might feel stressed, tired, and overwhelmed. Don't be afraid to ask for help. Maybe you have a trusted family member who can offer some advice on how to relate to your teen.Try talking to other parents. It's useful to know what your son or daughter's friends are allowed to do. You can try asking their parents about curfew, allowance, etc. to get an idea of the types of policies you want to set.
Your teen's doctor can be a great resource, too. He or her can help you make sure that your son or daughter stays physically and emotionally healthy. They can also offer outside resources.

Avoid using the word “don’t.” If it seems like the kids in your group aren’t listening to you, make sure you’re phrasing your instructions clearly enough.,
Separate misbehaving kids from the group.,
Talk with the child about their behavior.,
Address the behavior instead of the child’s character.,
Use consequences.,
Make your consequences fair to the whole group.,
Avoid criticizing or blaming the children.",How to Discipline a Group of Children2," Tell them what you want them to do, not what you don’t want them to do. Otherwise, they may get confused.For instance, say, “Savannah, can you use your indoor voice, please?” instead of “Savannah, don’t talk so loudly.”

, If a certain child is being disruptive to the group, ask them to come and sit or stand with you. Remain in a place where you can keep supervising the others.If two or more children start fighting, have all of them come over with you. Separate them so they can’t keep fighting.
If the disruptive child is upset or angry, give them some time to cool down. Ask them to sit quietly, or read them a book until they’re calmer.

, In terms the child can understand, explain why their behavior wasn’t acceptable. Help them understand how their actions affect other people.For instance, you could say something like, “Do you remember how you felt last week when Jill took your markers without asking? That’s how Michael felt when you took his toys today.”
Take the child’s age into account as you talk to them. Younger children may need multiple reminders before they understand why certain behaviors are wrong.
Talk to the child privately if you can, and discipline them separately away from the group. Don’t lecture them about misbehaving in front of the rest of the group.

, Effective discipline involves teaching, not punishment. Avoid implying that the child is a bad person for misbehaving. Instead, tell them that you know they can do better, and help them think of more appropriate ways to act.For instance, don’t say, “Why are you being such a bad boy?” or “Why can’t you behave?” Instead, say, “It’s not okay to hit other people, because that hurts them. Let’s think of some better ways to tell people you’re mad at them.”

, Teach the kids in your group that actions have consequences. For disruptive behaviors like fighting, create some negative consequences, like missing recess. For positive behaviors like sharing, offer a few words of praise or a small treat like a sticker., Don't let a few bad apples spoil the whole bunch. It's unfair to punish the entire group of kids if a few are acting up. In such cases, it may work to give the misbehaving kids an extra assignment to dissuade talking or playing. Other kids might work silently or go outside for recess.


When misbehaving kids see others getting free time or special treats, they are more likely to clean up their acts. If the other kids don't get any special treatment, there's no motivation to behave well.
Constantly calling out a single child or solely blaming them for misbehavior can make the child feel isolated from the rest of the children. They may start thinking that they do not fit in, and it may create resentment.

, It is always more effective to use positive reinforcement than to use negative punishment. Try not to blame the children or criticize them heavily, as they may begin to resent you or feel bad about themselves. Instead, reduce their privileges by using timeouts and restricting their playtime. This will teach them that their actions have consequences.

"

Be consistent.,
Model positive and kind interactions.,
Stay calm and collected.",How to Discipline a Group of Children3," Know what your rules are, and stick to them. Don’t change your standards arbitrarily. If you aren’t consistent with your discipline, you’ll send the message that good behavior isn’t important all the time.Sometimes you might need to change your rules or make an exception. When this happens, give your group a clear explanation of what’s happening and why. Otherwise, the kids may be confused.

, Children learn more from your behavior than they do from your words. Show your group how you want them to act by using good manners, treating others with kindness, and being patient. In addition, be cordial and positive when interacting with other teachers and administrators to model appropriate behavior.For instance, always say please and thank you, whether you’re interacting with children or adults.

, When a child acts up, don’t lose your temper with them, even if you’re frustrated. Speak in a low voice, and use calm movements. By keeping your cool, you’re modeling good conflict resolution skills while letting the child know you’re in control of the situation.Losing your temper might get kids to behave temporarily, but it also sends the message that you aren’t really in charge.
If you need to, pause and take a deep breath to compose yourself before dealing with a misbehaving child.

Don’t protect your child from natural consequences.Natural consequences are those which are produced as a direct result of an individual’s actions.,
Help your child learn self-discipline.,
Encourage your child to reflect on his or her mistakes.Good discipline involves not just punishing or demonstrating how your child’s actions have brought about certain consequences, but showing your tween the possibility of other courses he or she could have taken and might take in the future.,
Include teens in the rule-making process.,
Let your teen know what your zero-tolerance policies are.,
Set a schedule for your teen.,
Remind your teenager of natural consequences.Your child should, by the teenage years, understand natural consequences.,
Take away privileges.,
Discuss issues with your teen.",How to Discipline a Child According to Age," If you see your child helping his/her sibling or cleaning up his or her toys, then encourage the behavior with praise.


For example, you might see your child picking up his/her blocks and putting them away. In this case, you could say, “Wow, you’re doing a great job putting your toys away. Thank you!”;
,


For instance, if you see your daughter throwing food at the cat, you’ll need to stop him/her immediately. Putting him/her in a safe time-out place like a high chair or crib will stop the behavior and also give you time to clean up or make corrections to the situation as needed.
Do not send your child to his or her room. Doing so will create a negative association for the child by linking his/her bedroom with punishment.

, But when you do set rules, make sure that you apply them evenly. If you’re in a two-parent household, consult with your partner to ensure you both apply the same rules in the same way.


For instance, do not allow a child into the office or near the stairs when you’re home if your partner does not.

, For instance, if you don’t want your child near the stairs, don’t say, “If you play near the stairs there is a chance you might tumble down them and hurt yourself.” Instead, simply say, “Let’s not play near the stairs.” The reasoning behind your rule is, at this point, uninteresting to the child. When your child starts asking “why”, you’ll know your child is ready for longer answers.


Squat down to your child’s level when explaining a rule or situation to your child.
Stay calm.Do not yell or scream at your child. Keep in mind that your child does not have the cognitive capabilities to distinguish right from wrong, or understand many rules. Yelling at your child will not help him or her understand the situation, it will only scare your child.
When you feel frustrated, try to take a few deep breaths, inhaling for three to five seconds, then exhaling for an equal amount of time.

, Beginning at age three, children can begin to understand and comply with your rules.For example, you can set a rule that if your child wants to paint, then he/she has to wear an old shirt or an apron over his/her clothes to protect them from paint. Make sure that you explain the rule to your child and remind him/her about it the first few times he/she wants to paint.


For example, after you have explained to your child that he/she must wear an old shirt or apron before he/she starts to paint, you might just remind him/her by saying, “What special thing do you have to put on before you can start painting?” After a few times, changing into an old shirt or apron should become automatic for your child.

, If you apply the rules in one situation but not in another, your child will be confused.In order to make the rules you set work, be consistent with your rules in different situations.


For instance, if you tell your child not to watch TV until after he/she eats dinner, but he/she turns the TV on anyway, you might discipline him/her by making him/her take a time-out. If he/she watches TV before dinner the next day, make him/her take another time-out. Administering the same punishment for the same offense every time ensures your child will get the message that you are displeased with his or her behavior.

,


For example, if you set a rule that your child must clean up his/her toys right after he/she finishes playing and he/she wants to know why this is the rule, then you might say something like, “Because it is important to take care of your belongings. By leaving your toys out, there is a chance that someone could accidentally step on one of them and break one of your toys. But if you put your toys away, then you can keep them safe from those kinds of accidents.”
Explain your rules in simple language. After you give a child a rule, make them repeat it back to you in your own words. Prompt them to tell you what you asked for by asking, “Do you understand?” If they intimate that they do, ask “What do I want you to do?” If they can, in their own words, successfully explain your expectations, then you’ve crafted a good rule and explained it to your child adequately.
If your child cannot explain a rule back to you accurately, perhaps your rule is too complex. Try a simpler rule and let them grow up a bit before instituting rules which they cannot reproduce in their own words.

, Do not give in to whining or complaints.If you let your child do whatever he/she wants, he/she will learn that whining will allow him/her to get his/her way, and he/she will use it to his/her advantage in the future.


For instance, if your child says repeatedly, “I want to play outside,” but it is time for dinner, you need to insist that he/she can play outside only when you allow it.

, Sometimes, parents perceive their child’s innocent offense as deliberately intended to irritate or cause mischief. In fact, many children only learn how to explore the world around them through misbehavior.For example, if your child starts drawing all over the walls, he or she might not know that such a behavior is inappropriate. You might rightly be upset that your child has engaged in such a behavior, but try to empathize with your child and look at the situation from his/her point of view. If you have never set a clear rule that it is not okay to draw on the walls, then your child may not have known that drawing on the walls was inappropriate.
When your child does act inappropriately, make it clear that you do not want your child to repeat that behavior. Offer a substitute activity, such as drawing on a piece of paper or in a coloring book instead of drawing on the walls. You could also get your child to help you clean the mess up. You do not, however, need to yell at or punish your child for doing something that he/she did not know was wrong.

, Let your child know that you care for him/her by saying something like, “I know you want to walk downstairs, but it is not safe for you to go there yet.” Give your toddler a hug and kiss to show that the limits you set are there for his/her own safety and welfare.


Understanding that most of the trouble your young child gets into is the result of his or her being naturally curious, not bad or willfully misbehaving. Understanding your child’s mental development will help you see the world from your child’s eyes a bit more, and inspire you to treat your child with greater empathy.
Don’t be afraid to say “no.” You’re the parent and must govern your child’s behavior.

, By creating a distraction for your child, you can redirect his or her energy in a positive way. Think about the situation that you and your child are in and look for creative alternatives that your child could engage in.


For instance, if your child starts throwing a tantrum in the supermarket because you won’t buy his/her favorite cereal, then you might ask for his/her help in finding other items on the shopping list. Or, if your young child is playing near a fragile vase, you should offer him/her a toy or pad of paper and some crayons to get him/her to move away from the vase and sit quietly for a bit.
This tactic is primarily intended for children aged six to 24 months old but works well for children of up to five years old., For instance, if your child is five, he or she should take a time-out for five minutes in the event of misbehavior. Time-out is an appropriate form of discipline for children up through elementary school age.


Choose a time-out location free of distractions like TV, books, toys, friends, or games. The purpose of the time-out is to provide space for the child to reflect on his or her actions in a quiet moment. A kitchen chair or a bottom stair is an appropriate spot for sitting a toddler up to two years of age for a time-out.Time-out is a good form of discipline when a child has broken a rule or done something dangerous. For instance, if you’ve told your child not to play in the street and he or she does so anyway, send your child to time-out.
Don’t speak to your child when he/she is in time-out.If you have a moralistic message you want to impart to your child, wait until he/she has completed the time-out. Even if your child starts crying or wailing, don’t acknowledge your child until the time-out is through.

, Explain to your child before doing do so that if he/she wishes to remain in possession of toys, he'll/she’ll need to take better care of them.


For young children, especially, ensure that you take away privileges as soon as you notice the undesirable behavior. This creates an association in the child’s mind between the behavior and the loss of the privilege.
Do not take away privileges for a long time. Children at a young age often lack the long-term concept of time that older children and adults do. Taking a young child’s toys away for a week might seem fair, but the impact will be lost after several days.

, For toddlers and very young children, reward them with verbal praise or a small, colorful sticker.Shaping positive behavior at this young age is more effective than punishment.


For instance, praise a child who shared a snack with a friend, even when he or she was not asked to do so.
Reward your child with a piece of candy or the chance to watch their favorite show longer than he or she normally might. Choose a reward which corresponds proportionally to the positive behavior the child demonstrated.

, This means that when your child takes a certain action, she can expect a certain result.Natural consequences help children understand that they must take responsibility for their actions and exercise judgment.


For example, if your child does not put his/her bike away after he/she is done riding it, then it is possible that the bike will start to rust or possibly even get stolen. If he/she leaves his/her bike outside despite the risks, then this might be an opportunity to teach your child about natural consequences.
If/then statements are good when explaining natural consequences to children. For example, you could say, “If you leave your bike out in the driveway, then it might get stolen or start to rust.”
Do not use natural consequences in situations that might compromise your child’s safety or well-being. For example, when the weather is cold, do not send your child outside without a coat if he/she does not want to wear one. Or, if you catch your child playing with matches, do not allow your child to continue playing with them. Your child might burn him/herself or set fire to your home.

, Do not overreact to things that your child does or expect your child to know how to do something that he/she has not learned about yet.


For example, if your three year old knocks over a glass of juice, don’t expect him or her to clean it up all alone. Instead, help your child and say “We need to clean this up now. Let’s learn how to clean up a mess up together.” Give your child a rag or napkin and insist that your child help you clean up. Show your child how to clean the mess and give your child tips as he/she does so.

, From the age of six months and up, give your child a regular routine. For instance, a six-month old might begin each day with a wake-up time at 8:00, breakfast at 9:00, play time until lunch at 12:00, a nap at 1:00, and a 7:00 bedtime. As children age, push bedtime back and provide more freedom in deciding how to use their time. Getting an early understanding of how to structure and manage one’s time will give children an advantage when they enter grade school.


If you do not set a schedule, on the other hand, you will open yourself up to constant negotiation with your child about when an appropriate bedtime, wake-up time, lunch time, and so on.
If you have multiple children of vastly different ages, you should give each a separate bedtime. This will not only accommodate each child’s different physiology and natural sleep cycles, but it will also give you private time with each of them when you tuck them in at the end of the night. If your children are very close in age (within four years of each other), though, you might think of letting them have the same bedtime schedules to prevent sibling rivalry.

, As your child grows, it becomes harder to discipline him or her as you did when your child was younger. Punishment or the threat of punishment will only go so far; a better solution to ensuring your child’s good behavior is to stay connected and encourage your child to act properly through positive reinforcement.Ask your child what he or she is doing in school, and if he or she has a favorite class. Take an interest in your child’s life.
Invite your child to go out with you on errands or family activities like a walk in the park, or even just a walk around the neighborhood.
While it can be hard to connect with children at this age, who might have soccer practice or after-school clubs to attend, make time to chat with your child for at least a few quiet minutes each day. Sitting with your child while he or she is free of distractions right before he or she goes to sleep is a good option.Model the behavior that you expect. If you say you’ll do something, do it. Don’t use profane language if you tell your child not to. Children copy what they see their parents do; if you act well, you will provide a positive model for your child to emulate.

, While your child still needs you, he or she might feel stifled by rules that were necessary when your child was younger. Compare your rules with those of other parents in order to gauge what a reasonable bedtime is, or how much TV your child should watch.


If your child has his or her own phone or computer at this age, set limits but allow your child some freedom. For instance, you might forbid using the phone at the dinner table or after a certain time in the evening.
Continue to monitor your children at this age. If your child likes playing outside with his or her friends, you can let your child do so but insist that you or another adult be present to supervise.
Work with your child and listen to what he or she is feeling and thinking. If your child is frustrated by a given rule, acknowledge your child’s point of view and (if reasonable) consider changing the rule to provide greater leniency.

, On the other hand, if you ground your child for a week just because he or she arrived late to the dinner table, the punishment exceeds the apparent severity of the infraction. Discipline your child in a fair, balanced way. Talk with your spouse or with other parents in order to find the best punishments for your children.

, When you decide to discipline, do it in a way that is private and respectful. For instance, if your child says something rude about another person in public, pull your child aside and let him or her know that he/she should not say those things where the person might hear him or her.


Children at this age can begin to feel intense social pressures, and may begin to experience hormonal changes. These influences can create an emotional cocktail within your child that results in tantrums or tearful frustration. Do not respond to these episodes with an equal volume of emotion. Instead, ask your child to leave the room to calm down. If you’re in your child’s room, ask if your child wants you to leave. Talk to your child about the outburst later when your child has calmed down. Ask, “Do you think your tone and actions earlier were acceptable?” Insist that your child apologize when yelling or succumbing to emotional outbursts.
If your child insults you or says “I hate you,” don’t take it personally. Understand that your child is trying to goad you into reacting angrily. Stay calm and later, when your child has calmed down, tell your child that what he or she said really hurt your feelings. Ask your child if he/she thinks he/she should apologize, but even if he does not, tell your child that you forgive him/her anyways. Express that you expect him to always be respectful and kind to others -- including you -- even when he angry.

, Consider rewarding your tween child with TV time or the opportunity to have a friend spend the night.


For middle or high-school aged children, you might allow him/her to stay out a bit later than he/she is normally allowed to when he/she finishes his/her homework.
Good behavior varies depending on the parent-child relationship. If your idea of good behavior is to have your child in bed each night by 9:00, let your child know this in advance. When your child is in bed at 9:00 each night for a week, administer a reward of your choosing, such as a trip to the ice cream parlor or arcade.

, For instance, a natural consequence for a child 8-12 might be that he/she left his/her book at a friend’s house, and cannot read it.


Another natural consequence for a tween or teen might be that he/she got mad and threw his/her phone. Instead of punishing the tween, inform him/her that with the phone is broken, and he/she now has no way of contacting his/her friends.
Always emphasize to your child how he or she experienced natural consequences when your child’s actions allow for it.

, Maintain healthy, open communication with your child as he/she grows. Instead of punishing your child as you would have when he/she was younger, show him/her when his/her behavior needs to change in order to make his/her life better.For example, perhaps your child struggles to catch the bus on time and is thus always late to school. Instead of instituting a punishment (“If you do not get up on time to catch the bus, I will take your games away”), approach your child about the issue with concern.
Tell your child, “I’ve noticed you’re having trouble getting to the bus on time. This will affect your grades if it continues. What do you think you can do to get out the door on time?”
Your child might suggest setting her alarm for an earlier time or putting out his/her clothes and backpack out the night before. You can help your child come up with ways to get set up, but you should allow him/her to do these things himself/herself to work on his/her self-discipline.

, For instance, if your child got a low grade in school, ask him why he/she thinks that happened. Perhaps he/she will reply that he/she consistently put the assignment off until it was too late for him/her to finish it in a timely manner.


Invite your child to think about things he/she could do which would have produced a more positive result for him/her. For example, you might ask probing questions like, “Why do you think you put it off for so long?”, “What could you have done to motivate yourself better?”, “Are you happy with the grade you got? Why or why not?” Asking your tween to think about the outcome of the situation is important to help him/her realize that he/she is responsible for his/her own life.
Always ask if there is anything he wants you to do for him in the future to ensure that he/she does not make similar mistakes. Showing your child that you are there for him/her will ensure that he/she feels cared for and loved no matter what mischief he has engaged in.

, Ensure your teen feels like he/she is participating in the rule-building process. Don’t let him/her have the final say or craft his/her own rules entirely, but let him/her know that you’re aware that he/she is growing up and deserves more autonomy.For example, you might let your child stay out later on weekends. When allowing him/her to do so, do not vaguely say “Don’t stay out too late.” Instead, let him/her know exactly when you expect her to be home. “Be home at 10:00” is a good directive when setting a curfew.
When he/she gets his/her driver’s license, you might let him/her drive on his/her own over short distances, then allow longer trips as she gains more experience on the road.
Staying connected to your teen can be hard. Teens typically do not want to bond with their parents, but by acknowledging their perspectives and desires, you can help you maintain a strong relationship with them. Bringing your teen into the disciplinary process shows that you respect his/her burgeoning independence, and he/she will appreciate this (even if he/she does not admit it).

, While a great deal of teen discipline relies on negotiating with your teen in order to reach a win-win situation, there are some things you need to hold the line on. For instance, you might insist that your child never drinks, does drugs, or brings friends over to the house when you or another adult is not home. Let your child know these are unacceptable and nonnegotiable.


If your child violates one of your hard rules, your response can vary. You should first ask your child is he/she knows that you’re uncomfortable with the fact that he/she broke the rule in question. Talk to him/her in a clear, calm way about why you have insisted upon the given rule.
For instance, if you tell your child not to drink, you might explain before and after he or she does so that drinking could lead to being taken advantage of, humiliated, or driving drunk and getting seriously hurt or hurting someone else.
If your teen refuses to abide by your rules, start with a form of discipline such as taking away a privilege like the car keys, phone, or tablet. If the behavior continues, consider turning your child over to another trusted relative, or insisting that if your child does not want to live by your rules, then he/she can find his/her own place to live and support himself/herself., Teens are often very busy with school, a part-time job, and/or commitments to a team or club. Help your teen organize his or her time better with a set schedule, but do not let your teen completely set the terms of his or her schedule. For instance, do not allow your teen to go to soccer practice if he/she has not completed his/her homework or is not performing well in school. Let your teen know that while you support his/her extra-curricular activities, he/she must maintain good grades and commit to the curfew you set. Do not accept your teen being out all night.


Teens will do better with later wake-up times and earlier bedtimes. Ensure that your teen gets 8 to 10 hours of sleep each night.Unfortunately, the school year dictates your teen’s wake-up time for most of the year. Allow your teen to sleep in on weekends if possible. Invite your teen’s feedback on his/her schedule and ask about his/her peers’ schedules to see if the one you’ve crafted is too strict.
If your child has trouble sticking to his or her schedule, type it up and post it in a visible place like on the fridge so your teen can consult it as needed. Let your child know that failure to adhere to the schedule will result in a particular disciplinary behavior. Always follow through on your disciplinary action after explaining the consequences to your children.

, At this stage, allow your teenager to make rational and reasonable dress decisions. If your teen refuses to wear a coat, and is then cold whenever he/she goes outside, draw attention to his/her feelings of discomfort and coldness as a natural consequence of his/her actions.

, If your teen acts up, you might need to take something he or she values away for a period of time. Removing the right to watch TV -- including shows on the phone or tablet -- is a good starting point. You might also disallow your child to go out with their friends.


Removal of privileges works best when the privilege being revoked is in some way related to the offense. For instance, if you tell your teenager to stop watching TV and do his/her homework, and he/she refuses after being asked to do so multiple times, you would be wise to suspend TV viewing for at least 24 hours.

, If your teen breaks a rule or does not do something that he or she is supposed to do, then it is important to have a discussion with your teen. Discussing issues will help you to understand your teen better and it will also help to reinforce the rules that you have set. Avoid jumping straight to punishment. Instead, ensure that your expectations are clear and look for ways to support your teen.For example, if your teen has been finding ways to get out of doing the dishes, then sit down and talk about it. You might explain that everyone has responsibilities and it is important to meet them even if we don’t always feel like it. You might provide an example for your teen, such as “What if I stopped going to work and we didn’t have any money to pay for food or clothes?”
You might also explain to your teen why it is important for him to do the dishes. You could say something like, “We all help out to make dinner time a family effort. Your father cooks dinner, your sister sets the table, and I tidy up the kitchen after he is done. Washing the dishes is your part in that effort and we need you to keep doing it.
You might consider asking your teen if there is anything you can do to make doing the dishes easier on him/her. For example, he/she might be grossed out by touching the dirty dishes, so you could get a pair of gloves for him/her to wear. Or, he/she might feel like it is unfair that he/she always has to do the dishes, so you could rotate the chores. Instead of always doing the dishes, your teen could rotate between setting the table, tidying up the kitchen after dinner, or perhaps even making dinner for the family.

Spend quality time together.,
Use social networking.,
Express your love.,
Ask questions and be interested.,
Permit space.,
Reduce family conflict.",How to Deal With Difficult Teenagers1," Connection between the teenager and parent or guardian is a strong protective factor against harm such as emotional distress, risky sexual behaviors, and substance use.Schedule regular family activities like eating dinner together or having game nights.
Spend face-to-face time on a weekly basis. Take your teen out to lunch or dinner without the rest of the family. This way you can focus solely on your connection instead of being distracted by others.
Try spending quality time with the adolescent doing activities that he enjoys. Ask him what he likes to do, or offer suggestions such as: playing video games, shopping, skateboarding, biking, camping, playing board games, or hiking.;
, Using social media as a way to foster parent-child interaction has been shown to increase connection and pro-social behaviors, while reducing acts of aggression.If you don’t have a Facebook account (or Instagram, etc.),sign up and add the teenager as a friend. You can monitor his actions on the various sites, as well as leave messages, and post photos.
Try to avoid embarrassing your adolescent. Teenagers can be sensitive to how others see them, especially their peers.

, A teenager who feels wanted and loved by his parents is more protected against developing negative influences and behaviors.Focus on ways you can show the teenager that he is worthy, accepted, loved, and cared about.


Physical contact such as hugs can go a long way in expressing affecting for your teen. However, if these acts of affection are uncomfortable, you can try other techniques such as touching his shoulders, or playing sports with him.
Say, “I love you,” and praise your teenager for what he is doing well. Identify and comment on his positive characteristics. Say things like, “I like how honest you are about your feelings.”
Give your child your attention. Be supportive by telling your teen that you will always be there for him. You could say something like, ""I want you to know that you can talk to me about anything and I will listen and try to help."" Provide support and guidance when he appears to need it.
Give gifts or surprise your teen with his favorite meal.

, Studies propose that parents who are informed and knowledgeable about their child’s life are more likely to have well adjusted teenagers.Ask open-ended questions like, ""What is going well in school lately?"" or, ""What are your goals right now?""
Avoid closed-ended questions that require one word answers such as, ""Was school okay today?"" or, ""Is everything alright?"" Your teenager may take this opportunity to simply say, ""yeah,"" and not elaborate. This closes off the conversation and enhances distance.
Listen rather than lecture. Focus on trying to understand your child's perspective instead of correcting him or offering advice.
Attempts to monitor your teen by spying or using surveillance techniques (tracking phone logs, etc.) may do more harm than good.Avoid these types of behaviors.

, Ironically, giving the teenager space can actually increase closeness and positivity within the relationship. Research shows that adolescents need a sense of autonomy or a sense that they have choices.Try not to pry if your teenager does not want to discuss something. Give him time to process the situation and let him come to you once he is ready.

, Marital conflict that is experienced or witnessed by an adolescent can lead to behavior problems, symptoms of depression, and decreased family connection.Do not fight or argue in front of your children.
When discussing family issues, be calm and avoid raising your voice out of anger.

"
"
Recognise the symptoms of fainting.,
If you begin to experience any of these, tell your teacher or another adult near by.,
Your teacher should send you to the medical room, office or nurse, (depends on the school).,
When you arrive at the nurse, don't feel embarrassed to answer her questions.,
In the event of you actually fainting in class, don't get upset.,
You will probably get sent home.,
In the event you hurt yourself or your faint warrants a hospital visit in an ambulance, don't worry.",How to Deal with Fainting at School1," These include Dizziness, blurry vision, fuzzy hearing or ringing in ears, feeling hot, feeling sick, upset stomach, sweating, tiredness, tingling hands, hyperventilation, tunnel vision, unsteadiness and fear.;
, Alternatively, let a friend know and let them get you help.

, Make sure, if your teacher doesn't send someone with you, that you ask. This applies, especially, if you have to climb or go down stairs on your way. If you fainted on the stairs, you could seriously hurt yourself

, The first thing she'll probably do is  lie you flat. It may feel strange, but she's seen this before. Answer any questions she has honestly and don't lie. Example: If she asks you if you had breakfast and you didn't, don't say you did so she doesn't lecture you.

, If other kids stare at you, don't feel embarrassed. You can deal with that later. In the mean time, think about them in your position.

, If you do, and your parents ask questions, answer them honestly.

, Other kids will most likely be concerned for your health than anything else. Again, think of them in your position.

Encourage involvement in extra-curricular activities.,
Set high but attainable expectations.,
Foster positive student-teacher relationships.,
Assist in the development of healthy peer relationships.",How to Deal With Difficult Teenagers2," A higher degree of school connection serves as a protective factor against harmful occurrences (destructive and negative behaviors including self-harm, distress, and substance use).Lower risk-factors are also associated with adolescent engagement in extra-curricular activities.


Try encouraging your adolescent to engage in activities such as groups or clubs on campus, student government, or yearbook.
Encourage participation in sports. Pro-social behaviors such as playing sports have been correlated with increases in self-esteem, as well as higher likelihood of college attendance.Although, participation in sports can also lead to higher rates of alcohol use.If your child is involved in sports make sure you discuss the dangers of alcohol. You may need to monitor his social activities if you suspect he engages in alcohol abuse.
Make sure leisure activities are well-structured; these types of activities are linked to less antisocial behaviors.For example, an after school recreational club where teenagers can do may different activities would be considered unstructured, while a specific sports team would be deemed well-structured.
Be careful not to force your teenager to engage in a sport or activity that he does not want to be involved in.

, Expecting more out of a teenager’s school performance is correlated with reduced health and behavioral risks.Let the youth know what you expect of his academic performance including what grades you require of him. Be careful not to aim too high (straight A’s), or too low (just passing). You could say, ""I think you should be able to get at least a C in each class. Do you think that is fair? Can we come to an agreement on this?""
Explain that you expect the youth to be respectful to adults and authority figures.

, A student’s belief that the teacher treats him fairly can be a protective factor against harm.Have regular meetings with the adolescent’s teachers in order to discuss any issues, and increase positive communication. Involve the student in the discussion if needed.
Address any issues with problematic student-teacher relationships as they arise. Meet with teachers and come up with a plan to improve the academic relationship.
If the student has a counselor or adviser at school, discuss the child’s goals and needs as well as ways to foster positive student-teacher relationships.

, Research indicates that one factor which helps protect teens from engaging in negative behaviors is degree of closeness with peers at school.Positive school relationships are also linked to higher overall academic achievement.Discuss the concept of healthy relationships with your teen. Explain that positive friendships involve fairness, trust, acceptance, and loyalty.
Monitor your youth’s interpersonal friendships. Know who his friends are and get to know their parents personally.
Be aware of any problematic peer relationships your teen might have. Ask your adolescent if he is being bullied or treated poorly by peers. Address these issues directly with school administration to come up with a plan to reduce bullying.

"
"
Remove harmful items from the home.,
Ensure appropriate supervision.,
Discuss risky situations.,
Consider treatment.",How to Deal With Difficult Teenagers3," The existence of harmful items in the home have been linked to destructive behaviors in teens.For example, alcohol and drugs in the home are correlated with increased substance use by adolescents.


Remove guns or other weapons from the home.
Get rid of alcohol and other substances (even unused prescription pills).
If your teen has a history of self-harm, remove or lock up sharp objects, including knives and weapons.
Set a positive example by reducing your own negative or unhealthy behaviors. For instance, teenagers can think it is hypocritical if you tell them not to smoke cigarettes while puffing away on one.

, Supervised and structured activities have been linked to a reduction in antisocial behaviors (criminal activity and other behavioral problems). When the teenager is involved in activities outside of the home, make sure there is adequate supervision and structure.Make sure the teen has adult supervision after school and on the weekends.
Ensure that outings are well supervised.
Get to know the parents of the youth’s friends in order to establish appropriate supervision and monitor the youth’s behaviors.

, Being open an honest with the adolescent about the risks of engaging in behaviors such as substance use, criminal activities, and unprotected sex. If you avoid these topics out of fear or discomfort, the child will most assuredly learn from his peers, which can involve misleading and incorrect information.


Have the sex talk. Sexual relationships in teenage years tend to predict and form the basis for future relationships.Discuss the risks of sex early on. In order to start the conversation you could say something like, ""I think it's time that we have a discussion about sex. I know this can be an uncomfortable topic to to talk about with your parent, but it is really important that we have it. What do you think?"" You can start by discussing what the teenager has heard about sex from his friends or on television. Explain your views of sex and what your expectations are for your child (when they should have it, why, and what resources they need such as condoms/birth control).
Give your teenager information on the riskiness of alcohol and drug use. Say something along the lines of, ""I want to talk to you about some things that teens might do that can be harmful. Are you okay with that?"" Explain your view of alcohol and drug use, and what you expect out of your teen (what to limit or not use and why). Explaining why not to use certain substances (risks to health, possible overdose, poor judgments, etc.) is very important; teens want explanations for rules or they might disregard them as stupid or strict.

, If the teenager engages in risky behaviors, is defiant against authority figures, becomes violent, or socially withdrawn, it might be due to a larger mental health issue. Psychological treatment can help individuals set goals and develop healthier ways of coping with being an adolescent.


Discuss treatment with the teenager's general practitioner (medical doctor) or call your insurance provider for a list of covered therapists.

"
"
Use authoritative parenting.,
Use assertive communication.,
Set boundaries.,
Use positive reinforcement.",How to Deal With Difficult Teenagers4," An authoritative style is high in acceptance and freedom, while still having clearly defined rules and expectations. This type of parenting is correlated with high academic achievement.An authoritative style involves being warm, caring, and flexible with the child.Focus on setting boundaries and rules, but be willing to negotiate or be flexible if necessary.
Accept the teen for who he is, and let him know that you accept him. Encourage him to work toward his dreams, whatever they may be. Authoritative parents are involved. Teens experience involvement when their parents are available to help them with homework and other challenges, as well as when their parents spend quality time with the family.Avoid authoritarian parenting. Authoritarian parenting is associated with strict and inflexible rules and an, ""I'm right and you're wrong"" mentality. An example of authoritarian style parenting would be if the teen said, ""My father tells me that he is right and I should just obey him and never question his authority."" Instead of being authoritarian, allow your teen to be involved in the boundary-setting process. Explain the reason for the rules that are made, and give the teen a chance to voice his opinion. Negotiate and compromise in order to come to a decision. For example, if you think your teen should have straight A's, while the teen believes this is too high an expectation, be willing to adjust this standard to meet the teens needs. Perhaps you could come to an agreement for him to get at least a B in each class.

, This type of communication is associated with conveying your message in a respectful and appropriate manner.Assertiveness comes from an, ""I'm okay. You're okay"" thought process.


Use an appropriate tone that is calm and comforting.
Say, “no” when necessary.
Explain your reasoning for rules and why they are in place.
Be honest and open about your thoughts and feelings (while also being respectful and tactful). Use I statements such as, ""I feel angry when you stay out past curfew.""
Avoid aggressive communication. Aggressive communication comes from an, ""I'm okay, you're not okay,"" mentality. Do not threaten or yell at your child, this models inappropriate behaviors for the teen and can make him feel fearful.
Limit passive communication. Passivity in communication is not expressing your needs and feelings. Passiveness comes from a, ""You're okay. I'm not okay"" perspective. A passive parent might be afraid of his teenager and instead of communicating with him, he would avoid him.

, Teens need structure in order to feel safe and secure and to reduce the likelihood of engagement in risky behaviors.Set limits that are realistic and fair. Make house rules. Tell your teen what behaviors are acceptable and which ones are not. For example, give your adolescent a curfew, and explain the specific consequences of staying out past the curfew.
Assign chores. Having chores can give the youth a sense of responsibility. Explain that everyone in the home needs to contribute. You can make a chore chart and provide rewards when your children complete their chores without being asked.
Set specific consequences for undesirable behaviors. Be very specific about what your teenager is not allowed to do (i.e. stay out past curfew, cut school, use drugs, etc.), as well as what will happen if the youth breaks the rule (i.e. grounding, taking away car or other privileges). Make sure your teen knows that he has a choice of whether or not to follow the rules.

, Rewarding desired behaviors can result in an increase in those behaviors and a reduction in associated negative behaviors.One study showed that youth who were rewarded for wearing their seat belts increased their overall seat belt use.Reward good behavior. When your child does something positive such as getting a good grade on a test, offer a reward such as a new piece of clothing that he wants.
Draw attention to positive qualities. High self-esteem in teenagers is a factor that helps guard against the development of negative feelings and behaviors.Tell your child that you are proud of him. Give specific examples of his accomplishments such as getting a good grade on a test or paper, being honest, or doing his chores.
Allow the youth to earn freedom. A youth that believes he is in control is associated with lower levels of aggressive behavior."
"
Identify increases in risk-taking.,
Know that impulse control may be limited.,
Empathize with adolescent emotions.",How to Deal With Difficult Teenagers5," Changes in the brain during adolescence can result in an increase in risk-taking and propensity toward experimentation with substance use (alcohol and other drugs).Specifically, adolescents are more drawn toward reinforcing stimuli – such as substances. However, the teen might also be more likely to take healthy risks such as trying new activities (sports, games, hobbies, etc).


The adolescent may engage in more risk-taking behaviors.This can sometimes include dangerous situations such as fast-driving, and breaking other rules or laws. Be aware of these warning signs and risky behaviors.

, The ability to control impulses is not yet fully developed in the adolescent brain.Understand that your teen may not yet be able to self-monitor or have delayed gratification.


Teach your child delayed gratification by helping him identify the pros and cons of engaging in a particular activity or behavior.

, Brain changes in the developing teenager can result in heightened emotional reactivity.This can result in teenagers experiencing more anger, sadness, loneliness, aggressiveness, and other negative emotions or behaviors.


Try to remember what it was like being a teenager, and identify a few feelings you had back then that were hard to cope with.
Instead of automatically reacting emotionally, attempt to empathize with the difficulty of the youth's situation.

"
"
Return to school as soon as possible.,
Change the subject if your faint comes up in conversation.,
Write your feelings down.,
If you feel extremely embarrassed about this, talk to your parents, a teacher, a counselor, or someone else you trust.,
If fainting is a regular event for you, visit a doctor.",How to Deal with Fainting at School2," Although it may be best for you if you have 1 or 2 days off to recover, it can also be difficult to return to the embarrassment. As soon as your physically able, not before, return to school.

, Just say, ""Ok, can we talk about, (insert interesting thing), now? This can really help to distract people from what happened to you.

, It may help if you jot your feelings down on paper, in a diary, etc. Then, try to solve them. If you feel embarrassed, think about these people you have to face in your position. Imagine them flat on the floor with their eyes rolled back in their head, looking very scary. If you feel scared about future fainting, consider when you fainted. If you fainted in a hot classroom, if you feel hot, ask to open a window. Don't be afraid to ask. If you fainted in the halls during the change of periods, consider waiting back a few seconds to miss the main crowd. Unless this will make you late for your class. What ever your negative feeling may be, come up with a solution to it.

, If people are still talking about it after a month or so, this may be a good idea anyway. If your friends embarrass you about it, you might want to reconsider this friendship. If they embarrass you, maybe they aren't good friends.

, Just to check.

, They must be licensed by the State of Hawaii to perform. Hawaii's Department of Health offers a list of licensed marriage performers that can perform a variety of ceremony types.


If you choose from the list of licensed performers provided by the Department of Health, you can obtain a temporary online marriage certificate 3 days after your ceremony. This is useful if you need your marriage certificate early since most official certificates take up to 3 weeks to be received in the mail.
The Marriage Equality act not only allows same-sex couples to marry but also gives religious freedom to performers or religious societies to determine who they will marry. So if you are a same-sex couple, be sure to find a performer that respects your choices and relationship.

, There are six main islands in Hawaii with a variety of resorts and beaches. Some islands are more isolated than others and may require extra travel to reach them. If you're having a big wedding with several guests and employing multiple services, a convenient location with lots entertaining activities may be best. Or if you're having a small wedding, a more private island may suit you better. Search Hawaii's island websites, travel sites, and forums to find the best island for your wedding.Hawaii's International Airport is located in Honolulu on Oahu island. Most flights from outside of Hawaii will arrive in Honolulu. From there, you can catch smaller planes that fly to the other islands of Hawaii. Some airlines may also fly directly into Maui.

, These four islands are most popular for tourists and couples coming for a vacation, wedding, or honeymoon.



Oahu: This will most likely be the first island you arrive in if you're coming to Hawaii by plane. Since Honolulu is home to the international airport, Oahu island offers a more tourist-friendly urban setting with many activities, great nightlife and many dining options. Waikiki Beach is lined with many resorts that look out at the Diamond Head State Monument (Le'ahi).

Maui: Dubbed as the most romantic island in Hawaii, Maui is a popular location for couples looking to get married with its black, red and white sandy beaches. It is also home to Hawaii's most luxurious resort hotels and easily accessible with several flight companies that fly directly from the mainland U.S. to Maui. There are also many flights flying daily from the Honolulu International Airport to Maui.

Kauai: Or ""The Garden Isle"" is Hawaii's lushest island and rainiest. This is a great island if you enjoy outdoor activities such as hiking, ziplining or sunset cruises along the Na Pali Coast. Kauai's North Shore is a popular wedding venue with many great resorts and private villas that can accommodate smaller weddings. Kauai's south coast is sunnier if rain is something you're worried about.

Big Island: It's no mystery how this island got its name. The biggest isle of Hawaii, Big Island is home to many volcanoes both covered in snow or actively sprouting red-hot lava. The island is divided into two sides: one side is lush and green and the other side near Kona is almost lunar-like but home to most resorts in Big Island.

, These exclusive isles are great venues if you're looking for a small and serene wedding ceremony without the big crowds.



Lana'i: Considered a more upscale or posh island to be wed in, its two resorts each offer different landscape experiences. Four Seasons Resort Lana'i is beachfront resort looking over Manele Bay, while Four Seasons Lodge at Koele is a surrounded by tropical forests.

Molokai: Nicknamed the ""Friendly Island"", Molokai is described by locals as the most Hawaiian island because it is untouched by big resorts. It's a great island if you want to explore the cultural and ecological sights of Molokai on horse-drawn wagons or on mules.

, Hawaii's climate is quite consistent with temperatures ranging from 70-80 degrees Fahrenheit all year round. However, Hawaii does have its wet seasons and some islands are drier than others.


Summer in Hawaii lasts from May through October and is warmer and drier than its winter season from November to April.
The southwestern part of Hawaii is drier since winds blow from the northeast. This creates more rain on the mountains and on the northeastern sides of the islands.

, It's quite difficult to plan a wedding when you're not in Hawaii. Consider hiring a Hawaiian wedding planner or booking at a resort hotel that offers wedding packages that can virtually handle every aspect of your wedding, from decorations to catering to entertainment. Most wedding consultants can even help you with the process of obtaining a marriage license or hiring a wedding performer.


Some services offer inclusive wedding packages that help plan out your entire trip so you don't have to worry about booking flights or accommodations or planning meals.
Be prepared to sign a contract and pay a deposit fee when you've chosen your wedding planner or venue. Read the contract carefully! You may also be dealing with a foreign company and the contract laws of your country may not apply to them.
Hire a wedding planner or book resort hotels well in advance. A year or more in advance is usually what vendors ask.

, Some vendors at home may offer destination wedding services, especially if the vendor is a big corporation or specializes in destination weddings.


The fee may include the vendor's travel and accommodation so be prepared for higher expenses to be paid.
Book vendors well in advance. A year or more in advance is usually what vendors ask.

, Since Hawaii is a such a popular spot for destination weddings, it's important you find a venue that fits the image of your perfect wedding day. You should consider the following:


How convenient is your wedding venue? The most convenient way to plan your wedding day is to have everything (rehearsal dinner, ceremony, and reception) held in one resort. Most resorts will have expert staff to help you plan and customize your wedding and already have designated ceremony locations such as the beach, a gazebo or a garden.
How big is your wedding? Most destination weddings will have around 60-75 guests. You will need to find a way to accommodate them all if you're making the travel arrangements. This becomes more complex if your wedding is larger with more than 200 people. A particular venue you might like might not be able to accommodate you if you're having a large wedding. If you're having an intimate wedding, consider renting a villa for you and your guests. You also need to consider the cost of travel for you and your guests. Some venues or resorts will have group rates to make it more affordable.

, Destination weddings can be very difficult to plan, especially when it comes to your guests. And since destination weddings are longer celebrations that can range from 3 to 7 days, there are many things to consider to ensure you and your guests have a smooth vacation.Send a save-the-date announcement as soon as your plans are confirmed. 9 to 12 months before the date is most ideal to give your guests enough time to schedule travel plans and time off work.
Send formal invitations 2 to 3 months before the wedding.
Since destination weddings are mostly for smaller parties, don't expect to be able to invite everyone. You might be questioned by friends or relatives who weren't invited, but all you have to tell them is that the wedding is small. If it is a large wedding, be honest about why someone wasn't invited, but don't be mean. You can't possibly invite everyone!

, A popular method for booking hotels and flights for a destination is to do a group block. This means your wedding specialist or destination wedding company will reserve a set number of rooms and flights for your guests. However, you may choose to allow your guests to make their own travel arrangements.


For convenience, it's best to have all your guests stay in the same resort or hotel with you.
You may begin to wonder who will pay for travel and accommodations. In most cases, you are only expected to pay for the ceremony and reception, and your guests should be paying for their own travel and accommodation. However, some guests may not be able to make it because of financial reasons. In these cases, you could consider aiding guests financially, especially if they are close friends or relatives, or part of your wedding party. However, you might be exposed to some criticism or stir negativity among your other guests, so it's best to keep things quiet or do what is most comfortable for you.

, It might all look and sound good on the website and through the phone, but you won't know for sure until you see it and experience it with your own eyes. Plan a short 4-5 night trip and visit all prospective venues.


This is a great opportunity to meet with your wedding consultant or local Hawaiian wedding planner face to face. Use this time to make decisions such as which caterer you'll be going with, how you and your guests will travel to the venue, or if the atmosphere of the location is right for you.
An extra trip to Hawaii may be costly, so be careful to budget how much you spend on this scouting trip. Consider staying in cheap hotels or travelling during the off-seasons."

Stop skipping breakfast.",How to Get in Shape Before Your Wedding," No matter what your goals are for your wedding, you should start acting on them three to six months before the big day. Getting into a healthy, stable routine well beforehand will not only produce the best results on your wedding day, but will also make it more likely that you’ll continue making these healthy choices after the big event., Ask yourself what about your general fitness level you want to change or improve. Perhaps you want to build your endurance to the point that you run a 5K or a half-marathon, or you just want to quit smoking and be able to walk around for a few hours without breathing heavily. Or, maybe you don’t care so much about endurance and are just interested in strengthening your core. Whatever your goals, write them down so that you can start making a plan to address them.


You might also want to keep a fitness journal to log your activities and accomplishments as the big day gets closer. This can help you identify any roadblocks you encounter along your personal fitness journey, as well as track your progress and show you how far you’ve come., You shouldn’t think of your body parts as ‘problem areas’ which need to be fixed, but you can identify body parts or health issues you’d like to address before you take your wedding pictures. For example, you might have an ongoing skin condition like eczema which you’d like to clear up, dry nails you’d like to restore, or weak arms you’d like to tone.


If your wedding dress is off-the shoulder, for instance, you may wish to target your arms and shoulders. Developing your shoulder caps, or deltoids, has the added benefit of making your waist appear smaller and your arms look leaner.
If you notice you slouch, work on your posture and try exercises that target your spinal erectors, such as spine extensions.
To tone your core, try planks and try working on your transverse abdominis muscles, which act like a natural girdle.
For issues such as serious dermatological conditions or malnutrition, you should consult a medical professional before attempting any independent programs or plans.

, In order to stay as mentally fit and centered as you can in the days leading up to your wedding, you should take some time to evaluate and identify which people, activities, or issues are likely to cause you the most stress. Knowing who and what things wear on you mentally and emotionally means that you can take this into consideration when planning your daily fitness regimen.


For example, if you figure out that your parents and in-laws always spike your stress levels, be sure to include de-stressing activities like yoga or walking any day you’ll be having dress fittings or making other arrangements with these family members.

, Getting at least 150 minutes of aerobic exercise — that is, any activity that raises your heart rate and can be continued for at least 10 minutes — will help relieve the stress of hectic wedding planning and elevate your mood. It will also help you address any endurance-related fitness goals you have, as well as reduce your risk of heart disease and diabetes.Joining a gym can be a good option, as it will offer an array of aerobics classes and workout machines for a varied workout routine that won’t bore you.
If you can’t afford a gym membership or you dislike the atmosphere, there are many alternative ways to get your daily dose of aerobic activity, such as jogging, brisk walking, cycling, or hiking.

, If you’re wanting to tone up before your walk down the aisle, make sure you do resistance-based exercises in addition to aerobic exercise. Medicine balls, resistance bands, weight machines, and no-equipment-necessary exercises such as pushups and situps are all great ways to strengthen your muscles and lose noticeable inches before the big day.Even if you want to target your arms in particular, for example, don’t ignore your other muscle groups entirely. Do at least some repetitions which address the core and legs as well.

, You’re probably seeing a lot of people and keeping a lot of appointments in the countdown to your wedding day, so it can seem like you don’t have much time to work out. Remember, though, that social and exercise time don’t have to be mutually exclusive! While you probably can’t consult your tailor while jogging or doing crunches, you can catch up with friends while taking a light jog or hiking together.If you’re making a lot of wedding arrangements over the phone, you can also do this while briskly walking around the neighborhood or on a treadmill in your home (but remember that talking on a cell phone at the gym is a major no-no).

, Taking a dance class will give you all the mental and physical benefits of a solo workout, while also boosting your confidence and skills for the reception. Friends and family at the wedding will be impressed with your new, smooth moves as well as your improved endurance and agility!


Check out the offerings at your local dance studio to see if they have a beginners course that works with your schedule and budget.

, As your wedding day approaches, you may find you have less and less free time. It is important to try and keep your exercise routine intact, even when your time is pressured. Exercise can reduce stress by releasing endorphins, improving your mood, and even serving as a form of meditation.Any form of exercise, even if it's just getting out of the house and taking a walk around the neighborhood, can help reduce stress.
Try to schedule time for exercise into your day between appointments or when you find you have some down time. Make exercise a priority.

, On the one hand, a sedentary lifestyle has been linked to increased risks of cancer, diabetes, and obesity.On the other hand, watching your favorite television show or playing a video game can help you unwind after a long day of appointments with the florist and caterer. Ultimately, then, you shouldn’t try to cut out these activities entirely. Just be sure to limit your daily doses of these sedentary activities in order to stay as active as possible in the days leading up to your wedding.


For example, give yourself an hour after work to watch television or an hour before bed to surf the internet. Set a timer to make sure you don't lose track of time.
If you have a treadmill at home or you know enough yoga moves to do them alone, try engaging in these physical activities while watching your favorite shows.

, Many wedding-oriented fitness plans focus on drastic weight loss through extreme dieting practices, but don’t be fooled into destructive measures that yield purely temporary results.Not only do restrictive crash diets lead to fluctuating weight — making it more likely that you’ll regain any lost weight after your nuptials — but they’ve also been shown to lead to binge-eating and other disordered eating habits.Crash diets have also been shown to damage your heart and lead to dangerous vitamin deficiencies.And, on top of everything else, you’ll also have less energy, less patience, and more mood swings.

, Protein-rich, unprocessed foods such as lean steak, chicken breast, fish, eggs, nuts, and beans will help ensure that your complexion will be clear for your wedding photos. They also contain high levels of energy-boosting B vitamins, iron, and magnesium, meaning that you’ll feel more energized and capable during stressful wedding preparations and hectic schedules.Make sure you allot appropriate portion sizes, as even healthy items such as salmon and lean steak can pack a mean caloric punch.
For example, your portions of protein should be roughly the size of your palm., In addition to long-term benefits such as decreased risk of cancer and diabetes, these all-natural superfoods can boost your gastrointestinal health and digestion so that you’re not backed up on the big day.In order to get these benefits, you should consume five portions of fruit and veg at a minimum, with nine to twelve servings being optimal.You can also make your regular ""rabbit food"" consumption more manageable by stocking a mixture of frozen, canned, and fresh fruit and vegetables in your kitchen. Just be sure not to fall for any pre-prepared items such as veggies in cheese sauce or fruit cocktails in heavy syrup: these sauces may seem like a negligible garnish, but they’re usually packed with saturated fat, sugar, or chemical additives., Studies have shown that drinking 2.2 liters of water daily can have a significant impact on your appearance. It has been shown to boost skin, hair, and nail health, while also assisting your digestion and keeping you regular.If you’re on-the-go during the day, take a water bottle with you in order to have water handy all day and cut down on plastic bottle waste.

, Foods such as sunflower seeds, dark chocolate, and apple cider vinegar have natural diuretic properties, meaning that they flush out excess water in your body and reduce unseemly bloat for your big day.And, since they’re all-natural, they won’t be too harsh and cause dehydration.


If you’re unsure how to include the strong tang of apple cider vinegar in your diet, add a dash into your homemade salad dressing. Some people even gulp it down in a shot glasses or dilute it in water. No matter how you ingest this ingredient, rest assured that it will provide the same benefits.

, A well-functioning digestive system will help you avoid constipation while easing some painful conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome and diarrhea. Probiotics and fiber are two of the best components to promote a healthy intestinal tract and function, so including them in your daily diet can help you look and feel lighter on your wedding day.For probiotics, look for yogurt labels indicating that it contains live cultures. For fiber, eat foods such as beans, broccoli, oats and whole grain bread.Many claims regarding the ability of probiotics to fight eczema and boost the immune system remain largely anecdotal and unsubstantiated by formal studies. There is, however, no evidence of this natural bacteria-booster having a harmful effect, so feel free to try out some supplements if you’ve heard good things., It shouldn't shock you to learn that the simple carbs found in foods like white breads, baked goods, crackers, and chips can derail your plans to get in shape. These foods are low in fiber and high in sugar and digest quickly, which means you will quickly feel hungry again after eating. But don't cut out carbs completely, as they are your body's main source of energy. Choose complex carbs, such as quinoa, whole wheat bread, carrots, and bananas., While ‘light’ foods may seem like a good option in the days and weeks winding up to your walk down the aisle, these artificially trimmed-down items should be avoided whenever possible. Not only do they contain fewer natural nutrients than their whole-fat counterparts, but they’re also less satisfying. This means that you’ll be hungry soon after eating your low-calorie yogurt or cheese, or that you’ll eat more of it during one sitting.This goes for processed, salty meats as well. Even if that deli turkey boasts that it contains only sixty calories per slice, it’s chock-full of sodium and harmful chemical additives such as nitrates and nitrites., You might think that skipping breakfast in the morning can help you cut calories and trim down for your wedding day, but in fact the opposite is true. Skipping this meal can slow your metabolism, whereas eating every day in the morning has been shown to make you more physically active throughout the rest of the day, lower your risk of diabetes and heart disease, and boost brain function.Not just any breakfast is a healthy one. Stay away from sugary cereals, large glasses of fruit juice, sweet pastries, and processed meats, as these can slow your metabolism and lead to a sugar crash.
Instead, try oatmeal, fruit with low-fat yogurt, eggs (unless prepared in fat), or 1 tablespoon of peanut butter on multigrain toast. To drink, try green tea or black coffee (skip the sugar, milk, and sugary additions).

Many people are also using websites to give more information about the ceremony. Look for a website on the invitation, then visit the site for directives.;
, Whatever the theme is, if you decide to attend the wedding, you are also agreeing to playing along with the theme. This is their day and you are a part of it. Follow any specific directions given by the bride and groom, whether that is dressing up like a Star Trek character, or sporting a Hawaiian shirt., If a cultural element is involved in the wedding theme, you can wear something in homage to the culture, but be sure that it does not come off as mocking the culture by going too far.Indian formal attire is a sari. You may not have one and don’t usually wear them, but you can match the brilliant colors of saris by wearing jewel tones. You could also accessorize with Indian jewelry.
Scottish wedding parties may be wearing kilts. You could choose a plaid tie to show your support without going all the way with your own kilt.
Keep it conservative and respect any religious traditions. If you are going to a Catholic mass, also consider the fact that you will be expected to stand for a good portion of the ceremony as well as possibly kneel. Wear conservative clothes and shoes comfortable to move and stand in.

Don’t wear white.,
Don’t wear all black.,
Tone down your style.,
Step your outfit up to formal.,
Roll up your sleeves.,
Take off your hat.,
Choose the right shoes.,
Dress your children in formal attire that is still comfortable.",How to Dress For a Wedding2," One of the first rules of weddings, especially in America, is that the only person wearing white should be the bride. This goes for the wedding and any other festivities surrounding it like bridal showers and rehearsal dinners. Even if your white outfit is your favorite one, leave it in the closet for these occasions.This goes for off-white as well. It is safest to avoid it altogether.
It is okay to have white accents or elements, but you should avoid solid white., While you don’t want to look like the bride in a white lace dress, you also don’t want to look like you are attending a funeral, or mourning the death of your friend’s single life. Don't dress in all black.A little black is fine, or even a black dress or suit paired with colored accessories or shoes. Just don’t cover yourself in black from head to toe.

, You want to look great and stylish, but you should not outshine the bride and groom. This is their day and you don’t want to take attention away from them by drawing attention to yourself with your outfit.Avoid too much bling. Clothes that have too much glitz and glamour can outshine the couple. This includes sequined dresses or lots of lace.
You can have a little glitz in your accessories, like a bold necklace, but avoid it in your clothes.
While you may be able to afford a more expensive suit or gown than the happy couple, you don’t want to flaunt it on their wedding day.

, Show respect for the occasion with your outfit. No matter how casual the wedding is, it’s better to avoid really casual clothing choices. This includes denim, t-shirts, sweats, tight leggings, and cargo shorts.It is better to overdress than underdress for the occasion.

, Short sleeve dress shirts are frowned upon for men. It may be hot, but men, if you are going to wear a dress shirt, make it a long-sleeved dress shirt. If you get too hot, rolling the sleeves up is perfectly acceptable., This is especially important for men. Definitely don’t wear caps or beanies, and other hats should be avoided as well. Wearing hats indoors is generally poor etiquette, and even outdoor weddings should be hat-free zones.On the other hand, there are exemptions to this rule for headwear relevant to religious traditions like the Jewish kippah, or Indian scarves.

, Wear nice dress shoes which match your outfit. A low heel for women or nice leather dress shoes for men are ideal. Nice sandals for women or loafers for men can pass at a summer wedding. Flip-flops and tennis shoes should be avoided., While you want your kids to look good, you also don't want them to get fussy. Many of these same rules apply to children, but you also need to keep their comfort in mind.It’s okay to put them in shorts when it’s hot. You can class up the outfit with some suspenders.
Choose sandals over heels for a young girl.
Bring play clothes for them to change into after the ceremony.

Choose deep colors and heavy materials for winter weddings.,
Prepare for unpredictable fall weather.,
Keep cool at a summer wedding with breathable fabric and bright colors.,
Prepare for damp springs, while embracing the colors of the blooms.",How to Dress For a Wedding3," This is your chance to wear deep jewel tones and dark suits. Go for a heavy material like velvet, tweed or wool that will keep you warm in the cold weather.A pant suit is acceptable for women at a winter wedding who want to stay warm. Longer dresses can also keep you covered and cozy.
Women can wear tights with a shorter dress, but pair them with close-toed heels. Don’t wear boots to a wedding.
Men can layer a sweater or cardigan between their jacket and their shirt and tie.

, It can be difficult to plan for a fall wedding, since the weather is changing. You may need to wait until you get close to the date of the wedding to decide what to wear. Have a couple of options planned out and choose one the week of the wedding. Muted colors, layers and mixing and matching are a good plan for fall.Women may or may not want to wear tights depending on the temperature. Choose a dress which can be worn either way.
Plan on carrying a nice sweater that you can throw on if there is a chill.
Men can mix up textures and patterns, like a tweed jacket and a silk tie.

, You want to focus on staying cool while still meeting the formal expectations of the ceremony. The trick here is choosing a fabric which lets the air in. Go for chiffon, silk, cotton and linen. Also match the sunshine with lighter and brighter colors.Women often wear a nice sundress, you can still wear long gowns as long as they are made of light, flowing fabrics.
Men may not need to wear a tie, but you should still wear a light jacket. You can take it off later and roll up your sleeves, but you should wear a jacket for the ceremony.

, Spring showers can make dressing formally a little challenging. You don’t want to ruin your best clothes or shoes in water and mud, so wear clothes and shoes that can survive the element. Keep your fancy suede at home. Focus the color of your outfit on the flowers blooming. Go bold with colors.Women should avoid long gowns which will drag in the mud.
Men and women can experiment with bold colors and pastels as opposed to black and white.
Men can wear colored shirts under their suit coats and even play around with fun patterned socks.

Ask the bride and groom what period and nationality of costuming they're going for, and how strict they're being.,
Once you ascertain what sort of costuming period you need, do a little research.,
If you are making costuming for you and your family, look into patterns that will let you make an outfit out of the same cloth.,
Look at clothing from that time period and region, and pick something you're COMFORTABLE wearing.,
If you're purchasing, talk to online vendors, and explain what you're looking for.,
Hunt around for good prices.,
If you're able to get a decent costume at a decent price from someone online, recommend them to others going to the wedding, even if they weren't part of the original 'bulk' order.,
Once you have your costume, look up articles online about how to wear it.,
Look reasonably at whether you can wear the costume in the car, or if you should change.,
Wear comfortable shoes.,
Have a change of clothing when you leave.,
Keep your costume if you like it - it'll make a great easy Halloween costume!",How to Dress for a Medieval or Renaissance Wedding," Medieval can be anything from 900 (kilts and loose gowns) to 1600 (neck high corsets and hoop skirts). If you show up in an Elizabethan gown and everyone else is sporting basic tunics and pants, it will look silly.;
, Find out if it will be cheaper to make it (if you have the skills for that) or cheaper to buy it online.

, Then you can buy in bulk, cheaper. Also, you'll be able to spot your family easily in the crowd despite strange clothing you're not used to.

, A man who hates the notion of wearing tights will be embarrassed and uncomfortable for the whole wedding. A woman who would never display her cleavage shouldn't wear a corset.

, Offer to put them in touch with anyone else going to the wedding - often for a large order, they'll let you get things at a lower rate.

, If you mention to a vendor that another place is willing to make a bulk deal, you could get better rates - but do *not* lie to them. A lot of those people work together at the same fairs, and have good friendly relationships.

, The more people dressed by the same company, the more classy the wedding will look - and the less you'll stick out.

, Men: Don't tuck in your shirt, strap a belt across it. And wear the belt under your belly, if you have a belly. It just looks silly when someone tries to girdle in their gut with a leather strap. It should go where your pants belt goes. Ask someone who does medieval re-enactment or a friend who is a history buff to help you try on the clothing. Some things that look like they go on easily don't. Corsets lace in the back, belts wrap around you twice, and men look very silly if they tuck in their shirt, since the shirt has a billowy loose bottom.

, Find out if the venue has somewhere you can change, or at worst, wear some of the costume and put on the parts you can't wear in the car (corset, belt, etc) once you get there.

, One of the best parts of medieval clothing is that you can wear loose pants or skirts that hide your shoes entirely, and medieval clothing never, ever had high heels until well after the Victorian era. Do not, under any circumstances, wear a traditional gown with heels. You'll be very off balance, more likely to fall, and look ridiculous.

, By the end of the day you might be relieved to put on a pair of jeans and a sweater. Being stuck in something you're not used to wearing might be frustrating or even embarrassing if you're pulled over or have to stop for food. People who wear that kind of clothing all the time for fairs or re-enactments are used to being looked at funny in the 7-Eleven, but it might be pretty humiliating if you aren't.

, Otherwise, sell it on Etsy or eBay. You can make a decent penny back on your investment that way, and if you have a set of family costumes, you might even help another family going to a wedding!

Consider the dress code.,
Follow a deep, rich color palette.,
Choose textured fabrics.,
Opt for a longer skirt or dress.,
Pair tights with a shorter dress.,
Consider wearing pants.,
Add a blazer over a short sleeve dress.,
Choose stable shoes.,
Opt for a wool suit.,
Dress in layers.,
Incorporate patterns.,
Choose dress boots instead of shoes.",How to Dress As a Winter Wedding Guest," Before deciding how the season will affect your clothing choices, you should make sure that you understand the wedding’s dress code. Consult the invitation, which will usually make it clear how guests are expected to dress. That way, you won’t dress too formally or casually for the event.If the invitation says “White Tie”, the wedding has an extremely formal dress code. Women should wear floor length evening gowns, while men are expected to wear a tuxedo with long tails, a white vest, and a black bowtie.
If the invitation says “Black Tie”, women can wear a floor length evening gown or a dressy cocktail dress. Men should wear a traditional tux with a cummerbund and bow tie.
If the invitation says “Formal” or “Black Tie Optional,” women can wear a floor length dress, a formal cocktail style dress, or dressy separates. Men can wear a traditional tuxedo or a dark suit, white shirt, and tie.
If the invitation says “Dressy Casual” or “Semiformal,” women should wear a cocktail dress or a dressy skirt and top. Men should wear a suit.
If the invitation says “Festive Attire,” you can have a little more fun with your outfit. Women can wear a cocktail dress in a bold color and pair it with fun accessories, such as a cute hat. Men should wear a suit, but pair it with a fun tie in a bold color or pattern.;
, While you can certainly wear any color that you like no matter what the season, a winter wedding is the perfect opportunity to wear rich, dark colors that fit the season. Black and navy appropriate for winter weddings, but so are jewel tones, such as sapphire, ruby, garnet, emerald, citrine, or amethyst. Metallic tones such as gold, silver, and bronze, also work well for winter weddings.

, While lightweight fabrics such as chiffon and linen are ideal for spring and summer, they’re not the best option for winter weddings. Instead, opt for weighty, textured fabrics that will not only keep you warm but add visual interest to your outfit too.Fabrics such as velvet, brocade, cashmere, and wool are all good options for a winter wedding.

, Even if the dress code for the wedding doesn’t call for extremely formal wear, you may want to opt for a longer dress or skirt to help stay warm. That doesn’t mean you have to choose a floor length option, though - a midi dress or skirt, which usually hits at mid-calf, can be a stylish option.Tea length dresses and skirts, which are usually slightly longer than midi styles but not floor length, are also a good option for winter weddings.
If you’re not sure about wearing a midi or tea length dress or skirt, consider wearing a high-low style. They’re usually longer in the back and shorter in the front, so you’ll get some added warmth while not committing to a longer length all the way around.

, If you want to wear a shorter dress that ends at the knees or above, your legs may be a little cold at the ceremony and reception. That doesn’t mean you have to ditch the dress -- just swap your bare legs or sheer hosiery for a pair of opaque tights that will help keep you a little warmer.Err on the side of caution by choosing tights in a neutral color such as black or gray. Wearing a color that coordinates with your dress can sometimes like a little too costume-y.
Depending on what type of dress or skirt that you’re wearing, you may want to opt for a textured pair of tights. For example, you can complement a simple sheath dress with a pair of tights with a lacy texture. If you’re wearing a dress with a bold pattern or texture, it’s best to wear smooth tights.

, It may not seem traditional, but pants can actually be an elegant option for a winter wedding. Just opt for a tailored pair that have an elegant look, and pair them with a statement top.For a winter wedding, pants in a dark color, such as black, are an ideal option. However, you can also go for a sophisticated, stylish look by choosing a pair in winter white or cream.
If you’re wearing pants to a winter wedding, wear them with a bold sequin top or elegant satin blouse to ensure that you look dressy enough.
In addition to pants, you can wear an elegant tailored jumpsuit to a winter wedding.

, If you have an ideal dress to wear to a winter wedding but you’re worried that you’ll be cold in its short sleeves, layer a blazer over it. A sophisticated velvet or brocade blazer can keep you warm and add style to your look.If you’re wearing a simple, solid colored dress, consider pairing it with a blazer in floral pattern that features rich jewel tones to give your outfit some more flair.

, At a winter wedding, you may have to deal with icy sidewalks or snowy parking lots -- which can be difficult to navigate in stiletto heels. Instead of skyscraper pumps, opt for shoes that are easier to walk in, such as velvet wedges or peep toe kitten heels.Ballet flats that are embellished with rhinestones or covered in satin are also a good option for winter weddings.
If you’re concerned about your feet being cold, pair your dress, skirt, or tailored pants with stylish ankle boots for added warmth.

, When in doubt, your best bet for a winter wedding is a classic trim-fit wool suit. You’ll be warmer than if you wear a basic cotton suit and have a more stylish look in a slim-fitting option. Add a tie for a more dressed up look, or pair it with a simple button-down for a more casual wedding.A cashmere suit is another option for a winter wedding. The fabric will keep your warm, and has a slight sheen that might make it too much for the office but will look appropriate at a special event such as a wedding.

, If you’re worried about being cold at the ceremony and/or reception, dressing in layers can help keep your warm. You can wear a zip-up sweater over your shirt and tie but under jacket to ward off the chill. Choosing a zippered style makes it easier to remove if you get too warm., At a winter wedding, you can add flair to your look by incorporating patterns. You might wear a striped shirt with a solid suit or add a elegant plaid pocket square to the pocket of a solid jacket. Wearing a patterned tie can also help spice up your outfit.You can mix patterns, but be careful to keep your outfit from looking too busy. For example, if you’re wearing a striped shirt, you might pair it with a suit with a subtle herringbone pattern but not a noticeable plaid pattern.

, Dress shoes can work well for a winter wedding, but your feet may get cold. Instead, consider swapping your usual dress shoes for a pair of dress boots. They’ll keep your feet warmer without taking anything away from your finished look. For example, you can find wingtip boots. They’ll look just like dress shoes with your suit or pants, but they’ll provide extra warmth.

Whatever your routine has been, now is not the time to change it. If you exfoliate, however, stay away from a harsh scrub and opt instead for a gentle exfoliating cleanser. If you have a blemish, dab some Visine on it but otherwise leave it alone. Your focus should be on having the clean and soft palette your makeup needs to achieve natural-looking, beautiful skin.;
, While there are specific skin types (identified from 1-6) for dermatological purposes, makeup companies use their own terminology to describe their makeup colors along the continuum of skin tone. And they aren’t particularly consistent at that. For example, one company might call its lightest foundation “ivory” while another calls the same color “fair.” Thus, in thinking about colors that match your skin tone, it’s best to first think broadly in terms of the range from ""fair"" to ""medium"" to ""deep.""Your skin’s undertones – cool or warm – are also a factor when choosing both matching and complementary colors.
You can determine your undertone with a quick trick. Hold a piece of silver and a piece of gold jewelry to the back of your hand. If the gold seems to melt away, you have a warm undertone. If the silver does, you have a cool undertone., Between the time you begin applying your makeup and the time you say goodbye to your guests, a lot will have happened. Using a primer before you apply your makeup will help ensure it holds up through the dancing, crying and toasting. You’ll likely still need occasional touch-ups, but they’ll be much less frequent. Additionally, a primer will help smooth fine lines and wrinkles and disguise open pores.









Use a small amount after you’ve moisturized, but before you put on foundation. Spread it evenly on your face and eyelids to create a smooth base for everything to come., Often people think concealer goes on before foundation, but the experts beg to differ.After you’ve put on the primer, allow it time to dry or set. One of the biggest mistakes you can make when applying makeup is not giving each step time to dry. If needed, turn your hair dryer on its coolest setting and wave it back and forth across your face before moving from one step to the next.








If you have a cool undertone, look for foundation that has a rosier, redder or blue base.
If you have a warm undertone, use a foundation with a yellow or golden base.
To determine if the shade is right, dip a Q-tip in the foundation and apply it to the center of your lower jawline. If it vanishes, it’s the right one!Apply foundation in thin layers, starting from the middle of your face and blending outward using a foundation brush. You don’t want any visible lines, so pay close attention to blending beneath your jaw and on your neck.
Don’t cake on foundation. It will look overdone and likely smear or streak., Whereas foundation is designed to even skin tone, concealers are designed to hide things, like blemishes and dark circles under your eyes. If you were to apply it before your foundation, you’d rub much of it away while working the foundation into your skin. To cover red areas or dark circles, use a concealer brush to dot a liquid concealer the same shade or one shade lighter than your skin tone along trouble areas. Then pat the brush against your skin to spread the concealer. If it’s not blended enough, dip the tip of a makeup sponge in water and work the concealer outward.








To hide a blemish, put foundation on it first, then apply concealer before setting it with powder. If you can still see it, add more concealer and powder. Make sure you pat the concealer on the blemish. Don’t rub., Highlighter isn’t always in everyone’s makeup bag, but its purpose is to make certain facial features like eyes appear larger and to add both glow and a youthful dewy look. Using too much, or a formulation with sparkle or glitter, is a recipe for photo disaster, so tread lightly. They come in both liquid and powder forms.









If you use a liquid, dab it on with a brush after your foundation in the shape of a check mark. Start near your inner eye, go down at a slight angle toward your nostril and then up your cheekbone, blending toward your temple. Do the same above your brows, down the center of your nose, the center of your forehead and your chin.
If you’re using a powder highlighter, use it after you powder and brush it under your brows, lightly in the corner of your eyes and on the tops of your cheekbones. Don’t use powder highlighter under your eyes or over your mouth or you’ll look sweaty in photos., Really, you have two choices next. You can use a cream blush rather than a powder blush or set your base with powder. If you opt to use a powder blush, first use a translucent powder to set your base and control shine. Powder is one of those times when less is absolutely more. You’re going for luminous, not laden down. Use a medium-sized brush to dust lightly over your forehead, the sides of your nose and on your chin.









Then use a powder bronzer that’s just a shade or two darker than your foundation and brush it in the shape of a 3 on both sides of your face.
To do so, start at your hairline, move down the side of your face and then under your cheekbone, back to the side of your face and then below your jaw.Have pressed powder on hand. There are always areas that shine and need a quick dab before a photo or while in the restroom., Whether you’re using a cream blush prior to your powder or a powder blush after, go lightly with the blush. You can always add more. Apply blush to the apples of your cheeks and blend upwards and out toward your hairline. You don’t want a pink nose, so don’t brush it there. To finish, do a small check mark at your cheek bones.








If you have fair skin with cool undertones, colors like soft rose or baby pink with hints of mocha or beige will look nice.
If you have fair skin with warm undertones, go for golden apricot or a light peach with a bit of pink.
If you have medium skin with cool undertones, try cranberry, light raspberry or rosy pink.
If you have medium skin with warm undertones, look for soft coral with hints of brown or sunkissed apricot.
If you have deep skin with cool undertones, blush on shades of plum, grape and raspberry.
If you have deep skin with warm undertones, keep it rich with brown suede or a deep coral with a little bronze., Wedding experts generally don't recommend a darkly dramatic eye, opting instead to use eye liners in colors other than black, paler or muted eye shadows complementary to your eye color, and highlighters to make eyes look large. Try brown, grey, and green eyeliners and apply it on both your top and bottom eyelids to draw attention to your eyes. Using a cream eye shadow will last longer and is best used on the lids of your eye while a powder is best in the crease of your eye. Use a powder highlighter in the corners of your eyes and under your brow.









As for colors, try bronze shades if you have green eyes, mocha if your eyes are hazel, navy and dark brown for blue eyes, and purples and grays for brown eyes.
Dampen an eyeliner brush in water and brush it into your eye shadow if you want to line your eyes with your eye shadow., Also, if you don’t already regularly wear false eyelashes, your wedding day is not the day to start.Instead, make sure you have a good eyelash curler, a volumizing mascara and a lengthening mascara. Curl your lashes before applying both. With your mascara, start at the root of your eyelashes and wiggle up from side to side to the top. Go with black – it looks good on everyone.









Finish by framing your face with a brow powder a little darker than your natural color. Brush it into the natural line of your eyebrows, working outward to the end of your eyes., Just as you need your facial skin to be well moisturized prior to applying makeup, your lips also need to be moisturized so they aren’t so dry or cracked that once color is applied all you see are lines. To avoid this, use a lip hydrator and let it absorb a couple of minutes before applying color. Choose a color that complements your blush while also following these tips.Also, while many newer lipsticks claim to last hours, going with a lip stain is a better bet on your wedding day.








If you have fair skin with cool undertones, go with nude, light mocha and light mauve; if you have warm undertones, try sand, nude peach or shell. Avoid bright pinks, dark bronzes and dark mochas.
If you have medium skin with cool undertones, choose a rosy pink, pomegranate or cranberry; if you have warm undertones, go for bronze, copper and cinnamon. Avoid nudes.
If you have deep skin with cool undertones, check out raisin, wine or ruby red; if you have warm undertones, try honey, ginger or a coppery bronze. Avoid anything close to orange.If using lip liner, apply your lip stain or lipstick, if that’s what you choose, almost to the edge of the lip. Next use a lip liner to define the shape of your lips and to seal it all in. Add just a little more color and blend the two together.If you go for a bolder, or statement, lip color, keep your eyes soft and natural to avoid the bridal doll look.Avoid smacking your lips together because this can make your smile look lop-sided.
Skip the lip gloss. First, it doesn’t last long. Secondly, it will end up on your groom’s lips. And, finally, it can create a glare in photos.

, One of the biggest mistakes brides make is caking on makeup – too many layers of overly dark foundation, far too smoky eyes, lipstick that is blindingly bright in photos and so forth. You don’t want to wince when you look back on your wedding photos like you do when looking at those from prom. Think timeless. Leave experimentation for another time and place – you want to look like the best version of you, not like someone else.Makeup artists highly recommend staying away from all makeup with any glitter or sparkle because it bounces off flash photography, leaving white spots on your skin. They can be removed from photos, but it’s expensive., Because your gown most likely will be white, you’ll need some color to compensate for its lack of color. Yet just as you don’t want to wear too much makeup, you also don’t want to wear the wrong style of makeup. Your goal is a cohesive look in which each piece makes sense with every other. Even if you love a certain style of makeup, or are simply accustomed to wearing makeup one way, that doesn’t mean it’s going to look good with your hair and dress.


If your gown is romantic, billowy and soft, for instance, smoky eyes and bright red lipstick will clash, not be complementary.
If you’re wearing your hair in an updo with a lot of adornments, you should keep your makeup simple, yet still fresh and rosy.Look at bridal magazines and red carpet images, specifically, to see how stylists put together an entire look that’s stunning rather than shocking.

, Another mistake brides often make is waiting until the last minute to decide how they’re going to do their makeup. So definitely get started early. Pull out those bridal magazines and start looking at the makeup used. When you see something you like, tear out the whole page and put it in a file marked “makeup.” Also look in other fashion magazines, search for images online (and print them) and browse other publications.Identify what it is you like about the makeup in each image you find. Use a sharpie and write it down to the side.
Look around and jot down notes at different times of the day and when you’re in different moods.
After you’ve collected a nice sample, try to determine if you notice any themes. For example, have you repeatedly written that you like a particular lip color? Do you see you’ve written several notes on lightening undereye circles?

, Remember back to weddings you’ve attended or been a part of in the past. When do you remember thinking to yourself about the bride, “Wow, she looks AMAZING!” You may not be able to remember exactly what it was about her makeup that you liked, or if it was even her makeup that made her stand out, but you know one thing – she didn’t mess it up and she looked fabulous. Give her a call. She will certainly take it as a compliment. Ask her if she did her makeup herself. If not, ask her who did. If she had a makeup artist, ask for the person’s name and contact information.


If you’re really struggling in deciding on a look, remember that one rarely fails: radiant skin, rosy cheeks and pink lips., If you’ve not been particularly diligent about taking good care of your facial skin, now is the time to start. Get facials once per month to firm your complexion and illuminate your skin, which will create a good base for makeup. Make sure you wash your face well not only in the morning but also at night to get rid of the day’s makeup. Regularly exfoliate to remove dead skin and even out your skin tone. Moisturize your face and drink plenty of water, too. Applying makeup to dry, splotchy and flaky skin won’t produce your desired look, no matter how hard you try.


If you have a breakout a day or two before your wedding, do not pick at it! It’s much easier to cover a blemish than a scab.
Wax brows or other areas of your face at least one week before your wedding to avoid any marks. If you’ve never waxed before, don’t start doing so days before your wedding because you can get a rash if you’ve never before waxed.
Consider whitening your teeth, too. There are many options, from having it done at the dentist’s office to doing it at home with over-the-counter products. You should start 3-4 months before the wedding., You may choose to do your own makeup, as Kate Middleton did before she wed Prince William. Or you may decide to have a friend or a makeup artist do it. If the latter, you may already have a recommendation from a friend. If not, consider asking your wedding planner if he or she can recommend one. You could also ask the coordinator of events for your wedding venue, look online or talk with the salon owner where you have your hair done or where you’re planning to have your hair done if you’re going that route.


No matter whom you select, ask to see a portfolio. If it’s heavy in everything but the look you want, find someone else.

, If you choose to have your makeup done by another person, schedule a time at least one month before the wedding to have a trial run. By this time, you’ll be more settled in the overall planning of your wedding and have a better idea of what you want. Take your collected images, a photo of your dress, a photo or image of what your hair will look like and a photo of yourself when you think you look your best to your trial run. This will all help the person doing your makeup both create the look you want and one that will work with your other elements.


If you plan to tan before your wedding, you need to achieve that color before your makeup trial, too, or the results will not be the same.
Also remember that while you might find a makeup look that you love, it might not look good with your coloring. If you’re using a makeup artist, allow him or her to guide you on these matters.
Always wear a white t-shirt to your trial run so you can see how your makeup will look against your dress. Take a photo with no flash before you leave., If you don’t know much about makeup application, keep reading. You can also research it online; watch YouTube videos; or go to a department store, look around at the women selling products at the makeup counters and find someone wearing a makeup style you like. Ask her for a makeover, which they’ll often do for free in hopes that you’ll buy some of their products. You might find that you do. Practice doing your makeup in natural light, using the products you plan to use. Also wear a white t-shirt and take a photo of yourself afterward.

Practice with matching.,
Work on the ability to identify differences.,
Practice visual memory.,
Cultivate attention to detail.,
Do puzzles.,
Teach left and right.,
Develop depth perception.,
Begin developing mathematical skills.,
Emphasize the importance of concentration.,
Stimulate logical thinking skills.,
Ask open-ended questions.",How to Improve Children's Perceptual Reasoning," Matching games can boost perceptual reasoning by increasing children’s abilities to recognize and compare visual information. There are an almost infinite number of ways to practice matching, but to begin with, try:


matching colors. Challenge children to find as many blue things as possible, then as many red things, and so on. Ask them to find something in the room around them that matches their shirt or their eyes.
matching shapes and sizes. Use cubes and blocks of varying shapes and sizes and challenge children to match them by shape, by size, or, once the children have progressed, by both at once.
writing letters on cards or pieces of paper and having children look for matches. Once this skill is mastered, you can move on to short words, then longer ones.
challenging children to match words with pictures. This game reinforces the connections between a written word and a visual image. There are flashcards and other games designed for this purpose, or you can make your own.
encouraging children to find items that begin with a particular letter. This game reinforces the connections between a particular letter or sound and the objects and people that letters can represent.
playing memory games. Memory games develop both matching and memory skills. They are usually played with cards, which have symbols drawn on pairs. The cards are turned face-down, and players have to find matches.;
, Part of perceptual reasoning involves picking up on differences and knowing where something does or does not “belong.” Lots of simple activities can help children develop these skills. For example:


try using “spot the difference” pictures. These appear in magazines, and you can find them in books and online as well. They feature two almost identical images side by side, and children can look to find the small differences between them.
encourage children to find objects that don’t belong. Set up a group of items – say, three apples and a pencil – and ask which object does not belong. As children progress, you can make this more difficult: use an apple, an orange, a banana, and a ball, for example, then an apple, an orange, a banana, and a carrot.

, Show children a picture, then cover all or part of it and ask them to describe what they saw. Alternatively, show children a set of items, then put them away and challenge them to think of as many as they can.


It can also help to encourage children to talk about the images that they see. Have children describe images in detail, tell stories about the images, and compare them with other images.

, Show children a picture with words or images hidden in it, and challenge them to find as many as they can.

, Jigsaw puzzles and other puzzle games encourage children to practice their visual perception skills: they have to rotate and match shapes and visualize larger pictures. These skills will be foundational for success in mathematics.

, Left-right orientation is part of perceptual reasoning and visual perception. Explain the difference between left and right – you can use the hand a child uses to write as a starting point – and reinforce the concept by asking children to carry items in their left hands or wave with their right hands – whatever comes to mind.


This is also a good time to introduce the concept of directional arrows. Show children pictures of arrows pointing left and right, and ask them to identify the direction.

, Perception of depth is part of perceptual reasoning. Play children’s versions of darts, basketball, and tennis to develop depth perception. You can also:


pour some items into a box (sticks, blocks, or marbles, for example) and tell children to take items only from the top.
have children close one eye, and turn a glass upside down on a table. Circle with your finger over the glass, and ask children to tell you to stop when your finger gets to the top.

, As children grow, they can begin to practice their perceptual reasoning skills in relation to numbers. Have children match numbers and match items with the number that describes them (two balls, three apples, four cups, etc.). As children are ready, begin working on addition and other mathematical concepts.

, From an early age, children can be taught to focus on a particular task or idea for short period of time; as they grow, they can learn to concentrate for longer and longer stretches. Teach children that this concentration is important.


Help children succeed at focusing by minimizing distractions – noise, television, electronic devices, other people, and anything else that makes concentration difficult.

, Logical reasoning is a tough skill to develop because so much of it depends on a child’s developmental level. You can encourage logic, however, by giving children opportunities to think about what will happen next and why. You can do this when reading stories or when doing your normal daily activities.

, Asking children questions with words like “why” and “how” stimulate logical thinking more than “yes/no” or multiple-choice style questions do.

Add captions to the photos.,
Place pictures in frames.,

, Photos that span decades may not look visually appealing together. To help give your photos a more cohesive look, scan them into your computer and edit them with the same colored filter.Some websites and photo editors will allow you to turn all the photos a color, like blue, green, or red, make them sepia-toned, or turn them black and white.

, Another way to make a uniform, tasteful display of photos from different eras is to place them all in the same frame. If you like the evolving look of photography through the decades, gain some continuity by placing each photo in the same frame.You can buy frames that are silver for a classic wedding look. You can buy frames in one of your wedding colors, or you can buy wooden frames and paint them for a unique DIY look.
If you want to go for a rustic, natural look, place the photos in the unpainted wooden frames.

Choose icing that fits with your color scheme.,
Don’t try to decorate it perfectly.,
Use a crisscross pattern in the icing.,
Create a striped design for a shabby-chic look.,
Opt for a naked cake.",How to Decorate a Rustic Wedding Cake1," When brainstorming your cake design, consider incorporating your color scheme into the cake’s icing. Bringing in your color scheme to your cake ties in the other elements of your wedding into this delicious focal point of the reception. Using colored icing is also an easy, simple way to dress up a wedding cake. Colorful icing may be all the decoration you need for rustic and elegant dessert.


You could go for an off-white or brown icing.;
, Rustic wedding cakes do not need to be neat and polished. The icing’s uneven texture can help create the cake’s rustic, rough-hewn, and effortless style. An imperfect swirl or an uneven layer of icing in one section lends itself to your handmade motif. Enjoy the imperfections and the creativity behind the design!


If you have a brown chocolate cake, for example, you can put off-white icing on top imperfectly so that a few bits of brown show up

, Adding interesting textures and indentions can help enhance your rustic theme. Use a fork to create a crisscross or basket pattern in the icing. Gently press the tongs of the fork vertically into the cake icing. After you have removed your fork, rotate it so that the tongs are horizontal. Press the fork into the icing again over the vertical stripes you just created.


Add these flourishes along the base of the cake for an understated stripe of texture, or cover the entire tier for a bolder look.

, To create a stunning, vertical-striped design, drag your knife, spatula, or the back of a spoon from the bottom of the cake toward the top. Repeat this motion around the entire cake.This simple design brings a unique movement to the cake while still retaining the natural ease of a rustic theme.

, Cakes that use a minimal amount of frosting are gaining in popularity. To boost your rustic theme, showcase the cake’s individual layers with a barely-there layer of icing—or with no icing at all!These bare layers will offer a fresh and unique look for the sweet focal point of your reception.


You can leave the body of the cake icing-free but cover the tops of the layers in white icing.
Choosing a cake that is not covered in icing or fondant will help ensure its freshness. The cake’s frosting acts as a barrier that prevents the cake from drying out too quickly. Without this layer, the baker will need to bake the cake on the day of your wedding, ensuring that the naked wedding cake is as fresh as possible."

, This is a particularly great choice if you are already incorporating blue into your overall wedding theme. Tint the frosting or fondant with a very light blue color. The frosting should have a smooth texture so the tiers look like snowy ice blankets. To continue the natural theme, decorate with pinecones.


For a snowy effect, speckle the pinecones with white royal icing and dust them with sparkling sugar.Create more natural texture by accenting with chocolate “pine needles.”

, If you’d prefer not to have a mostly white cake, you still have plenty of options. Have a chocolate cake, or alternate cream and chocolate tiers for an earthy vibe. Rich reds are also very seasonal and red accents look great on a chocolate cake.For example, you could place sprigs of red berries on the tiers.


To enhance the Christmas vibe, put sprigs of holly around the red berries.
For a less rustic look, line the tiers with red rosettes made of royal frosting or create a red stripe with a velvet ribbon.

, If you want to keep it simple, consider using gold icing on the cake. Use metallic elements to accent, such as gold or iridescent colored rosettes made of icing. Gold icing can be hand painted onto your cake for a very elegant look. If you prefer silver, start with a white cake and create all of the accents in silver.Make one of the tiers silver or go all out and gild your entire cake.

Date and location of the ceremony.
Processional and recessional music selections.
Greetings from the officiant.
Special readings (cite the readings and also include the name of the reader).
Prayers or religious customs.
Exchanging of vows and rings (some people like to print their vows in the program. This will take up extra space and may cause the program to be too long.)
Lighting of unity candle or special song.
Pronouncement of marriage.;
, Typically, the person officiating your wedding will have a general outline for how they perform a wedding ceremony. Make sure that you talk about any additional readings or songs you would like to include and arrange where they should be placed in the ceremony.

, A wedding program is a great place to provide the names of the bride's and groom’s parents along with the wedding party. Remember that many people attending your wedding will not know each other. A list of names can allow you to introduce your parents and bridal party to your guests.For example, list the parents of the bride, parents of the groom, maid of honor, best man, bridesmaids, and groomsmen.
You may also want to include the names of grandparents.

, If your wedding reception is in a different location from your wedding ceremony, it is a good idea to include the address for the reception on the back of the program. This will help your guests with traveling from the ceremony to the reception.

If you decide not to use a template, organize the program in chronological order. Begin by introducing the bride a groom, followed by the order of the ceremony, and end with a quick thank you note to all your guests.

, Make sure that you thoroughly edit your program before printing. You don’t want to print 200 copies only to find that you have misspelled the name of your husband-to-be!

, It is a good idea to print your program on a thick paper. A variety of colors and thicknesses are available at your local office supply store. In order to ensure that the formatting and colors are correct, you should print one program first and then make adjustments as needed.


Have your programs printed at a local print shop, if you don't have the supplies to print all of the programs from home.

Include a photo or special design.,
Search for more creative ideas to match your theme.,
Add a touch of elegance to your wedding program by tying a ribbon to the top.,
Place the programs in a lined basket.",How to Make a Wedding Program3," Typically, a wedding will have a particular colour scheme, for example, blush and gold. You may want to match your wedding program to the overall style and colour scheme of your wedding.

, If you find the program is slightly dull with just words, you could add a photo of the bride and groom on the front cover or some sort of special design that matches the theme of your wedding.For example, you may have a country/western themed wedding and a pair of cowboy boots would be a cute addition to the program.

, There are a lot of amazing and creative ideas that can help you come up with a unique wedding program design that matches the theme of your wedding. If you are having a modern formal wedding, try a Google image search for ""formal modern wedding programs.""

,


Punch two holes in the top left corner. The holes should be about 1 1⁄2 inches (3.8 cm) from the edge of the paper. You can place the holes either beside or on top of one another.
Run a thin piece of ribbon up through each hole and tie a small bow on the front.

, Use the same shade of ribbon that was used on the programs to tie a bow onto the basket. Place the basket on the guest registry table.

Consider using online invitations for your wedding announcements.,
When searching for wine themed invitations on these sites, be sure to check the ""wine tasting"" section and ""party"" section, as well as the ""engagement/wedding"" section.,
Find a winery image that you would like to place on your invitations.,
Shop around for small wine-themed stencils or stamps.,
Search online for wedding templates.,
Purchase your paper and envelopes if you have not already.,
Plan out your customization before printing the invitations.,
Set up a stamping or stencil station.,
Customize your invitations.,
Print your wedding invitations if you have not already.,
Repeat the process with the RSVP cards.,
Stamp your envelopes with wine-themed stamps.,
Weigh your entire invite at the post office before buying postage.",How to Make Your Own Wine Themed Wedding Invites," By going to Evite, Ping, Paperless Post or Punchbowl, you can find themed invitations for free or for less. After choosing your template, you can insert your information and save money on cards, envelopes and postage.;
, On most of these templates, you can write the title of your event, so you can personalize most choices.

, It is a good idea to choose 1 image, such as a bottle, vine, wine barrel or wine label to decrease the cost and complexity of your invitation. You can look at clip art online to find examples of good images.

, Using ink or paint to decorate your invitations will afford you customization. Buy ink or acrylic paint in your wedding colors.

, If you are customizing with stamps or stencils, then you can find a template or make your own using a word processing program or another computer program. The following are some good places to look for wedding invitation templates:


Sellers, such as ""I Do"" it Yourself, on the Etsy marketplace provide electronic templates of wedding invitations. You send them the necessary information and they create a graphic design that looks like their samples online. ""I Do"" it Yourself even carries a template featuring a vine for $30. Once you receive the image in pdf or jpg format, you can print it out on your own printer.
Buy a wedding invite kit. These kits include paper, envelopes, embellishments and smaller cards. Most kits allow you to do the printing at home. If you choose a simple kit, then you can embellish with stencils and stamps while getting your paper in a convenient package.
Visit a local paper or stationary shop to inquire about discounts for local paper and wedding invitations. Many of these shops print them for you, which will be at an additional cost, but you may find a good deal on pre-printed, themed wedding invitations.
Gather clip art online and make your own wedding invitation in a word processing program. This option may be the least expensive and the least elaborate.
Ask a graphic designer to make a wine label with your wedding details on it. If this graphic designer can create a jpg image in small and large sizes, you can place it onto your wedding invitations in a software program and then print them. You can also use it for wine bottles at the wedding and on other accents.

, Do not forget to include a smaller RSVP invite and envelope. Choose your paper according to envelope size, because unusual sizes will cost you more in postage.

, You can decide whether you want to layer light images, and print on top of a stamped image, or whether you want to stamp them after printing.

, Practice your placement on scrap paper 10 to 50 times to ensure you will be able to affix the same image on each invitation. Do an entire practice invitation, and try several versions, before starting to stamp or stencil.

, Sit down and stamp or stencil all of the paper at once. Allow it to dry on large tables or pieces of cardboard before continuing.

, You will want to print them before customizing if the process of adding ink or paint makes them hard to bend and move through the printer. Allow the ink to dry well before stuffing them into envelopes.

, Use a smaller wine-themed image for these cards.

, Placing a small bunch of grapes, wine bottle or vine at an edge of the envelope will add extra flair to your invites. Avoid the postage and address areas.

, Try to avoid gluing extra paper on top of the invitation, because it may increase the cost of the entire envelope. Buy postage once you have made your themed invites and you are confident of the cost.

Publish a wedding website.,
Provide welcome bags.,
Use signs.",How to Make Your Wedding Guests Happy1," With a wedding website, you’ll be able to keep all your guests informed about the details of your upcoming wedding. Your website should include the date, time, and addresses of all the events pertaining to the wedding. Wedding-related events might include the bridal shower, wedding rehearsal, the post-wedding reception, and of course the wedding itself.Encourage wedding guests to post their wishes and messages about the wedding to the site.
You can use a social media platform like Facebook to create a wedding events page. Alternately, if you want to get really snazzy with your website and design, you could take advantage of a web publishing platform like Squarespace to help you build a unique wedding website.Make a wedding-specific hashtag that only your guests will use. Encourage them to use it later to tag people at the wedding on social media.;
, Even though the wedding is really all about you, it’s important to thank your guests for coming and show them how much you appreciate them. An easy way to do this is by leaving some gift bags at the hotel where your guests are staying.There are no rules when it comes to what you can and can’t put in your gift bags, but standard items include mints, snacks, and a water bottle.
Think about the personalities of your partner and yourself when adding things to the gift bag. Are there certain items that one of you loves, or always has on hand? For instance, if you always wear sunglasses, you might provide a small pin or magnet depicting sunglasses, or – if you’re going all-out – you could include a real pair of sunglasses for each guest.

, Getting lost en route to the wedding is no fun. If your wedding, reception, or other, related event is in an especially large church or other venue, ensure your wedding guests can quickly and easily get to where they need to be. Include signage that reads something like, “Mike and Jane’s Wedding” accompanied by an arrow.Provide additional signage for branching halls.
You can easily print high-quality signage on a home printer. Many people prefer to use a flowing cursive font for their wedding-related signs.
If you don’t own a home printer, you can get signs printed at a commercial printing business. Contact your local office supply store or printer’s shop for more information.

Plan for the environment.,
Keep the ceremony short.,
Be happy.",How to Make Your Wedding Guests Happy2," If your wedding is outside, you might need to offer objects, apparel, or accommodations that acknowledge the specific venue in which you’re being wed. Think about the environment your wedding will be in and plan accordingly to keep your guests happy.For instance, if you’re getting married on the beach, you should provide your guests with a pair of flip-flops or sandals so they don’t get sand in their fancy shoes.
If your wedding is at a mountain lodge during the winter, you should provide guests with blankets as they make their way into the wedding hall.

, The wedding ceremony itself should be short and sweet. Nobody wants to sit stiffly in uncomfortable seats or benches for longer than necessary. The fun part of the wedding is the reception, so a short wedding ceremony means more time for the fun part.Keep the ceremony under 45 minutes from start to finish.

, The one thing that is guaranteed to make your wedding guests happy is to be happy yourself. Relax, enjoy your wedding, and smile. Think about the many happy years of love and marriage you have ahead of you.Let your guests know you are happy. Say to each guest, “I am so happy that you came. It’s great to see you.”
Find positive ways of dealing with stress. If you’re worried about something going wrong on your wedding day, push the thought away when it emerges in your mind with an opposite thought. For instance, if you think, “The cake will not arrive in time,” recognize the thought and challenge it with a though like, “Everything will proceed as I have planned.” Positive thoughts will help you worry less and feel happier.
Even if something goes wrong – like you trip on your way down the aisle – just laugh it off. Contextualize all the minor inconveniences against the joy and happiness of your wonderful marriage.

Make passed drinks available.,
Offer a variety of food.,
Offer extras in the bathroom.,
Allow song requests.,
Surprise your guests.,
Pose for pictures.,
Don’t ask your guests for favors at the last minute.,
Be authentic.,
Write your guests a thank-you note.",How to Make Your Wedding Guests Happy3," Many people like to drink alcohol at weddings. You can avoid long lines at the bar if you provide passed drinks – an arrangement in which drink are brought around by the waitstaff on a platter or in a cart. Your guests can then choose what they want as the drinks come around to them., Some of your guests might have special dietary needs. For instance, you might have guests who cannot consume gluten, or who choose not to eat dairy, eggs, or meat. You might also have guests with allergies to peanuts, soy, or another allergen. In order to ensure all your guests can find something they want to eat, provide options that allow everyone to dine together and enjoy themselves.Provide ingredient labels in front of baked or cooked dishes identifying what is in each item.

, Your wedding guests might need to step into the bathroom to adjust their wardrobe or fix their makeup, among other reasons. Provide a small basket at the front of each bathroom in the reception hall with bandages of varying sizes, mints, a miniature sewing kit, and other items you think might be useful., Tell your DJ to be flexible and prepared to accept song requests. If your guests want to hear a certain song, encourage them to speak with the DJ. If your guests can hear a special song, they’ll be able to have lots of fun dancing and singing along.You can solicit song requests via your wedding website, or just ask your friends to make a list of a few songs they’d like to hear during the reception.

, There are several options for surprising your guests at the reception. For instance, you could hire a group of singers and have them dress as waitstaff or guests. You could also sing a song with your new spouse. Giving your guests a pleasant surprise performance will add an element of whimsy and you’re your wedding memorable., Guests will love the opportunity to document the wedding by taking lots of pictures with you and your spouse (both separately and together). If you have a large wedding, especially, it can be hard to make the rounds with everyone and pose for all the pictures. But you will make your guests very happy if you allow them to take pictures of or with you.Plus, all the free photography means you’ll have loads of pictures to choose from later when your friends post the images online.
Encourage your friends to tag you in the pictures they take of the wedding events.

, If you ask friends or guests for favors well in advance of the wedding, they’ll almost definitely be pumped to help you. But if you wait until the reception is winding down, they’ll probably be tired, tipsy, and worn out after the whole wedding ordeal. If you need help breaking down tables, setting up chairs, or doing any other sort of arranging or decorating for the wedding events, request their assistance at least a week before the wedding.The best people to ask for help are immediate family members, maids of honor, and best men.

, Everything from the food to the decorations to the vows should be personal and unique to you and your spouse. Don’t get an extravagant five-tiered cake if that’s not who you are as a couple. Don’t go for a giant reception with tons of drinking if you and your spouse are bookish types that don’t even like drinking. If your guests see you and your spouse having fun together and can see the heart and soul you’ve put into the wedding and reception, they will enjoy themselves and cherish the experience they got to share with you., After your wedding is done, write each guest a sincere thank you-note. Thank your guest not only for attending the wedding, but for the gifts they gave you at the reception.You can buy thank-notes in bulk from a printer’s shop or wedding supplies retailer.

Decide if you want to customize cigar labels and order them.",How to Include Celebratory Cigars at Your Upcoming Wedding," Address together any concerns either of you may have regarding offering cigars at your wedding before moving forward with it.;
, The most elaborate way is to host a cigar rolling activity during the reception. You can hire a specialty company that will travel to your event, provide their own cigar rolling supplies and do the actual cigar rolling demonstration. The cigar roller, typically dressed in authentic Dominican attire and straw hat, will interact with your guests and offer a hand rolled cigar to each participating guest to enjoy at wedding or at a later time. Another option is to host a cigar bar in an area near the reception area where you offer cigars for guests so they can enjoy them there and mingle with other cigar smokers. The simplest option is to provide a celebratory cigar as part of a thank you gift as guests are leaving the wedding.

, If you are hiring a specialty company to do the cigar rolling demonstration or host a cigar bar, reserve them as soon as you can. If you are hosting a cigar bar yourself or giving out cigars, decide who will be responsible for fulfilling that task.

, Some good cigar brands to buy for the masses for weddings in particular are Roly and Baccarat. Another good choice is the Saint Luis Rey Rothchilde, which cost about $50 a box for 25 cigars. While ordering your cigars, don’t forget to include cigar cutters to have available as well.

, Personalized cigar labels with the wedding date and the bride and groom’s name is a nice touch especially at a wedding. Ask the specialty company who is doing your cigar rolling demo or cigar bar if they can coordinate this for you or if you need to order them online yourself. If you are doing the cigar bar or giving cigars as part of a thank you gift, you can find several companies online that specialize in customized cigar labels. While ordering cigar labels, also consider ordering personalized matches to have available at the wedding or included in bags with the cigars.

For example, if the wedding is held in a church, the ceremony booklet may refer guests to the pew hymnals.
List the name, source and authorship of any readings, as well as the name of each reader.
Include words to all prayers or sung responses. For example, if the congregation will recite the Lord's Prayer as part of a Christian wedding ceremony, include the words to the prayer in the ceremony program. If Holy Communion will be part of a Catholic wedding ceremony, include the sung responses in the ceremony bulletin. This encourages active participation by all wedding guests.
Indicate movements guests will make during the wedding ceremony. For example, note when guests stand, sit or kneel during the ceremony.
Provide explanations for religious and cultural traditions, rituals or customs featured in the ceremony. Write a brief explanation, including the history and background of the ritual and why it is significant to your wedding, to inform guests who do not share your culture or religion.

Estimate how many wedding ceremony programs to make.,
Design the personal wedding ceremony booklet.,
Purchase paper and supplies to make the personal wedding ceremony booklet.,
Assemble the personal wedding ceremony booklet.,
Present the personal wedding ceremony booklets.",How to Make a Personal Wedding Ceremony Booklet2," Most wedding etiquette experts suggest providing 1 ceremony program per couple and 1 per single guest. Plan to make at least 20 extras as keepsakes for the wedding party and family members.

, There are several different options for wedding booklet formats, such as a tri-fold brochure, single piece of large cardstock or multi-page booklet. The wedding booklet should coordinate with the wedding invitations and other stationery.


Utilize a publishing or word processing software program to design the wedding booklets. Some programs include design templates for wedding programs and other similar printed pieces.
Incorporate colors, graphic elements and fonts that coordinate with or complement the wedding invitations. If your wedding has a theme, use the wedding ceremony booklet to carry out the theme. For example, if your wedding incorporates a beach theme, include seashell graphics on the ceremony program. If you wedding colors are black and white, consider wrapping the ceremony booklets with a black satin ribbon.

, Office supply and paper vendors offer many types of paper in different weights and colors. Select a paper that is appropriate for the type of booklet you are making. For example, if you are making a multi-page booklet, choose a mid-weight paper that folds easily, rather than a heavy cardstock. If you are creating a 1-page panel card, your best choice would be a cardstock that won't bend easily. Ask your local paper supplier about the best paper choice for your booklet design.


Purchase any other supplies required to make the wedding ceremony booklets. If you are using ribbon to hold a multi-page booklet together, purchase the ribbon. Don't forget other supplies that may be necessary, such as paper trimmers, scissors, adhesive and hole punches. If you will be printing the booklets using your home printer, be sure to purchase extra ink cartridges.

, Depending on how labor-intensive your wedding ceremony booklet is, assembling the programs can take a few minutes or a few hours. Consider asking your family or bridal party to help you assemble the booklets.

, Because wedding programs can be any shape or size, the presentation may vary. Consider filling a wicker basket, antique tray or glass bowl with the booklets, and place them at the entrance to your ceremony venue.


Ask a family member or friend to greet wedding guests as they arrive and hand out the wedding ceremony booklets. This ensures that each couple gets 1 booklet and you won't run out of booklets before all of the guests arrive. Ushers tend to be busy seating guests, so a designated greeter or program attendant is helpful in distributing the booklets.

Enter the invitation text inside each card.",How to Make a Simple Handmade Wedding Invitation," Make a large workspace area available for your wedding invitation crafting.;
,,


Create a template rectangle (or square if you are looking for a square shape). This should be made on very thick cardboard so that it can be drawn around again and again. Cutting up a cardboard box is ideal.
Create a slightly smaller template for the feature piece of paper which will sit over the top of the heavy card. This template should stop several inches each side of the card it will be sitting on. See photo for example.

, Do as many invitations as you require, plus some spares. Using scissors or a precision cutting machine, cut the cards neatly. Do the same for the feature piece.

,, Smooth out any bubbles or wrinkles. Before you get the hang of this, you may need to pencil in the exact placement of the feature piece in order to ensure that it remains even on each card. The more cards that you make, however, the more intuitive this will become.

,, See photo above for example. Make as many of these bows as you have cards.

, This will be the front of your card. Allow to dry.

, If you have a calligraphy pen, this will make it appear very elegant. Another alternative is to prepare a printed insert and attach it to the inner side of each card. This is faster and you do not have to worry about making mistakes or keeping straight.

, Get a piece of pre-cut material and lay it with the side you want to see face up on the table. Place the burlap on top (adhesive side down) and center it on the material. When centered, hold the burlap in place and flip over. Use the iron on the back of the fabric to heat up the adhesive so that it attaches the burlap to the fabric. Do this for all five pieces.

, Attach adhesive to the ribbon and after the adhesive cools, take off the white paper like before and attach the ribbon to the fabric.

, These holes should be placed at the top of the banner on the fabric at equal intervals with the first and last holes being cut above the edge of the burlap on each side. Don't worry that the holes will be too large because you're going to hot glue the twine in place. You need to measure out about 15 feet (4.6 m) of twine just to be sure you have enough (you can always cut off excess later). Leave a few feet of excess twine for holding. Starting with the first number in your banner, take the twine and thread it through the holes from top to bottom as seen in the picture below. In the middle tie a bow and continue to thread the twine in the same manner so both sides match. Leave a bit of space between each banner piece and continue threading the banner through and adding bows. Be sure to leave another few feet of twine at the other end of the banner for holding. After finishing all pieces use a hot glue gun to hot glue the twine to the back of the fabric and on the knot in the bow to keep it from coming undone.

, It looks amazing and you saved a ton.

Display your centerpieces.",How to Make a Citrus Slice Centerpiece1," One beautiful way to integrate citrus slices into your centerpiece is to line the inside of a clear vase with citrus rounds and place another, smaller clear vase that holds a flower arrangement inside the first vase. To begin making this arrangement, find two clear flower vases, making sure one of which is small enough to fit inside the other.Make sure that the vases are a similar shape but have different diameters. For instance, you can use two cube shaped vases, or two cylindrical vases.
The vases should be of similar or equal height, but one vase's diameter should be about one inch (2.54 cm) smaller than the other vase's diameter so it can be comfortably placed within the larger vase.;
, Before getting to the citrus element of the centerpiece, first pick out flowers to arrange in the smaller vase. Consider the size of the smaller vase when estimating the number of flowers you will need. If the vase has a small diameter, you may need 10 or so flowers, depending on their size, to fill the vase. If you have a larger vase, you may need more.If you have no idea how many flowers you will need, buy inexpensive fake flowers that you can use to fill the vase and help give you some idea of how many real flowers you will need.

, Use a mix of flowers in your arrangement so that it looks interesting and dynamic. Use a few colors that compliment each other, as well as a few different types of flowers to give your arrangements texture and variety. Ask your florist for advice on which colors and flowers look good together, or find inspiration from bridal catalogs or pictures of floral arrangements on the Internet.

Consider what kind of citrus fruit you will be using before choosing the colors of your flowers. For instance, if you are using orange slices, you may consider adding a few orange flowers to compliment the orange slices.
Because citrus slices give this arrangement a summery look, consider using light colors and pastels to keep with the summery theme.

, Once you have a sense of what flowers you want and how many you will need, decide if you want to buy the flowers yourself and arrangement them or entrust this to a florist. Depending on what florist you choose, having a florist make the arrangements may not be much more expensive than buying all the flowers individually, and it could save you stress if you are making many separate arrangements. Once you have decided, pay for the flowers and arrange to pick them up the morning of the event., The morning of your wedding, dinner, or whatever event you are planning, get the flowers from your florist or floral vendor. Fill the smaller vase with about 3 inches (7.62 cm) of water, then set up the arrangements in each small vase.You may decide to do the same arrangement in each vase, or do a few different arrangements, depending on how consistent you want your centerpieces to look.

, Once you finish making your floral arrangement in the small vases, place each small vase into one of the larger vases. Try to center the small vases inside the large vases so that there is an equal amount of space on all sides of the small vases., Take several lemons, limes, or oranges, and slice them into ½ inch (1.27 cm) rounds. Try to slice the citrus right before the event, a few hours at most, so that the citrus fruit still looks fresh and vibrant when displayed.Make sure to slice the fruit the morning of as opposed to far in advance so that the fruit stays fresh and beautiful.

, After you slice the citrus rounds, drop the rounds in the small space between the two vases, stacking the rounds on all sides of the vase until they fill the vase and obscure the stems of the flowers., Once you add the citrus rounds, your centerpiece is complete! Place your centerpieces on tables, and even add whole citrus fruits on the table around the arrangements to give your centerpieces an extra touch!"

Select wide candles to decorate.,
Slice your citrus fruits into rounds.,
Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F (121.11 C).,
Bake the citrus slices for two hours.,
Glue the dried citrus slices to the candles.,
Add additional ornaments to the candles.,
Arrange the candles in clusters.",How to Make a Citrus Slice Centerpiece2," Another great use of citrus slices in a centerpiece is to dry them and use them to decorate large candles. These centerpieces are great for great for fall or winter events, and give your tables an intimate and romantic feel. Select as many large candles as you need, keeping in mind that you may want a few candles for each centerpiece.Choose squat, wide candles that have a lot of space to decorate.
Use neutral color candles, or candles that compliment the deep yellow, orange or green colors of the dried citrus fruit. Consider using deep colors like burgundy or dark purple, especially if you are using them for a fall or winter event like a Thanksgiving dinner or a fall wedding.

, Begin making these centerpieces by slicing your citrus fruit of choice into 1/8 inch (0.31 cm) rounds. You'll likely need 5-10 rounds per candle, depending on the size of the candle. You may decide to use one kind of citrus fruit, or a mixture of lemons, limes and oranges for extra color., To begin the drying process, preheat the oven to 250 degrees F (121.11 C). Place a wire rack on top of a cookie sheet, then place the citrus rounds on top of the wire rack.Placing the citrus rounds on top of the wire rack as opposed to directly on the cookie sheet allows them to dry thoroughly.
Drying the citrus rounds deepens the color of the fruit and preserves the slices so that you can make these centerpieces well in advance.

, Once the oven has preheated, place the tray of citrus slices inside and let them dry for two hours. After two hours, take the tray out of the oven and let the slices cool.If the slices still aren’t dry after a few hours, turn the oven off and leave the citrus slices inside overnight. By the next morning, the slices should be dry.

, One the citrus slices have cooled, apply hot glue to one side of the citrus slices and glue them to the wide candles. Use several citrus slices on each candle, overlapping them or spacing them as you please.Don’t apply hot glue directly to the candle, as the heat can melt the wax.

, You don’t need to stop at the citrus slices when you decorate your candles; you can also add other decorative elements like dark leaves, herbs, beads or ribbon to offset the color of the citrus fruit., Once you are done decorating the individual candles, place the candles in groups of two’s or three’s on the table or surface you are decorating. Consider adding leaves, sprigs of herbs, or dried flowers around the candle clusters to add another visual element to the centerpieces. Light the candles or leave them unlit so that you can use these centerpieces again!"

Cut the orange rinds into twists.,
Fill a standard size Mason jar with water.,
Add the orange twist and various herbs to the water.,
Add a floating candle to the top of the water.,
Arrange the centerpieces and light the candles.",How to Make a Citrus Slice Centerpiece3," Begin creating the orange twists by cutting off the bottom of the orange and placing it on a cutting board. Use a paring knife to begin making a slice into the orange in a downward motion at the top of the fruit. Make sure the cut is shallow so it doesn’t cut through to the meat of the orange. Keep making the slice in a long continuous strip, moving the paring knife around the orange to cut the rind in a loop. Stop cutting when you reach the bottom of the orange.Cut as many orange twists as you want centerpieces. You will likely need a new orange for each twist.

, Once you have finished making the twists, fill a standard sized clear Mason jar, about the size of a juice glass, with water until about an inch (2.54 cm) below the rim of the jar. This will be the base for the floating candle., Place the orange twist into the water of the Mason jar, then add any attractive herbs or decorations you would like.

Herbs like rosemary sprigs and cinnamon sticks add color and texture to the centerpiece.
You can be creative and add any decorations that you wish, even things like marbles or pebbles.

, Once you have finished adding the orange rind and other decorative elements to the water, place a small floating candle on top of the water.You can get floating candles at standard department stores or at art supply stores.

, When you are ready to display the centerpieces, place them on the table as you wish. Sprinkle sprigs of herbs or flowers around the base of the Mason jars, then light the candles and enjoy your dinner or event by the soft light of these beautiful centerpieces."

",How to Have a Cowboy Themed Wedding," Keep in mind that a cowboy themed wedding will lean towards the natural, so unless you are think bright red hats and kerchiefs and black boots, plan to use lots of muted browns along with whatever ""signature"" colors you choose.;
, For the perfect cowboy themed wedding, think of an outdoor location. Try selecting a date in late spring, summer or early fall. Remember, if you choose a summer date it can storm or be extremely hot midday so plan accordingly.

, Choose a wedding site that reflects your theme. Perhaps there is a lovely outdoor site where you can have the ceremony with a lodge, cabin or barn that would be appropriate for the reception. If you cannot find a suitable location in your area or price range, find a space with a large amount of prairie acreage and rent a large white tent.

, Choose food that is innately ""cowboy."" One big advantage to this is that almost any local barbecue joint that caters will likely have the perfect menu. Be sure to inquire about what kind of serving ware they will use and what kinds of place settings they offer if this is important to you.

, Choose a cake in your colors and add cowboy embellishments. Choose a topper with a cowgirl lassoing her man. Ask the baker if she can make cream cheese mints in the shapes of cowboy boots, hats and horseshoes.

, Hire a country band or select a song list for the DJ that reflects your down home style. Select you and your significant other's favorite country tune for your first dance and other important dances.

, Choose a dress for yourself that reflects your haute cowgirl-esque style! Find a garter embellished with a horseshoe pendant (or add one yourself) for good luck. Select suits for the men and choose bolero ties. Ask them to wear cowboy hats and boots that match the suits, and ask them to buy a matching belt on which they can put their favorite big buckle. Choose cute sundress-style dresses for the ladies. For the hair, flowers might be a nice touch for that natural feel. Also ask the maids to wear boots or to change into boots for the reception, if desired. Be sure to find a cute new pair of boots for yourself too!

, For a cowboy themed wedding, go with flowers that evoke nature. Messy bouquets of ""wildflowers"" would be perfect.

, Round up old cowboy boots and put slim vases with water inside of them. Fill them with wildflower bouquets. Find old horseshoes and large belt buckles and lay them on the tables around the flower arrangement. Buy cowboy boot place card holders and put boot, hat, or horseshoe embellished place cards in them. Hang a pair of horseshoes on the alter with the flowers for good luck. Place old cowboy hats on the buffet and cake tables for decoration. Turn old cowboy hats upside down and line a with a clear glass bowl and use to serve mints and nuts on the cake table.

, Choose cowboy-themed Toasting Glasses, Cake Knife, and Server Set. Find or have made a leather bound Guest Book (maybe embellished with your names and date). Buy a real wood Pen. Embellish the Ring Pillow and Flower Girl Basket with horseshoe or cowboy hat pendants. Create or buy an Aisle Runner in your theme (stencils and paint on a cheap standard runner would work great!).

, The stationary set you choose sets the stage for your event so make sure guests know that your hitchin' will be a hoedown for the ages. Start with save the dates in a traditional ""wanted"" poster style that read: ""Wanted: A posse to witness the hitchin' of..."" Send invites on recycled paper (maybe even wildflower seed embedded) with natural edges. Create programs to match.

, Nothing says ""cowboy"" better than riding on horseback or behind a horse-drawn carriage to the reception.

Choose a suitable wedding location.,
Find your reliable caterer well in advance.,
Consider your budget.,
Plan the menu.,
Plan the tableware additions with an Eco-friendly touch.,
Consider your wedding clothing.,
Choose locally grown, organic flowers.",How to Hold a Vegan Wedding," Being vegan doesn't preclude you from choosing the same places as non-vegan wedding parties but you might wish to reflect your love of nature, the outdoors, or similar in your choice. It is also important to take into account the ease with which your guests can get to the wedding location and reception, and any personal preferences.


A vegan wedding in an organic garden is a nice touch for those who love gardening and local, fresh food.
A vegan wedding in a garden, a park, or botanical gardens can also serve as an expression of your love of nature and being outside.
Consider whether you will hold the wedding and reception in the same location, or apart. The same location means a lot less travel and hassles for all the guests, increasing the simplicity. Garden weddings work well for this option.;
, You will need to find caterers able to make good quality vegan food, including substitute foods, so planning well ahead of time is important. Things to consider include:


Look for a suitable caterer. It must be someone sympathetic to your dietary needs and wedding wants, even if they cook vegan food most of the time.
Don't overlook non-vegan caterers. Many excellent caterers have very able chefs capable of cooking vegan food. You might have to do a little more of the suggestion work and research, but that's probably something you're already used to and prepared for with a wedding anyway. In some ways, it's good to have such a level of control when it's a personal, special event.
Be sure you are happy that your caterer and venue are open-minded and happy to work with your preferences. Otherwise, keep looking.

, The budget for wedding tends to be half the cost of the wedding if you are serving a meal for guests.A vegan wedding can cut these costs but not necessarily. If, like Chelsea Clinton, you are catering for vegans, vegetarians, and organically based meat meals, your costs can actually increase trying to spread your menu so far.Remember that anything specialized will cost more money, especially if your caterer is not familiar with vegan food styles, or if you're asking the caterer to prepare ""substitute"" style foods that match traditional wedding options.
If you're happy to keep the menu plain, on the other hand, it is possible to make this a lower cost part of your overall wedding costs.
Think seasonal and local. Many vegans are attuned to the buy local (the average meal travels 1500 miles)and eat seasonally ethos and this can keep down the costs too. Locally purchased food supports local farmers and guarantees very fresh food too. It really depends on how many ""dreams"" you already have about the ""perfect"" wedding food!
Think organic. Do you want the food to be all organic, some organic, or doesn't this concern you at all? The choice will vary the cost, with organic food being the most pricey most times.
Consider the food style. The budget varies widely depending on the method by which the food is provided, with sitting down for a full meal being the most expensive. Your choices include a sit-down, buffet, picnic, cocktail party, breakfast, brunch, supper, punch and cake only, etc. This decision rests with your budget and preferences.

, Once you've decided on the caterer and the budget, plan the menu in detail. If possible, aim for a lot of variety as this can excite guest's enthusiasm to try different foods and discover the many wonderful possibilities of vegan food.


Consider the main course (entrée) food. Ideas include wonderfully fresh salads with edible flowers, delectable soups with brilliant colors, and delicious main courses from sizzling Mongolian vegetables to Teriyaki tofu. Have a look through wikiHow's Vegan Recipes for ideas to help you to get started. The principal point to always keep in mind is that the food must taste good!

It's a really good idea to get out all of your favorite vegan cookbooks and choose the recipes that appeal to you most - it's a great opportunity to finally try some of those harder ones you'd never make normally. Equally, it's a good idea to have a practice run of each recipe you're unsure about, in small quantities - sit down with your caterer, show him or her the recipes and work from there.
Have a vegan cake made. You could have a vegan cupcake wedding cake made, or a more traditional style of cake made without eggs, dairy, etc.

, If you are of the vegan ethos, there are many things requiring consideration, as you will probably be attuned to Eco-friendly options.


Look for reusable cutlery, plates, tablecloths, etc.
Use recycled paper for anything that you can't have in a reusable form.
Use natural items such as flowers or food as the cake topper rather than plastic objects.
Consider wedding favors with care. Think edible favors such as homemade biscotti, candies, or cookies; homemade preserves or sauce beautifully wrapped in recycled cloth or paper, etc. Think of recycled objects from candles to cookie cutters. Or simply do away with having favors at all., It isn't all about the food. It's also about other wedding items, including the all-important clothing. Some of the things to be aware of include:


Look for a wedding dress that does not cause harm. This means that silk is not a suitable material. For some vegans, even wool is not suitable.
Find suitable false leather shoes, gloves, etc., to accompany the dress. There are pleather and other choices available. Do an online search if you can't find stockists locally.
Depending on the depth of your vegan ethos, you might wish to consider avoiding wearing anything made from animals such as pearl, antique ivory, bone, etc. The challenge here is not in avoiding purchasing such items as you will probably already be carefully scrutinizing what everything is made from but is more likely to arise when family members pass on traditional items that they'd like you to wear. Weigh your values carefully, as your family's wishes are well-meaning.
If you like pearls, look for human-made (faux pearls) versions.

, For centerpieces, bouquets, and decoration, aim to source your flowers in season, locally and organic.

Get all your needs sorted with respect to the wedding.,
Determine how much to budget for your reception entertainment.,
Establish the theme of the wedding.,
Compile a list of possible DJ choices.,
Be sure that your choices specialize in wedding receptions.,
Make a shortlist of at least five qualifying disc jockeys.,
Make sure that the DJ/MC is clean cut and has excellent verbal skills.,
Make contact with the disc jockeys.,
Check the terms and conditions of hiring the DJ.,
Sign a written contract (written agreement).",How to Hire a Disc Jockey for Your Wedding," Establish the venue of the wedding, the date on which the wedding will take place and the length of time the disc jockey will be expected to play. This information is crucial to knowing the costs involved. In terms of the venue, it is always preferable to know the estimated size of the venue.;
, Expect to spend anywhere from £600.00 or equivalent in your currency to £1,500.00 or equivalent for an experienced wedding DJ with good equipment and decent references.


You can get a good idea of what you may require by making inquiries about the cost of booking a room in local hotels. An allowance has to be made for meals and a few other requests as well.
Another cost that will have to be factored in is the airfare for the DJ and this is before you can even think about the booking fees for the performance.
You will also need to establish the arrangements that are in place with regards to a PA system for the wedding. DJs can come with their own Public Address systems although this will cost you more especially if the DJ has to be flown in. A good arrangement is for the DJ to bring only his or her turntables, consoles or laptop and simply plug into an available PA system.







, If possible, get some input from the wedding couple and planner on the theme, mood or intended feel of the wedding. This will give you an idea of the preferred DJs.

, Use the internet, yellow pages, bridal shows, or get the names of some DJs who performed at your friends' or relatives' weddings who did a good job.

, A good club DJ can be an awful wedding DJ unless he or she is an experienced wedding DJ also. Same goes for radio DJs: Unless you have wedding experience, the shows are very different from radio and club DJing. A good DJ can match his or her crowd. Some things to consider include:


Try to work with DJs who are local to your location. The closer the better. You will find literally hundreds of DJs within 60 miles (97 km) of your home in many cases.






The fact that your DJ is part-time or full-time is not as important as how many weddings that DJ has performed at and their references.






DJ brokers/agencies and large DJ companies: They can offer usually two levels of quality, one being high-quality DJs (but you need to see a video performance and check references prior to hiring them and make sure that is the DJ guaranteed in contract), and two: the ones that do not tell you who the DJ will be are usually the ones that sub-contract low quality DJs, but if you don't care about the low price then maybe you don't care about the quality too.






Be careful hiring friends and family unless they are true professionals in the industry and you have reviewed their references, contract and performance live or on video, just as you would someone you did not know. A contract is especially important for hiring friends or family.






When you begin to contact possible DJ companies, ask to speak directly with the DJ who would be at your wedding before you agree to anything or put down a deposit. The person on the phone may be outgoing and experienced but your actual DJ may be a dud. If the company says they will assign you a DJ, then you probably only care about low price and it will be probably a DJ who matches that price and quality that you will get.







, In making this selection, the overriding consideration must be for a DJ who is capable of complementing every other aspect of the wedding to bring out an event that will be talked about for many years and remain etched in the hearts and minds of the guests and wedding couple.


Go online to the bbb.com (better business bureau) and check your town to make sure there are no complaints or how their company handles complaints, if there are any. They need not be a member but should not have any negative comments or major issues.






Check videos of prior shows. Video clips of a company in action are okay but multiple clips of your exact DJ is what you want. Some companies ""fake"" a party to get good video but 90% of the companies are legit video clips. Always contact the last five events references by phone to make sure you are getting a good DJ. You can tell if the crowd is naturally reacting to the DJ or if the whole thing is ""faked"".







, This is a wedding, not a mosh pit.

, You can do this by going through celebrity booking agents in Washington who are easily found on the internet and have a wide selection of disk jockeys of all calibers. To make a successful booking you must always endeavor to be realistic and stick within your budget especially if it is not very flexible. As a general rule, it is always wise to ask the agent to include the airfare in the booking charges so that you are left with the obligation of booking the hotel, meals and any other requests.

, It is a wise idea to always have a look at the terms and conditions shown on the website and, if possible, to make a hard copy of the page. Some of the things to watch out for include:

Make sure the DJ you consider hiring has on-site back ups of everything. Get it in writing. They must have a back up of every single cord in their system as well as a back up amp, computer or CD player.






This is so important and you should not even consider a DJ who will not indicate the back up equipment in writing.








Watch out for add-on costs. Weddings should include lighting and it should not be an add-on cost. Additional legitimate charges for extras would be for something like video screens, spotlight, projectors, karaoke etc.






If your DJ uses banner advertising at your event, make sure you are okay with that. The best option is to have business cards on the corner of the table.






Deposit requirements. Typical deposits are non-refundable and about $200.00 or equivalent, or 25%, whichever is higher.






Payment expectations. Full-time professional companies will ask for the balance paid one week in advance. Collecting the money the night of the reception can be tricky especially after alcoholic beverages are served.







, After you're sure you're satisfied with your choice and the costs involved, the next best thing is to enter into a written contract with the agency to secure a booking and make the necessary payments.


Make copies of your contract and avoid getting verbal commitments that are not reflected in the written contract. If there are any verbal commitments or variations from the written word they must be conformed in writing through an email or otherwise.
The contract must indicate date, times, promises, when they will be set up by, and things important to you.






A DJ should always be set up completely at least 30 minutes prior to the first guest arriving into the area they are performing within.

Determine whether you will buy or bake the cookies.,
Buy multiple store-bought brands and mix them up.,
Try custom fortune cookies.,
Go classic with custom monogrammed sugar cookies.,
Opt for tuxedo and gown cookies.,
Use two to five cookies per favor.,
Wrap them in cellophane with a romantic quote.,
Use mini cookie jars.,
Put the cookies in decorated mini boxes.,
Stack white-icing sugar cookies to look like mini wedding cakes.,
Put the favors at your guests’ place settings at the reception.,
Hand out the favors personally as you work the room.,
Set up a cookie buffet at the reception.",How to Give Cookie Wedding Favors," Cookies are a cost-effective choice whether you bake or buy them, but baking is certainly the cheaper of the two options. If you or your fiancée enjoy baking and want to add a very personal touch to your wedding favors, baking your own cookies may be the way to go. If you prefer to buy them, you can purchase store-bought cookies or hire a baker to do custom cookies for you., If you’re short on time or money, this approach may be ideal for your wedding. Buy different brands that come in a variety of colors and shapes to make an eye-catching blend. You could also group together the cookies that reflect your wedding colors and assemble them as favors.For example, you could buy an array of macaroons that match your wedding colors and give those out. If you want something simpler, buy all-white macaroons.Ask your fiancée if they have a favorite cookie brand from childhood, or think about cookies that the two of you love eating together. Using cookies that have sentimental value will make it feel more special.

, Adapt these cookies for your wedding by including custom “fortunes” inside. You can hand write or print out romantic lines of poetry, or make up your own romantic “fortunes.” The cookies are quite easy to make at home, and then you just slip the fortunes in after they’ve cooled. The size of the fortunes will vary somewhat depending on your cookies, but in general they should be about six inches long and ½ inch wide.You can make vanilla or chocolate fortune cookies (or both), depending on your preference. They can also be purchased in a rainbow of colors.If you don’t want to make them yourself, you can order fortune cookies online from vendors who will insert custom fortunes for you.
These are usually packaged up with two cookies per favor.

, Sugar cookies are easy to make and decorate yourself using icing, but you can also hire a baker to create this classic look. You can do any color of icing under the sun, so have the cookies match your wedding colors or do something different altogether.Package two iced cookies back to back, wrap them in cellophane and then tie off the ends with matching ribbon for a simple and classic wedding favor., Another wedding classic, these are usually sugar or molasses cookies that are iced to look like mini wedding gowns and tuxedos. Square cookies will work for the tuxes, and a simple dress shape can be used for the gowns. You can ice them as elaborately or as simply as you like. You can do these yourself, or hire a baker to do them.These are packaged up with two cookies -- one gown cookie and one tux cookie -- per favor.

, This will vary slightly depending on the size of your cookies and what presentation you want to go with, but in general, aim for somewhere between two and five. Large cookies are usually packaged as pairs, whereas medium and small cookies are usually packaged anywhere from three to five per favor.Ultimately, it's up to you, but two is generally considered the minimum.

, This is by far the easiest (and most popular) method, since it can be done at home and costs very little. There are many different ways to customize the presentation, such as using colorful cellophane and getting creative with the ribbons or other materials used to tie off the ends of each favor.Customize them even more by writing or printing out special messages and tucking them inside before sealing the favor.
If you don't want to use cellophane, consider using tiny organza bags, or wrapping them in taffeta or some other special material.

, Mini glass cookie jars can be purchased online and add a charming quality to your wedding favors. These jars are small enough to fit in the palm of your hand, so the cookies you put in them will have to also be small. Mini cookie jars are a great way to dress up store-bought cookies. Once your guests have consumed the cookies, they can reuse the jars.Add personal touches and embellishments to make the jars even more special. For instance, dress up the jars with ribbon-tied tags, or print out homemade labels to affix to the jars.

, Tiny boxes made of sturdy paper can be purchased at craft stores and customized in any way you want. You could stamp them with your initials or add embellishments like ribbons, custom labels and tags. Stack between two and four cookies inside the box and secure it with ribbon or burlap.For a personal touch, you could include little cards inside with hand written or printed messages.

, You’ll need three sugar cookies in one size to form the base, three slightly smaller ones to form the next layer, and two even smaller ones to form the top layer of the “wedding cake.” Package them in small glassine boxes so the cute cakes are visible. Tie a ribbon around the box as a final touch.You can buy small glassine boxes at most craft stores or online. If you’re having a very large wedding, you may want to order online so you can get discounted bulk pricing on the boxes.

, If you plan to give one favor per guest, place a favor at each place setting. You could also create a centerpiece of favors at each table and allow your guests to choose the one they want. If your guests have assigned seats, you can customize the favors with their names.For a special touch, incorporate the favors into the table decorations.

, You’ll be speaking to everyone at the reception at some point or another, so this is a good opportunity to greet your guests, hand them a wedding favor and thank them for coming. If you have too many guests for this to be feasible, instruct the wait staff to present the favors at each table during the dessert course.For an extra special touch, have the wait staff present the favors on silver lined trays.

, If you want to do something really different, or if you want to avoid packaging favors yourself, set up a cookie buffet at your reception. Offer five or six different cookie varieties and display them in large glass jars on the “buffet” table. Set out tongs, glassine-lined bags and seals for packaging and let your guests choose their favorites.Get custom-printed glassine bags and seals for a personal touch and to tie in your wedding theme/colors.

Start saving as soon as possible.,
Determine how much you are willing to contribute.,
Prioritize college and retirement savings.",How to Help Pay for Your Child's Wedding1," If you want to help your child pay for their future wedding, the easiest way to ensure that you have enough money is to begin saving as soon as possible. Once you have the resources, start putting away a little bit of money for your child’s wedding. Talk with your partner about opening a savings account and putting small amounts of money in it to pay for any future weddings.There are a number of different types of savings accounts that you can consider. Check with your local bank or financial institution.Make sure that you are saving equitably for all of your children. Financially favoring one child over another can lead to resentment and animosity in your family.;
, Talk with your partner about how much you will be willing to pay for your child’s wedding. Determine if you want to pay for the entire wedding or just a part of it. Work with your partner to find a price that is within your budget and allows you comfortably save money.The tradition of the bride’s parents paying for everything is outdated and less common today. Instead, the bride’s parents, the groom’s parents, and the bride and groom tend to split the wedding expenses.
You should create a budget with your partner to ensure that you save enough for the future while meeting your current expenses.

, One important factor to remember when saving for your child’s future wedding is prioritizing saving for your child’s college education and your retirement. Make sure that you are adequately saving for these two things before putting any money into a wedding savings account. If your resources are tight, put off saving for a wedding until you can afford it.Your retirement and your child’s education are much more expensive than a wedding and will require as much money as you can save.

If you have multiple children, make sure that you pay for things fairly.


Talk with your partner about a strategy to pay for all of your children’s weddings fairly.
Do not keep these things from your children. They will find out if you are being unfair.

, When it comes time to arrange for the wedding, let your child know how much you are willing to commit. Let your child know if you are giving them a blank check, a fixed amount, or paying for a portion of the wedding. You should also let them know if you are unable to help them financially. Communicating your expectations early will help them plan a wedding that they can afford and that does not put you in debt.Try to have this conversation with the couple and not just your child. It is important that you respect the couple and their autonomy. Communicating to only one member of the pair can be problematic.
Have this conversation early to avoid any misunderstandings or hard feelings with other family members. Make sure that no one has unrealistic expectations of what you are able to contribute.

, If they want your help, you can also offer to help your child budget for the wedding. This can help you put some limits on spending and suggest options that will not break the bank. However, it is important that you let your child plan the wedding. Do not take control and start planning the wedding for them. Your child will resent it.If your child seems put off by a suggestion, walk it back and let them know that it is their wedding.

, If you do not have the resources to finance your child’s wedding, you should not take out a loan, put a large amount of money on a credit card, or dip into your savings. Paying for your child’s wedding is not worth the price of digging yourself a large financial whole. Instead, stay within your means and clearly communicate your contribution to your child.Remember that, in 2015, the average wedding cost $32,641. However, this number varies greatly from place to place., Financing a wedding can sometimes become a competition over whether the bride or the groom’s family can spend more money. This escalation can quickly leave both sides in debt. Instead, stick to your contribution regardless of how much the other family is spending. If your child’s future in-laws want to go over budget paying for things, let them. You are under no obligation to meet any expenses that go beyond the initial budget.


Consider talking with the other parents about how to equitably divide expenses and support the young couple.

Provide a set amount.,
Offer to pay for certain services.,
Let them use your home or property.,
Suggest money saving alternatives.",How to Help Pay for Your Child's Wedding3," One simple strategy to ensure that you do not go outside of your budget is to offer your child a set amount of money and stick to it. Find an amount of money that you are willing to pay and then offer that to your child. This will help you maintain your boundaries and ensure that you do not end up dipping into your savings.For example, if you have saved $10,000 for your child’s wedding, offer them that money up front and let them do what they want with it.

, You can also offer to pay for certain things during the wedding, like food, alcohol or music. Find the things that you want to contribute and that are in your budget. This will help you set clear boundaries and keep you from going over budget.Avoid contributing things that your child does not want. If you suggest hiring a live jazz band and your child shoots it down, do not hire the band and look for another option.
You can even help your child with the wedding planning by offering to take responsibility for something that they are not interested in. For example, if your kid and their partner are not terribly interested in the floral arrangements, you can offer to take care of the flowers for them.

, If your finances are tight but you have a nice property, you might offer to let your child have the wedding and reception there. Hold the ceremony in your large backyard or let the young couple have their reception there. This could save your child thousands of dollars., If you are footing the bill for your child’s wedding, you may want to suggest various methods for saving money on the wedding ceremony and reception. For example, you might suggest that they get married on a Friday or in the winter in order to save money on a venue. Tactfully let your child know about these money-saving ideas so that the wedding does not go over budget.This strategy works best if you have already set a fixed budget for the wedding. Your child might become a little exasperated with you if you give them a blank check for wedding expenses and then begin suggesting ways of cutting back.

If you are doing a destination wedding in Mexico, for example, you may search online for makeup artists who work out of the resort you are staying at in Mexico. You can also look on wedding blogs to see what other people have done makeup wise for their weddings and to look for makeup artists who you like.Many popular wedding planning sites online will have links to recommended makeup artists. Check these links for artists based in your area who might be a good fit for your wedding.
When searching online for makeup artists, always look for referrals and reviews of the artist. Check if the makeup artist has an online portfolio or photo album of their past work for weddings. Flip through the images to see if the makeup artist is a right fit for you.;
, Speak to married family and friends about finding a good makeup artist. You can also reach out to coworkers for recommendations. Focus on any weddings you’ve attended where you’ve loved the makeup. Then, contact the married person and ask them for a referral for their makeup artist.You may ask married family and friends, “I’m looking for a good makeup artist for my wedding. Do you have any suggestions or recommendations?”

, As you start searching for a makeup artist for your wedding, make a list of one to three potential artists you like. Having a list of a few artists will allow you to have some options in the event one artist is unavailable on your wedding day or out of your price range.You may rank one to three makeup artists based on your top choice, then your second choice, and then your third choice.

, Before you hire the makeup artist, set up a brief, free consultation with them. Most makeup artist will invite you to their salon or meet you at a coffee shop to go over your desired look, your wedding budget, and your expectations for the big day. The consultation should be casual and relaxed. You should get a sense of what the makeup artist is like to work with and confirm you have good communication with them.You may book a consultation with more than one makeup artist so you can get a sense of what they are like to work with.
If a makeup artist refuses to agree to a free consultation or meet and greet, this may be a red flag. It is industry standard to offer prospective clients a free consultation before being hired.

, During your consultations with makeup artists, talk to them about their rates for weddings. Discuss the details of their rates as well as their price points for different makeup styles and services. A good makeup artist will be able to offer you several options at different price points. Compare several artists so you can find one who fits your budget.For example, some makeup artists will charge more for doing elaborate eye makeup or for applying fake eyelashes. You should get all the details of the artist’s services so you know what you are paying for before you hire them.

, Refer to your wedding budget and make sure the makeup artist is affordable for you. Ask the makeup artist about their services based on your budget to see if they can accommodate your needs. A good makeup artist will offer you a price point that fits your budget and makes you feel comfortable.A more experienced makeup artist may be more expensive, but they may offer services that you want for your wedding. You may then be able to budget for the more expensive artist. Or you may opt for a makeup artist who is less expensive and still offers services for your wedding look that you want.

, If you need the makeup artist to travel to the wedding, they may charge for mileage or add on a travel fee to their regular fee. Make sure you go over additional expenses for travel with the artist before you book them. Some makeup artist will not charge for travel and some will, especially if the distance is far for them., Once you have chosen a makeup artist you like, arrange for a paid trial where you get a hands on consultation with the artist. The paid trial will usually be at the salon or space the makeup artist works out of. The artist will do a trial run of your wedding makeup so you know what to expect on the big day.Bring any inspirational images that you like to the paid trial as well as any ideas you have for your wedding makeup.
Try to only set up a paid trial with the makeup artist you plan to use for your wedding. Often, the paid trial costs half of what the actual wedding-day makeup will cost.

, If the paid trial goes well, make sure you book the makeup artist right away. Try to book a makeup artist for your wedding at least five to six months before the big day. The makeup artist will require you to sign a contract hiring them for your wedding. The contract should outline all the costs associated with hiring the makeup artist.Keep in mind most makeup artists do not include a tip for their services in the contract. It is considered proper etiquette to tip the makeup artist 15-18% on the day of the wedding if you like their work.

Don't be cheesy or have dad-jokes.,
Start by Introducing yourself and why you are here to speak.,
Thank the guests for coming and taking their time to celebrate with you, your family and your daughter on her special day.,
Tell them about your daughter.,
Tell them about your new son-in-law.,
To conclude toast the new couple and wish them all the happiness and everlasting love you ever wished your daughter to have ever since you first held her as a new-born.,
After the wedding and the honeymoon contact the new couple and thank your daughter for the opportunity to speak and for being your daughter and for being as perfect as she is because she is exactly the way she is meant to be.

",How to Give a Father of the Bride Speech," We have all been to that wedding with the disastrous father of the bride speech where the whole room is dying with embarrassment along with the bride. This is an opportunity to show your daughter your pride in her and the woman she has become. Mark it appropriately and don't distract from it with cheesy one liners.;
, It may be half of the room knows exactly who you are, but the other don't and it is good manners to start any wedding speech with an introduction.

, Remember these guests are there voluntarily and give gifts from their hearts not out of a sense of obligation. It is good manners to thank people for this.

, Make this part appropriate and formal. This is not the time to tell the room about her topless vacation to Cancun or any other embarrassing moments best left for something like a 21st birthday speech. Tell the room about your pride for your daughter and the accomplishments you feel helped make her who she is. Express your love for your daughter and your sadness at her no longer being your little girl with ribbons and curls.

, Again this part should be appropriate and formal. Remember half the room is filled with his guests and family. This is not the time to threaten a meeting with a shot-gun if he breaks your daughter's heart. Be genuine when speaking talk about why you allowed him to marry your daughter and what you like about him or admire.

, Remind them fairy tales do come true and that your daughter was the biggest fairytale to you of them all.

The best way to show your true love is by purchasing a diamond engagement ring with matching wedding bands.,
Check the diamond’s cut.,
Check the clarity.,
Check the Carat weight.",How to Select a Diamond Engagement Ring," Read about the history of diamonds, their popularity in engagement rings in Western culture, and particularly about blood diamonds. You also may want to know how diamonds are priced, i.e. the 4 Cs, Light Behavior, and Cut Grade. Consider the material the solitaire engagement rings can be made of, as for different diamonds there can be a wide range of materials used. Make sure you know these things and it will make your life easier when discussing the price with a jeweler.

, The most important thing in buying a diamond ring is to find a sufficient amount of money. There is a belief that the solitaire engagement rings should cost not lower than two average monthly salaries.

, Classic setting? Pave? Diamond Shape? All good things to know. Would you prefer a classic diamond ring like a solitaire, or a diamond eternity band? Or would you like to have something more modern? Many options are available even in solitaires. Diamond ring is something you are going to wear for the rest of your life, so make sure the style reflects your personality. However, the most preferable style of many solitaire engagement rings is classic, what make rings almost persistent to time, so it can be inherited by many more generations and raise its value in the future.


Observe her jewelry tastes. Weather she prefer traditional or contemporary. You can get many designs in engagement rings. You must consider the size of her hand. If she has small hands, a wide band and bold style will make her hand look even smaller.
Think of her lifestyle. If she lives a very active lifestyle then choose a ring with a low profile to avoid it from losing and destroying. For a woman of fashion it would be better to choose something more original and exclusive what will make her an object of adore among friends and colleagues.

, It’s a vital part of purchase.



Color - It is a myth that all diamonds are colorless. While most diamonds appear white, all include trace amounts of yellow. Colorless diamonds typically hold the most value, with nearly colorless following suit. However, deeply colored fancy diamonds can sometimes cost more than colorless diamonds of the same carat weight. Fancy diamonds are popular in many celebrity engagement rings and come in a variety of colors, such as pink, grey, yellow and orange.

Carat - Diamond size is measured by weight in carats. Prices rise as carat weight increases. Choosing a slightly smaller carat weight, can save you money and still allow you to present your future spouse with a dazzling diamond.

Clarity - Most diamonds have tiny flaws called inclusions, often invisible to the naked eye. Pay special attention to product details when deciding. Most diamonds do contain some blemishes inside the stones and these are what give each diamond its own uniqueness. The most important thing to remember about clarity is that you do not want inclusions to be visible to the naked eye, nor should they be so excessive that they affect the diamond's brilliance or durability.

Clarity is a critical C and has a great effect on the diamond's value. When diamonds are moved up on the clarity scale, you generally see a significant increase in price. The object is to choose a diamond as high on the clarity scale as your budget will allow, while still taking the other C's into account.



Cut - The cut of a diamond determines how well a diamond reflects light to shows its brilliance. A standard report describes cut by the shape or outline of the diamond and the facet arrangement, also known as cutting style. Shapes range from traditional round to hearts, pears, emerald, and more. Choose a shape that reflects the tastes of the person who will wear the stone. Cut becomes very relevant when zeroing down on the choice of diamond. The cut is the result of transforming the diamond into a gem. A better cut will have a great effect on the beauty of the diamond. Diamonds with correct proportions better refract the light out of the top of the stone. Lesser cut diamonds allow some light to escape from the bottom of the stone, resulting in a less brilliant diamond.

Shape - Another factor you need to consider when choosing a diamond is its shape. Although shape and cut are sometimes used interchangeably, they are not the same. Cut refers to the proportions and symmetry. Shape, on the other hand, refers to the actual shape or contour of the diamond. There are 8 popular shapes including: round (also called brilliant cut), Princess cut, Emerald cut, Asscher cut, Marquise cut, Radiant cut, Pear cut, and Heart cut. When you select a shape, the most important factor is simply what appeals to you.

, Before purchasing, check if the diamonds are certified or not. Some of the most accurate/popular diamond grading labs include Precision Gem Grading Laboratory (PGGL), Gemological Institute of America (GIA), European Gemological Laboratory (EGL), and International Gemological Institute (IGI). Only purchase conflict-free diamonds - otherwise someone may have been murdered to bring you the symbol of your love.

, Getting a second opinion on your diamond ring may be essential. Many jewelers today may rip you off and you would have no idea.

, Buying a wedding band along with engagement ring will show your commitment and dedication to go through the marriage. You may think that it is not important, but for your lover it will be everything. Purchasing a set is a good idea because you can save money also.

, The effective cutting pattern is responsible for the best sparkle. A poorly cut diamond simply looks dull.;
, Clarity is an issue of purchase loose diamond. Diamond with little inclusion is recommended also they have a high value.

, The weight of diamond is measured in carats. Diamond values are dependent on its weight.

, If you want one-stop shopping where you can find in-house catering, bartenders, and waitstaff, go for a venue that’s known for receptions.

Or if you’re the homebody sort, this would be a good venue in which to feel comfortable.


If you don’t have a large home, no problem! Throw an open house party over the course of a day or evening so your guests can come in and out as they please.Utilize any large, open spaces in your home, such as a big backyard.

Want to invite loads of people? Etiquette nowadays allows you to invite people you might not invite to the wedding. So long as you can find a venue large enough, the sky’s the limit!Some venues will require a minimum amount of guests so this is good to know before beginning your search.

, Pull out those calendars and find a date that will work best for the engagement party as this will also help you determine which venues are available. If you simply must have a certain venue, you should arrange your date around their openings.


Engagement parties are typically thrown within a few months of the proposal before things get hectic with wedding planning.Keep in mind that you’ll want to invite guests about a month before the party, so don’t drag your feet for too long before booking a venue!, If you’re hosting an engagement party on behalf of the bride and groom, be sure to ask them what venue they’d like since it’s their party.Be conscious of financial costs of venues when you’re not the one in charge of throwing and paying for the party. If the couple is providing financial backing, but not hosting, the host should be aware of their budget. Likewise, if a couple asks someone to host a party for them they should be aware of the financial burden they are asking the host to shoulder.Be sure to also run other logistics by the couple, such as the guest list and food options.

, If you decide to have a themed engagement party, this will help you decide what kind of venue you’ll want for the party. You could do anything from an ocean theme at a beach to a simple vintage party in an old warehouse.If you’re going for for a backyard theme, have the party at someone’s house or at a park where you can enjoy outdoor games and grilling.
If it’s a more fancy affair, you may choose to book a formal garden at an estate.Take advantage of seasonal themes. For example, a clambake on the beach might be great for the summer or a rustic ski lodge might be perfect for the winter., The type of decorations you want will determine what kind of venue you book. Some venues will allow you to bring in your own decorations and others will have a staff that will decorate the space for you. Decide how much you want to be a part of the process before looking for venues.Your decorations for your engagement party don’t have to match your wedding theme.

, Do you like to get your guests moving around? Some engagement parties might include games. If you want something like a scavenger hunt or lawn games, you’ll need to have a venue that has enough space for these activities.If you want to have yard games, for example, make sure your venue has an outdoors space.

, Your style of party will determine your food and drink needs. You’ll want to make sure your venue can accommodate those. If you’re into making your own food, you should consider making your venue a private home. If you don’t want to be bothered with figuring out food and drink, make sure your venue accommodates caterers.Some venues, for example, may not allow for alcohol.

Your fee is reduced by up to $32.50 if you took a state-sanctioned marriage prep course (see below).

, If both parties can present a certificate of completion for a marriage prep course, your license is effective immediately. You will also get a discount on your application fee. The premarital course must:Instruct spouses in communication skills, conflict management, parenting responsibilities, and financial issues relating to marriage.
Be administered by a licensed psychologist, social worker, marriage and family therapist, mental health counselor, or religious figure. It can also be taught by any other court-appointed individual.
Last at least four hours.
There are lots of ways to take the course. Options include both in-person and remote learning. For instance, you can take it online here., If you didn't take the premarital course, your marriage license will not take effect until three days after it is issued. Carefully note the date on the marriage certificate. The waiting period should be reflected. You cannot get legally married during this period.

, Marriage licenses in Florida have a 60-day expiration period. If you don't get married within this time frame, you will need to get another marriage license (and pay the fee again).

, To be legally binding, a marriage must be presided over by someone who has the authority to grant marriages. This includes several different kinds of people, including:All normally-ordained priests, ministers, and other religious personnel
All judicial officers (judges), including retired ones
All clerks of the state circuit courts
All notaries public (see below)

, Anyone who is a licensed notary may legally perform the rites of marriage. Most city and county clerks in Florida are notaries. The courthouse that issues the marriage license may be able to provide you with a list of local notaries.


If you want a friend or relative to say your wedding, this is your best option. The process for becoming a notary is cheap and can mostly be done online. Instructions are available via the governor's office here.If you're getting married in a state park, at a private estate, or in an unusual place like on a boat, you may also want to ask about notaries on-site.

, During the ceremony, the officiant will guide the spouses as they say their vows, exchange rings, and affirm their marriage. The specifics of a marriage ceremony can vary based on the venue, the number of guests attending, whether the ceremony is religious, and so on. See our selection of wedding articles for specific guides. From a legal standpoint, all that's important is that the officiant is there to witness the wedding and confirm your intention to marry.


""Scripts"" for very simple wedding ceremonies are available in English and Spanish via the governor's office here. These are the sort of ceremony you would have if you get married at a county court building.

, Usually, a pre-adressed envelope will be provided with the form so it can be mailed easily. This is not the responsibility of either spouse, but you may want to check in with the officiant anyway to ensure speedy processing of your marriage.


After the Marriage Record is received, the Clerk's Office will mail a certified copy to the newly-married couple.At this point, your marriage is official.

, This is a concern for nearly any wedding. However, it matters especially if you intend to have a large reception or you want to reserve a historic Florida location, like Sarasota's John and Mabel Ringling Estate, the St. Augustine lighthouse, or the Carillon tower at Bok Tower Gardens.

, With Florida's balmy climate and dazzling locales, outdoor weddings are understandably sought-after. If your wedding is on public land, be sure that you have valid permission and documentation to avoid embarrassing legal snafus.


Florida's public beach parks require a permit before having a ceremony on-site. Some of these permits are free while others cost money. For Florida beach weddings, inquire at city hall.
For government-run parks such as Fort DeSoto in Pinellas county or Bahia Honda State Park, contact the ranger station or park headquarters.

, Florida is well-known for its hot, subtropical climate. However, many visitors are not aware that it actually has a pronounced rainy season for much of the year. This is important to know, especially if you're having an outdoor ceremony. As a very general rule:


The dry season lasts from October through April for most of the state.
The wet season lasts from May to October for most of the state.

"
First, do not make a script, because you cannot count on what you want people to say.,
In secret, ask the girl's parents if they consent to you being married to their daughter.,
If the parents say yes, ask the girl out on a date at a very fancy diner, like the ones who have a dress code.,
2 weeks before you have the date, definitely get the most beautiful, most affordable, and most her-personality ring you can, in a nice little black satin box with silk stuffed neatly inside it.,
When your date is done, when you walk her home, in front of the house, kneel down.,
Then, of course, there's always the awkward moment after you ask her.",How to Say Will You Marry Me,";
, If they say yes, hold a little 'me celebration', but do not make it too big, because if the girl says no, your heart will be broken. If they say no, then do not get mad at them. Remain calm, but put on a depressed look, otherwise, if you are too calm, the parents will think that you did not love her.

, Put on your finest suit, or rent a tuxedo. Put deodorant on, shower, put a spritz of citrus body spray on, brush your teeth, wash your face, and shave, if you don't have a beard, and (maybe) get your hair styled. Try not to get anything on your suit. Right before you get there, tuck a plump red rose in your buttonhole.

, Black, in this case, is romantic for ring boxes.

, Hold her hand in your left hand, and open the ring box. Hold the opened ring box in your right hand. Say, (her full name), will you agree to be my wife? or, traditionally, (her full name), will you marry me? When she replies, if she says yes, scoop her up in your arms, laugh playfully, and kiss her. Knock and lead her in. If she says no, do the same thing with the parents. Say, Goodbye, then. Look disappointed, and lead her in. If she says that she needs time to think about it, say I understand. Smile and lead her in her house.

, When you lead her in, smile (sadly, if you were turned down), and wave. Then drive or walk back to your house.

"
"
Acknowledge your feelings.,
Pause.,
Respond appropriately.",How to React if You Hate Your Engagement Ring1," In the moment, recognize that the ring does not match your personal tastes. Internally acknowledge your feelings of disappointment and dissatisfaction — these feelings are okay and you don't need to panic. Choose to not react to these feelings of disappointment and dissatisfaction, but to respond instead.Respond by resolving to take the best course of action based on logic or reason, cooperation, and compassion.
Say to yourself, for example, ""I feel disappointed that the ring doesn't match my personal tastes. But, I love the person in front me and all that matters right now is our happiness."";
, Take a deep breath and allow any tension to leave your body. Gather your thoughts. Let your feelings rise and then decrease in intensity. Remember that you do not have to react immediately because of an internal feeling.By taking a second to pause, you can avoid reacting negatively, such as making a face or accidentally saying something hurtful.
Smile. Even a slight smile can signal your body to relax and soften.

, Remember that you are marrying the person, not the ring. Focus on the fact that the person you love has asked you to marry them, which is a cause for celebration no matter what the ring looks like.React to these feelings instead of the feelings that you have about the ring.
If your partner asks you if you like the ring in the moment, you can say ""It's a beautiful ring"" and worry about it later, instead allowing yourself to relish the happy moment. Later on you might say something like, ""You know, I've been thinking about it, and this ring doesn't totally feel like 'me.'""
Or you can hint at the fact that you might prefer a different setting or band. You can say, for example, ""I like the ring and I love you, but I think I would prefer a different setting."" If you choose this route, it may ruin the moment so be prepared to comfort and support your partner. It might be best to wait a few days and just focus on the happy occasion.

Learn to love the ring.,
Redesign the ring.,
Exchange the ring.",How to React if You Hate Your Engagement Ring2," If you do not have the heart to tell your significant other that you do not like it, then you will just have to learn to love the ring. Perhaps your fiancé chose the ring because it is within their budget, or because it is an heirloom. Instead, focus on what the ring symbolizes — love and commitment.Your fiancé picked that ring specifically for you as a symbol of their love. Consider regarding the ring as a representation of that love and express your own style through your other jewelry.
Remember that you can pick a wedding ring that you love and you can wear that after the wedding instead.

, If you cannot learn to love the ring, then suggest redesigning the ring. When making this suggestion, approach the situation as a project that you and your partner can bond over and work on together.For example, if you do not like the setting, then suggest picking a different one.
If the ring is an heirloom, you might suggest resetting the stones in a style that you like.

, Many big-name jewelry stores have return policies on rings, for example, 30 to 60 days for a refund or 90 days for store credit. Before suggesting an exchange to your partner, find out where they bought the ring and research the store’s return policy.This way, if you are unable to return or exchange the ring, you can avoid an uncomfortable (and unnecessary) conversation with your partner.

"
"
Be empathetic.,
Prepare what you will say.,
Find the right place and time.,
Monitor your body language.,
Be supportive.",How to React if You Hate Your Engagement Ring3," Place yourself in your partner’s shoes. Think about how you would feel if they told you they did not like their engagement ring or another important gift. Also, keep in mind your partner’s personality. Are they cool, strong-willed/fiery, sensitive, or passionate? Then, base what you will say off of these facts.For example, if your partner is passionate, reframe the information by helping them see the silver lining. Focus on the idea that redesigning the ring can be a project that brings the two of you closer together. And make sure to ask for their input., Sit down and write what you will say and how you will say it. Craft your words carefully and make sure that the words you choose express your feelings accurately. Remember to use “I” statements instead of “you” statements.For example, instead of saying, “You picked the wrong ring,” say, “I’m not sure if the ring suits my personal tastes. I think I would like a different setting. What do you think?”
Your tone of voice should be courteous and respectful, as well. This will communicate your honesty and willingness to work together to make the situation right.
Consider asking a trusted friend to sit down with you so you can practice and work out exactly what you will say. This can be especially helpful if your friend knows your fiancé, as this can give you greater insight into how your fiancé might react.

, Make sure that the place you choose to break the news is comfortable and private. Your partner may have a strong emotional response, so try not to tell them in a public setting. Also, be aware of your timing. Don’t bring up the conversation when they are in a bad mood or are busy.Try to keep this conversation as casual as possible. Saying something like, ""I need to talk to you about something. Can you come over tonight?"" might cause a lot of unnecessary stress and anxiety. Consider telling them when you've already planned a low-key hangout, for instance.

, Make sure that your body language reflects your message. When you are communicating with your partner you want to appear open and positive. Remember to make eye contact, have good posture, smile, and try not to cross your arms or have your hands in your pocket.If you are unsure about your body language, practice what you will say in front of a mirror. This way you can adjust any body language that sends the wrong message.

, When breaking the news, your partner will inevitably feel embarrassed, disheartened, disappointed, or even sad. Understand that this is a natural reaction, especially in this case. Allow your partner to feel what they need to feel and try to make them feel more comfortable.Even if you speak with compassion and tact, your partner's feelings may still be hurt.
Remind them that picking out a new ring together can be a positive experience. Just wait until your partner has worked through their emotions somewhat. Still feeling upset, hurt, or resentful could make the experience difficult, when it should be fun.
Let them know that you love them and that this is not a rejection of their love and commitment.
Your partner may need a little time to process their feelings — after all, they probably put a lot of time and thought into their ring selection. You may feel terrible about hurting their feelings, but give them the space to feel their feelings and let them be hurt. Tell them how much you love them, and how excited you are to be getting married.

Decide on your available budget.,
Look for diamonds that only have the highest cut grades (GIA - Excellent or AGS - Ideal).,
Ensure that your diamond is ""eye-clean"" or has no visible inclusions.,
Consider a diamond's fluorescence.",How to Purchase a Round Brilliant Diamond on the Internet," Have a reasonable idea of what diamond color and carat weight you are looking for. Colorless diamonds (D, E, and F) are more rare and thus will cost more. Near-colorless diamonds (G, H, I, and J) are more economical and offer the best of both worlds.

Did you know that most people cannot start to see color in a diamond until the H/I color range, with most people detecting color in J or below? Money Saving Tip: If you are setting your diamond in a white gold or platinum setting stick with G/H color. If you are setting your diamond in a yellow gold setting stick with J/K color.



 

;
, Since cut is the most important characteristic when it comes to a diamond's brilliance and sparkle, you do not want to compromise in this area. Cut is a somewhat complex characteristic to evaluate.

Even the most diamond dealers and jewelers underestimate the importance of a diamond's cut proportions. For round brilliant diamonds, look for the following dimensions: Table % = 52.4% to 57.5%, Depth % = 58.7% to 62.3%, Crown Angle = 33.7 to 35.8 degrees, Pavilion Angle = 40.5 to 41.0 degrees.







, Remember that natural diamonds are 1-3 billion years old and were formed originally deep within the Earth's mantle. Through extreme heat and pressure they gained their durability and hardness. Inclusions are a natural by-product of this natural process and shouldn't be unexpected.

Clarity does not equal brilliance. A diamond's ability to reflect light from within its facets is indicative of its cut - so be sure to focus on cut quality above anything else.







, Some natural diamond fluoresce and this is usually seen in special UV lighting situations such as black lights (nightclub). This can be a positive or negative aspect to your diamond's beauty so this is an important consideration.

For diamonds that are colorless (D-F), a strong blue fluorescence can sometimes make the diamond appear ""milky"" or even cloudy. However. this is in some cases and not all cases. In other situations, near-colorless (G-J) and tinted (K-M) diamonds can actually benefit from the strong blue fluorescence because the natural yellow tint that they have can be cancelled out by the blue hue.
In both cases, it is important to see actual pictures of the strong blue fluorescent diamond to ensure that it is not negatively affected by the fluorescence.

Set the scene for the proposal.,
Try to keep things quiet.,
Kiss your date underneath the mistletoe.,
Have her unwrap some of her gifts.,
Tell her that there is one last gift that you want her to open (as you open up the gift-wrapping).,
Tell her that you love her with all your heart, and that you'd like to spend the whole rest of your life with her.,
Get down on your knee as you open up the ring box.,

, Don't make things seem grandiose or in any way awkward.

, But don't make the situation seem in any way like you know that you are expecting to propose to her. Leave this box just a little out of sight, in hopes that she doesn't see it too well.

, Make sure to leave the wrapped ring box to the very end, after all other the boxes have been unwrapped.

, As you give the gift to her, keep your hand on the box. After she's ""unwrapped"" the ring, slide the used wrapping paper out from underneath the box with one of your other fingers on the same hand which is holding the present.

, Tell her that Christmas is the time for lovers to get married.

, Ask her the most important question that comes with any proposal ""(Mention her name including her first, middle and maiden name), Will you marry me?""

, If she turns you down, the extravaganza might have been too much. Tone things down and try to re-propose to her in a few weeks; just make sure to keep the love in both of your hearts that you've been experiencing over the past few weeks.

, This will tone things down, but keep the romance going.

She likes the ocean? Invite her to vacation with your family, and propose there. She likes football? Take her to her favorite team's game.

, Thanks to Hollywood and pop culture, guys' romantic tricks and secrets concerning proposals are known by girls everywhere. Make sure that, in the moment she isn't exactly expecting a proposal. For example, you take her to the beach with your family. You've been dating/courting for two years. She's probably expecting a proposal by now!! Don't propose to her while you're walking down the beach in the moonlight, just the two of you. She'll probably expect it, at least a little bit. Instead, propose to her on the ""fishing trip"" where you actually take her and your family to a neat picnic spot. Blow her mind! (And by the way,...girls are smart. They know when you're planning something. Make sure she's surprised!)

, Don't propose to her in the line at the Nachos stand at her favorite team's football game. You can still do something surprising without throwing class, tradition, and chivalry out the back door.

, Don't do something completely out of character for yourself, or she'll suspect something's up for sure.

, That will give you some ideas, and if there's a family ""proposing tradition"", you'll want to know about that.

, Sure, tell her how much she means to you and that she's the most beautiful girl you know, but show her that Jesus is the foundation for your love so she knows that she knows that you're stable. Say things like, ""I believe God put us together""...""I want to love you like Christ loves the church""...""Since Jesus never leaves us, I want to exemplify that by spending the rest of my life with you""...""My mission is to bring glory to God, and I think two can better accomplish that mission than one""...""Your beauty is your godliness"", etc.

Locate the hallmark on the inside of the band.,
Look for a symbol that indicates platinum.,
Read the letters and numbers of the hallmark.",How to Identify Quality in Platinum Rings1," Look at the inside of a ring’s band to find the hallmark that indicates the platinum purity. Find this marking as a sure way to determine that the ring is truly made of platinum.


You may need a magnifying glass to see the fine engraving on a small ring.
If there is no engraved hallmark, the ring is not platinum, or is made with less than 50% of it and cannot be considered and marked as platinum.;
, Check the inner band for a symbol that you can use to quickly identify if the ring is made with real platinum. The type and presence of the symbol depends on the country of origin; sometimes there may only be words and numbers instead of a symbol.


In the U.S., you will see a symbol that resembles a house shape (triangle atop a rectangle), or simply a combination of letters and numbers.
In India, you will find a symbol created by an uppercase “P” and a lowercase “t,” followed by the number 950.
In China, you will find the English letters “Pt,” perhaps alongside other Chinese characters.
In Japan, you will see “Pt” followed by the number 850, 900, 950, or 999., Look at the numbers and/or letters that are given as part of the platinum hallmark. The letters will designate the ring as platinum, while the numbers indicate how many parts out of 1000 are pure platinum by weight.


If letters are given, they will say either PT, PLAT, or PLATINUM, which indicates that the ring is at least 95% platinum.In the U.S., the number given before or after these letters can be 850, 900, or 950. This indicates that the ring is made with 85%, 90%, or 95% pure platinum, respectively. The other percentage of the ring composition is a metal that the platinum is alloyed with to make it harder."
"
Find out what metal the platinum is mixed with.,
Understand what alloys yield the best quality.,
Consider possible allergens in metal alloys.",How to Identify Quality in Platinum Rings2," Determine what kind of alloy a ring is made of by reading labels and talking to a jeweler. An alloy is a mixture of two or more metals, in this case used to make the platinum harder. Platinum rings should be marketed listing the quantity of other metals, especially if there is less than 90% pure platinum in the ring.


A 950PLAT ring will typically be alloyed with cobalt, copper (or a combination of the two), iridium, palladium, ruthenium, or tungsten, which makes up the other 50 parts of 1000. If this other 5% is from the platinum metal group (iridium, palladium, ruthenium, rhodium), the ring can be considered 100% precious.A 900PLAT ring will usually be alloyed with iridium or palladium. Sometimes it will be listed as IRIDPLAT to indicate a mix of 100 parts iridium and 900 parts platinum.
An 850PLAT ring will usually be alloyed with palladium. Less than 85% platinum will often be listed with the quantity of palladium or other metal, such as ""585PLAT 415PALL."", Once you know the content of other metal present in a platinum ring, you can make choices based on the quality that each type yields. Find an alloy that will have the finish and durability you desire.


A composition of 950 parts platinum and 50 parts cobalt is often considered the finest alloy quality for platinum rings. This combination creates an extremely strong and durable ring with a very bright finish, looking almost as if it has been lit from the inside.
A ring with 950 parts platinum and 50 parts ruthenium is very durable and almost scratch-resistant, so it is a very fine quality choice. It also has a high shine mirror-like finish.
A 950 parts platinum and 50 parts iridium is perhaps the most common alloy sold in platinum rings, but it is not the highest quality. It yields a softer metal which is prone to scratches, pits, and bends, leading to a duller finish over time., Choose a platinum alloy with a certain type of metal if you have a known allergy to one of the common base metals. Note that any ring with a high percentage of pure platinum should not cause negative skin reactions, as platinum is hypoallergenic.


Avoid cobalt in alloys with a lower amount of platinum, as those with a cobalt allergy may be sensitive. However, in a quality PT950/Cobalt alloy, allergic reactions are very rare.Copper is also a fairly common metal allergy. Steer clear of rings with copper or copper-cobalt platinum alloys, especially in lower grades, if you have a known reaction.
An allergy to any metal in jewelry will show up as a red, itchy rash or blisters on the skin that comes in contact with the jewelry. Test out wearing a piece of copper or cobalt jewelry for 24-48 hours, if you can, to determine if you will have a negative reaction."

Find a trusted jeweler.,
Ask specific questions.,
Consider eco-friendly options for platinum.",How to Identify Quality in Platinum Rings3," Talk to and buy from a jewelry store that has a good reputation and staff that makes you feel comfortable and informed. Ask to talk to the head jeweler at a store or an expert on platinum to get all the answers you need about quality.


Research or ask to see the credentials of a jeweler. Look at how long they’ve been in business and check independent reviews of them online to see what their reputation is like.
Make sure anyone in the store can answer your questions about a ring thoroughly and confidently, or can direct you to someone else on the premises who can.You should not buy precious metal jewelry like platinum rings from an online store, where you cannot look at and ask questions about the piece before buying.

, Go into a jewelry store with specific questions in mind to help you further determine the quality and authenticity of a platinum ring. Make sure you know all the possible details you can before purchasing.


Ask about how the metal will wear and look over time. Shiny new platinum naturally dulls slightly with age, but many actually enjoy the way this makes precious gems set in the metal appear sparklier by contrast.Find out if the jeweler can resize or repair the ring in the case of scratching or other damage. Some may even offer free or discounted repairs or retreatment, or a money-back guarantee if you are not satisfied with the ring.
Ensure that a store is not overcharging for a ring with a lower platinum content. For instance, an 850 or less platinum alloyed with iridium should not cost the same as a 950 platinum ring, or be marketed as pure platinum when it is not.

, Make specific ring choices if you have an ethical concern about the impact of platinum on the environment. Note that platinum mines create a huge volume of waste to produce just an ounce of pure platinum.


Consider a used or vintage platinum ring for an option that doesn’t require or support additional platinum mining. Consult an antique jewelry expert to get an appraisal on vintage metal quality.
Choose a jeweler that has options for rings made with recycled platinum alloys, which can be just as durable and luminous as the new metal. You may also have your own platinum jewelry melted down by specialty jewelers to create a new ring.
Buy from jewelers that advertise low impact mining methods and fair trade labor practices for new platinum rings that contribute to slightly less negative impact. Do your own research into policies and partnerships to verify their claims."

Make sure you're in love.,
Think about spending the rest of your life together.,
Compare your goals.,
Consider your lifestyles.,
Reflect on your partner's characteristics.",How to Know if You Are Ready to Get Engaged1," If you are considering getting engaged, you probably love your partner. But are you in love with them? There actually is a difference, and it is important.There are several differences between being in love and loving someone. When you are in love, you likely want to be physically intimate with your partner.
Being in love can cause a rush of emotions. You may feel like it is difficult to be away from your partner.
The sensation of being in love is different from the love you would feel for your sister, for example.
Keep in mind that it is also possible to be in love with the idea of being in love. In this case, you may want to be in love so much that you make yourself believe it.;
, Spend some time reflecting on what your future looks like. When you picture yourself 5, 10, or 20 years from now, is your partner there in your vision? Do you automatically imagine the two of you together?When you picture your future, it is a good sign if your partner is automatically there.
Choose a specific scenario. For example, do you want to have kids in the future? Can you picture your partner being a good parent? What does that look like? These are some good questions to ask yourself.

, Think about what you want out of your life. Is it important to you to live in a certain city? Do you want to focus on your career? Take some time to think about how your goals fit into your relationship.Does your have similar goals? For example, you might be able to relate well to one another if you are both career driven.
Is your goal to live in New York City? That might cause a problem if you partner's goal is to live in a remote mountain cabin.

, It's great if you and your partner have some different interests. That can help keep your relationship exciting and interesting. However, it can also be nice to have some things in common. You might not want to spend the rest of your life with someone who doesn't share any of your interests.For example, if you are a very fit and active person, it might be troublesome if your partner is a more sedentary person. It's ok if the two of you don't work out together every day, but you might get frustrated if you can't ever enjoy a hike together. Ask yourself if you are okay with doing this activity with a friend instead?
You might try making a list of all of the activities you like to do together. If you can't think of many (or any), you might want to consider how important your interests are to you.

, When you are evaluating your relationship, you definitely want to take your partner's personality into consideration. Make a list of the characteristics that are important to you, and then determine whether or not your partner has them. You might list traits such as:Honesty
Empathy
Kindness

Take a self-assessment.,
Figure out your stance on marriage.,
Consider outside influences.,
Think about your future.",How to Know if You Are Ready to Get Engaged2," When you are engaged or married, you are in a partnership. A successful partnership will have two partners that are comfortable in their own skin, confident, and happy. Before you decide to get engaged, think about your own status. If you aren't in a good place, it may not be the time to get engaged.Are you between jobs and feeling somewhat adrift? You might feel like an engagement might help you feel grounded. But it won't solve the problem that you're actually dealing with.
Ask yourself how you feel about yourself. Are you happy? Do you like yourself? Are you comfortable with your life choices? These are good signs that you are mature and stable enough to get engaged.

, Take some time to reflect on what marriage means to you. Do you see it as a religious commitment? Or maybe it is more of a legal contract. Some people view it as a sign of commitment to your partner.Write down what marriage means to you personally. Make notes such as ""legally binding,"" ""family,"" ""spiritual,"" or ""emotional companionship.""
Will you feel like you are in a committed relationship without being married? Or is it something that you need or want for your relationship to feel complete?

, There can be a lot of societal pressure to get married. Particularly if you're a woman, you may have heard more than once, ""Why aren't you married?"" These comments can come from anyone from a perfect stranger to your mom.Examine your motives. Make sure you want to get married. Don't get engaged just because Mom is pressuring you.
Women are not alone in feeling the pressure. Men may have frequently heard stereotypical comments such as, ""Isn't it time to settle down yet?""
These types of remarks can be irritating and hurtful. Try to firmly shut them down with a clear comment on where you stand. ""Thanks for your concern, but those types of decisions are for my partner and I to make.""

, When you are considering getting engaged, the future will undoubtedly be on your mind. Of course, you've thought about what life would look like for you and your partner. Now, spend some time thinking about your individual needs.Write down your goals. Is your priority to spend more time traveling the world? Can you make that happen if you get engaged?Maybe owning your own business is your main goal. Will that be compatible with a marriage? Or, are you sure about wanting to have children, but less certain of marrying this particular person?

Have a discussion with your partner.,
Communicate effectively.,
Give yourself time to make a decision.,
Decide how to move forward.",How to Know if You Are Ready to Get Engaged3," Getting engaged is a two person decision. Have you and your partner discussed the idea? If not, now is the time. Ask your partner to have a talk with you.Pick a good time and place. Don't abruptly bring it up when your partner is leaving for work. Instead, find a time when you are both relaxed and at ease.
Find a good conversation opener. Try, ""I've been thinking about what the future holds for our relationship. Do you have some time to talk about where we're headed?""
Make sure that you avoid asking, ""Is this relationship going anywhere?""

, Be thoughtful about what you want to say and how to say it. Try to use ""I"" statements, such as ""I feel that we are ready to talk about getting engaged."" You should also try to make your points clearly and directly.Say what you mean. You might say, ""The thought of getting engaged makes me both nervous and excited.""
Actively listen to your partner. Indicate that you are listening by maintaining eye contact and paraphrasing your partner's statements. You can also ask questions to show that you are interested in their views.

, You may be feeling overwhelmed after your time spent reflecting. Be patient with yourself as you make your decision. You might also want to give yourself a break from thinking about it.Go see a funny movie or read a good book. You could even go on a weekend getaway with your friends.
Give yourself permission to process your emotions. Whatever you are feeling is ok.

, Once you have processed all of your thoughts and feelings, you're ready to make your choice. Are you ready to get engaged? Only you know the answer to that. But once you've examined your own feelings and talked to your partner, you should be in a much better position to answer that question. You can now confidently decide whether to get engaged, stick with the status quo, or go for a fresh start.

Make sure he will be ready for the commitment.,
Make sure that it's the right time in his life.,
Make sure that he can't see a future without you in it.,
Get a feel for his views on marriage.",How to Get Your Long Term Boyfriend to Propose You1," Though you might have been together for over a year, or even five, that doesn't mean that he's ready to marry you. Some men want to get married eventually, but only when they are ready. The concept of ""ready"" is complicated and often involves a feeling that he has ""played the field,"" had adventure, had independent fun, is financially stable, is mature and now ready to settle down. All of these are valid reasons and you shouldn't ignore him and force him to do something that he's just not ready to do.


See if he's committed to you in any way other than calling you his girlfriend. This could mean moving in with you, sharing a pet with you, moving to a new location with you, or even putting himself in the same exact social circle as you.
See if he's had other relationships. If he's had significant dating experience before, then you shouldn't be jealous, but fortunate that he's had some experience with women and is more likely to feel less interest in ""playing the field"" and seeing what else is out there.;
, Every relationship is different, and many couples who got engaged after being together for just a year or two can have marriages that are just as successful as those of couples who waited five or ten years to get married. If it's not the right time in your man's life, then it doesn't matter how long you've been together.


If he's still trying to figure out his career, if all of his buddies are still single and not even really dating, or if he still has a lot of personal issues to sort out, then it may not be the best for him to marry you.
If he's not feeling stable personally, financially, or even physically, then his mind may be on other things.
Still, keep in mind that there's no perfect time to get married. If it hasn't felt like ""the right time"" for years, then there may be bigger problems.

, If you want to get your long term boyfriend to propose, then you should make sure that he can't imagine his life without you. Sure, you've been together for three years, but does that mean he wants to be with you for thirty? If every time he talks about the future, he starts with ""We..."" and if he's mentioned moving to a new place with you, buying a home with you, or even starting a family with you, then sure, he's probably thinking of being with you forever.


If he never talks about what will happen even six months down the line, even if you're planning to attend a wedding together, or if he's spending a summer studying abroad, then he may be trying to avoid the issue.

, Some men are very nonchalant about marriage—-they're fine with getting married, but they'd also be fine with not getting married. If this is the case, don't expect him to be as enthusiastic about marriage as you are and accept that it's something he'd be doing mostly because you want to. You'll have to do a lot of nudging to get the wedding of your dreams.


It's also possible the he doesn't want to get married at all, to anyone. Getting a guy who decidedly doesn't believe in marriage to propose to you is pretty much impossible.

Casually bring up marriage.,
Mention your future together.,
Plan a romantic trip.,
If you don't want an expensive ring -- or a ring at all -- mention it.,
If you don't want an expensive wedding, mention it.,
Let him see you as ""wife material.""",How to Get Your Long Term Boyfriend to Propose You2," To avoid overwhelming your boyfriend, you should start by being subtle and build your way up to talking about your own marriage. You should start by casually bringing up a conversation about marriage that doesn't directly involve your marriage. You can mention someone else who got married or engaged recently or make a comment on an engagement commercial, for example. A good way to start things is to express confusion or even mild criticism. Here's how to do it:


You could say, ""A co-worker just got back from his honeymoon. You know where they went? To the beach. That's so weird to me because we go to the beach about once a month and it's so close by. If I was going on a honeymoon, I'd want to go somewhere new and exotic. Wouldn't you?""
You could also say, ""Can you believe John proposed to Marla on a Ferris wheel? I think that's perfect for them, but I think I'd like something a little different.""

, Don't say, ""I can't wait to have ten kids with you!"" Just subtly start making comments that allude to you being together in the future, whether you're married or not. If he isn't responsive to the indirect approach, start slowly making it more direct with phrases like, ""if we stay together,"" ""if we live together,"" and later, ""if we get married.""


Watch his reaction when you discuss the future. See if he carries that conversation on or avoids the subject.
Remember that even though this may have been on your mind for a long time, this is a new conversation for him and he needs time to sort out his thoughts. Don't expect him to have his answer prepared.

, If you think that your man has been waiting for the perfect time to make the right move, then suggest that it's time that you go on vacation. Make sure that you plan it far enough away -- at least two or three months -- so your man has time to think of it as a potential place to propose. Don't mention anything about how it would be the perfect proposal destination and wait for him to figure it out.If you don't mention that it would be a great place to get engaged, then he won't feel that you're putting the pressure on.
And even if he doesn't propose, seeing you in a romantic setting where many people do propose will put his mind on proposing.

, This is an important point. Many men don't propose because they're putting off figuring out what kind of ring their woman wants and what her ring size is. Many more men don't propose because they're not ready to shell out thousands of dollars for a diamond ring and think it'll take them forever to save up for it.


Well, if you don't want a fancy ring, or even a ring at all, then you can mention it, however subtly, so that he knows that this shouldn't be a factor in his plans for a proposal.
You can even mention your thoughts on the ring by mentioning someone else's ring. You could say, ""Did you see that rock Rick gave to Sheila? I can't believe she didn't fall over with that thing on her hand. I would never want a ring like that -- I'd want it to be small and simple.""

, Though a proposal does not mean an immediate wedding, many men are also deterred from proposing because they're worried that they'll never be able to afford an expensive 400 person wedding, or because they don't want to be roped in to the wedding-planning hoopla. Well, if you planned on just having a small wedding in the park with 50 of your closest friends and family and having a casual dress code, you should find a way to mention this too.


Though this shouldn't be a factor in a man's decision to marry you for life, it does deter men from wanting to get the ball rolling on the whole marriage thing. Can you blame them?

, Though he may think you're a ton of fun or a sex kitten, you should also let him see you as wife material -- as the woman who will be his lifelong partner and potentially the mother of his children. So, show him that you'd make a great wife as well as a fun girlfriend. Let him see that you're independent and career-oriented while also knowing how to take care of him when he's sick, how to tastefully decorate your home, and how to cook a healthy meal -- nothing fancy required.


If you want him to see you as a wife, then your relationship should be positive most of the time. If you spend most of your time fighting or crying about your insecurities, he won't think you're ready for marriage.
Let him see that you have your act together on your own and that you're ready to move towards marriage. If he thinks that your life won't be complete until you get married, he won't want to propose.

"
"
Address his fears.,
Make a logical argument for getting married.,
Make him see what he'll miss if he doesn't marry you.,
Propose yourself.",How to Get Your Long Term Boyfriend to Propose You3," If you've openly discussed marriage, then you can assuage his fears a bit so he sees that he has nothing to be scared about. Maybe he's concerned that once you get married, you'll change somehow, and settle into a comfort zone. Or, is he worried that after tying the knot, he'll be pressured to start a family right away? It could also be that he feels insecure somehow, and his current self-image doesn't match the role he envisioned as a husband.


If he's just worried about the ring or the wedding itself, then you can think of some creative compromises. If he can't afford a ring, can you live without one? If he doesn't want a big wedding, how about eloping or having a small, private ceremony?
If he's afraid that marriage will take the luster out of your relationship, have some go-to happily married couples that you both admire that you can point to.

, If he's a logical thinker, appeal to that part of his brain. Though it may not be the most romantic approach to take, there are some practical benefits of getting married. Practical and legal benefits of marriage include putting your significant other on your insurance plan, being eligible for more government benefits and filing joint income tax returns. Marriage is also an effective way to make sure your mate is taken care of if you die suddenly. If you are not married, and one of you dies, the other will not inherit anything unless it is spelled out in a will. And even if it is, there will be estate and gift taxes. Also, if you are married you can receive wages, workers' compensation, and retirement plan benefits for a deceased spouse.
Though you may not want to go down this morbid line of thinking, it is very logical, and is something to consider -- especially if you've been together for fifteen years and aren't married.

, If he really sounds like he's unsure about whether he wants to marry you or not, or even says he needs some time to himself to figure some things out, then let him have that time. But make it clear that you're not waiting around forever for him to make the move, and that you're a great catch that any man would be lucky to marry.While you shouldn't make him feel bad for being uncertain or make him propose because he feels jealous or guilty, you should let him know that if you've invested a lot of time and love into the relationship and he still doesn't know what he wants, that you have your limits, too.

, If you think that the time is right and that you're both ready to get married, then hey, it's the 21st century and you can take the matter into your own hands. If you've been waiting around long enough and you're sure that the only thing really holding your man back is the proposal itself instead of the prospect of marriage, then speed things up by asking him to marry you.

Avoid repeatedly bringing up marriage talks.,
Tell your friends and family to zip it.,
Don't give him an ultimatum.,
Don't start putting the pressure on before he's ready -- or close to it.,
Don't be desperate.",How to Get Your Long Term Boyfriend to Propose You4," It's a guarantee that if you mentioned wanting to get married once, it's burned into his brain. The more you talk about it, the less he hears it. If you're the one who always brings it up and the word ""marriage"" never comes out of his mouth, then you should take it easy for a while.

, You may think your friends are being helpful by casually slipping in marriage comments to him, but it will likely make him feel ganged up on. Let him come to the decision on his own, without the advice or urging of those in your life.

, Though you may think that giving your man an ultimatum is the fastest way to get him to spring to action, giving an ultimatum -- ""Marry me or it's over"" -- will actually make him feel too much pressure and won't make him propose any faster. Saying, ""Propose in the next two months or it's over"" will actually scare him off and will deter him from proposing.


However, if you really feel like you've been waiting around forever and are fully ready and think he is, too, then let him know without making a harsh statement.

, If you've only been with your boyfriend for a few months, or have been together longer than that but things aren't really serious between you if you have to be honest, then you shouldn't start pressuring him to marry you if he's beyond not ready. Doing this too early in the relationship, especially way too early, can end the relationship quicker than you can say, ""I do.""


Just because all of your friends are getting ready or you can't wait to try on a wedding dress doesn't mean that you should talk about your wedding from your second date -- or there won't be a third.

, Many magazines may give you the wrong message, making you think that if you want your man to fall in love with you, all you have to do is cook a five-course meal in a pair of hot high heels, stay up late to pick him up when he's on a bender with his buddies, or to generally be at his beck and call so he can see what an ""amazing"" girlfriend you are.This will not make him upgrade you to wife status. Men are much more interested in women who are confident and independent than women who serve their every need and will drop everything just to pamper and feed them -- especially if they're only doing it because they think it'll make him more likely to propose.

Convey unconditional love.",How to Get a Man to Marry You," Think, would you marry you? If you're not happy with who you are then don't expect others will be. Analyze yourself and change what you don't like. Positive self-esteem is key.;
, From the start of the relationship and all through the marriage, the key to keeping the relationship together is communication. Tell him what you feel both positive and negative.

, For all the glamour advertisements out there, the fake boobs, hair dyes, and all the rest, a man really appreciates something that is genuine. Be natural and don't pose. You want him to get to know the real you because it is the real you he's going to have to live with when you're married.

, While sexuality isn't the only thing in a relationship, it is important. Show that you're interested in him romantically. Try not to be too prudish and withdrawn. Allow that aspect of the relationship to be free, fun, and lively. Men who want to marry aren't looking for just a roommate.

, An important part of any relationship is making both partners aware that they have a crucial and indispensable role to play. Make sure that you and your partner have a similar view of the relationship. If you're looking for someone to have kids with and he's looking for a casual relationship, it's not going to work out.

, Life with you should not be a roller coaster ride. Men generally like women who are stable and vice versa. Sometimes this is a difficult task in our hectic lives, but it is not impossible. If you find yourself referred to as a ""drama queen"" in more than one instance, seek help and guidance in relaxing your nerves and calming your emotions.

, They date first before becoming a boyfriend, and they stay a boyfriend first before getting engaged. This is often hard for women, but there is a lesson to be learned from it. They make sure (as women should) that they feel compatible on all levels. This process must happen at its own pace. Pressuring a man to make a decision before he feels he knows you will inevitably lead him to be uncertain. Don't talk about marriage until either he brings it up or it's been about a year.

, If dating goes well, and your interactions are positive, he'll want you to be his girlfriend. If he builds experience with you and sees you as a person he wants to be with forever, he will get more serious about his future and work, start considering more distant goals such as buying a home, and begin to discuss the future more and more. Only once he has made a decision about you and feels prepared and mature enough to propose will he do so.

, Be sure of yourself, and ready to tackle whatever is before you. Many men love confident women. How can a man not feel privileged when he earns the esteem of a woman who values herself so highly?

, A special glance, a scratch on the back, or a soft kiss is nice, but nothing ""clingy"" or inappropriate.

, Also, tell him so, even if he's already prideful. Then, support him when he is at his best, and avoid nagging or berating him when he is at his worst.

, This sounds basic, but it's a critical factor in any relationship. Have a sense of humor. Don’t be uptight or negative.

, Women who are glad to be alive and are enjoying every minute of it may be irrepressibly attractive to men.

, If the warmth of your heart is written all over your face, and your feelings for your guy show in the sparkle in your eyes, you will melt him. This is what removes all doubt--it's the important ""silver bullet"".

, A humble person is not someone who downplays herself; it is a person who controls her ego and shows a genuine interest in others.

, It may not be obvious, but you actually have to go out on dates with a man and commit to a relationship before he will propose. The term ""date"" in modern culture is vague and sometimes redefined as something more than it is. Simply converse with a man and get to know more about each others' lives.

, Some men wait slightly longer than you might want before they ask. If he is really worth marrying, you should be willing to wait (within reason). But if he is uninterested (or worse, making excuses) even after a long period of time, you need to re-evaluate the direction of your relationship.

, If you want to be respected and treated as an equal, do the same for him. Be romantic. Make him want to be in this relationship. Don't be a cheapskate. Men often enjoy romance too; pretending otherwise will only drive him away.

, If, after six months to a year, you still haven't heard him refer to his future plans for marriage or family (with or without you), you may need to ask, ""What qualities do you look for in someone you see yourself committing to?"" If he mentions qualities he's complimented you on, take it as a good sign. If his compliments are largely related to sex, it probably is not.

, Instead of coming at him with a serious tone (which will bring up his innate fear of pressure for commitment), be upbeat and positive. ""I really love spending time with you. I really feel happy around you. But I just want to double check and see if we're on the same page. While I know it is too soon for us to worry about it, I do want to get married in the future and want to make sure I'm dating someone who has the same values as me. As we get to know each other better and better, are you beginning to see me as someone you could possibly see that happening with?""

, A strong relationship should be based upon more than convenience. Pushing past difficult times while remaining together requires a deep commitment and appreciation for one another. Unconditional love is developed over time. It is a choice we make, not necessarily a feeling we experience.

The surrounding gemstones or diamonds create a halo effect for the center stone and flash with light to create a dazzling effect.;
, You can choose diamond (white or color) or other gemstones to be fixed at the center, depending on your budget and preferences. The cut of the stone can be the classic round or princess if desired; however, the modern-style cuts like emerald, asscher or cushion offers an extra dazzling touch.

, You can choose contrasting or complementary halo stones. For example, blue sapphires or rubies surrounding a white diamond will create a contrasting effect while diamonds bordering a solitaire diamond in the ring can create a complementary effect.

, Since this is a quest to add more and more bling to your solitaire engagement ring, you can double or even triple the number of halos if you'd like. Each “circle” surrounding the center will make the ring go bigger and bigger and will amplify the dazzle of the ring.

You’ll probably have to tell them why you’re asking, so be prepared with a story if you don’t feel comfortable telling them the truth.You could also ask one of her friends to take her ring shopping. It is less likely to arouse suspicion if a close girlfriend casually suggests wanting to go ring shopping. Ask her friend to remember what size she wears after they go and report back to you.
If you want to get her a ring, but aren’t sure what she would like, this can also be a good way to get an idea of what styles she likes.;
, If you have a friend that is similar in size to your girlfriend, try asking them what size ring they wear. If you have already bought the ring, ask your friend to try it on and see if it fits.Keep in mind, though, that ring size can vary a lot. Even some petite girls can have chubby fingers, whereas some larger women have very slender fingers. Don’t just ask a friend that is roughly the same size and weight. Try to have a good idea of the recipient’s hand size, and then choose a friend that has similarly sized hands.

, You could come up with a story about how you’d like to get a family member (e.g. mom, sister, aunt, grandma, etc.) a ring as a gift, but that you have no idea what size they wear. Tell her that you think that she might have similarly sized hands, and ask if she knows what size ring she wears.You can take this one step further and actually purchase a cheap ring in the size you think she wears. Tell her you’re thinking of giving it to a female family member as a gift, but you’re not sure if the size is right. Have her try the ring on to see if it fits.

Split the shank.,
Pick the metal.,
Choose the number of shanks.,
Decide on the gemstones.",How to Enhance a Solitaire Engagement Ring3," The shank of the ring is divided into multiple strands leaving spaces between them. The common form is single split that leads to two individual shanks. The split can go up to three or four at times. The shanks will merge into one at the end of the ring to form a single band that can be worn comfortably.

, Since the splits will be sleek, choosing a hard metal is ideal.

, Single split is the most common; nevertheless one can choose by two or three. You can choose each split to be bejeweled with diamonds or gemstones. Additionally, you can also choose alternate splits depending upon the amount of dazzle you want.

, The gemstones for the shank can be complementary to the tone of the metal used or the solitaire stone featuring in the center of the ring.

Decide if you want a pave setting.,
Pick the gemstones.,
Choose between pave and micro pave setting.",How to Enhance a Solitaire Engagement Ring4," Pave rings are bejeweled with smaller diamonds or gemstones set in such proximity along the band that no metal shows. The stones encrusted offer a feel of a solid bed to enhance the look of the center stone. The smaller gemstone can surround the band completely called as “full pave” or stop halfway called as ""half pave.” Select your design.

, First of all, decide on the center solitaire gemstone. Once the center stone is finalized, choose complementary or contrasting gemstones to be encrusted in the band through pave setting. The additional stones can be in one gemstone or diamond or a combination of two/three gemstones or one gemstone and diamond to create a dramatic effect.

, The difference between the two settings is the size of the gemstones. In pave setting, there is a variation in the size of gemstones. An assortment is used to fit the space as well as possible. However, in micro pave setting, the size of the gemstone is uniform and they are encrusted in a honeycomb-like arrangement in the band."

Borrow one of her rings.,
Trace one of her rings.,
Try one of her rings on your fingers.",How to Figure out Her Ring Size2," One of the most sure-fire ways to figure out her ring size accurately is to have a ring she already owns sized. Choose a ring that she wears on her ring finger (or whatever finger you want to put your ring on), and take it to a jeweler. They will be able to tell you what size the ring is.Be careful when borrowing a ring, though! Don’t take her favorite ring that she wears every single day. She will notice that it is gone, and probably be very worried. Instead, try to take a ring that you have seen her wear on the correct finger (even if it is on the wrong hand), but that she only wears every now and then.
Take good care of the ring while it is in your possession! You don’t want to have to deal with the consequences if you lose or damage the ring.

, If you feel too nervous borrowing one of her rings for a day, you can also trace the ring on a sheet of paper. Lay the ring flat on a piece of paper and trace the inner part of the ring using a pen or pencil.You can then try to figure out her ring size by calculating the circumference. Use an online size conversion chart to figure out her ring size.
Alternatively, you can press her ring into a soft bar of soap to get an exact impression. However, this may leave a film on the ring, and the soap may get into the setting. If this happens, be sure to rinse the ring gently under running water. Don’t forget to plug the sink so you don’t drop it down the drain.
You can easily find a conversion chart by doing an internet search for “ring size conversion chart.” These charts will usually show you a list of various diameters (in inches or in millimeters) and the corresponding sizes in various countries.

, If you don’t want to borrow the ring for a day, and you don’t want to bother with the math, then try on a ring she owns to see how it fits your fingers. The easiest time to do this without getting caught is while she is in the shower or bath. Most people take their jewelry off while bathing so they don’t lose them.If you have similarly sized hands her ring might fit well on one of your fingers. If this is the case, you just have to remember which finger it fit best on. Go to a jeweler and ask them to size that finger.
If you have hands that are much larger, the ring probably won’t fit on your finger correctly. In this case, just put the ring on a finger as far down as it will go (don’t force it, just let it sit where it feels snug, but not too tight). Use a pen to mark the point on your finger where the ring fits. You can then go to a jeweler to find out the size, or measure your finger’s circumference and use a size chart to figure out what size she wears.
Note that if your hands are a lot smaller than hers, this method won’t work.

Take her to the mall.,
Measure her finger while she is sleeping.,
Compare her fingers with your fingers.",How to Figure out Her Ring Size3," Many department stores have a jewelry section. In this section, there is often a display of many rings where you can try on the different rings. In most cases, the rings are arranged by size, and the ring size is clearly indicated. Casually trying on rings for fun is the perfect way to get her ring size on the sly.Take her to the mall for a casual shopping trip, and plan it so that you just happen to pass by the ring display. When you pass by, act like there is a ring that has caught your interest. Usually, there will be rings for men and women. If you are a man, start casually trying on the men’s rings and invite her to join in the fun.

, If you live together or spend the night together often, you can try to measure her ring finger while she is sleeping. The easiest way to do this is to use a piece of string. When she is in her deepest sleep, gently wrap the string around her finger so that it is snug, but not tight. If you see her finger changing color, the string is too tight.Mark the spot where the string comes together and then use a ring size chart to figure out her ring size. You can find one at this website: http://qalo.com/pages/ring-size-chart. By doing it this way, you can measure the length of the string in inches or millimeters. This will be the circumference of her finger. You can then easily convert this into the correct ring size.
If she is not a deep sleeper then this is probably not the safest option. If she wakes up, you’ll probably have a hard time explaining what you’re doing without arousing suspicion.

, This method isn’t the most exact method in the world, but it can help give you an idea. Keep this as casual as possible. For example, if you are hanging out watching TV, hold her hand for awhile. Try to wait until she’s really into whatever is on TV and then compare her ring finger with your fingers. Is there one that is pretty similar in size?Do this casually, don’t just grab her hand out of nowhere and start comparing all of your fingers.
If you do have one finger that is quite similar to her ring finger you can go to the jewelers and explain the situation to them. They’ll help you size your own finger to figure out her ring size.

Step back and think about the situations that cause conflict.,
Understand that you can never get along with everyone all of the time.,
Be patient, even if others aren't.,
Work on being friendly.,
Realize that sometimes, conflict will be unavoidable.,
Know that squabbling is a natural, normal, even healthy aspect of interacting families.,
Be tactful.,
If you can’t beat ‘em, ignore ‘em.",How to Understand and Maintain Family Cohesion," You might actually begin to appreciate the differences in others around you, the variations that play upon the family dynamics as a whole. Take a closer look and you may even find hidden similarities you appreciate as well. If you're not careful, you could actually end up liking your family members even though they seem impossible to comprehend and drive you absolutely crazy. Coexistence with your family unit can actually become bearable, perhaps even enjoyable, despite the seething madness, the exasperation, the mayhem and inane antagonism. It just takes a good deal of consideration and understanding, kindness and courage and tact as well as patience, patience, patience and more patience.;
, Because we are human, each one of us is absolutely unique unto ourselves and completely different from everyone else. We all have the right to exist as we are and we all have the right to our own feelings, habits, and personalities as we diversify naturally. Each member of a family has a special role to play for the purpose of the whole. Recognizing and respecting each person’s right to their unique place in the family dynamic is the first big step to a peaceful co-existence. This also means accepting that some family members will not understand this concept, nor will they respect other family members’ unique roles or their rights to exist in the home as individuals. Therefore, we also must accept that they have the right to not understand, or perhaps are lacking the capacity or merely the desire to understand and that they cannot or will not accept other individuals rights to deviate from their own understanding or lack thereof. Conflicts arise as humans diversify. Understanding and tolerance of others is only achieved from the acceptance of their right to exist as individuals. Respect for anybody is still a long way off, so we are just going to have to make do with being polite for right now.

, Unfortunately, not everyone will hold such a virtue as patience. Impatience is unavoidable, because as human beings, we are all often rash, cruel, rude, disgusting, etc., to varying degrees. We are sensitive, callous, considerate, tolerant, inconsiderate, petty, profound at different times and in different situations. The best thing we can do is to try to be aware of this, be prepared for it, and learn to avoid such moments when personalities will surely clash. We must learn how to adapt to and overcome the conflicts of our obvious differences in order to remain functional in a family group. Only with patience and understanding can we achieve successful cooperation.

, If you’re nice to everyone first thing in the morning, they’ll be nice to you all day long. Taking a moment to say or do something pleasant and kind is greatly rewarding both for you and for the recipient. Instead of just going through routine motions, try to greet your family members amiably with sincere warmth and affection. No matter how small or insignificant a gesture may seem, it still goes a long way to create a relaxed and cheerful atmosphere for all. Furthermore, you can combine a good-natured smile with a thoughtful compliment to instantly achieve a total sense of civil unity within the group. A family greatly at ease is far less predisposed to inner controversy and battles. To continue the comfortable alliance all around everyone will be wholly content to keep the peace.

, Buttons will be pressed, tempers will flare, and arguments will undoubtedly happen. One good thing about family however, is that it is family. No matter what they do to you or you do to them, you're still all in it together. There’s no possible breaking up or permanent severance.

, Bickering keeps each role in a unit clearly defined. Our occasional quarrels are reminders of a basic primordial human need for a role in a small family unit on which we still depend. Today, our conflicts arise from a lack of dependency on the cooperation of our family group for immediate gain. Without a dire need of one another, we must recognize our developmental strengths and remember how to use them constructively for the good of everyone.

, Sometimes, there is no escape from dealing with family members. Maybe there is a shared chore to accomplish, or a coveted possession to be shared. Perhaps the holidays are coming and there is just nowhere to hide from one another. Sometimes, a little diplomacy can go a long way to defuse annoying issues before they come up. If you know where possible conflict could develop, you can approach the family member and propose a solution that will make both your lives easier from the start. Discussing, bargaining, even subtle bribing could settle issues before there’s even a problem. Also, the relationship with that particular family member may possibly be greatly improved with the exercise of such successful cooperation. You might even find that you are both smiling congenially as you collaborate for a common goal. This kind of resolution puts you both back on the same team. Cooperation is the exact reason we evolved to exist in small family groups, so it naturally leads to inner contentment, fulfilling a primal directive.

, Sometimes, you finally just reach your wit’s end, and after blowing up at a person, bending over backward, or beating your head (or someone else’s) against a wall, you decide that you simply cannot endure the behavior or personality, peeve, or whatever of a family member any more. You accept that even though you may have pleaded with them, or discussed, screamed or muttered under your breath, bargained, debated or even threatened over a conflict, there is simply nothing that can be done to resolve the problem effectively. In a case like this, the best thing you can do is just concentrate on your own life and pay as little attention as possible to the annoyance factor. By effectively tuning out the cause of such colossal irritation, you can go about your own day with minimal disruption. Simply ignoring the family member can also save a great deal of energy and aggravation. If you are able to resist such provocation completely you’ll remain free of that sense of futility and frustration and maintain a sense of peace.

Be polite.,
Be firm.,
Thank them.,
Say no even if you usually agree.",How to Turn Down Advice from a Relative Who Is a Therapist1," You may respect your relative and their advice but still want to say no. Say, “Thank you, I’ll think about that” as a way acknowledge yet not weigh in on their advice. You can also say, “That’s a good idea and I’ll decide whether that’s right for me.” This statement recognizes their advice as good, yet not necessarily right for you.There’s no need to be rude or say that their advice is bad or wrong.





;
, If the advice is inappropriate or not wanted, let your relative know this in a firm and unwavering way. Make it clear you do not wish to discuss it and that the advice needs to end.You may wish to share your feelings or experiences, but firmly say you do not want advice.


Perhaps your relative has some relationship advice for you and you are not asking people to weigh in. Say, “I’m not asking for advice at this time” or, “I respect your knowledge and your willingness to help, but right now is not a good time for me to receive this advice. When I am ready, I will come to you.”







, Often, this type of advice comes from a good place and is meant to be helpful. Your relative may have a clinical specialty and want to help you. If it’s given without you asking, it’s okay to not accept the advice, even if it’s expert advice. Whatever your reaction, thank them for thinking of you.You can say a simple, “Thank you for thinking of me” and leave it at that.

, If you tend to accept your relative’s advice but are choosing not to this time, it can be trickier to say no. Especially if you respect your relative’s opinion and advice, an occasional no thank you can be difficult to deliver. You may be firm in your no or unsure about it. Either way, don’t be afraid to turn the advice down this time, even if you’ve taken the advice every other time.


Say, “I appreciate the advice you give me regularly and I’ve found it to be really helpful over time. Thanks for the advice on how to treat my depression. At this time, I’m thinking about treating it a different way, but I’ll keep this in mind.”
Keep in mind that most good therapists know that all they can do is offer advice and it is up to the recipient to act on it. Also, remember that you have the right to accept or ignore advice.

Acknowledge their perspective.,
Talk about receiving advice.,
Set some boundaries.,
Maintain some privacy.",How to Turn Down Advice from a Relative Who Is a Therapist2," You might turn down your relative’s advice when you asked for it. If, after some consideration, you have decided on something else, you may want to let your relative know. Tell them that you considered their advice, but chose a different route. Thank them for their time and consideration and for providing their perspective.


For example, say, “I know I asked you for advice about the divorce, and I thank you for your suggestions. I decided to pursue it differently, but I appreciate what you said.”

, If your relative consistently doles out advice, think about how this affects your relationship. The fact that your relative is a therapist can create an uncomfortable dynamic for you. If their advice makes you uncomfortable, say something. Communicate how you feel and how the advice affects you.


For example, say, “I appreciate the advice you give, especially because I know you have some expertise. However, sometimes it makes me feel uncomfortable receiving advice from you as my relative and as a therapist, and I’d rather you not give advice unless I ask for it.”
You can also say, “It’s difficult to turn down advice from you as my relative and as a therapist. I don’t like feeling conflicted in this way with you, so it would be best to keep advice off the table.”

, It is important to set boundaries early in any type of relationship. You may like getting advice, hate it, or appreciate at times and not others. If you don’t want to hear it ever, let your relative know as soon as possible. If you sometimes appreciate some advice, make this clear, too. Clear communication can help your relationship in the long-run.For example, say, “I’d like advice only when I ask for it” or, “I’m not interested in your opinions and I’d rather you kept them to yourself.”
If you enjoy talking to your relative, start conversations with what you want. For example, say, “I don’t want to hear your advice, I just want your support” or, “I’d like some advice on this.”

, If your family tends to know everything about everybody, it may be difficult to maintain a sense of privacy in your personal life. Some families may be more meddling than others, and this can be true with relatives who are therapists as well. If you’d like to have more privacy in your affairs away from your family (and especially your relative), request that your private matters stay private.


For example, if you’re struggling with mental health problems, you may not want your whole family knowing about your struggles and weighing in, no matter how good their intentions are. If you do talk to a family member, say, “I want to confide in you, yet please respect my desire for this to be confidential and do not share it with anyone else.”
You can also say, “This is a difficult time for me, and I feel overwhelmed by lots of advice. I just want support right now.”

Cope with your fears.,
Consider feelings of disappointment.,
Accept your outcomes.",How to Turn Down Advice from a Relative Who Is a Therapist3," If your family respects this relative’s opinion, you might fear the backlash you receive from turning down advice. If other relatives agree with your relative who is a therapist, it can be even harder to go against their advice. Regardless of how other people feel, however, some decisions are only yours to make. Consider the advice, take some deep breaths, and face the choices.For example, if several family members think you should attend Alcoholics Anonymous but you don’t benefit from going, it’s okay to make your own choice, even if you fear their reactions.

, You might be fearful in saying no because you respect your relative and don’t want to hurt or disappoint them (or your family). It’s important to balance disappointing someone with what’s good for you, even if that person offers expert advice. If your judgment concludes you don’t want to take the advice, it’s okay to say no.Sometimes you do things for your family because it’s the right thing to do. Other times, you do things because it’s right for you. Say, “I’m sorry if you feel disappointed that I’m making another choice. I believe this to be what’s best for me.”

, Your relative may give you sound advice, and if you choose not to take it, then you may regret it. This can be a reality, so prepare for whatever outcome arises. Your relative may say, “I told you so” or try to help you get back on your feet. Whatever happens, accept the responsibility of making the decisions for yourself. It is important to hold yourself accountable so that you can learn from your mistakes.

Many people with gambling addictions also suffer from mood disorders or other mental health issues, so medications like mood stabilizers or antidepressants may help you combat your addiction., If you have children or other young relatives in your family, you should tell them what is going on, but only in as much detail as they can understand.

As a result, you may need to explain to your family how gambling makes you feel and why you have been unable to stop thus far.You may really spell out what an addiction feels like. For example, you could say something like, ""It may be difficult for someone who does not have an addiction to understand, but I feel unable to stop myself from gambling even though I know I shouldn't do it. I feel so happy and free while I am gambling, and then I feel bad afterwards, which makes me want to regain that happy feeling by gambling more.""

They may also ask you questions about your finances, which may be uncomfortable, but try to be open and honest.

, If you have any family members who enable your gambling addiction in any way, you need to have a conversation with them about what they need to stop doing.

Another tactic at the dinner table you can try is to ask your teen about the highlight of their day. It could be as simple as a good test score or a funny joke a friend told during lunch. Or it could relate to current news, like the landing of the Mars rover. Share your highlight with your teen as well. Listen to their highlight and don’t interrupt them.;
, If you’re spending a lot of time in the car with your teen as their designated chauffeur, make the most of the driving time and use it to talk. For some drivers, talking in the car can be distracting. So focus more on introducing topics of conversation and then listening to your teen’s responses.Try to keep the conversation natural and open. You could comment on your immediate surroundings (“Did you see that guy make that left turn?” “This traffic light is taking forever, huh?”). Or you could focus on basic topics of conversation like your teens plans for the night, or what time they need a ride home.

, Watch the nightly news together and chat during the commercials. If you’re both into a show on Netflix, pause between episodes. Recap what just happened in the last scene or your thoughts on what will happen in the next episode.This will give you and your teen something in common to discuss and will likely lead to natural banter between the two of you. Short bursts of communication are a good way to get a quiet teen to talk.

, Some teens find it easier to talk at night. Knock on their door and ask if they have time for a talk. Sit with them in their room and ask them about their day before they go to bed.Another way to start a conversation at night is to greet your teen after a night out and offer them a snack. This will show them that you are available for a chat about their night. After time with their friends, your teen may let their guard down and share more with you.
Try a conversation starter like: “So, how was your night?” or “You looked so great when you went out. How did it go?” Or, “It was nice to meet your friend when she picked you up. Where did you guys end up tonight?”
Avoid interrogating your teen. Try not to act aggressive or ask them where they’ve been all night long. Waiting up for them and pouncing on them as soon as they get through the door will likely only turn them off or make them less willing to talk. Offering them a snack or dessert when they get home will seem more casual and open.

, No matter what your teen’s interests-- sports, music, fashion, TV, video games, friends, school work--be open to talking about them. Work on being a good listener and try to show genuine interest in what your teen enjoys discussing.A good rule of thumb is to listen twice as much as you speak. This ensures you are giving your teen enough time and attention to talk about their interests., Teens are great at doing or saying things that annoy their parents or elders. Rather than react emotionally to their actions or words, consider why they be pushing your buttons. The answer could be resentment towards being late for an important event, or simply that they are being a moody teenager.By reflecting on your responses to your teen, you can find the root of the problem or issue. This will likely also lead to less fighting and more talking.

, This can be difficult to do, as you may feel you need to serve as a good role model for your teen. But acknowledging when you made a mistake will allow your teen to see you are human, and someone they can relate to. In fact, admitting a wrong and apologizing sets a positive example for your teen. “I’m sorry” are powerful words for a teen to hear from their parents or authority figure.This kind of positive communication will give your teen a chance to learn how to talk honestly and respectfully with others, even when they disagree. They will also learn to feel more confident when discussing their feelings with others, including you.

, Chances are you will hear your teen say something you disagree with. But its important to avoid statements like, “That’s a stupid decision,” or “You’re wrong about that boy.” Instead, try to offer an opinion by saying, “I understand where you’re coming from but this is how I see it…”. Or “I’m here to listen, but let me know if you want any advice from me.”


Start by noting your teen’s feelings. “You seem upset about what happened last night.” Using a statement rather than a question will make the phrase sound more like a suggestion, rather than an accusation.
Give them all your attention and listen to what they have to say. Put your phone away, turn off the TV, or shut the door. Make your teen feel like they have the floor.
Offer help or advice once they have finished speaking. Ask them: “Is there something I can do to help?” or “Would you like some advice?”
Often, teens just need to talk about issues or problems to someone they trust and respect. They may not be seeking the answer to a problem or an easy solution. So, be willing to listen to them, rather than lecture them.

, These aggressive actions will likely kill any meaningful conversations with your teen. Remember you are trying to talk to your teen, not shout them down or get upset at them.

, Agree to private phone calls behind a closed door, but set ground rules. No calls after midnight or during dinner, for example. Ask your teen where they will be when they go out at night, but don’t call them every five minutes to confirm. Show your teen you respect and trust them by not encroaching on their privacy. This will likely make them more willing to share their thoughts or feelings with you.It’s important to respect your teen’s privacy in small ways. This could be knocking on their bedroom door before entering their room. Or asking for permission to come into the bathroom before you enter.
Avoid barging in on your teen at different times of day. Schedule a time with them to talk about their latest test score or cleaning up their room. Don’t catch your teen off guard, as this may lead to a fight. If you usually discuss these issues at dinner or in the car, bring them up with your teen during your usual time.

, A move across the country or a major financial decision will affect your teen’s world. So rather than spring the decision on your teen, consult with them about a major life change. Talking to them about the decision and listening to their opinion will show you respect their point of view. It will also likely make the change less painful for your teen and help them to adapt to the change., Build trust between you and your teen by keeping your conversations confidential. That is, unless there is an issue you feel you need to discuss with your partner or another adult.If you end up sharing your teen's private words, this may shut down communication. Your teen may not want to risk offering their intimate thoughts or opinions to you again. Don't betray their trust by revealing what they told you in confidence.

, If it was a sad or serious announcement, give them time to process and let their emotions out. That will make them feel better. If it is manageable, then ease them up by cracking a joke.

Consider asking the sufferer to explain what he or she is going through, but do so in a way that doesn't apply any additional pressure. For instance, you might say, “If you ever feel like talking about everything that's going on, I would like to learn more about what you're going through and would be more than willing to listen.”
You can also research the situation in more general terms. For example, if a loved one has been diagnosed with depression, consider reading articles and books about the illness so that you can come to understand a little more about the way it works.;
, When another person is in pain, do not ignore that pain or try to look away from it. Observing that pain firsthand will usually allow you to develop more sincere compassion for the person experiencing it.Suffering makes most people uncomfortable, so it can be easy to turn a blind eye to it. Instead of running to escape that discomfort, let your discomfort inspire you to act in a way that can help remove the suffering that causes it.

, Ask yourself how you would likely feel if you were in the other person's situation. You may not be able to gain a complete understanding, but even developing some idea of what the other person may feel can help evoke greater sympathy in you.


If you've never experienced the exact same pain, use your memory of a similar experience to try imagining how great the other person's present grief is.
For instance, you may not know how it feels when a spouse, parent, child, or sibling passes away, so sympathizing with someone who has lost a loved one to death may seem difficult. Think about a time when you experienced a loss of your own, even if it wasn't something as serious—your childhood best friend moving, a messy break-up or divorce—and think of how it might be if that feeling of loss were even more severe.

, Depending on the circumstances, the person in pain may lash out at you during his or her time of need. You don't need to take any and all abuse that comes your way, but understand that the other person may not mean anything personal when acting that way.


Remember that your loved one's pain is about them, not you. If your attempts at comforting him or her don't seem to make a difference, do not get angry about it.
This doesn't mean that you should neglect your own emotional needs, of course. If you receive nothing but verbal abuse throughout the ordeal, there may come a time when you need to take a step back for the sake of your own sanity. Do so without making any accusations or hurtful remarks, though.

, Sympathy allows you to feel compassion and support toward someone who is suffering, while empathy allows you to understand and share another person's grief.You can feel sympathetic without feeling empathetic. If you have never experienced the sort of pain your loved one is suffering through or cannot fathom why someone grieves as severely as he or she does, don't worry about it. What you lack is empathy, not sympathy.
If you are unable to understand or feel the grief your loved one feels, you can still recognize that the grief exists and nurture a desire to support him or her through it. As long as you can do that much, you are technically sympathizing with the distressed party.

, Tell the other person that you know he or she is hurting right now. You may not understand exactly how the pain feels, but simply acknowledging that the pain exists can show support.In general, nearly any statement that shows support while acknowledging the grief that's present can be helpful. Consider any of the following statements:

""I'm sorry for your pain.""
""You're in my thoughts/prayers.""
""This must be difficult for you.""



, When something hurts, it hurts, and being told that it shouldn't hurt as much as it does can actually make a suffering person feel worse.


Avoid saying things like, ""I know how you feel."" Every person's grief is different, and speaking as though this isn't the case can evoke a sense of bitterness or isolation in the person grieving.
Similarly, avoid statements like ""You'll feel better soon"" or ""This isn't a big deal."" You may think that you're encouraging the other person to look forward at the future, but criticizing one's grief or pressuring someone to get over it can cause more harm than good.

, Directly express your desire to support the person who is suffering. Don't say anything you don't mean, but don't let the other person remain in the dark about the sympathy you feel or him or her.


A simple “I love you,” “I'm on your side,” or “I'm here to listen if you want to talk” can mean a lot to someone in the midst of his or her grief. Having an ally often makes it easier to push through difficult circumstances.
Use words that offer reassurance. For example, if someone with depression feels unworthy of being loved, say something like, ""I love you for who you are and I am not going to abandon you."" Frequent reassurance can help calm otherwise unruly grief and anxiety., There are times when the only thing you can say will sound like nothing more than a cliché, and that's okay. On the other hand, there are also times when you need to push past those cliches and say something a little more personal.


The exact “right words” will vary on a case by case basis.
When sympathizing with someone who lost a loved one, for instance, you might get personal by sharing pleasant stories about the deceased individual or by describing your own experiences regarding a similar loss. Make sure that the losses are truly similar, though; do not compare the death of a spouse to the death of your dog.

, Don't run away from the other person and resist any efforts that he or she may exert to drive you away. Stay with the other person through the mess so that he or she can recognize your sincerity.


If your loved one needs space, though, don't push yourself on him or her. Say that you respect his or her desire for alone time, but before you leave, make sure the other party knows that you are willing to return when needed. Check in periodically, too, just in case your loved one is in need of some company but felt too awkward or embarrassed to call for you.

, When the suffering individual reaches out to you, respond back. Do not ignore a cry for help, even if it comes at an inconvenient time.


No matter how it may seem, when someone reaches out to you, that person is seeking a connection. If your loved one didn't want to connect, he or she would've remained silent.
Respond in as positive a manner as possible. Sound sincere and take the necessary time to sit down and address the emotions your loved one is revealing to you.

, Showing support is just as important as speaking support. Instead of asking to help in a general way, though, it would be much better to ask about helping with something specific.Avoid saying something general like, ""Call me if you need anything."" You might be sincere, but a vague statement like this places the burden of reaching out on the shoulders of the sufferer.
Instead, a better option would be to say something like, ""I could help by (watching the kids, hanging out with you, bringing you a meal, etc.)."" Mention a specific task you would like to help with and follow up a few days later by calling them to ask when a convenient time might be.
There are plenty of concrete things you can offer to help with. You can clean the house, cook a meal, watch someone's children, or offer to take care of any other ordinary household task during a tough time. On the other hand, you may also show support simply by offering to sit with them, play games, or see a movie.
Regardless of what you choose to do, make sure that it is something the other person is open to. Do not force your goodwill on someone who would rather have space.

, Touch is a powerful tool used to convey affection and support. When appropriate, offer support in the form of a hug or casual touch.


Touch utilizes a tangible sense to convey support. By reaching out to touch someone, you are delivering a well-rounded message of support that is physical as well as psychological.
When sympathizing with a loved one, you can use touch in the form of a hug, a kiss, a pat on the head, or a squeeze of the hand.
When dealing with an acquaintance or relative stranger, most people will feel comfortable enough with a quick pat on the arm in between the shoulder and elbow. Anything more personal may make the other person more uncomfortable, though.

, You probably won't be able to fix the other party's problem. Only worry about doing what you can do and try not to stress out about the things you cannot do for the other person.


This also means knowing your own emotional limits. Support your suffering loved one, but don't let your desire to support him or her consume your life. If you completely wear yourself out, you won't be able to help anyone.

Tell them in person if you can.,
Consider letting them know non-verbally.,
Speak slowly and calmly.,
Ask for your siblings’ support.,
Be patient.,
Anticipate questions that might come up.",How to Tell Your Siblings You Are Bisexual1," There are plenty of ways you can go about sharing the information you’re hoping to convey to your siblings. Your relationship with them, as well as any potential qualms on their part will factor into this decision.It may seem hard to bring up the conversation. You can ease into a more serious conversation by saying something like, “There’s something important that I want to tell you because you mean a lot to me.”
Also include some reassurance with a statement that indicates your comfort with you own bisexuality. Say something like, “I’m happy and healthy!”
Consider telling your siblings one at a time. This route offers you the chance to take a different approach with each of the people you hope to share the news with.
For instance, you may have a sibling with whom a conversation in the car may work best, so as to facilitate a conversational dynamic in which eye contact isn’t as frequent as it may be face-to-face.
Be straightforward. If your siblings may be unsure what you mean when you tell them you’re bisexual, follow up with “I’m attracted to both men and women.”
Go for a walk. Walking may be the very best way to have any sort of conversation with anyone. The fresh air, the mobility, the privacy, and more all provide a comfortable context in which to share a meaningful, heartfelt conversation.
However you choose to tell your siblings, be sure to include something along the lines of “I love you, and I want us to have an honest, positive relationship.”;
, A face-to-face conversation may be too intense for either you or your siblings. Some people will benefit from the distance and time allowed to digest the news, whereas a face-to-face conversation may lead to rash or overly emotional reactions.


Especially if you came from a home that was aggressively religious, culturally one-dimensional, or generally lacking in conversations about sex, notifying your siblings of your sexual orientation might initially upset them.
While texts and phone calls could work, writing a letter might be the best way to tell somehow who might need a while to come to terms with the news. Calls risk putting someone in a situation where they feel like they need to respond, and may not know how. Texts are a rather impersonal way to communicate, unless you’ve developed a communication style with one of your siblings that would facilitate the use of texts to convey something meaningful.
Letters, on the other hand, allow you to express your thoughts openly, slowly, and clearly. You can also express your love for your siblings and share everything you would want to in a face-to-face conversation, and allow them the chance to read it at their pace and contact you when they are ready to speak with you.Start the letter by sharing how important your family is to you, and that you always want their support. Include statements like, “I’m writing to share a part of myself with you, because I value our relationship” and “More than anything, I always want to have your love your support, and you always have mine.”

, If you’re with your siblings when you tell them, you want to be sure everyone understands what you’re saying. More importantly, you want to convey a comfortable calmness. Even if you feel understandably nervous, remaining calm will help your siblings stay calm as well.One option is to gather all of those you hope to speak with in a private place and explain that you want them to know something that means a great deal to you.
Explain simply that you feel your sexuality is a significant aspect of who you are and that you want to talk about it with them. Again, be clear that you’re comfortable and content with your sexuality, as this may assuage some concerns that they may otherwise have.
Try something like, “I’m comfortable with my sexual orientation and I’m happier and more confident than I ever have been. Of course, I still want you all to be a part of my life, and to maintain the love we share.”

, We all need support in our lives, especially when we’re going through periods of increasing self-awareness and transformation. Support from our siblings in particular is an incredibly significant source of our internal strength, our ability to connect with others, and our well-being in general.Tell your siblings you value the relationships you have with them, that they have your support, and that you hope to have their support as well.
Share any experiences of isolation you’ve felt, particularly on account of any of your family members’ behavior.
If your siblings are unable to provide you with emotional and other forms of support quite yet, find a community in which you can get the support you need.

, You don’t know how the conversation will go ahead of time. It may go better than expected, and you may wind up feeling relieved and ecstatic to have spoken with your siblings about something so important to you. But some of your siblings may seem worried, angry, or even responsible. They may need time and space to come to terms with what you’re telling them.As much as you’ve thought about your own sexuality, recognize that they may not have given it too much thought.
Know that feelings of shock, denial, and even guilt are common among family members encountering this sort of news. While this is unfortunate, don’t be surprised if your siblings seem surprised at first.
Allow them to express their own feelings, and listen calmly and patiently to their responses.
Know that you may have to repeat yourself. Sometimes people will deny, resist, or ignore your bisexuality. You may even need to have a similar conversation again, perhaps after they’ve have a while to come to terms with what you already told them.

, These may include some personal, and potentially even intimate questions. Know that you don’t have to answer any question that makes you uncomfortable, but that your answers may help them come to terms with your bisexuality.


Your siblings may be curious or even confused about what your telling them. They may have all sorts of questions about how you can be sure and what bisexuality is and more. Be open and honest with them, but know that short, simple answers will usually suffice.
They may object to what you’re telling them. Don’t try to reason them into accepting your identity. If they’re resistant to the idea, you will not be able to reason with them.
It may be best to answer questions you aren’t sure how to answer by re-iterating that you only want their love. Be explicit by saying things like “All I need from you is your love and support.”They may even be skeptical. If you get the all-to-common “How do you know?”, feel free to answer simply by saying, “I just know!”

"
"
Know the facts.,
Know that people are sometimes especially skeptical of bisexuality.,
Rise above it.,
Stay positive.",How to Tell Your Siblings You Are Bisexual2," Though the concept of bisexuality is often particularly hard for some to come to terms with, understanding bisexuality can be extremely helpful in learning more about sexual orientation, gender, and even the mysteries of attraction and our subsequent treatment of one another.Recognize that bisexuality is more common than homosexuality. Yup. Even people who recognize that sexuality and gender are fluid are often surprised to learn of the greater frequency with which people identify as bisexual.
While some people assume bisexuality is more common for women, many men identify as bisexual as well.

, Insecurity, bigotry, and ignorance bring out to worst in people, and many people – even people you may love – may not initially recognize your right to identify as you wish.Bisexuality is especially tough for some people to accept. Even people who are comfortable with the concept of homosexuality may reject the concept of bisexuality because it may radically challenge their assumptions about sexual orientations.
An inability to comfortably categorize other’s as either alike or different from themselves, especially in the context of behavior or identity regarding aspects of our lives (like sex) that some people are especially sensitive about can lead to particularly vehement demonstrations of insecurity.
Never allow your siblings to hurt or disrespect you. If they use offensive or aggressive language, or become visibly angry, postpone the rest of the discussion until everyone is calm. Have a friend or parent talk to them if this behavior continues.

, We live in a heterosexist society. The assumption that heterosexuality is “normal” is an extremely significant aspect of many people’s thoughts and behaviors. Challenges to this assumption, including real-world evidence that contradicts heteronormativity, commonly make people uncomfortable. This discomfort is what the term homophobia refers to.Know that people’s fear does not mean they cannot learn to be more understanding. Often, people are unaware of their prejudice. This does not justify any rude or insensitive behavior. If you are mistreated by people who are bigoted or otherwise insecure, know that it has nothing to do with you.
Many people still do not understand the incredible complexity of human sexual orientation. Though we celebrate diversity in other ways, many people are judgmental of people who identify with minority categories of sexual identity.
Most people’s views will change as they have more positive interactions with people like you!

, Simply by being a positive, friendly person, you may help people recognize that sexual orientation does not at all dictate your worth and quality as an individual.


Social equality in terms of sexual orientation is rising, and your ability to have conversations about how you identify with your friends and family will help facilitate this process.
Do not feel as though it is your responsibility, or that you are obligated in any way to educate people about the way that you or others identify. Simply know that when these conversations do occur, they do help people better understand the diversity, wonder, and excitement that members of our species are capable of sharing with one another.

"
"
Build up the necessary courage.,
Talk to others beforehand.,
Take care of yourself.,
Find support online.",How to Tell Your Siblings You Are Bisexual3," The tension associated with uncertainty about whether you should tell people in your life about your sexual orientation can contribute to stress and unhappiness. If you want to share your identity with your siblings and feel ready to do so, go for it!


If you’re nervous, know that you’re not alone. In fact, less than a quarter of people who identify as bisexual are entirely open about it with others.If you don’t feel ready to tell your siblings, or simply don’t want to, it’s entirely okay. There’s no reason you have to do so, and it’s fine to wait until you feel comfortable doing so.

, Consider getting someone else’s advice on how to begin the conversation and how to respond to any potential responses. By speaking to those who know you and your siblings, you can be better prepared to ensure the conversation goes smoothly and respectfully.


Talk to a friend who has had similar conversations before.
Talk to one of your parents.
Consider inviting someone to join the conversation. Tell them that you don’t need them to speak for you, but that their support would help.

, Your own self-confidence and sense of self-worth depends on your ability to accept the sexual orientation you identify with. Embracing your sexuality as a meaningful part of who you are will help you stand up to the unique challenges you may face as a bisexual person.Don’t allow yourself to become consumed by emotional turmoil. Wishing, or worse, praying to be different than you are is a sure way to guarantee your own unhappiness.
Questioning who you are makes it harder to achieve goals in your life generally, and makes it more likely that you will become depressed or overuse substances.
Recognize negative, detrimental, or dangerous behaviors before they take over your life. If you’re struggling with addiction or depression, get professional help.
Speak with a therapist or counselor. While you know your siblings better than most people, there are also trained professional who can help you deal with experiences such as those you’re going through.
Again, you’re not alone. Almost a third of LGBT youth attempt suicide. If you ever have suicidal thoughts, call 1(800) 273-8255.

, There are countless websites geared towards bisexual people that offer information and stories. Even better, there are online communities of people who are ready and willing to support you.


Check out the It Gets Better Project. This website posts supportive stories from people who identify as having a minority sexual orientation. Stories are posted by people from all over the world.Visit Being Gay is OK. This website is designed specifically for people under 25, and provides helpful, supportive advice for young people coming to terms with their sexuality.Explore the LGBT Foundation website. The foundation’s website provides a wealth of information on available types of support and much more."

Local churches, particularly churches in downtown districts and rural areas, often operate food banks or soup kitchens. These can be a good source of aid to help you get back on your feet as well.
A nationwide locator for food banks can be found at http://www.feedingamerica.org/find-your-local-foodbank/.;
, A bad situation like homelessness is only made worse if you lose important documents like Social Security cards, birth certificates, and any other documents that go toward proving you and your children’s identities and medical conditions.


Protect these documents. Find a locker to rent where you can store these items. Bus stations and subways typically offer very low cost lockers for rent.
It is often necessary to carry items like driver’s licenses and State ID cards with you. While a wallet works fine, wallets can often be targets for theft. Consider keeping your ID in a separate watertight container, such as a Ziplock bag.

, This may sound absurd, but gyms have facilities that homeless people need desperately, often for low cost.Almost all gyms have showers and lockers, and many more have a host of other amenities. Many gyms are open 24 hours a day.
Memberships can be had for as little as $20 per month at many major chains. Try Planet Fitness, Cardinal Fitness, LA Fitness, the YMCA, and Gold’s. As of 2016, the prices for basic memberships at those chains ranged from $10-$30 per month., Many homeless people are living out of their cars. If this is your situation, then you need to find a safe place to park.The best option is probably the parking lot of a 24 hour establishment in a reasonably well-lit location. There will most likely be enough traffic to deter predators, there might be security patrols, and in many cases, surveillance cameras. This location can be a gym, but there are many 24 hour grocery stores that would fit the bill as well.

, If you don’t have a car, you’ll need to find emergency shelter for yourself and your children. The policies and eligibility requirements of each shelter vary, and the rules can be specific, rigid, and restrictive, so be sure to ask.


The Salvation Army is one resource for emergency shelter. Locate a Salvation Army branch at http://www.salvationarmyusa.org/usn/housing-and-homeless-services.
You can also locate shelters that receive federal funds on https://resources.hud.gov/. Simply click on the option that says “locate homeless resources.”

, Once you have found emergency food, bathroom facilities, and some type of shelter, you need to make sure that you can communicate effectively, particularly with emergency services.


Although there prepaid “burner” phones are an option, the best option is probably the Lifeline Program. Lifeline phones are subsidized by the US government specifically for low-income people. Apply at http://www.usac.org/li/.
For 2016, Lifeline phones come with 500 voice minutes and 500 MB of mobile data at 3G speeds.Eligible parties include: people with income at 135% or less of the Federal Poverty Level; who are on Medicaid, SNAP, or Head Start; receive Federal Public Housing Assistance, certain types of Veteran’s Pensions or Survivor’s Benefits or any one of numerous types of aid administered by the American Indian Tribal governments., Not only is it mandatory for your children to be in school, it helps their well-being and keeps the authorities off of your case.


If you don't have a permanent address, use the address of your emergency shelter. A lot of school districts will have specific policies to address homeless parents, but this is probably going to be your best bet if you want to avoid questions. For location-specific information, look up the residency policies of your local school district.
Keeping your kids in school also allows you to apply for the free lunch programs, which reduces the financial burden on yourself.

, Being poor is not a crime, and poverty is generally not grounds for losing custody for your children. However, not being able to shelter and feed your family is usually grounds for losing custody.Food and shelter are terms which are construed liberally. Emergency shelter counts as shelter, and so does your car.

, If your children are 5 or younger, enrolling them in a Head Start program can serve some of the same function that having them in school would have.


Head Start encompasses a variety of services that might be broadly called day care. However, Head Start is far more comprehensive than an ordinary day care, providing nutritional, health, and educational assistance.
Head Start programs last from four hours to eight hours, although programs for 0-3 year olds are at least six hours per day.
Locate a local Head Start program at https://eclkc.ohs.acf.hhs.gov/hslc/HeadStartOffices.

, This can be your extended family, a friend, or a foster family.


The state foster system should be your last resort. Not only will it create a record of state involvement, but you will have to meet certain conditions to get your children back. In other words, they get to decide when to give you your children back, not you.
Although a trusted friend or family member will most likely be your first and best option, if you can't find one who is willing to take temporary care of your children, there is a non-profit that may be able to help. Safe-families.org helps parents in precarious situations make arrangements to care for their children with other volunteer families. They are not part of the state foster system, so you can get your children back whenever you are ready., Sleeping in your car or at an emergency shelter can be fine for a short term solution, but finding permanent shelter is a must.


The Federal government operates a number of programs offering housing assistance for low-income people which are usually administered by state and local agencies. These include Section 8 Housing Vouchers, public housing projects, and subsidized private housing.The HUD website at https://resources.hud.gov/ is probably the best place to start to find available options in your area. Plus, it has links to all of the state housing authorities, which should let you know if your state offers additional aid.
Private charities also assist in finding housing for homeless individuals and families. However, the vast majority are strictly local. Some national charities offering housing assistance include: http://www.coabode.org, http://www.habitat.org/, and http://www.salvationarmyusa.org/usn/housing-and-homeless-services. Also, http://bridgeofhopeinc.org/ and http://www.mercyhousing.org/propertylocations operate in 12 and 21 states, respectively.

, All states have varying requirements for Medicare. While many states allow adults who are not disabled (and simply poor) to enroll, many other states do not. Check to see if you can apply at https://www.medicaid.gov/apply-for-coverage/apply-for-coverage.html


Even states with the most restrictive Medicaid eligibility requirements allow impoverished children to enroll in Medicaid, so you can make sure that your children receive medical care if you can’t., SNAP stands for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. It’s what used to be called “Food Stamps.” These days, people aren’t issued stamps, they’re issued cards. It’s one of the most widely used government assistance programs.


Like many governmental assistance programs, the eligibility requirements are determined by a multi-factor formula, and since each state has a different cost of living, income requirements can vary from state to state.Generally, SNAP eligibility is pegged to the poverty level—you need to be at the poverty level to be eligible for SNAP.However, poverty is determined by your net income after many deductions are made. You can check your eligibility at http://www.snap-step1.usda.gov/fns/.
If you still have questions about the process, check out the guide at Apply for Food Stamps in the US


, TANF stands for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. It’s what a lot of people think of when they think of “welfare,” meaning that it’s a straight cash benefit. It’s also one of the most difficult forms of public assistance to get. Learn more about the process at Get Welfare


As is the case with many of these programs, states determine eligibility requirements. However, In every state but Wisconsin, the maximum eligible income for receiving TANF is less than the federal poverty level.The benefits can also be heartbreakingly low. States also have a lot of control over how much they give in aid, and the least generous states give very, very, little. In Mississippi, for example, an individual making $100 a month would only receive about $170 in TANF benefits."

Acknowledge and grieve the loss of never having a true mother.,
Avoid trying to change your mother.,
Obtain a strong support system.,
Distance yourself from your mother.",How to Survive With a Narcissistic Mother," A real mother puts her child’s physical and emotional needs above her own, however if you’ve lived or are currently living with a narcissistic mother, her needs must be met first.


Don’t try to figure out why. In some cases your mother was the victim of a narcissistic mother herself or another kind of abuse. In other cases perhaps your mother never really “grew up” and hasn’t realized that the world is a bigger place than just her. Either way, it’s her problem not yours.
Try not to ponder “what if?” You were dealt this kind of mother for a reason--not to punish you but instead to perhaps challenge you or inspire you to rise above. Wistfully thinking about what could have been if you had a different mother will only make the situation more painful.
Go through the actual grieving process. You’ve finally realized that your mother will not change and you’ve been given a mother who only thinks of one person--herself. Give yourself time to grieve so you can move onto healing.;
, Perhaps you believe that if you are better behaved or get that big promotion at work your mother will finally recognize you and be proud. You’ve done nothing wrong, but unfortunately any act of greatness will be wasted on a narcissist.

, Depending on your age, surround yourself with caring, loving people who truly care about you and your well-being. If you are still living at home it may be your friends, relatives or boyfriend/girlfriend. Adults can turn to their spouse or friends as well.


If you are an adult and have children, don’t use their love as a crutch. As much as you may want to turn to your child when your mother is upsetting you ( they can still do that well into adulthood), stop yourself and redirect your emotions. Children will not only misunderstand what you are trying to tell them, they may become concerned that the same thing could happen to them.
If you have trouble securing support, consult with a trained therapist who can suggest an actual support group for children of narcissistic mothers.

, As difficult as that may sound getting away from someone like this may be the only way you can move toward healing.


If you still live at home, avoid getting close. Often narcissistic people will sense when others are pulling away and act as though they are taking interest only to go back to their old ways once they have captivated their “audience” (you). Try to maintain minimal contact with your mother at home--consider her behavior as more of an amusement, which is nothing serious and has no weight on your life.
Move away from your mother. Limited contact will most likely work best for you, especially if you live in different towns or states. If you find that talking on the phone with your mother gets you upset, only take phone calls when you are mentally prepared to deal with her--don’t allow her to take you off guard, upsetting you and ruining your day.
Maintain a level of contact that makes you comfortable. If completely abandoning the relationship, never looking back is the only way you can move on, do whatever you can to heal. However, some children still feel guilty completely letting go and may feel obligated to provide financial assistance to their narcissistic mother--if that does not weigh heavily on your spirit allow yourself to provide for your mother. Remember it's not about her, it's about healing you and moving on.

Articulate your vision for your wedding.,
Find room for compromise.,
Pick your battles.,
Remind them gently that this is your wedding.,
Ask for their advice.,
Give them a project.,
Fund it yourself.",How to Stop Your Parents from Controlling Your Wedding Plans1," Perhaps your parents are pushing back on your wedding plans because they don’t fully understand them. Spend some time talking to them about your ideal day and you might find that they will get on board and support you in achieving it.You might say “Dad, I know you always thought I would get married in our church. But since I was a little girl, I’ve loved the beach. I’ve always thought of myself getting married on the beach. And that’s where Chris proposed to me so it’s even more special. I hope you’ll support me.”;
, Find ways to compromise with your parents in small ways. You might not allow them to pick out your flowers, but perhaps you will let them be the tiebreaker between you and your fiancee if you can’t decide. Or perhaps your parents are against you having an open bar wedding; opt instead to have guests purchase their own alcoholic beverages., Know when to battle with your parents and when to refrain. If your family is set on peach as opposed to coral place settings, let her have it. However, for larger things like food or venue, advocate persuasively for your desires., If they continue to push back against you, despite all you have done, continuously remind them kindly that it is your wedding day. Tell them that you will forever remember this day as the day that you joined yourself to your spouse and it is important for you to do that in the way that you see as best so that you have no regrets.


You can say “Mom, we have talked about this a few times, and I’m hoping you can be a little more understanding soon. I love and respect you very much but please don’t buy those flowers for my wedding. Can you help me choose some different ones?”

, Before making any final decisions, consult with them for advice. They likely have more experience with weddings than you do and could be of great assistance. Also, if they are paying, they have the final say anyway., Your parents might be interjecting into your business because they feel that they don’t have a part in the planning process. Find some aspect of planning that you have not yet completed or that you don’t have much stake in and allow them to handle that.For instance, perhaps you need help finding a florist or photographer. Ask your parents to find a few and then select one from their options.

, If your parents are paying for the wedding, they should get a say. If you want to have more control over how that day will go, then you will need to work to pay for it yourself.Get a second job, sell some of your old stuff, find deals online, or see if your fiancee’s parents can chip in more.

Talk to your parents about their role.,
Invite the guests you want.,
Talk about the wedding minimally.,
Use their strengths.",How to Stop Your Parents from Controlling Your Wedding Plans2," When enduring this power struggle with your parents, be sure to clarify their role in the wedding planning process. Remind them that you are the one getting married and tell them that you will always consider their suggestions. Avoid always saying “don’t” or “no” to them, but do remind that you do have the final say.You might say “Mom, I’ve always wanted a mermaid shaped wedding gown, but I do think that the ballgown that you picked out looked nice. I really felt like a bride in the dress that I picked out and I hope that you respect my decision.”

, Though you parents may want you to invite your second cousin by marriage twice removed, know that you do not have to. Say ‘no’ to them in a polite way when they try to make any unwanted additions.Go over the budget with them as well if you cannot afford additional guests.

, If your family is not contributing financially to the wedding, keep the talk of it to a minimum when together. Though your wedding is an important day, it is not worth suffering unnecessary stress over. Inform them of any necessary information, like their role, the date, and time, but avoid discussing other details that you might argue over.If they try to engage with you about it, you might say something like “You know Mom, the last time we talked about the wedding, we both got really upset. But I will say that Jess and I picked a nice venue that we’re really excited about. Now can we talk about something else?”

, If you know that your mom has an eye for decoration and your dad has a lot of connections in the area, use this. Doing so will allow them to feel useful while you are also planning your perfect wedding."

Have necessary conversations in person.,
Find out what’s most important to them.,
Be understanding.,
Ask your other family members to help.,
Enlist the help of your wedding planner.",How to Stop Your Parents from Controlling Your Wedding Plans3," Conversations over text or email can be easily misconstrued. When possible, speak to your parents in person or by phone to discuss important wedding matters., Your parents might be trying to control every aspect of your wedding because they feel that they don’t have a say. Talk to them to find out what they care about the most and see if they have any concerns that they haven’t told you about.You might find that your mom trying to pick the bridesmaid’s dresses really comes from her desire to be involved in general. Pick a few potential dresses and then get her input on the ones she likes the best. Involve her in other ways, as well.

, Though you are likely frustrated that they are trying to control your day, try to be as understanding as possible. Your parents probably care about you very much and want your wedding to be perfect. Your wedding will be one day, but they are your parents forever.However, your parents may have always been controlling and overbearing. Understand that this has been their dynamic with you since you were a child and work to change that now so that you can have your wedding as you like it.

, If you are about to attend a family function or any other gathering that your parents will be at, call in the reinforcements. Ask your other family members to exist as a buffer and take up for you and advocate for your autonomy in your wedding.For instance, if you know your dad is trying to get you to select a certain caterer that you don’t want for the wedding, you might tell your sister beforehand so that she can tell him it’s your decision and that she likes the food you’ve chosen.

, If you have a wedding planner, consider using them as a buffer when having conversations with your parents. They are there to help you create your vision, not your parents. They can also be objective when the two of you might be emotional and can provide solutions or compromises that you may not have considered."

Determine your eligibility.,
Attend an information session.,
Take part in a training session.,
Submit an application.,
Undergo assessment.,
Work with the birth family.",How to Adopt in Australia1," Many people in Australia hope to adopt a child born in the country. The process begins with determining whether you are eligible.


You must be married or have been in a stable relationship for two years. You must be able to provide evidence of this.You must be physically healthy enough to raise a child. This usually means you must be around the age that someone would typically have a child.;
, Information sessions are held on a regular basis to explain the process of adopting and to help you determine whether or not adoption is right for you and your family. You must attend one of these sessions to proceed.You'll need to check out the website for your state's human services department to determine when and where the next session will be held.

, If you decide adoption is right for you, your next step is to attend a training session that will give a more detailed understanding of the process and help prepare you for some of the challenges that can come with adopting a child.If you or your spouse have undergone fertility treatment in an attempt to have your own child, you may not participate in a a training session until six months have passed, to ensure that you aren't currently pregnant.

, Once you've completed the necessary training, you'll have to fill out a detailed application. This application will be used to verify your eligibility and suitability to adopt, and will require the following:A police check
A medical checks
A working-with-children check (used to verify that you haven't been charged with or convicted of harming a child)References
If you're in a de facto (non-married) relationship, documentary evidence will also be required.

, There is a formal assessment process that will be used to predict whether you will be a suitable adoptive parent. The process typically takes three to four months.The assessment will consider your age, health, relationships, stability, and ability to provide financially for an adopted child., In Australia, the birth family of a child does not end their relationship with a child they have given up for adoption. They have a say in selecting a family to adopt their child. They may also have visitation rights.If a birth family selects you as a good family to raise their surrendered child, you may end up working closely with the birth family until the child reaches adulthood.

Travel to meet and pick up the child.,
Finalize your permanent adoption arrangement.",How to Adopt in Australia2," Adopting from overseas is an even more complicated process, but may provide more options. The first step is to contact the office in your state that oversees adoption and alert them to your intentions..


The agency will provide you with the necessary information and paperwork for the adoption process. In particular, they will give you an Expression of Interest document, which is necessary to proceed in the adoption process in some states.
Intercountry Adoption has an online directory of the relevant agencies., Submit a form formally expressing your interest in intercountry adoption to the appropriate department or agency in your state.


Note that just as in domestic adoptions, certain eligibility requirements apply. You must be married or have been in a stable relationship for two years. You must not have undergone fertility treatment in the last six months, and you must not have had another child under your care for less than a year.Guides are available from the state to help you complete this form.Note that not every state requires you to submit this form before proceeding to informational seminars., Once the state department handling adoption receives your Expression of Interest form, they will let you know that they received it. The form will be reviewed by the department and if you qualify, you will need to attend the seminar.


Depending on the state you live in, you will need to attend one or more seminars describing the process and responsibilities required to adopt a child.If you are adopting a child that is more than 2 years old, you may also need to schedule and attend the Older Child Seminar.
You'll receive an application at the seminar.In some states, you must complete this application within a certain number of weeks following the seminar, or you will be required to attend again.

, Complete and submit your application to the state. Your application will be reviewed by an assessor who will determine your eligibility and suitability for adoption.This will include a police background check, verification of health and relationship status, and so on.

, If your state approves your application, it will forward it on to the country from which you are hoping to adopt. It will then be up to that country's government to determine whether you will be allowed to adopt.If the country in question has a quota on how many applications it accepts per year, your application may not be sent right away.
If your application is approved, you will be placed on a waiting list for a child.
Wait times vary by country, but you should expect to wait for a while. In 2013-2014, the average wait time was five years.

, Once a child has been selected for you, the Australian government must make a determination as to whether the child is eligible to immigrate.Since the child will not be able to file this paperwork him or herself, you will need to complete it.


The paperwork for an adoption visa is available from the Department of Immigration and Border Protection.You'll need to include certified copies of documents proving your citizenship, a police check, the child's birth certificate, and other pertinent documentation. Having these documents ready in advance will speed up the application process. Do not send original documents.

, Once your visa application is accepted, you'll need to travel to the child's home country to meet and accept the child allocated to you, and to bring him or her home.While you are overseas, you will likely also need to complete some adoption procedures with the government of the child's home country, such as court hearings finalizing the adoption with that government.
Do not make travel arrangements until your state's adoption office advises you to do so.
The Australian government's Smartraveller service can help you to prepare yourself for the requirements of traveling to the child's home country.Using this service is strongly advised by Intercountry Adoption.

, When you get home, you will need to finalize the process by applying for a court order, a birth certificate, and a citizenship certificate. The details of this process will vary based on the home country of the child and the state you live in.In some states, for example, you will need to submit regular progress reports for several month after bringing the child home before you can finalize the adoption. In others, there will be home visits to verify that everything is going well.Details on how to complete these final steps will be provided by your state's adoption agency and/or the government of the child's country of origin.

Determine your eligibility.,
Assess the child's eligibility.,
Complete an application.,
Provide a court report.,
Obtain consent.,
Await a court decision.",How to Adopt in Australia3," The easiest way to adopt a child in Australia is to adopt one that you are related to, either by blood or as a step-parent (intrafamily adoption). Your specific relationship to the child will determine your eligibility.For step-parents, you must have lived with the birth or adoptive parent of the child for at least two years immediately prior to the application.
For a grandparent, aunt, uncle, or sibling, you must have had a stable and ongoing relationship with the child for at least two years.

, The child must also be eligible for you to adopt, under the law. There are several specific guidelines that apply.For step-parents, the child must be at least five years of age.
A child must usually be under the age of 18 on the date the adoption application was submitted.
Step-parents and relatives may file for adoption of persons over the age of 18 if they cared for the child prior to his or her 18th birthday.

, An application for intrafamily adoption can filed directly with the supreme court of the state you live in.Contact the court to obtain the necessary paperwork.


It is a good idea to meet with a solicitor or contact Legal Aid for advice on filling out the application., If the person you wish to adopt is under the age of 18, you will have to provide a court report detailing the adoption, prepared by a Contracted Adoption Assessor.The Contracted Adoption Assessor will prepare this report, for a fee, that details your suitability to adopt the child. The Assessor works on behalf of the Family and Community Services department of your state. Check your state's website to find out how to initiate the assessment process.

, Unless the court waves this requirement, you must obtain consent from the birth-parents of (or whomever has parental responsibility for) the child. There are some exceptions to this requirement:If the child is 12 or older, he or she may give consent to be adopted, rather than a parent.
Parental consent is likewise not necessary if the person being adopted is over 18.

, Last, you must wait for the court to make a ruling about the adoption. The court will rule based on whether the adoption will be in the best interests of the child."

Start when your child is ready.It is important to wait until your little girl has developed enough physically and emotionally to begin.,
Buy a training potty and a training seat.,
Demonstrate the process.Toddlers learn by imitating adults and older children.,
Schedule your training.,
Decide on what she should wear in the meantime.,
Personalize the experience.,
Get her acquainted with the toilet.,
Allow your toddler to sit bottomless for a little while.,
Teach her to wipe correctly.,
Stay positive.,
Transition into nighttime training.",How to Potty Train Your Daughter," Typically, this occurs for most children between the ages of 22 and 30 months, and girls are often ready a little earlier than boys. Every child is different, though.


Recognize the signs. A little girl is physically ready when she can control her bowel and bladder muscles. If bowel movements are around the same time each day and do not happen at night, that is a good indication. Moreover, if her diaper stays dry for two hours or more, that is another indication.
Take a hint. Children are emotionally ready once they begin talking about wanting to use the toilet. If she talks about wanting to be a ""big girl,"" she might be ready to start potty training.;
, Both tools can help you potty train your daughter. Which one you choose will depend on your individual bathroom situation, but here's what you need to know:


A training potty is a portable toilet-shaped container that a young girl can climb onto without much difficulty. It is generally recommended that you start training with the child-size potty first, since a little girl can climb onto it by herself. She may also feel more secure being lower to the ground, which will make the process much easier.
A training seat fits on top of a normal toilet and makes the opening narrower, preventing her from falling in or feeling as though she might slip in. You should also buy a small footstep for her to use as she climbs up.

, As a result, it is important that she sees her mother or other female relatives using the toilet rather than her father or other male relatives.


Be wary of incorrect demonstrations. If she does see an older brother or father use the toilet standing up, she may try to do likewise. In instances like this, you should explain the difference between boys and girls and let her know that girls need to sit down to use the potty.
If there are no other females in her life, you can also demonstrate the process to your toddler by showing her books or videos specifically designed to act as potty training aids.
Another good way to demonstrate the process is by acting it out with a favorite doll or teddy bear. Little girls tend to develop an emotional attachment to their dolls and stuffed animals, and if they see their beloved companions ""using"" the potty, they might feel more motivated to follow the toy's example.

, Determine when your daughter is most likely to need a bathroom break, and try to coordinate your efforts around those times. If she attends daycare or stays with another person for part of the day, you may need to skip over those times and focus your attention on the times of day you spend with her.

, You could go back-and-forth between diapers and underpants, but this can get confusing for your toddler. Try these options instead:


Disposable training pants are useful because they absorb like diapers do, but your toddler can pull them up and down on her own.
You can make use of training pants, or you can switch directly to actual underwear or cotton training pants. These will cause your daughter to feel wet as soon as she starts urinating, which may make her more motivated to go to the potty. These also tend to be much messier, though.
Let your daughter spend some time each day naked. This will help liberate and relax your daughter, and help her feel more aware of her bodily signals. You might worry about her having an accident directly on your floor or carpet, but if this happens while she's naked, you won't have to worry about any clothes to wash, diapers to change, or having to give your daughter a bath.
Note that you will likely need to continue keeping your daughter in diapers at night for several months after she learns to stay dry during the day. Her body needs to train itself to stop urinating at night. Once she stays consistently dry at night, you can transition over into underpants.

, Your daughter may feel more comfortable and excited about learning to use the potty if the experience is tailored to her.


Choose a training potty or training seat with a design or color that appeals to your little girl. If possible, write her name directly on the training device, or allow her to decorate the sides of the training potty with colorful stickers.
Similarly, when it is time for your daughter to switch to underpants instead of diapers, choose colorful, fun designs to make her feel eager about wearing them.

, Your toddler may feel apprehensive about climbing onto the potty since it seems so unfamiliar, but you can help ease her anxiety by allowing her to transition into the process gradually.


Let her start with her clothes on. By allowing her to sit on the potty with her clothes on, you are allowing her the chance to get accustomed to the view and to the way the seat feels.
Transition to a pants-off approach after a week or so. After she seems comfortable sitting on her training potty with her clothes on, she might be ready to sit on it with her pants off. If she resists, though, give it more time. Avoid getting into fights or power struggles that could dampen the experience and make her even more resistant.

, Children often have an easier time determining when they need to use the bathroom without clothing on. Make sure that your daughter's training potty is nearby, and rush her there as soon as her body language suggests that she needs to go. Encourage her to sit until she goes.


Keep her entertained while she's waiting. Supply her with a stack of picture books, or a few toys to play with.

, Girls are at a higher risk of developing urinary tract infections, and girls in the middle of potty training are at an even higher risk since they are more likely to spread bacteria around. Instruct her to move the toilet paper from front to back.


If she cannot remember to move the paper in a certain direction, teach her to pat herself dry after she urinates.

, Celebrate her triumphs and be patient with her through her failures. Remember, the goal is for her to want to use the potty by herself, not for her to use it out of fear of punishment.


The occasional reward allows your little girl to know just how proud you are and may make her feel more determined to continue pressing forward with her training. You can reward her every so often by allowing her to watch a video or by giving her stickers or small treats after successful potty trips.

, Once your daughter is toilet-trained during the daylight hours, begin checking her diapers in the morning to monitor whether or not she is still going at night. If her diapers start looking dry, she is likely ready.


Additionally, if she expresses a desire to try wearing normal underpants at night, allow her to try doing so. If her body is not ready yet and she continues wetting the bed for a few nights in a row, switch back to diapers for a little while longer.

Help keep an eye on them by listening to how they describe their days, school, friends, or other aspects of their lives.Feelings of sadness, such as crying spells for no apparent reason
Feeling hopeless or empty
Being in an irritable or annoyed mood
Frustration or feelings of anger, even over small matters

, A depressed teenager will show changes in their actions and the way they interact with the world. Just remember that these are signs of depression if they represent changes in behavior.Tiredness and loss of energy
Insomnia or sleeping too much
Changes in appetite, which can mean decreased appetite and weight loss, or increased cravings for food and weight gain
Use of alcohol or drugs
Agitation or restlessness such as pacing, hand-wringing or an inability to sit still
Slowed thinking, speaking, or body movements
Frequently complaining of unexplained body aches and headaches. You may notice this in the form of frequent visits to the school nurse
Social isolation
Poor school performance or frequent absences from school
Neglecting his or her appearance
Angry outbursts, disruptive or risky behavior, or other acting-out behaviors

, Depression can arise from a number of conditions in a teenager’s life. When considering if your teenager may be depressed, look for events in the recent past that could be leading to depression. The presence of these things, along with changes in mood or behavior, could be a sign of depression.Look for stressful events in the teenager’s life, such as a death in the family, parental divorce, breaking up with a boyfriend or girlfriend, or doing particularly poorly in school.
Consider your family history as well. If your teenager has a blood relative like a parent or grandparent who suffered from depression, bipolar disorder, or alcoholism, he or she is at a greater risk for depression. Having a family member commit suicide, or a generally dysfunctional family can also contribute to depression in teenagers.

, Teenagers are dealing with a lot of changes to their bodies and social lives, which can be stressful and difficult to process at times. If you notice signs of depression that have been going on for more than 2 weeks, there may be a more serious issue. On the other hand, occasional appearance of these signs could be typical teenage behavior., People who are suicidal not only have these thoughts, but tend to dwell on them. It will seem like they cannot think about anything else. They will probably talk about being a burden to others, or feeling trapped.More specifically, suicidal thoughts can also be threats to kill oneself, or talking about wanting to kill themselves. A suicidal person might say things like “I’m going to kill myself,” “There’s no reason to live,” or “I wish I were dead.”
Suicidal people may also show rage or uncontrollable anger, particularly directed at others, including talking about getting revenge., A person who is suicidal may begin engaging in risky activities, believing they have nothing to live for. These can include using and abusing drugs and alcohol, reckless driving, or knowingly having unsafe sex. Even if the person doesn’t end up attempting suicide, these behaviors make people a danger to themselves and others.Suicidal individuals may also begin withdrawing from others, taking more time for themselves and removing themselves from other people’s lives., If the person has been moody and depressed for sometime, and has suddenly become calm, that could be a sign of trouble. She may have made the decision to end her life, and is no longer agonizing over the decision. You may also notice deliberate activities like giving away personal possessions, or saying goodbye to people., These can be stockpiling pills, or buying a weapon such as a knife or gun. If you notice this, or the person starts talking about getting their hands on these items, you should contact help immediately., If you notice that your teenager is showing signs of depression, sit down and talk to him. Talk about his feelings, and try to determine if he seems capable of managing these feelings, or if it seems to be overwhelming.People don’t always notice they are depressed. In many cases, people who are depressed become self-critical, so they will think of themselves as failures, losers, or bad people. If you don’t ask, the other person may not be able to notice depression alone., When you talk to your teenager, make sure that you are letting him do the talking. The point of this conversation is to let your teenager explain what he is feeling. Avoid the urge to pass judgement or lecture your teenager on what he should be feeling or what he is doing wrong.Your teenager should be doing most of the talking, explaining his feelings. You can ask questions, or offer support. Say things like “I’m here for you,” “What are you feeling?” or “What can I do to help?” This will remind him that he has someone to talk to, and can encourage more communication.Acknowledge his feelings. Don’t use this as an opportunity to prove your teenager wrong, or to say “Things aren’t like that,” or “It’s all in your head,” even if you believe his concerns are irrational. You want him to feel understood and supported, so for now it is important to let him know that you are listening to him., If you think your teenager is suffering from depression, you should go see a medical professional. The doctor will run a series of tests, including a physical exam, blood test, and psychological evaluation in order to determine if your teen should be diagnosed with depression. Depending on what the doctor finds, your teenager may be diagnosed with depression and have treatment prescribed.Make sure you talk to the doctor about what your role should be in helping to treat and care for a teenager suffering from depression.

, One of the common signs of depression is withdrawing from friends and social activities. While your teenager is undergoing treatment from a doctor, make sure she spends time with other people. It can also be helpful to give your teenager something to do. Suggest she do something with friends, or invite her along for errands or other outside activities., Depression can get worse when accompanied by bad physical habits. Inactivity, not enough sleep, or bad nutrition, which are all problems for teenagers in normal circumstances. In addition to being a sounding board, make sure your teenager is getting the right kind of physical activity to stay healthy.Regular physical activity can help reduce depression, and is generally healthy for you. Encourage your teenager to get an hour of aerobic activity every day, such as running, swimming, or even just walking. These can even be things you do together.
Keep an eye on screen time. Electronic devices like computers and television can limit people’s exposure to others, and provide avenues for depression triggers like cyberbullying or negative or violent content. Make sure your teenager is getting time away from screens to interact with real people, including friends and family.
Make sure your teenager is getting a good night’s sleep. Strictly enforce a curfew, and make sure your teenager is going to bed when they should. Spending a lot of time on electronic devices like televisions or phones can really hurt a sleep cycle.

For example, in California, the essential elements of a valid adoption include:A voluntary and informed parental consent to the adoption (unless the parent has surrendered or has been judicially deprived of parental control)
A suitable adoptive parent (at least 10 years older than the child being adopted)
A decision by the court that the adoption is in the best interest of the child

, A lawyer will help you navigate the confusing legal field of co-parent adoptions. Without the help of a qualified family law lawyer, you may accidentally terminate your girlfriend's or boyfriend's parental rights. A lawyer will help you draft adoption documents, file your paperwork, and go to court.


If you cannot afford to hire a lawyer to represent you throughout the entire process, at least consult with one about the intricacies of co-parent adoptions. Most lawyers will offer free initial consultations where you may be able to learn whether your state allows co-parent adoptions and whether your local court has forms available for you to fill out.
If you need help to Find a Good Family Law Attorney, contact your state bar association's lawyer referral service. After answering a few general questions about your legal issue, you will be put in contact with qualified lawyers in your area.

, If you think you can meet all of the requirements necessary to adopt your girlfriend's or boyfriend's child, visit your county courthouse and request an adoption packet. If your courthouse does not have an adoption packet available, they should be able to point you in the direction of the forms you will need. Make sure you ask for independent adoption forms. Independent adoptions are those that do not involve adoption or state agencies.Visit the courthouse where you plan on filing for adoption. Each county in each state will have different forms and different procedures. While some states will have special courts to handle adoption matters, most states will handle these matters in their normal civil courts.

, An adoption request (or a petition in some states) tells the judge about the adoption request and who all the parties are.In California, for example, you can obtain an adoption request (Form ADOPT-200) from the California court website. When you fill out this form, you will need to include the following information:Your personal information as the adopting parent (e.g., your name, address, and relationship to the child)
An indication of why you are filing in a particular court (e.g., you reside in that county or the child resides in that county)
The type of adoption you are filing for (e.g., an independent, additional parent adoption)
The child's personal information
A statement saying you are suitable to adopt the child (e.g., you will support the child, you are of a suitable age, and and you will treat the child as your own)

, This form tells the judge that you and the child agree to the adoption.You will sign this form in the presence of the judge. If the child is over a certain age (usually 12), he or she will be required to sign the form as well.


For example, in California, you will fill out Form ADOPT-210 by providing your personal information on the top of the form. You will not have to do anything else with this form until your hearing., An adoption order is a blank form the judge will sign if he or she approves the adoption. All you need to do is fill in your personal information and information about the court hearing. In California, the adoption order is Form ADOPT-215., The court will require you to submit an itemized list of the expenses you incurred while going through the adoption process. Most courts will have a form you fill out to accomplish this. For example, in California, you can fill out Form ADOPT-230. Common adoption expenses you might incur include:Hospital services
Prenatal care
Legal fees
Transportation fees
Counseling fees
Court filing fees

, The most important document you will sign and have signed is the waiver, which is an agreement waiving the termination of parental rights. The waiver must be signed by both adopting parents and both biological parents. This is the document that will allow your girlfriend or boyfriend to retain their parental rights even after you adopt the child. Once you have a waiver agreement drafted and signed, indicate this fact on your adoption request.


Remember that every parent involved has to sign this waiver. This will include you, your boyfriend or girlfriend, and the child's other parent.
This agreement will be attached to your adoption request., Take all of your completed original forms to your county courthouse and hand them to the clerk of court. He or she will explain the adoption process moving forward. When you submit your paperwork, make sure you bring multiple copies for your records. While the court will keep the originals, you may want stamped copies for yourself.When your paperwork is submitted, it will be stamped as ""filed"".

, You will have to pay a filing fee when you submit your paperwork. Each county's fees will vary but they generally fall between $100 and $400. If you cannot afford the filing fee, you can ask the court for a fee waiver., In most adoptions, an investigator will be assigned to your case. The investigator will conduct an interview with you and other interested parties. The investigator might also review your financial information, your home life, and your relationship. After the investigation is complete, the investigator will write a report and file it with the court.


This report will give the judge important information he or she will use when deciding your case.Do everything in your power to ensure a positive report is written. For example, clean your home and make sure it is child proof. Talk with friends and family and ensure they are on board with the adoption. Make sure your financials are in order (e.g., have a steady job and a good savings). Sit down with your boyfriend or girlfriend and discuss parenting plans. This could be the difference between having your adoption granted or denied.

, Once the court receives the investigator's report, the clerk will reach out to you to schedule a hearing date. Work with all interested parties (e.g., your boyfriend or girlfriend and the child) to find a date that works for everyone. All of these parties will be required to be at the hearing., On the day of your hearing, arrive early so you have time to park, get through security, and find your courtroom. Be sure you bring copies of all the paperwork you have as well as the child you are adopting. Once you find your courtroom, sit quietly until your case is called. When your case is called, move to the front of the courtroom and speak with the judge. To grant your adoption, the judge will have to find all of the following:The child is of an appropriate age (and consent was given if child is over 12)
The adopting parent (you) is at least 10 years older than the child, will care for the child, has a suitable home, and agrees to the adoption
The waiver is valid that allows your boyfriend or girlfriend to retain parental rights
The adoption is in the best interest of the child

, If the court grants the adoption he or she will sign the completed adoption order, which you will give them during the hearing. Once the adoption order is signed, the adoption will be official.

, Most adoptions go smoothly so long as the other biological parent (i.e., not your boyfriend or girlfriend) consents to having their parental rights terminated. If the other parent has not provided support or been in the child's life in the past, consent might not even be necessary. However, in some cases, your adoption might be contested. If your adoption is contested, you will have to convince the judge that the adoption is in the best interest of the child. When a judge determines best interests, he or she will take into consideration the following:The importance of family integrity, which in some cases might mean allowing the adoption (e.g., if the other biological parent has been out of the picture for some time).
The health, safety, and protection of the child.
The emotional ties a child has to you and his or her parents.
Your capacity to provide a safe home.
The presence of domestic violence in the home.
The mental and physical health of you and the child.

Never discourage curiosity.,
Examine your own behavior first.,
Racism, like other prejudices, often stems from ignorance and fear of the unknown.,
Show them the hard, cold facts.,
Teach good ways to show curiosity about another culture.,
Tell kids about things that are definite no-nos.,
If your kid has ever been discriminated against, help them recognize that stereotypes exist no matter what, where, with who, or how.,
Keep an eye out for popular stereotypes being glamorized by the media.,
If peer pressure is the problem, help them see that bullies are often just scared and resentful inside.",How to Teach Racial Tolerance to Teens," If certain questions make you uncomfortable about saying the wrong thing inadvertently, make sure to reflect and think about what exactly to say before you start talking. Teens are impressionable and whether they admit it or not, parents and guardians play a very important role in formulating their views on life. Shutting down curiosity about racial diversity and racism can lead to displaced anger towards others.;
, If you think it's OK to blurt out jokes about people from another culture, or if you think snide innuendos about race are funny, think again. Aside from the hurt your own comments may cause, they are setting a bad example for your children.

, Educate kids on different cultures around the world, and even within their own country, so that they can appreciate the fact that the world isn't one boring, homogeneous place. Take them to museums, introduce them to books and real-life accounts of people who'd had to undergo severe discrimination. Expose them through their childhood to books, toys, movies, etc. that have people who are from races and cultures not their own.

, Don't talk about apartheid as a faraway historical topic that happened way back in the Paleolithic age. Introduce them to movies like Remember The Titans, and to books like To Kill A Mockingbird that deal with racism in the present world.

, Asking others to teach you a few words of their native language works. Asking them to change their accent, on the other hand, is just plain dumb. If someone has an accent, it simply means he or she knows one more language than you do.

, It's unacceptable to name-call and discriminate against people because of the way they look.

, It's up to them to not let the sheer stupidity of it all get to them. Let them see it's what's different that makes them special. Teach them to be proud of their own culture.

, This doesn't mean you have to censor everything a teen watches, just make sure that their favorite shows don't encourage them to treat people poorly if they look, talk, walk, or eat differently. If your kid's favorite T.V. show has a parody token minority, talk about it. If all else fails, make them learn from every teenager's favorite teacher: Lady Gaga.'Born this Way' says it all. Lady Gaga is the perfect sign for teens to embrace everything about themselves.

, Helping your child deal with bullying is challenging no matter the cause, but racial bullying can be particularly hurtful. It can teach your child to resent who they are.

Start at home.,
Model good driving.,
Help your student driver to get his or her learner's permit or provisional license.,
Find a place off the street and relatively free of obstructions for your student's first experience behind the wheel.,
Review the controls.,
Practice controlling the car.,
Choose a road with light traffic for the first on-road experience.,
Work up gradually to more involved driving situations, such as freeways, inclement weather, and heavy traffic.

,
Practice maneuvers that will be needed on the driver's test as well as techniques that will be needed for driving under real conditions.

,
Rehearse for the driving test, even if you have to make it up yourselves.",How to Teach Somebody How to Drive," Before you ever get in the car, review the rules of the road, the basics of automobile operation and maintenance, and the requirements for getting a driver's license.


Review both the drivers' handbook and the owner's manual for the car.
If your student driver is also your child, this is a good time to agree on what responsibilities you will have and what responsibilities are your child's. Who will pay for fuel and insurance? Will your child drive your car or get his/her own? Must he/she be home at a certain hour or maintain certain grades in school? It is a good idea to lay out these conditions in advance.;
, Encourage the one you're teaching to notice what you do. You can start this process well before your student will get his/her license.


Drive out loud. It may have been a long time since you were conscious of your driving, but try to narrate the process aloud with your learner as a passenger. Say things like, ""That blue car is going too fast. It'll probably pull in front of us, so I'll leave extra space,"" and ""I'm going to turn left up ahead, so I'll signal and start pulling over and slowing down now.""

Demonstrate good driving technique and adhere to the rules even more than usual. Leave space, signal, do not speed, and avoid berating other drivers.
Encourage your passenger to make judgments about what traffic will do and how to respond to it.
Discuss road hazards and what to do about them.

, In many cases, they may not practice on public roads without it.

Review what the rules are for using the learner's permit. In most cases, an adult or teacher will need to be in the car with the student.
Keep a log of driving practice hours if one is required as part of the license process.

, An empty parking lot after hours is a one choice.


Go out the first few times in daylight and in mild weather. Let your student learn at least the basics of controlling the car and maneuvering in traffic before driving under hazardous or difficult conditions.

,


Turn the car on and off a few times. Fasten your seat belts, adjust the mirrors and seats, release the brake, start the ignition, put the car in gear, etc. Then, reverse the process.
Review the controls for windshield wipers, headlights, turn signals and other items.

,


Accelerate and decelerate so that it is smooth and even.
Practice changing gears if it is a manual transmission car.
Drive in patterns, especially those that will be required in real driving situations. Make left and right turns. Try parallel parking next to a curb or painted line. Try parking in the marked spaces.
Get comfortable with where the sides and back of the car are.
Practice backing the car, too. Again, start with an open space, then try backing up towards a target, preferably one that won't damage the car in case of error (such as a hedge or painted lines).
Practice multiple times in the parking lot, if that is what it takes to be confident and consistent with basic controls and positioning.

,


Practice staying on the correct side and centered in the lane.
Advise stopping well back of other cars at stop lights. A good rule of thumb is being able to see the wheels of the car in front. Especially with an inexperienced driver, stopping too soon is far
Remind your student to leave plenty of space for stopping.

,,, Generally, the driver's manual will indicate the sorts of maneuvers that will be tested, so find some side streets and practice those items. You may not be able to give your student a particular score, but you can probably give some feedback, such as ""watch your speed"" or ""you forgot to signal that turn.""

Switch from using diapers to pull-ups at first.,
Consider allowing your child to walk around your home or private yard naked or bottomless.,
Dress your child in clothing that’s relatively easy to remove.,
Watch your child closely to familiarize yourself with their cues it’s time to go potty.,
Establish a motivating reward system.,
Praise your children when they successfully use the potty on their own.,
Involve your child in the process of choosing a children’s potty, if possible.,
Give your child the option of reading a book or playing with a special toy when sitting on the potty.,
Take your child shopping for big-girl or big-boy underpants.,
Have your child sit on the potty first thing after waking up in the morning or after a nap.,
Train boys to sit down to pee before teaching them how to pee standing up.",How to Start Potty Training," Pull-ups function similarly to diapers, but can be pulled up and down just like underpants so your child can become more familiarized with the ritual when he or she uses the restroom.;
, This can help children grow more consciously aware of their body signals when it’s really time to use the potty.Spend time with your child in a clean room near the restroom so he or she can access the potty immediately when needed.

, This will allow your child to undress quickly when it’s time to use the potty.


Avoid dressing your child in onesies, overalls, and other articles of clothing that are too difficult for your child to remove quickly.

, Your child may fidget, make straining faces, announce their tummy hurts, look you in the face, hold up their hand, or run off to hide in a corner if they need to use the potty.


After you’ve learned your child’s potty cues, take him or her to the restroom immediately upon recognizing these signals.

, Children are more likely to use the potty when they know they’re going to be rewarded for doing so. Many parents offer incentives such as pieces of candy, stickers to place on the calendar, or pennies to store in a piggy bank.

, Being positive and recognizing your child’s accomplishment will motivate them to continue using the potty.

, Kid potties are available in a variety of different styles and colors. Allowing your child to choose a potty can empower him or her to use it when needed., Activities such as these can make potty training seem fun, instead of as a chore or lesson.

, Allowing your child to pick out their favorite pairs of underpants can make them feel more excited about potty training, and about graduating from diapers to underpants.

, In most cases, your child will have to use the restroom, and will most likely use the potty with success.

, This will help prevent confusion in the beginning as your child becomes more familiar with using the potty.


Consider placing pieces of cereal or candy in the potty when you’re ready to teach a boy how to pee standing up. These items can function like targets boys can aim for when they’re ready to pee standing up!

Determine your child's physical ability to potty train.,
Assess your child's recognition of their own needs.,
Obtain approval from their doctor.,
Have all equipment ready and consider logistics.As you are assessing readiness for beginning toilet training, make sure you have all the supplies and equipment you may need.,
Recognize potential difficulties in potty training kids with physical disabilities.,
Evaluate potential difficulties in potty training kids with mental or emotional difficulties.",How to Potty Train Children with Special Needs1," You will want to make sure your child is physically ready and it is safe for them to begin toilet training before beginning.Forcing your child to begin too early, or not providing enough assistance to them, may be detrimental to the potty training process. If they are not ready, choose to either wait or create assistive measures to help them succeed. Some ways to determine if your child is physically ready include the following.Can they sit with or without support?
Can they attempt to squat with or without losing their balance?
Can they walk without help?
Can they stay dry for at least an hour at a time?;
, This involves making sure your child is cognitively and emotionally ready to begin toilet training.It will help to determine where you child's ability to sense their own need to use the bathroom and how they process through the steps of toileting. If they are not ready, choose to either wait for them to become ready or help them by providing extra assistance. Some ways to determine if your child is cognitively or emotionally ready include the following.Can they tell the difference between being wet and dry?
Can they sense when they need to go to the bathroom?
Can they undress themselves with or without help?

, Having a child with special needs, you are probably speaking to their doctors regularly. Inform your child's doctor of your intention to begin potty training. The doctor will be able to talk with you about the readiness of your child to begin potty training, which can vary greatly by child, especially with children with special needs.Additionally, having a discussion with your child's doctor may be very helpful to you during the process.

, Consider common toilet training needs, such as child toilets or seat extenders. Also, determine the need for equipment that may be specific to your child, their disability, and their needs. Consider the following equipment or logistical considerations you may need to make.


Physical assistive devices, such as portable toilets, hand rails, and appropriate access to the sink, and materials your child may need.
Consider the logistics of your child's access to the bathroom. Is it easily reached, or will you need to make adjustments to your home?
Cleaning supplies for possible accidents during the training process.

, Children with with physical special needs should be potty trained in a different manner from children with behavioral, cognitive, or emotional special needs. Knowing your child and how potty training will be affected by their specific complications will allow you to tailor each stage of the training so that they have the best chance of being successful.If your child has special needs that make walking or standing difficult, potty training should focus on different mobility options as well as how to give themselves more time to get to the bathroom.
A child that is blind may need more detailed instructions due to not being able to model behavior they view, or they may need instructions on how to locate the toilet bowl or the toilet tissue paper.Children with paralysis or nerve damage may have difficulty recognizing the feeling of their internal organs nearing capacity so they may need help developing a schedule.

, Children with mental or emotional special needs have a different set of challenges in potty training than children with physical special needs. Some potential difficulties can result from an impaired level of comprehension or understanding of what the parent is trying to get them to do or the process altogether.Be aware of the potential obstacles and meet your child where they are functionally and work from there.


Recognize that with emotional, mental, developmental, or intellectual disabilities, the potty training process can take significantly longer.Exercise patience with your child and celebrate small steps with them.

Set up a potty training schedule or visual aid.,
Help your child to recognize when it is time to go to the bathroom.,
Model behaviors.",How to Potty Train Children with Special Needs2," One method that may be helpful for potty training children with special needs is for the parent to set up a fairly precise daily potty schedule. Creating something visual or even rewarding for the child to view helps them organize and keep track of what they are working on. Create a schedule based around what times of day the child tends to go to the bathroom in their diaper.Observe your child's schedule. Most people’s bodies have their own internal schedule and by observing when the child does these things, the parent can try to get the child to the toilet before they use their diaper.
If the child uses the toilet successfully, the parent should praise them and reward them so that they can begin to form connections. Connections such as being able to complete a task successfully, as well as the connection between how their body feels when it needs to go and the toilet, will help them continue to be successful.

, If there are no paralysis or nerve damage disabilities present, and the child is capable of understanding the parent, it is possible to teach them to recognize when their bladder is full.If there are paralysis or nerve damage disabilities present, help the child develop a schedule for toileting. Help the child by paying attention with them to when they drink a lot and then when they go to the bathroom. This will aid them in making connections to any sensations they may be having.


Place a nonabsorbent cloth in your child's diaper so they may begin to be aware of feeling wet.
Talk to your child about how their stomach feels when they are full and how it feels after they use the bathroom. Help them make the connection between those sensations.
Develop a regular schedule with your child if paralysis or nerve damage makes sensation difficult or impossible. Prompt and help the child get used to the schedule.

, This may sound like a strange suggestion, but it can help to allow your child to watch you model the behavior of using the toilet.Children copy other children and adults all the time; it's part of a natural process for mimicking behavior. Let that work for you. Some children with mental disabilities pick up on toilet training simply by watching a parent of the same sex do it repeatedly.


You might not feel comfortable having your child watch while you use the toilet, but it is worth the slight feeling of embarrassment if it works to get the child to use the toilet on their own.

"
"
Consider assistive devices for children with physical challenges.One method that might be used to help potty train children with physical disabilities, is to utilize assistive devices.,
Adapt to visual disabilities and sight deficiencies.,
Plan for potty training with hearing or communication disabilities.,
Work on addressing continence problems as a result of special needs.,
Adjust toilet training to behavioral or emotional behavior needs.,
Accommodate Intellectual Disabilities and Developmental Disorders in your child's training.",How to Potty Train Children with Special Needs3," Depending on the type and severity of the physical disability, it may be helpful to incorporate something like a portable potty during the training process. This allows the child to have quick and easy access to a toilet while they are learning a schedule. As you move through the training process, use any of the devices to further help your child potty train.


For example, if you use a portable potty, move the portable potty closer and closer to the stationary bathroom. This will help your child adjust to and practice continence in having longer distances to reach the potty.
It may be necessary to get an adult sized portable toilet depending on the age and disability of your child.
Consider the addition of hand rail, step, or back rest adaptive devices to help with positioning while getting on the potty or staying on the potty while training.
You may also consider dressing the child in easy to remove clothing, such as loose fitting clothing or clothing with Velcro fasteners. This may help to make undressing and dressing easier when the child needs to use the bathroom.

, Visual difficulties or disabilities make many stages of the toilet training process more challenging for you and your child. Without sight ability your child will not be able to witness modeling behavior as well as the smaller tasks involved in toileting.Rely more on language, hearing, and touch sensations to help your child understand how the process works. This may mean waiting a little longer to begin toilet training with your child.


When you are ready to begin, let your child explore the bathroom, making sure to help them locate and identify the toilet and handle, as well as the toilet paper.
Talk to your child more about the process of toileting, explaining all the steps and letting them talk to you about it.
Utilize training products such as musical potties to help reward your child for successful use of the toilet., Similar to difficulties in potty training a special needs child with visual disabilities, hearing and communication will also greatly impact training. If your child is fluent in sign language or is able to communicate, you may find it somewhat easier.To help your child with potty training rely on visual observation and explanations that you can provide to them. Work on one part of the process at a time to not overwhelm your child and to make sure they understand before moving on.


Let your child observe you, and if possible, other children like their siblings, using the bathroom.
Consistently use the same signs, gestures, and facial expressions when training your child.
Place a few drops of food coloring in the toilet bowl and have your child guess what the color will change to after they urinate., Your child's special needs may not be difficulties with interpreting or understanding the toileting process. Instead, your child may experience trouble with continence and frustration with the training process. Try to help your child by making a regular potty schedule to get them used to regularly going to the toilet. This may help with frustration of accidents or interruption of activities. You may also need to help your child with dietary changes to facilitate easier toileting. Consider the following specific special needs:


Children with Cerebral Palsy may struggle with bladder awareness, bladder control, and constipation.Concentrate on developing awareness of needing to go to the bathroom, and altering diet or medications to avoid constipation.
If your special needs child struggles with Spina Bifida, spinal cord injury, or spinal tumors they may have some similar difficulties to children with Cerebral Palsy. You may need to focus toilet training more on teaching your child to use a catheter for urination and visit the bathroom on a schedule for toileting.It might not be possible to completely potty train some children, especially those with neurologic disabilities.

, If your child's special needs include conditions such as Oppositional Defiant Disorder or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, toilet training difficulties may include low motivation, concentration, or a lack of response to typical reinforcements.Your child may struggle because it is difficult for children with these needs to adjust to change in their daily lives. Take training slowly and focus on one small change at a time as not to overwhelm your child with changes all at once.


Get creative and adapt your training methods to your child's interests and motivations. For example, if your child has a favorite cartoon character, try to buy underwear with that character on them and make a game out of trying to keep that character from getting wet. Making it fun for your child and connecting it to something they are interested in will ease the stress of change.

, Key to potty training a special needs child with and intellectual disability, developmental delay, or a developmental disorder is the understanding that the time to achieve successful training may be significantly longer than expected.Your child may need the process broken down into smaller tasks and may need more time to master those tasks. Be patient and consider the following.


Cater to your child's verbal level and ability. If they have a lower verbal ability utilize facial expressions and modeling to help.
Keep each portion of training simple and concrete. Utilizing visual aids each step of the way can help your child develop the concrete ideas into actions as well.
Use rewards, such as treats or play time to increase the likelihood that they will repeat the behavior. Avoid using punishments or reprimands as it may cause a regression or further delay in successful toileting.

Visit a specialist.,
Join a support group or organization.,
Speak to a mental health professional.",How to Potty Train Children with Special Needs4," Hopefully, you have been consulting with your child's doctors to determine if your child is ready and to deal with any issues involved in your child's digestive or urinary health. If you have been trying and are having little or no success potty training your child, consult with the doctor again. Your doctor may be able to provide you with a referral to a specialist in the field that correlates to the child’s special needs.These professionals can provide tips and guidelines to help the parents and may be able to suggest plans that have not be attempted before.

, Your largest source of support and information will likely be other parents of special needs children.It might be helpful to join a group or organization of other parents that have children with the same special needs in order to share your experience or ideas. The parent groups can also be a great source of emotional support for a parent of a child with special needs. Search for groups in your area by trying the following.


Search for groups specific to your child's special need.
Search for parenting groups through any doctor or specialist you visit with your child.
Search for organizations or groups online.

, Caring for a child with special needs can be stressful, emotional, and difficult. Your mental, emotional, and physical health are just as important as your child's. Furthermore, in order to provide the best care for your child, you need to make sure you are taking care of yourself as well.Consider making an appointment with a counselor or individual therapist so that you have someone objective to talk to while you are raising your special child.

Learn to adjust your expectations.,
Be patient and understanding.During potty training, it may be difficult for you to remember that accidents will happen as potty training is a learning process, just like any other.,
Stay positive.",How to Potty Train Children with Special Needs5," Chances are, if you are a parent of a child with special needs, you have already adjusted your expectations for life with your child.Consider however, that all children with special needs are different from each other as well. Not only do they vary by what types of special needs they have, but even children with the same type of special needs, such as blindness, might differ in how they approach new tasks or how well they cope with them. Think about your child and how their needs may alter the course of potty training. Consider the following.


Since potty training is started at a young age, children with any type of special needs might have more trouble understanding or doing what is expected of them.
Prepare yourself for the likelihood that your child may need more support, encouragement, and reminders to use the toilet than other children.
Understand that your child may have a different timeline for potty training.

, Remind yourself that these bodily functions naturally and automatically occur when organs in the body reach capacity. Potty training is actually teaching the child how to sense when these organs are nearing their capacity so that they can choose to use a toilet instead of a diaper.


Try to understand the difficulty for the child if they have trouble recognizing their body’s signs. When accidents happen, try not to yell or ridicule your child for these accidents. Negative adult reactions like these can actually cause the child’s progress to slow down, stop, or even regress., Try and remain positive, calm, helpful, consistent, and patient when in front of your child while potty training them. If you are stressed about the lack of progress your child is experiencing, it may show. Your child may pick up on the fact that you are upset with them, causing more difficulties.It's important to express and feel that frustration, but do so in a healthy way. Confide in your partner or another adult, somewhere the child is not able to hear."

Make sure your teen has a learner's permit.,
Take a deep breath.,
Locate a quiet parking lot.,
Narrate your driving.,
Check that the parking lot is empty.,

Practice as often as you can.,
Before your teen gets their license, discuss driving rules.",How to Teach Your Kid to Drive," Most states have specific requirements for a learner's permit: a driving student must have completed a certain amount of written driver's education, and (in some places) some hours at an accredited driving school as well.


In most places, a learner's permit allows its holder to practice driving during specific times of the day, and in the presence of an older licensed driver.;
, It’s totally natural to be nervous about your child to drive. If you’re tense and snappy throughout the process, though, your teen will sense that, and it will not reflect well in their driving. Do your best to be kind and calm, especially if you’re naturally a nervous driver.Be aware of your body language as well as your words. If you sense yourself balling up your fists or tensing your shoulders, try to relax them.
Remember that your child has a learner's permit; they already know quite a bit about the mechanics and safety of driving. You don't have to recite the Driver's Ed textbook at them. You only need to help them practice.

, This is a classic for good reason. With plenty of space and no one to get in the way, a parking lot is a great setting for low-pressure lessons. Plan to have your first lesson together here on a clear, sunny day. Try to avoid doing this in the cold--ice has a way of making an easy lesson difficult.

, On your way to the parking lot for the first lesson, point out to your teen what you're doing, and why. Are you accelerating? Why are you stopping? Who has the right of way at this intersection?, Stop the car, remove the keys, then switch seats with your child. This may be their first time behind the wheel of a non-driver's-school car, so give them a moment to adjust.

, Encourage your child to start the car. Pick out a nearby marker (like a trash can or light post). Then tell them to drive in a straight line in the direction of the object, then stop. Next, have them try reversing a few feet., Encourage your teen to circle slowly, both clockwise and counterclockwise. Then try making corners, instead of smooth circles.


Even though there's no one else in the parking lot, make sure your teen is using the turn signals.
Be careful not to do “doughnuts” (tight, skidding loops): they are dangerous, and you and your teen could get in trouble., Driving can be stressful, and a long lesson will wear on both of you. Try to cap your time at fifteen or twenty minutes--you can always come back to practice later in the week., Whether your teen is learning to drive a stick shift or automatic car, it’s important that they get the hang of driving one specific car. This way, there will be no surprises the day of the test., Return to the parking lot for a few more sessions. This will help your teen's confidence and skills grow before they surrender to the call of the open road. You can practice for up to an hour if you're so inclined. Make sure to take a break or cut the lesson short if one of you needs it.

, A parking lot has the advantage of pre-marked parking spaces, so take advantage of them!


Tell your teen to pull up to line their passenger side mirror up with the boundary line of a space.
Then, have them turn their wheel all the way to the side, and begin to enter the space. Once they're about halfway in, they can straighten the wheel and finish pulling in., Also called 3-point turns, K turns are useful for reversing directions in areas of heavy traffic. They're also tricky to get right, which is why it's great to do them in an empty parking lot.


Tell your teen to signal right, then pull all the way right.
Next, encourage them to turn on their left-hand signal, then drive left a bit.
Now tell them to signal right, then reverse. They should be near where they started, but facing the opposite direction., You can use the curbs in the parking lot to practice parallel parking, even if that isn't their intended function. This maneuver can require a lot of repetition, so don't let it psych your teen (or you) out.


Tell your teen to come to a stop, then check their mirrors. Have them turn on their turn signal on the right. Then encourage them to turn the steering wheel all the way to the right, towards the curb.
Now, they should begin to reverse. Remind them going extremely slowly is okay, and encouraged--even experienced drivers find parallel parking difficult.
Then, have them switch the wheel to the left and back up a bit more.
Finally, your teen should straighten out their wheels completely and inch forward a bit. Get out of the car and look at how close the curb is. If it's nearly touching the wheels, or a couple of feet away from them, have your teen try again!

, Your teen may not be a perfect driver yet, but that's why they're practicing with you. You may need to correct them, but make sure your comments are useful and constructive (e.g. “Pump the breaks,” not “slow down, we’re going to die!”)., It's easy to figure out where to correct (it will often happen when your teen doesn't seem to be paying attention), but we often take good driving for granted and forget to reinforce it. Here are some actions worthy of praise:


Correcting a mistake without being prompted.
Considering right of way.
Taking weather or light conditions into account.

, Bringing other drivers into the mix may be a stressor for both of you, but if you and your teen have been practicing in a parking lot, you will be well-prepared. However, more people on the road means more things to be aware of.


Review right of way laws with your teen. These may vary depending on where you live.
Now more than ever, emphasize that signaling is important.

, After your teen has the hang of driving on fairly quiet roads, take them to a busier location to handle more drivers. If possible, practice in a place your teen is already familiar with.


Remind your teen that city driving requires not only patience for a lot of starting and stopping, but heightened awareness for pedestrians.
Plan a route through the city with your teen in advance. This will be less stressful than being surprised by an ""obstacle course."", Highway driving is really fast, so it might feel intimidating for your child. The good news is that it's usually a straight shot and there are no pedestrians or bikers to worry about.


Acceleration and deceleration lanes can be stressful. Emphasize the importance of smoothly increasing and decreasing speed.
Remind your teen that cars on the highway should be more widely spaced than they should be on a regular street. Tell them to try the three-second rule: start counting when the car in front of them passes a certain landmark (like a road sign). They should pass the sign three seconds after the car in front of them. , Once your teen feels safe driving in different situations, take them out to drive in rain, snow, and the dark.


In many places, drivers are obligated to turn on their headlights if there is rain heavy enough to necessitate windshield wipers. Even if this isn't legally required in your area, it's good sense.Rain, ice, and snow can cause skidding. Make sure your teen knows to turn the wheel in the direction of a skid, no matter how counterintuitive this may sound!, Several times a week is ideal. Driving depends partly on muscle memory, like playing a sport.Even if your teen has been performing splendidly while you drive together, they have to keep reinforcing what they’ve learned until it sticks.

, Safety concerns are important, but as they prepare to take the test, family boundaries are too. If all goes well, you’ll have another licensed driver in the house soon; it’s important to figure out how what areas your teen can be independent in, and which areas still need guidance.How will car-sharing work? Do you plan to buy your child a new car? Will you share the family car?
Will your teen have a curfew if they’re out driving? (Note: in many states, drivers with provisional licenses already have a curfew in place.)
Will you limit the number of friends in the car?
Are there certain places your teen will not be permitted to drive?
Consider making a written contract for your family’s specific rules. There are templates available online. Here's one from the Car Talk hosts.

Offer alternative ways to express individuality.",How to Talk Your Teen out of Getting a Body Piercing," Teenagers are learning how to express their individuality and obtain membership in social groups. They may act differently than before, accepting or rejecting new types of friends or striving to be recognized by different kinds of social groups.This experimentation with identity may be simply behavioral or emotional, but it can also be physical--teenagers may try new fashions, sexual habits, or ways of decorating their body. A piercing may promote acceptance within a clique or may be pure self-expression.


Take time to understand what a body piercing might mean to your teenager. You may even ask them directly. Often, it signals a shift toward adulthood and autonomy and away from childhood. Sometimes they may not be able to articulate this directly.
Take time to understand your own feelings about the matter, especially if they are feelings of opposition. Curiosity and acceptance from a parental figure, rather than hostility or suspicion, will strengthen mutual respect within a family. If you show your teen child that you respect their interests, you will often receive respect in return, and will model healthy relationship habits for your teen. ;
, Though respecting your teenager is key, they still need guidance. Is the piercing a choice that they are making for themselves, or is it one that their friends are making for them? Does your teenager want a piercing for its own merits, or do they just want to ""fit in""? Respecting your teenager's choices also means respecting your teenager's need to develop good decision-making skills. Helping your teenager determine their own motivations can help them strengthen their social awareness, self-reliance, and emotional resiliency, all of which are key skills.

, Teenagers do need structure in their lives, even if they are exploring and experimenting.Setting age-appropriate goals can be a successful way to guide your teenager in their decision-making. There are many safe ways for teenagers express themselves that will not have as long-lasting effects as a piercing does. Depending on your teenager's age, help them set goals that satisfy their need to experiment while keeping their level of development in mind.

, Young teenagers may not have as well thought-out reasons for their motivations. Often, presenting simple alternatives can help them probe their reasoning. If your teen is 14 and asking for a body piercing, it may help to mutually set a later age at which a piercing will be acceptable. This will give them space to plan for the event, think through consequences, and possibly talk themselves out of it.


Teenagers aged 10-14 begin to be more emotionally volatile and concerned about their social presence, but are only beginning to think in abstract terms.Understand their decisions as a ""trying-out"" of new emotions, ideas, and preferences.

, If your teen is older, from 16 to 18 years old, respect their growing expectations of pending adulthood and allow them to set their own goals.Give them adult insights about the consequences of their actions in relation to their other goals. This will help put their choices in perspective.


Consult them on plans for further education. A piercing may have important consequences based on what they wish to study and where. Piercings and other body modifications may or may not impress peer groups, instructors, admissions committees, or scholarship foundations based on where they want to go.
Consult them on plans for work. Considering their preferred job may help them decide if getting a piercing is an appropriate choice for them. A law office, for instance, will have different expectations than a graphic design firm.

, There are a number of reasons why a parent might oppose body piercings. There may not be reliable piercing facilities nearby, or teenagers may not be ready to take hygienic responsibility for their piercing, which can both be health problems. A piercing may detract from your teenager's goals in ways that you uniquely anticipate.


Alternatively, parents may simply have distaste for piercings. If you oppose a piercing, make sure you are not simply projecting a fear or personal preference upon your teenager--this does not help your teenager develop reasoning skills, but simply prevents them from practicing autonomy in a healthy way., Whether or not a piercing may be a good idea for your teenager, be fair to them. Don't try to ""win"" arguments based on your own age or authority. Rather, be clear about what you think their best interests are, as well as your own and those of the family as a whole. If your teen senses that you are immediately dismissive, they won't be able to hear what you have to say. Listen first and then offer your perspective and advice.

, Teenagers are more likely to respond to a parent when the parent has clearly taken the time to consider the issue fully. Be able to articulate your position, read up on the consequences of bodily piercings, or consult a professional to gain more information. Give yourself time to process and sort your findings.


Allow your teenager to be an expert, too. Ask them what sort of piercing they want, where they want it, who they want it from, and why. Ask them why they prefer one option over another. Allow them to take part in the research and decision-making process.
Allowing your teenager to be an expert can also help them decide if they want to commit or not. If a piercing is just a whim, they may quickly abandon the idea when pressed for information.

, Have your teen list what he or she sees as the positives of getting a piercing. Ask them to consider cons if they don't have any they can immediately see. You can use this understanding to better resolve the issue--your teenager may be able to more clearly understand their motivations once pros and cons are listed and consulted. If they deny that any cons exist, postpone the discussion and come back to it later once they've had some time to reflect.


It may be useful to refer your teen to a third party, such as someone who has had a piercing before, as your teen can learn about his or her experiences., Explain your concerns in a thoughtful, non-judgmental way. Tell your teen if you are concerned about how they will be perceived, or about the impact of getting a body piercing as they age and mature. Teenagers can be receptive to a wide range of reasons, including health reasons. Remember, the issue is not about your taste or preferences, but about your child’s well-being, now and in the future.

, Your teen may resist accepting your explanation that a body piercing is not the best idea for them. There are better and worse ways to reply to many of these responses, and it will help to anticipate them. Some samples of good replies might be the following:


Teen: “Everyone at school has them!” or “All of my friends have them!”

Parent: “Your friends John and Sara don’t have piercings and you really respect them. In fact, many of your older friends don't have piercings, and for good reasons that make sense to them. I want you to feel like you belong at school, but getting a piercing won't guarantee that. Maybe think of the goals that your friends have for being pierced or not pierced and see if they line up with your own.”


Teen: “My boyfriend/girlfriend really likes it.”

Parent: “You don’t need to change your body or who you are to meet the preferences of your partner. If they’re not happy with you the way you are, you might want to wonder why they're with you. Besides, what if this relationship doesn’t last? You’ll be stuck with the piercing, a painful reminder of a relationship that didn’t work.


Teen: “It’s my body so it should be my choice.”

Parent: “That's true--you do have choices about your body and how you present it. But while you are under my care, it’s my responsibility to take of you and your body until you are an adult. It’s totally normal to begin asserting your independence at your age, and soon you’ll be able to get as many piercings as you like. But, for now, I have to do what I think is best for you in the long run--this won't prevent you from getting piercings when you are older, when I think it's more clear that you're ready for them.”



, Your teenager may be unaware of the potential health risks associated with body piercings. After having researched the topic, you will be in a good position to inform him or her of the risks. Some of these risks includeSkin infections
Allergic reactions
Damage to teeth from tongue rings – repeated contact can chip away tooth enamel
Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, and other diseases can be transmitted through unsterilized needles
Tissue tearing if the piercing gets caught on hooks, zippers, corners, etc.

, If your teen’s reason for wanting a piercing is to fit in with others, there are probably other ways to accomplish this goal. For instance, instead of a body piercing, use the money for the piercing to get a trendier cell phone, clothes, or haircut. This way, your teen can feel like he or she is fitting in without piercing his or her body. Here’s how a conversation about fitting in might go:


Teen: “I’m going to get my tongue pierced.”

Parent: “I’m not sure that’s a good idea.”


Teen: “But all my friends have their tongues pierced. All of their parents said it was fine!”

Parent: “I understand what you’re saying. I remember when I was young, I wanted to get the same exact clothing brands as my best friends. But there are ways of getting along with your friends without piercing your tongue.


Teen: “It just looks cool, though.”

Parent: “Piercings can get infected, and tongue studs can chip away your tooth enamel and lead to longer term damage to your teeth and gums. Aren’t your friends all wearing horn-rimmed glasses? Those look pretty cool! Let’s look into some cosmetic glasses. They don’t carry the same risks as a tongue piercing, and I'd be more comfortable with you wearing them.”



, For instance, your teenager could use clip-on jewelry for the nose, which would not require piercing the body. After using the clip-on for a while, they may grow tired of the look and change their minds about wanting a piercing. Here’s how the conversation might go:


Teen: “I want a nose piercing.”

Parent: “Are you sure? You have to take your senior portrait taken soon. Do you really want to have your nose pierced in a picture you’ll keep forever?”


Teen: “I hadn’t thought about that, I guess. Still, I really want a septum piercing. It just looks cool.”

Parent: ""How about a clip-on piece? That way you can try out the look, but take it out for your senior portrait. If you like how it looks, you can get the piercing when you’re an adult. But if you end up changing your mind about it, there’s no harm done.”



, Teens can express themselves through their hairstyles, clothing choices, extracurricular activities, posters, music choices, and many other ways. Work with your teen to find other outlets to express their unique personalities. Here’s how the conversation might go if this is the reason your teen wants a piercing:


Teen: “I’m thinking about getting a lip ring – maybe a loop.”

Parent: “Really? Why?”


Teen: “Why not? It would just make me stand apart from other people. I think people with lip rings are more confident, and I want to express that I’m confident, too.”

Parent: “I see. I think you stand out in a lot of ways already, but I understand how it’s important to express yourself. Does a lip ring really say much, though? What if we dye your hair another color instead? You’ve talked about that sometimes. That way you can stand out without having to worry about cleaning the piercing all the time or risking an infection.”

You may choose to tell your child about puberty as you notice their bodily changes or start earlier in order to prepare them. It’s recommended that by age eight, children know about puberty and the associated physical and emotional changes.While you may choose to have a single conversation about puberty with your kids, keep conversations about development and coming into adulthood ongoing.
Girls experience puberty around age eight. If you notice an initial growth spurt, this can indicate the onset of puberty and mean that it’s time to talk.Boys experience puberty later than girls, usually around age ten or eleven.;
, It’s on you to open a discussion, so don’t wait for your children to come to you with questions. If you’re waiting for your child to come to you, you may be waiting forever.In fact, if you don't address it yourself, you may be unintentionally telling them that it's not okay to talk about or that it is something you're unwilling to discuss. This can hinder communications between you and your kids and drive a wedge between you, so make sure to be the adult and start a conversation with them about it.


Even though kids may hear information about sex and puberty from outside sources such as older siblings, friends, television, or the internet, it’s still important to have a talk with them yourself. Give them reliable information that is valid and true.Often, children receive untrue or unreliable information about sex and puberty. They might hear something from an older sibling or friend that is outright wrong. Make sure they get good information about the changes ahead from you.

, You may wish to plan an event around your discussion to make it more enjoyable for both you and your child. For example, take them out to lunch or dinner, go ice skating, or spend a day at the museum. Spend quality time together before or after the talk.


Keep the discussion brief and then get back to having fun. You don’t need to have a long, drawn-out conversation. You can always revisit the conversation later.

, Talking about puberty is not thought of as fun by either parents or children. If you’re nervous or anxious to talk about puberty with your kids, get informed. Gaining knowledge can help you speak with clarity and without getting too embarrassed. Stick with the facts if you’re nervous.


Try not to laugh or get embarrassed in front of your child. You want to normalize puberty without adding shame or embarrassment to it.
Make sure that you keep breathing and keep your body relaxed and softened. Avoid pacing, clenching, or holding tension in your body in other ways.

, You may wish to hand your child a pamphlet or book about what to expect with puberty. Get any books, pamphlets, videos, or other resources prior to sitting down with your child. You may want to give your child the name of a website they can check out, or go through the website together. If you want to use pictures, print them ahead of time. Gather a toolkit to help you explain things to your child.


Find helpful resources through the internet or books. There are a number of websites with helpful information regarding puberty and how to talk to your child. You could also give your child a copy of the books “”The Puberty Book: A Guide for Children and Teenagers” and “It’s Perfectly Normal.”

, Start by creating time to talk to your child when neither of you are rushed or distracted. Share some facts and allow your child to share their thoughts, feelings, and concerns. You may wish to begin by asking your child what they’ve heard or been told by others about puberty, then addressing what is right or wrong.If your child is nervous or anxious, keep your conversation brief and focus on building trust and openness for future conversations.
You can say, “You said that your friend told you a girl cannot become pregnant before she’s married. That’s wrong. A girl can become pregnant any time after her first menstrual cycle, even if she’s really young. How is that different from what you heard from your friend?”

, Talk about hormones and their role in puberty. Say that the body needs to go through puberty in order to be sexually mature, and the changes help that process to occur.Be sure to frame these changes in a positive way and make sure your child knows that it is nothing to be ashamed of or that they need to hide.


Say, “Hormones are chemical messengers in your body that are responsible for the changes that both boys and girls experience. These chemicals kickstart puberty and allow both boys and girls to mature into an adult body over time. That way, your body will be prepared for making the decision of having kids of your own one day.”

, Having changes in moods and emotions are a normal part of puberty. Changes in hormones can lead to emotional changes and mood lability. If your child is moody or experiencing mood swings, give them some space.Encourage your child to engage in exercise and physical activity, talk to friends, eat healthy foods, and get plenty of sleep. Encourage your child to turn off their electronic devices to help make sleep easier.

Sometimes, children may begin to show signs of mental health problems and experience depression, anxiety, or other more serious mental health disorders. For example, irritability and changes in temper can indicate depression. If you are concerned about your child’s moods or behavior, talk to a therapist or mental health provider., Children should know when something is not okay and how to talk to a trusted adult. This discussion should be ongoing and continue throughout your child’s life. Their changing body may attract attention that is new for them. Remind children that their body is their own and nobody else’s. Whether you wish to talk about sex or not, do bring up consent and that each person has the right to say “no” to any touch that feels uncomfortable.


Keep in mind that these discussions will need to change as children get older. For example, when they are young, they need to know what kinds of touching are inappropriate, but when they are older, they will need to know about consent for sexual activity.
From a young age, teach children the underwear rule: a person cannot touch them in places where underwear is worn and they cannot touch others in these places.Tell your child, “It’s exciting to see your body change as you move through puberty. However, your body is your own and nobody has the right to touch it without your permission. If someone tries to touch your body, say, “No.” Tell me or another adult you trust about it so that you can stay safe.”

, Many children fear that their bodies are no longer normal or are different from their friends’ bodies. Tell your children that everyone develops at different times and in different ways. Kids going through puberty want to be normal and fit in with their friends. Assure them that all of the changes they are going through are totally normal and won’t go on forever.For example, your daughter may develop breasts before her friends. Assure her that it is normal to develop breasts and her friends will develop them, too.
Say, “You’ll notice that most of the kids in your grade have or will start to change. It can be scary, but it’s totally normal for boys to grow taller and develop deeper voices. Girls will grow breasts and start their periods. Whenever it happens, it’s normal.”

, Both boys and girls develop body hair during puberty. Tell your children that it’s normal to have hair in places it wasn’t before. Tell children that hair growth is normal. In some cultures, shaving body hair is socially acceptable and boys may start to shave their facial hair while girls may start to shave their underarm hair.Say, “Body hair is a normal part of puberty and you may start to notice it in your genital area and underarms. Boys start to develop facial hair.”
Sometimes body hair comes alongside body odor. Talk to your children about body odor and bring up options like deodorant. Say, “When body odor becomes unpleasant, it’s time to start using deodorant. We can go pick out some if you’d like.”

, You may choose to talk about menstruation to boys and girls differently, although it’s important that both boys and girls understand menstruation so that shame, embarrassment, and misunderstanding don’t cloud perceptions. It’s vital to talk about menstruation with girls prior to them having their periods so that don’t feel fearful or frightened by the sight of blood in their underwear.For example, say, “Menstruation is a normal and healthy part of being a woman and is nothing to be afraid of. Boys shouldn’t be scared of it, either. It is part of reproduction and helps a woman know if she is pregnant or not.“
For girls, you may want to explain menstruation in more depth to let them know what to expect and how to handle their monthly changes. Give a brief, age-appropriate explanation of feminine hygiene products. You can revisit this conversation later on when they start menstruating, but laying the groundwork will help to combat any fears they might have about it.

, Let your children know that spontaneous erections occur at times, which can feel embarrassing in public. Let boys know that the erections will go away, and a well placed bookbag or jacket can cover it if they feel embarrassed.Talk about wet dreams before they start happening, around age 12-16. Left misunderstood, wet dreams can frighten or embarrass a boy or make him think something is wrong.
To boys, say, “Erections are normal, even if they’re uncomfortable. If you get an erection, don’t worry. It will go away.”
Tell your child that if they notice a boy’s erection, they shouldn't make fun of him.

, Children often feel insecure or embarrassed about their changes. Reassure your child that they will get through puberty. Children may begin to feel more self-conscious or awkward in their appearance. Some children may become irritable or moody. Help them understand these changes and reassure them that it won’t last forever.Let them know that you are there for them and that you care.


Remind them that you love them and support them. Even if their moods upset you, be gentle and loving toward them. Do not match their mood or tone with yours. Remember that you are the adult, and it is up to you to model good emotional self-control for them.

, Let your children know that you’re here for them and are available to answer any questions or concerns that they have. Girls may ask why they haven’t gotten their periods yet or why their breasts are different sizes. Boys may ask about wet dreams or changes to their testicles or penis. If you don’t have an answer for them, say, “That’s a great question. Let me get back to you on that” and do some research to adequately address the question.Give your child the time and opportunity to ask questions. Tell them that their questions are important and answer them as honestly as you can. Do not smile, laugh, or joke about their concerns. This may minimize their concerns and make them feel foolish. It will not lighten the mood.

, Children may come to you with embarrassing questions that may make you want to run and hide. Instead of making up a story about storks or magical lands, answer their questions as honestly as you can within an age-appropriate framing. Use these moments to talk to your child about puberty and sexuality in a matter-of-fact way that shows that you’re not afraid to answer their curious questions.For example, if your eight-year-old asks you about oral sex, say, “That’s something that grown-ups do by putting their mouths on each other’s genitals.”

Provide resources.",How to Talk to Teenagers About HIV/AIDS," When you discuss AIDS, it is important to make sure that you have all of your facts straight. If you give a teen false information, they might form prejudices or unknowingly engage in risky behavior. Look for good sources so that you know your information is accurate.Head to your local library. Ask the reference librarian to point you towards the most recent scientific research.
Talk to your doctor. Ask if they have some information you could study. However, keep in mind that local, free healthcare clinics often have much more information on STDs, such as HIV/AIDS. They also usually staff HIV/AIDS Case Managers who are knowledgeable on the statistics and prevalence of HIV/AIDS in the community. Knowing information about the prevalence of HIV/AIDS in their community may have a greater effect on teens than national statistics.
Look for reputable sources such as aids.gov, aids.org, and unaids.org.;
, Once you find some good sources, it's time to start learning. Even if you think you're well-informed, new research on AIDS is published regularly. Take care to get caught up on the most current information.Read statistics about AIDS, and the spread of the disease. You can focus specifically on your geographic region, or take a global view.
Learn the facts about HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.
Know that a blood test is the only sure way to determine whether someone has AIDS.

, It's important that your teen know how AIDs is transferred from person to person. Make sure to include facts about the causes of AIDS in your discussion. For example, you can say, ""Having unprotected sex just once with an infected person can transfer the disease.""You should also tell the teen that the best way to avoid becoming infected with HIV is to practice abstinence and to not share needles with anyone.This includes needles used for intravenous drugs and tattoos.
Make it clear that you cannot tell by looking at someone whether or not they are infected.

, If you are unclear about any of the facts, don't be afraid to ask questions. Your doctor can be a great resource in this situation. You can say, ""I'm going to discuss AIDS with Jenny. What are the most important facts for me to convey?""


You can also ask advice from a family member or close friend. Try asking, ""I'm nervous about approaching Jenny to talk about AIDS. How do you think I should start the conversation?"" Keep in mind that that it is totally normal to be nervous.
Try to prepare yourself for the talk beforehand, such as by thinking about what you want to say and why. You might even prepare some visual aids to help you go trough all of the information.
It is also important to be honest about the thoughts and questions you have on the subject. Try writing these down to anticipate some of the questions that teens might ask.
The school nurse might also be helpful. Ask if there is any literature on AIDS specifically geared towards teens.

, You want to feel comfortable for this talk, and you want your teen to feel at ease, too. Pick a place where you will both feel free to talk. The teen's room might be a good place. Or you could try the dinner table. Avoid picking a spot where you are likely to be interrupted.


Timing is also important. Choose a day and time where neither your or the teen are in a hurry. Maybe a Sunday evening would work well.
Avoid having this important talk when either you or your teen are particularly tired or stressed. For example, don't broach the subject the night before your teen has an important exam at school.

, Your first words will set the tone for the entire talk. Take some time to consider the best conversation opener. Do you want to get straight to the point or ease into the topic? That depends on you and your teen.You could try saying, ""When do you have time to talk this week? I want to make sure you have all of the facts about AIDS.""
Or you could be more spontaneous. Knock on your teen's door and ask simply, ""Do you have a few minutes?""

, Once you begin the conversation, it is important that you make your points clear. Get to the point quickly. You can say, ""I want to make sure you know the causes of HIV and AIDS. I'd like to share some information with you.Don't avoid subjects that are uncomfortable. Maybe you feel a bit strange talking about sex to teenagers. You need to stay calm and face the topic head on.
You can say, ""I'd like to talk to you about condoms and make sure you know how to use them properly.

, Don't be afraid to share your thoughts and feelings with teens. You can say, ""AIDS is a terrible disease, and I want to do everything I can to help you stay safe."" You should also try to answer questions as honestly as you can.Clearly explain risks. You don't have to try to scare teens, but it is important that you are honest about dangers. You can say, ""Do you understand everything I'm telling you about how people become infected? Does it make sense that needles can be very dangerous?"", You want your teen to listen to you. Set a good example and offer them the same respect. Pay attention to what your teen says, and make sure to thoughtfully consider each question.Demonstrate active listening by maintaining eye contact and nodding your head occasionally while your teen speaks.
Illustrate your understanding by paraphrasing. For instance, you could say, ""I hear you saying that still need more information about how to avoid contracting AIDS.""

, The initial conversation is important, but it's also a good idea to make this an ongoing discussion. A good way to encourage your teen to keep talking is to ask questions every so often.For example, you could say, ""I thought our talk last week about AIDS was really useful. Have you given the subject anymore thought over the past few days?""
You could also try, ""Have you covered this topic in your health class?""

, It's possible that during your talk your teen asked you some questions. It's ok if you didn't know all of the answers. Just make sure to get back to the teen after you've had some time to carefully consider the question.Say something like, ""Kelly, you asked me how long it takes for HIV to develop into AIDS. I wanted to make sure I had my facts straight before I answered you. Let's talk about it more now.""

, Everyday instances are often great ways to naturally bring up a subject. A teachable moment is taking advantage of an opportunity to broach the subject. For example, maybe you and your teen are watching a movie together. After it's over, you could say, ""It was sad when the character of Amy found out she had AIDS. How did that make you feel?""Other teachable moments can be found while reading the news, listening to the radio, or by observing people around you.

, One of the best ways to follow up with teens is to offer them additional information. If the teen does not feel comfortable talking to you, you can make sure that they know where to find accurate information.Make sure your teen is aware of resources like AIDSinfo and Project Inform.
If your teen seems reluctant to talk, you can send them an e-mail or text with links to good sites.

Explain the consequences of stealing.,
Show your teen the consequences of stealing.,
Impose a punishment that requires a positive action from your teen.,
Ask your teen why they feel they need to steal.,
Provide other sources of income for your teen.,
Get your teen involved in healthy extra curricular activities.,
Spend quality time with your teen.,
Speak to a family counselor or therapist if your teen keeps stealing.",How to Stop a Teenager from Stealing," Perhaps you discovered your teen was stealing money out of your wallet, or you found stolen goods in your teen’s backpack. If your teen is a first time offender and has not been charged with a crime, it’s important that you sit your teen down and explain how taking other people’s property is illegal and could lead to jail time. Don’t downplay the seriousness of the situation or coddle your teen into believing stealing is okay as long as you don’t get caught. Be clear and forceful with your words as you explain the serious, potentially life altering consequences of stealing to your teen.Use legal terms to explain the possible jail time associated with committing larceny (which is when you steal property from someone, like a purse or a bicycle) and committing a felony (which is when you steal with the intent to deprive someone of money, such as taking someone’s wallet or writing a bad check).The value of the stolen property will determine if the crime is considered a felony or a misdemeanor. Regardless of the level of the crime, your teen could be fined a steep amount or serve several months or years in jail if they are caught stealing.;
, Another method is to show, rather than tell, your teen what could happen if they are caught stealing. If your teen has stolen money or goods from you, some parents recommend calling the police and having a police officer mock arrest the teen. The officer may hand cuff your teen and place him in the back of the police car so he can explain what a felony charge is and how it can affect your teen’s future.This may seem like an extreme tactic, and it should only be done if your teen has stolen from you directly as you are the one who will decide whether or not to press charges against your teen. However, this tactic can scare your teen so much that he may never even consider stealing again.

, Rather than enforce a physical punishment or a shaming punishment that causes your teen to become more angry and resentful, focus on creating a punishment that requires your teen to make up for stealing with a positive action. This will reinforce the damage stealing does to the relationships with those around you, and allow your teen to learn the value of honesty.For example, you may have caught your teen stealing money from your purse. You may then punish him by having him pay back all the money he stole from you. This may take time, as he may need to get a job or do odd jobs to earn back the money. But he will learn the consequences of his actions, gain more responsibility by getting a job, and understand why it’s wrong to steal.
Another option is to have your teen pay back the money with doing extra chores around the house or cooking dinner for the family for a month. This way, he will be doing positive actions for others to make up for his mistake.

, Your teen may be motivated to steal due to other issues or problems. Identifying the root cause of your teen’s actions will help you prevent your teen from stealing again. Teens tend to steal for several reasons, including:Peer pressure can be a big motivator for your teen’s stealing. He may want the latest smart phone or the cool, new sneakers and feel the only way to get them is to steal them from others, or steal to money from you to buy these items. A big part of adolescence is fitting in with your peers, and your teen may feel pressure to have certain items so he can blend in with the other teens at school.
The need for attention is also another possible reason why your teen is stealing. Any attention from others, especially authority figures, can seem better to your teen than none at all. Your teen may be stealing because he knows it will get your attention and make you notice them.
Embarrassment or anxiety around certain items, like condoms, tampons, emergency contraception, or a pregnancy test, could lead your teen to steal these items. Your teen may be too embarrassed to go to the clinic for these items or to ask you for money for these things, so he feels his only resort is to steal them.
The thrill of wrongdoing could also be a motivator for your teen. Often, teens enjoy the thrill of doing something wrong and participating in risky behavior. Most teens are interested in things that are off limits or considered wrong. So stealing may be one way they are pushing the boundaries and trying to see how much they can get away with.

, If your teen is stealing because they feel they cannot afford items their peers own, have your teen get a part time job after school or take up odd jobs to earn some money. This will help him learn responsibility and money management, and allow him the freedom to purchase items he wants, rather than steal them.


You want to suggest your teen create a budget and learn how to manage his money so he develops good money management habits.

, Encourage your teen to focus his energies on improving his skills and abilities with others in a productive way through joining a sports team or a club at school. This may help him connect with peers who are interested in other things besides material objects or the latest must have items.

, Stealing can be seen as a cry for attention from your teen. Don’t ignore this. Instead, try to spend quality time with your teen on a consistent basis. Show your teen you care about him and what he’s interested in by suggesting you do a favorite activity together or you both go see a band he likes.During this quality time, you may want to discuss contraception and condoms with your teen if you find out embarrassment or shame was his reason for stealing. Let your teen ask specific questions and provide these items so your teen does not have to feel embarrassed about having them. Talk to your teen about sex if this is part of his motivation for stealing.

, If you catch your teen stealing again, it may be time to reach out to a family counselor or a therapist. Some teens steal due to deeper issues that may require hands on therapy, with your family or at an individual level. Don’t let your teen’s stealing become a habit, as this can lead to more serious consequences and a skewed moral code for your teen.Some teens can develop kleptomania, a rare compulsive disorder where the person feels anxiety or tension before stealing and then feels relief or gratification after stealing. Talk to your doctor or a therapist if you suspect your teen may be developing this disorder.

Set realistic goals for the first lesson.,
Before the driving lesson, go for a short drive by yourself.,
Choose an appropriate location for the lesson.,
Make sure the teenager is familiar with the buttons, switches, and gauges on the dashboard.,
Be patient.",How to Survive a Teenager's First Driving Lesson," Possible goals include learning how to start the car, shift gears, use the accelerator and brakes, and get comfortable turning the car. For a vehicle with a standard transmission, just learning how to start the car and shift gears might be enough for the first lesson.
, As you start your car and ease onto the road, take notice of all the small steps involved in the driving process: checking mirrors, starting the car, braking, shifting gears, and so forth. Since you'll be teaching the whole detailed process to someone else, it will be useful to remind yourself of all the steps that experienced drivers perform without thinking about them., The best ones are spacious, out-of-the way places such as easy country roads or parking lots containing few or no cars. The fewer people and obstacles at your location, the better. Drive the teenager to this location before letting him or her take the driver's seat for the lesson., He or she should know where they are and what they do., As you guide the teenager through the steps of driving, remember that he or she is learning a complex skill that will take many hours to master. Sometimes learning to drive can be frustrating, so if tempers flare, bring the lesson to an end to decrease the possibility of an accident. Plan a new lesson for a time when everyone involved is calm."

Check the graduated driver rules in your state.,
Tell your teen to always wear their seatbelt.,
Ban the use of their cellphone in the car.,
Restrict the use of drugs or alcohol in the car.,
Limit the number of teen passengers allowed in the car.,
Confirm they understand and follow the rules of the road.",How to Set Rules for Your Teen Driver1," Every state has their own rules around graduated drivers that state when teen drivers can be on the road and how many passengers they can have in the car at one time. Look up the graduated driver rules in your state so you are aware of the limits around your teen driver. You and your teen should discuss these rules together so you are both informed.You can find the complete rules for graduated drivers by state online. You can also call your local American Motors Association (AMA) chapter to get more information on graduated driver rules.;
, One of the most important rules of the road is to always wear a seatbelt in the car when driving. Reinforce this rule by telling your teen they absolutely must wear their seatbelt at all times when they are driving. You may penalize them for not doing so by restricting their use of the car.You should also tell your teen that every passenger in the car must wear their seatbelt when they are driving. This means any friends, family, or acquaintances in the car must buckle up before your teen starts driving.
For example, you may tell your teen, ""You must wear your seatbelt at all times when you are driving the car. Any passengers you have in the car must also wear their seatbelts at all times, no exceptions.""

, Make sure your teen is not distracted when driving by banning the use of their cellphone when they are driving the car. In most states, it is also illegal to use your cellphone while driving. Remind your teen that not only do they put themselves and others at risk when they text and drive, they can also receive a hefty ticket or demerits on their driving record if they get caught.You may also tell your teen not to let their passengers use their cellphones in the car so your teen is not distracted when driving.
For example, you may tell your teen, ""You cannot use your cellphone while you are driving the car and I would prefer if you limited cellphone use in the car period, especially when you have passengers in the car.""

, Let your teen know that they are not allowed under any circumstances to drive while under the influence of drugs or alcohol. You may not allow the presence of drugs or alcohol in the car period when they are driving and tell them they cannot have any passengers who are under the influence in the car with them.As part of this rule, you can also outline consequences if your teen breaks this rule and allows friends who are inebriated in the car. You may revoke their driving privileges if this happens.
You should also remind your teen that it is against the law to drive while under the influence of drugs or alcohol and that doing so can put themselves and others in danger.
For example, you may tell your teen, ""Under no circumstances can you drive the car when you are under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Not only does it put you and others on the road in danger, it is also against the law.""

, In some states, having a graduated driver’s license means the driver can only have a certain number of passengers in the car at one time. Make sure your teen understands how many passengers are allowed and try to limit their passengers to no more than one to two people at a time. Having a lot of passengers in the car can lead to distracted driving and put your teen at risk of an accident.You may start by allowing your teen to have one to two passengers at a time that you know well. You may tell them they cannot let strangers into the car without checking with you first so you know exactly who is in the car with your teen at all times.
For example, you may tell your teen, ""I would prefer if you only had one to two passengers in the car at one time. This rule may shift over time, but for now, I am limiting how many passengers you can drive around at one time.""

, You should also confirm your teen understands the rules of the road before they get behind the wheel. If they passed their driver’s test and earned their license, they should be well aware of how to follow road signs, how to interact with other drivers, and how to be a proactive driver. You may still want to be sure your teen is able to follow the rules of the road by quizzing them and by taking a drive with them around the neighborhood.You may also ask your teen to drive you to an errand on a major road to confirm they can follow the rules of the road and be responsible behind the wheel. When you are in the car with them, try not to be a backseat driver and let them take control of the wheel so you can confirm they are a confident driver.
Make sure your teen follows the speed limits when they drive. Tell them it is dangerous to speed and that it puts their life and the lives of others at risk.

Let them know when they can and cannot drive the car.,
Tell them they are responsible for any traffic tickets or infractions.,
Discuss gas payments and car maintenance.,
Set up insurance coverage for your teen.",How to Set Rules for Your Teen Driver2," You should sit down with your teenage driver and outline rules around when they can and cannot use the car. This is especially important if your teen is using the family car or a shared car, as you will need to make sure you and other members of the family have access to the car as well. Make a weekly schedule with your teen so they know when they can have access to the car.For example, you may tell your teen, “You can use the car to drive to hockey practice after school on Mondays and Wednesdays” or “You are allowed to use the car on weekends but you have it back in the garage by 9 pm.”
You may decide to avoid letting your teen drive at night or very late at night, as their risk of an accident goes up once it gets dark. You may set a nightly curfew so your teen brings the car back before dark.

, Let your teen know that as the driver of the car, they are responsible for what happens with the car. This means that if they get a parking ticket, they are responsible for paying for the ticket. If they break a rule of the road and get a ticket or an infraction, they will have to deal with the consequences.You may decide to make your teen pay for any parking tickets as punishment. You may then restrict their access to the car as punishment for an infraction or for breaking a rule of the road. Doing this will ensure your teen understands the importance of safe driving and takes driving seriously.

, You should also talk about whether your teen is responsible for paying for their own gas or if you will split the cost of gas with them. Make sure you address who is responsible for maintaining the car if it breaks down or has an issue. You may decide your teen needs to learn to take care of the car and suggest they bring the car in for maintenance on a regular basis.For example, you and your teen may come to an agreement where they pay for their own gas and you help them cover the cost of maintaining the car.

, Before you let your teen drive the family car, you should make sure they are covered by the insurance on the car. You may add their name to the insurance so they covered in the event of an accident. If your teen is using their own car, make sure it is insured before they start driving.You and your teen may also discuss who will be responsible for the insurance payments. You may offer to split the cost with your teen or require them to pay for insurance on their own as part of the rules for using the car.

Discuss the rules again after six months.,
Adjust the rules once your teen earns their permanent driver’s license.,
Continue to be a good driving role model for your teen.",How to Set Rules for Your Teen Driver3," See how your teen does with these rules for six months. Note if they break any of your rules and penalize them accordingly. If they show they can follow your rules for six months and do not break any of them, you may decide to revisit the rules. Discuss any changes in the rules only when you are comfortable with your teen as a driver and when they have earned your trust.


For example, after six months you may extend your teen’s curfew by half an hour or one hour so they can stay out later and drive home on their own. Or you may give your teen more access to the car to run errands on their own after six months of following your rules.

, You may also decide to wait until your teen earns their permanent driver’s license, which they will do after several years of driving. In most states, drivers have to take a road test to get their permanent driver’s license. Once your teen does this, you may then loosen up the rules on the car a little bit.Depending on your finances, you may offer to help your teen buy a car once they earn their permanent driver’s license. Doing this will show your teen you trust them and consider them a responsible driver.

, As your teen gets the hang of driving and ventures out with the car on their own, you as a parent should be a good driving model for them. Maintain your composure when you are in the car with your teen and be a good driver when you are behind the wheel. Modeling good driving behavior will help your teen learn about road safety and ensure they pick up good driving habits.If you notice your teen making a driving mistake when you are in the car with them, be sure to point it out and offer advice or feedback. Doing this will ensure you are a good driving model even when you are not driving and teach your teen the correct way to drive on the road.

Don’t raise your voice.,
Try to keep your teenager calm.,

Follow through with punishments every time.,
Don’t negotiate without a very good reason.,

Remove privileges when necessary.Be ready for an argument if you choose to take away something that your teen values, but doing so is the most effective way to demonstrate to your teen that certain behaviors simply will not be tolerated.,
Reward good behavior.Don’t wait for them to upset you before discussing their behavior.,
Bribe them into good behavior, but bribe thoughtfully.The research on bribing children for good behavior is a mixed bag: some argue that it’s a good way to develop positive habits, while others say that it results in children who will behave properly only when promised a reward.,
Be a good listener.Your teenager’s problems might seem trivial in comparison to adult ones, but your child will be less combative with you if you demonstrate to them that you care about the things that upset them.,
Be a good role model.Think about how you act around your child: do you roll your eyes or fight with your partner in front of them?,
Eat meals together as a family.Between work, homework, friends, and the internet and TV, it can hard to get all members of your family together at the table for dinner, but studies have repeatedly shown that regular family meals is a proven indicator of desirable behavior in children of all ages.,
Coordinate your efforts with other adults.,
Sign your teenager up for a sport.,
Attend functional family therapy (FFT) with your child.,
Attend attachment-based family therapy (ABFT) with your child if they suffer from parental attachment problems.",How to Respond to Smart Mouthed Teens," Studies have shown that yelling at your teenager, no matter how much you may believe they deserve it, actually makes behavior worse.It might feel good in the short term, but parenting is about improving your child’s behavior, not making yourself feel good. No matter how hard it is, don’t let yourself yell back, even if your child is yelling at you at the top of their lungs.;
, Even if you keep your cool, it doesn't feel good to get yelled at. Furthermore, you need to break your child of the habit of raising their voice to you before they begin to think that it's acceptable behavior.


If it's a relatively new behavior, be understanding with them and explain why yelling doesn't help: ""I understand that you're upset, but yelling doesn't do anything but get both of us riled up. The more worked up we get, the less likely we'll be to reach a happy ending here.""
If it's repeated behavior, be firmer: ""I do my very best to never raise my voice to you, no matter how upset I get. I expect the same courtesy from you.""
If your teenager has made a habit out of being smart with you, set firm, strict boundaries in a confident tone: ""I don't know what you think you're going to accomplish by being sarcastic with me. At the end of the day, I'm still your parent, and you need to watch your tone and lower your voice before I double your punishment.""

, Everyone can think back to a time when they snapped at someone without thinking first about what they were saying — usually, you regret it immediately. Take a few seconds to work through your immediate reaction of frustration or anger before responding to your child. Your teenager is coming from an uncontrollably emotional place, but it’s on you as an adult and parent to speak from a place of reason.


Don’t worry about voicing your personal frustration; instead, focus on what you can say that will actually elicit the desired behavior from your child.

, It may be helpful to breathe deeply for a few moments to get your breathing and heart rate under control. By consciously reducing the physical symptoms of agitation, you can put yourself in a calmer mindset. Counting to ten is a useful tool, though it may take longer to get yourself under control.

, If your reaction is so strong that deep breathing and counting to ten don’t work, you need to take a break from the conversation, and ask your teenager to do the same. While decompressing, do something that relieves your stress: read a book, knit, cook, lay down and close your eyes — whatever you need to do to feel better.


""I'm too upset right now to speak calmly, and so are you. I'm worried that we're going to say hurtful things to each other, so other, so we should take a break.""
""I love you very much, but I think we need to be apart for fifteen minutes before we can continue this discussion.""
""Let's both go into our rooms and calm down. When I feel ready to talk, I'll wait for you in the living room, and you do the same if you calm down before me.""
Don’t restart the conversation until you’ve both plateaued emotionally.

, When emotions are high, hearing the word “you” over and over again will make anyone feel attacked, and that’s not what you want. Instead of attacking the teenager about their bad attitude, try to make them understand how their words and actions make life harder for the people around them, including you. For example, try saying:


“I feel bad when you speak to me this way” instead of “you have a bad attitude.”
“I get exhausted between working and cleaning up after everyone at home” instead of “you never clean up your messes.”
“Your father/mother is going through a rough patch right now” instead of “you need to be nicer to your mother/father.”

, Pay attention to the situations that seem to elicit the worst behavior from your teenager. It may be that your child is most irritable immediately after school, but that they calm down after they’ve had a snack or nap. It may be that they act out more when they have a lot of work for school, or when they’re fighting with a friend or significant other.


By being alert to the situations that trigger your teen’s worst behavior, you have a choice to either give them more leeway or to proactively lessen their stress.
Be proactive by making their lives easier: have snacks waiting in the kitchen after school; help them with their homework; etc.

, While it’s very difficult to watch your child go from a sweet, loving child to a combative teen, you have to remember that to a certain degree, their backtalk has nothing to do with you. Beginning with early adolescence (age 12-14), a healthy child will begin to develop a new and, to them, groundbreaking awareness that adults, including their parents, are not infallible.As they’re struggling to reconcile what they’ve always thought about you with this new realization that you are a flawed human being, it’s perfectly normal for them to lash out from time to time before they learn how to relate to you as one adult to another.


Remember that it’s not just your child. Talk to your friends with similarly-aged children, and you’ll find that all teenagers act out to some degree.

, Bad behavior in a child is infuriating, and it’s very difficult to get beyond the frustration you rightly feel. However, it’ll be much easier for you to keep your cool if you try to consider the experience from their perspective. Think back to your own adolescence — odds are high that you said your own share of hurtful things to your parents. Some things to remember about life from your teenager’s point of view include:


Egocentrism, or the belief that their interpretation of the situation is the only possible correct interpretation is a normal part of cognitive development.Your child’s brain is developing the capability to grow beyond egocentrism, but it’s not finished yet. For example, when they were three, they might stand in front of the TV and not understand that just because they could see the TV didn’t mean that others in the room could see through their body. As teenagers, they’ve developed beyond that — but there’s still a ways to go.
Your teenager’s brain is developing in a way that allows them to grasp abstraction in a new way, and for the first time.Injustices seem to be everywhere — but without the wisdom that comes with life experience, and without the cognitive ability to flesh out the logical repercussions of their abstract thinking.
Because of this, they get incredibly worked up about things that seem insignificant from an adult’s perspective. But remember that their brains are still developing important cognitive functions that will allow them to see the way you, as an adult, do with time.

, While it’s true that parenting is a day-to-day judgment of which hill to die on, there’s a difference between keeping calm and letting your teenager get away with bad behavior. Although you don’t want to get into a fight with your child every time they mutter under their breath or roll their eyes, you do want to engage them in discussions frequently enough to send a clear message that all such behavior is inappropriate.


Decide which behaviors you will tolerate and which ones you will engage.One method might be to let nonverbal rudeness like excessive sighing and eye-rolling slide, while engaging with verbal backtalk.

, If your child does not have a clear sense of where the boundaries are in family interactions, they won’t be able to stay within your limits. Creating an explicit, written contract about the repercussions for backtalking and other bad behavior is a good way to establish boundaries.Although confrontation is exhausting, it’s very important that you be a verbal communicator when your child breaks the contract. Be explicit about which parts of your teenager’s behavior or language crosses the line between acceptable teenaged acting out and problematic disrespect. For example:


“It’s perfectly fine for you to tell me that you’re too tired to clean your room right now — I understand that you have a lot of schoolwork right now. However, raising your voice to me like this isn’t acceptable, and will result in punishment every time.”
""You may not be able to control rolling your eyes, but you can control raising your voice and being sarcastic. That crosses the line.""
""I respect that you're upset that I'm grounding you — I would be upset, too. But even though I'm upset with you right now, I haven't cursed at you. You're allowed to be mad at me, but you're not allowed to use disrespectful language.""

, If you apply punishments haphazardly, your teenager will not be receiving a clear message about the repercussions of their back-talking. Explain to your child what the precise repercussions will be for bad behavior so they know exactly what’s coming down the pipeline when they act up. For example, tell them that:


""I understand that you're young, and sometimes you're going to lose your temper. However, if you raise your voice to us twice in a week, we're cutting your allowance in half.""
""Using curse words in this house will result in being grounded for the weekend, no excuses.""

, You might think that you’ll spend your entire day doling out punishments if you follow through with the repercussions every time your teenager acts up, but nobody said parenting was easy! If you apply punishments irregularly — letting them get away with behaviors sometimes and coming down on them at other times — you’re sending mixed messages and confusing your teenager. Teenagers are programmed to push boundaries, so the boundaries must be firm.


""You know perfectly well that raising your voice twice in this house will get your allowance cut. Get your temper in check right now, or you know what's coming.""
""Promising not to talk back again doesn't change the fact that you just talked back to me. You know what the repercussions are for your behavior. It's on you to control yourself from the beginning.""

, If your child does something that should result in being grounded during prom, you might defer their grounding to the next weekend. After all, you want them to learn a lesson, not miss important life experiences. In general, though, don’t get into a habit of letting your teenager negotiate with you about normal repercussions. Wanting to go to the mall with their friends is not a special enough occasion to merit bending the ground rules for acceptable behavior.

, Simply grounding your teenager and letting them stew in their room will not necessarily improve their behavior. Some teenagers might actually enjoy the quiet time to laze around their room. Instead, use their punishment as an opportunity to instill life lessons. For example:


""I understand that you're upset about not getting the video game you want, but you need to learn that there's a difference between what you earn and what you deserve. Everyone deserves a roof over their head, clothes on their backs, good in their stomachs, and love from their family — but not everyone has even that. We're going to volunteer together at a soup kitchen this weekend to get a sense of how much you have that should should be grateful for.""
""I don't think you understand how hurtful your words can be, so your punishment will be to write an essay on the history of slurs in this country. Prove to me that you understand the power of words.""
""I think you're having trouble communicating with me in a productive manner. I want you to write me a letter about how you feel about this, and spend some time getting it right using respectful language.""

, The privilege you remove will depend on your teen — consider what he or she values most, and will be most unwilling to give up in the future.


For example, you might take away your child's car, cell phone, laptop, television, etc.
Set a clear deadline for when the privilege will be reinstated; reinstatement will be contingent on good behavior in the interim.
Tell your child, ""The next time you act like this, you will lose this privilege for (x) days longer. The punishment will increase every time you act like this.""

, When your teen does something that makes you proud or makes your life easier — cleaning up the dishes without being asked, sticking up for a bullied classmate, etc. — be quicker with praise than you are with punishment when they disappoint you.


A heartfelt “thank you” with a hug and a kiss will make your teenager want to continue acting in ways that make them feel especially loved and appreciated.
Sometimes, if your teenager is especially good about reacting well in a stressful situation or goes a long time without talking back, you might want to give them a special reward.
Examples of positive rewards might include buying them something they want (a video game, for example), enrolling them in lessons they want (tennis, guitar, etc.), taking them on an outing (a sporting event), or allowing an outing they would not normally be allowed to participate in (going to a concert with friends)., Bribery can work well, but only if you put a lot of thought into the message you’re sending your child.


Don’t frame it as a bribe. For example, you might give your child a regular allowance that is withheld if they speak to you disrespectfully.
That way, they don’t see it as a bribe for good behavior, but as a repercussion of bad behavior. Instead of training them to see aberrant good behavior as something that is rewarded from time to time, they’ll see aberrant bad behavior as something that is punished.

, Find ways to connect with your teenager about normal adolescent problems:


""I remember how hard it was to stay awake in school when I was you age. Heck, I still have trouble staying awake at work now. But your grades are slipping, so let me share some of the tricks I use to make sure I have energy during the day.""
""There's nothing worse than feeling like you're friends are talking about you behind your back. Tell me how you're dealing with it.""

, If so, you’re leading them to believe that such behavior is acceptable. Children learn by imitating the behavior of those around them, and while you can’t always control the behavior of others around them (in school, on TV, etc.), you can control the behavior you’re modeling for them.

, Make family meals a priority.


Use that time to ask your child about what’s going well for them these days, and what’s upsetting them.
This is a way to let them vent their frustrations in a way that actually builds up the bond between parent and child.
Without regular conversations like this, you will only hear about their frustrations when they build up and explode into an argument.

, They say “it takes a village to raise a child,” and there’s a lot of truth in that statement. There are many other adults who come into contact with your children, and they’re probably being treated as poorly as you are by your teen. Reach out to them to coordinate an effort to create boundaries and enact discipline in a systematic way to curb your teenager’s attitude problem.


Set up a meeting with the school’s guidance counselor to discuss behavioral problems your child may be having at school and an action plan to curb such behavior.
Speak to your child’s individual teachers, if possible. Work out a system of repercussions for back-talking that extends from home into the classroom, and across all of your child’s teachers.
For example, you may ask the teachers to notify you of back-talking at school so you can discipline the child through extra chores, grounding, etc. at home.
If your child spends a lot of time at a particular friend’s house, maintain regular communication with that friend’s parents. If you’re comfortable with their parenting style and capabilities, tell them they should feel free to discipline your child as they would their own for any bad behavior they witness in their home.

, Studies have shown that playing sports in a structured, team-oriented manner over a prolonged period of time does a lot more than simply keep kids in shape; it is also correlated with higher grades, a decrease in behavioral problems, and higher self-esteem. A team sport will also provide your teenager with a positive authority figure in the role of the coach; a good coach will promote healthy social behavior and provide emotional support that your teenager may simply be unwilling to turn to you for.Furthermore, the bond hopefully created between your child and their teammates will create a sense of belonging and pride — to both the team and the school — that is correlated with better focus and behavior.Choose a sport that your teenager actually enjoys; forcing your problem teen into something they actively dislike will likely not improve their behavior.
Research the coach before allowing your child to join the team. Arrange a meeting to speak with them, and talk to the parents of other children on the team to make sure the coach’s goals for character development are in line with your own.
Speak with the coach candidly about the problems you are having at home with your teenager, so they know what to expect and can formulate a plan for how to deal with these issues.
Show interest in your child’s team involvement. Go to every game you can attend, and be a vocal supporter. Cheer your child on, and grieve with them when they lose.

, Even if you think the problems lie within your child alone, you, as a parent, must be willing to do some serious work if you want your child’s behavior to improve. FFT is recommended for the families of children of 11-18 year of age who demonstrate serious behavioral issues, including delinquency and violence. The therapy centers on five dimensions: engagement, motivation, relational assessment, behavior change and generalization.Engagement: FFT therapists develop a close relationship with all members of the family and are available to them to a far larger degree than non-FFT therapists. The therapist relationship is far more intimate than with other types of therapy.
Motivation: the therapist will help redefine the difference between blame and responsibility — a line which often becomes blurry. The goal is to shift the family dynamic from one of blame to one of hope.
Relational assessment: the therapist will provide an objective analysis of the dynamics between family members through observation and questioning. They will attempt to shift the perception of family problems from individual perspectives to a relationship perspective, in which family members see the connectedness of the family unit and how it functions together, rather than focusing on themselves as an isolated unit within a family structure.
Behavior change: the therapist will equip your family with conflict resolution techniques and communication methods that will help you work through bad moods and family problems in a more constructive manner.
Generalization: you will create a plan for how to extend what you have learned in the FFT sessions forward into your life beyond therapy.
FFT generally involves 12-14 sessions conducted over the course of 3-5 months.

, Attachment theory posits that the relationship babies develop with their caregivers in the earliest years of life continues to affect their relationships and behaviors throughout their adolescent and adult lives.If you, as a parent, were unable to provide your child with a secure, nurturing environment in childhood, it’s unreasonable to expect them to work through their attachment issues on their own as adolescents, even if you are now a better parent to them than you were before.


ABFT sessions are usually an hour to 1 ½ hours long, and meet once a week.
It begins with the question of “why do you (the child) not turn to your parents in times of crisis or need?”
The therapist will meet with the members of your family both in a group context, and in individual sessions.
Individual sessions will guide your teen through difficult memories from childhood that need to be addressed and dealt with for positive behavioral change.
Sessions held with the parents alone will help parents work through attachment problems they might suffer from themselves, and how their issues are being revisited upon their children.
Full family sessions will provide a safe space for you to be honest with each other and create a plan to improve family dynamics going forward.

Talk about how texting in school can hinder their future.,
Include your teen in the boundary-making process.,
Write down your proposed boundaries.,
Be clear about your rules.,

Check your teen’s text log occasionally.,
Consistently enforce punishments.",How to Set Texting Boundaries for Your Teen," Before you approach your teen about texting boundaries, it is important to consider your approach. Try to think of what you can do to improve the chances that your teen will listen to you.

For example, you could take your teen out to a sporting event or to dinner at their favorite restaurant. Do something that will be fun for your teen and where you can spend some quality time together.
Whatever, you decide to do, make sure that you have your teen’s full attention and have set a positive tone before stating your boundaries.;
, You’d be hard pressed to find someone today who hasn’t heard about how unsafe texting while driving is. But your teenager may not fully understand the scope of just how deadly this act is. Sitting them down and explaining that texting while driving is deadly and setting the boundary of prohibiting them from doing so may help them understand.


You might say, ""I know this device seems harmless, but it's responsible for taking many lives. I want to make sure you understand how dangerous it can be to text and drive.""
Show your teen pictures and statistics of texting while driving. Inform them that 6,000 teens die in car crashes every year, and texting when behind the wheel is one of the causes. Consider limiting their text messages in your plan and monitoring when the texts occur. Letting them know that you will be watching them may prevent them from getting into an accident because of texting and driving., Your teen may think you’re exaggerating when you tell them that texting can have a negative impact on their health, but it’s actually true. Teens often text late into the night, which results in not getting enough sleep. Not only does this affect the way they feel, but it can impact their grades, social activities, and appearance.


To make this point really hit home, talk about how the lack of sleep can affect your teen’s life personally. Knowing your audience can make a huge difference in how effective this boundary is.
For instance, if your child really enjoys playing football, you might say ""Not getting enough sleep because you're up all night texting might affect your performance."" Or, if your teen is concerned about their appearance, you might say ""I know having youthful-looking skin is important to you. That's why I want to remind you that not sleeping because of late-night texting can cause acne or bags under your eyes, dear."", Most schools prohibit bringing cell phones into the classroom, but that doesn’t always stop teens from doing so. When your teen is texting instead of paying attention, their grades can fall.


Additionally, they can get in trouble for texting, which can earn them marks on their permanent record. If your teen is focused on getting into a good college, explain how texting while in school can prevent that from happening.You might say, ""I know your reputation with your teachers is crucial to your college applications. I don't want your teachers to think you're not taking classes seriously because you're texting, so put your phone away at school. Okay?""

, If your child feels like they are a part of making the rules, instead of just the person who has to abide by them, they may be inclined to do what they are supposed to. Your teen wants to know that they are heard and their opinions are respected. Including them in the decision-making process can help to enforce boundaries successfully.


Ask your teen what they honestly feel their boundaries should be. Say, ""Let's talk about some fair rules we can set to make sure you get to use your phone, but also make sure it's not distracting you from other, more important things.""
Even if they don’t suggest the boundaries you want, getting the conversation going allows you to build respect with each other and may eventually lead to a mutual understanding and abiding of the boundaries., Coming into the conversation prepared allows you to stay on track and get your point across. Jot down the boundaries you would like your child to follow, and then suggestions on how they can still do what they want while adhering to your rules. Showing the child that they aren’t missing out on anything by listening to your rules will make them better adept at following them.


If one of your rules is to not text during family dinners or outings, suggest that they do so right before and after. This gives them time to get their texting out of the way, so they won’t feel like they aren’t getting out the information they need to send. Additionally, if one of your rules is they have to put their phones away by a certain time each night, offer to let them use it later one night a week if they follow the rules for the rest of the days., To ensure that your teen follows the rules, you want to make sure you state the specific actions you expect from them. This also helps when you go to enforce these rules. If they aren't clear, you may get in a power-struggle with your teen about semantics.However, it is important to avoid power struggles at all costs. Try to keep things light and friendly. State the facts and stay focused on your expectations.


For example, you might say, ""The rules we agreed on are no texting after 9pm, during dinner, during the weekly family meeting, or during movie night.""

, There’s something about contracts that make everything seem more official. Writing up a contract then having your child sign it may make the boundaries more concrete. Sweeten the deal by allowing special privileges each week or month the teen adheres to all of your boundaries.Be sure to post the contract somewhere that your child can see it on a daily basis, such as on the refrigerator.

, Some newer vehicles, like the 2016 Chevy Malibu, come with technology that allows you to monitor your teen’s phone use while driving. If your teen doesn’t drive a newer vehicle, you can purchase programs that are installed into the car that allow you to keep tabs on what is going on while your child is behind the wheel. If this is one of your boundaries, you may want to consider investing in these types of programs., Examine the kinds of texts your teen is setting and when they take place by looking at your child’s text log. Although this method isn’t foolproof, as your teen may delete incriminating texts, doing so shows them that you mean business and you are going to stay on top of the situation by checking in periodically. Your teen may feel violated that you are going through their personal texts, but part of being a parent is making sure your child is safe, even when they don’t feel like that is what is going on.


In addition to checking your child’s texts, become involved in their life. Talk to them regularly about what is going on at school and in their social circles. Know who their friends are and check in with their parents, if you can. Being an active part of your child’s life can stop them from getting into trouble and build a rewarding relationship for the both of you., If your children break the rules, they must learn there are consequences. When you set your rules, it's a good idea to go ahead and let your teen know what the consequences will be for breaking them.


If you set punishments, you must make sure you carry them through. If your child sees that you are all talk and no action, they will likely continue to break the rules knowing that they can get away with it.Reasonable consequences might include losing cellphone privileges for a certain period of time completely (e.g. no phone privileges for 2 days), having a narrow window of phone privileges (e.g. between 6pm and 8pm), or having to do extra chores."
"
Describe the physical injuries the teen could sustain due to the challenge.,
Provide a real life example of the physical risks.,
Show the teen documentation of real life injuries sustained by participants in the challenge.",How to Warn Teens About the Duct Tape Challenge1," Sit the teen down and have a serious discussion about the possible physical injuries she could sustain due to the duct tape challenge. Though the game may appear fun or funny in an online video, doing it to yourself or to someone else can be a whole different matter.Because the rules of the game simply require someone to be duct taped until they cannot move, the teen could be duct taped to a wall, while sitting in a chair, or while standing up. Trying to remove yourself from layers of duct tape in these positions could cause serious physical injuries, from pulling a muscle while trying to remove the tape with your mouth or one hand to falling over and hitting your head when you try to remove the duct tape.
Some duct tape challenges involve duct tape over your mouth, thereby making it more difficult to free yourself. Putting duct tape over the mouth can be a breathing hazard, as you are at risk of suffocating or choking.;
, If the teen does not seem convinced of the physical risks of the duct tape challenge, it may be useful to discuss a real life example of a duct tape challenge gone very wrong. You may find these examples online or through word of mouth from other parents who are concerned about their teen participating in the game.


For example, you may tell the teen about 14 year old Skylar Fish, who injured himself while trying to get out of the duct tape wrapped around him by friends. Fish was standing up when he was duct taped and fell as he tried to get the duct tape off. He hit his head on the corner of a window frame and crushed his eye socket. He also suffered a brain aneurysm that required 48 staples in his head and lost the sight in his left eye due to his fall.Skylar Fish is just one real life example of the serious physical risks of the duct tape challenge. Though this example may seem extreme, Fish’s injuries were due to a fall on his head, which anyone could potentially do while trying to free themselves from duct tape.

, You may also want to back up your discussion of the physical risks of the challenge by showing the teen videos and images of real life injuries due to the game.


The video and images of Skylar Fish is pretty graphic, so only show it to the teen if you think it will get your point across.Make sure you frame the video of Skylar Fish's duct tape challenge within the context of the injuries he suffered as a result of attempting the challenge. Though your teen may not show an immediate reaction to the documentation, she will likely end up thinking more about her safety and the hazards associated with the challenge later. Some teens need time to internalize what their parents and authority figures tell them."
"
Discuss the possible emotional and psychological risks associated with the challenge.,
Provide a real life example of the emotional and psychological risks.,
Have the teen watch videos of other teens doing the challenge.",How to Warn Teens About the Duct Tape Challenge2," Because the duct tape challenge involves confining a person in layers of duct tape and leaving them alone to figure out how to get out, it is possible that the person could suffer psychological issues like anxiety, claustrophobia, and crippling fear. These emotions could then lead to a panic attack, made all the more worse by the fact that the person cannot get out of the duct tape without help as this is against the “rules” of the game.Remind the teen that being confined in duct tape can be frightening and lead to an emotional reaction that is hard to predict or control. This is especially important if you know the teen is prone to anxiety or an emotional reaction to confinement or small spaces. Warn the teen that doing the challenge may only make their anxiety based symptoms worse and could lead to further psychological issues in the future.

, You may want to try to get through to the teen by using real life examples of individuals who have done the duct tape challenge and have suffered emotionally or psychologically as a result of the game.


For example, 14 year old Skylar Fish has stated that after his attempt at the duct tape challenge went horribly wrong he felt “sad” that it had happened but also that he felt “lucky to be alive”. His mother has stated that she would have been emotionally devastated if she had lost her son over the duct tape challenge and has warned other parents that the internet challenge is dangerous and risky., If your teen still does not seem that concerned about the emotional or psychological issues, you may want to show her videos of other teens getting upset as they try to do the duct tape challenge. There are several videos online that show teens visibly shaken and disturbed as they attempt to get themselves out of the layers of duct tape. These videos can help to reinforce your warnings about the challenge.

Avoid implementing lots of changes.,
Set house rules with your partner.,
Let go of control.,
Respect their privacy.,
Treat them fairly.,
Don’t put on an act.,
Spend time just the two of you.,
Be ready for power struggles.,
Remain calm.,
Encourage positive behaviors.,
Remember that teens don’t want a tense relationship either.,
Handle emerging sexuality carefully.",How to Stepparent a Teenager," You may feel like an expert in raising teens if you’ve already raised your own or have certain standards for behavior in your home. However, take it slow when dealing with a teen, especially if you’ve recently walked into the role of stepparent. Don’t be too quick to implement changes or make things different.Your changes may be helpful but take them slowly and don’t be forceful. Talk over your requests with your partner and decide on a timeline.


Remember that the teen has likely endured lots of changes between parental divorce or separation, remarriage, relationships with siblings and stepsiblings, moving, or traveling between parents. There may be physical challenges as well as emotional challenges.;
, Instead of making rules or responding to the teen’s behavior on your own, have rules and consequences set in place which you and your partner create together.Determine what time curfew is, how often the teen should contact you, and how to arrange hanging out with friends or using the car.


Let the natural parent take the lead in enforcing rules, as teens may be more willing to accept rules or consequences from their biological parent.
Get on the same page with your partner’s ex to create a sense of consistency across environments., Expect the teen to make mistakes and poor decisions. You might want more control, rules, and order in your home, and if there’s something that teens hate, it’s control, rules, and order. If the teen is caught up in bad choices or poor behavior, don’t rush in to reprimand. Consider letting their biological parent handle it, or talk it over with your partner first. Have a talk, make a consequence, and then forgive them.If you tend to want to control the teen’s behavior, talk about how to handle bad attitudes, moodiness, and poor choices. Decide on a way to address these issues together.

, When communicating with the teen, remain willing to listen. Respect the teen’s privacy and give them alone time when they ask for it.Don’t demand that they spend time with you, engage in daily family time, or spend less time with friends. Remember that teens need social time with their friends to develop their identities, and don’t take their skimping on family time personally.


Whatever you do, don’t go through their things or read their journal. If you’re found out, it can damage all trust between you.

, If you have your own biological child or teen, treat your stepchild the same. You might be able to forgive your own child or handle their moods or behavior better than your stepchild’s. Be aware of your attitudes toward your own kids and your stepkids and do your best to be just as forgiving, patient, and loving.Have consequences that apply to anyone who breaks a rule without exceptions or favoritism.

, Teens have a way of seeing through anything that’s phony or hypocritical. Don’t try to be someone you are not or act in a disingenuous way. It’s likely that anything considered phony by the teen will be met with disdain.Be real with the teen. Be yourself and be honest in what you say.
Especially because teens are developing their own identity, be a good role model and show integrity in what you do and who you are., Stepkids may feel like they have to compete for their parent’s attention when you are around. Having one-on-one time with the teen can help you form a relationship by getting to know one another, forming companionship, and communicating more effectively.Plan time for the two of you to do something fun together.


Take the teen to ice cream once a month or be the person your teen can go to when stumped with homework.

, Your teen might fire back, “You’re not my real mom!” or “You’re not my dad!” Be ready for this type of response and understand why the teen may say it. The teen likely feels like they’re in a power struggle and wants to take power away from you. Don’t allow the teen power through this statement. Instead, respond by saying, “You’re right, I’m not your biological parent, but I am your stepparent. And that doesn’t change the fact that I love you and care about you.” Be firm but gentle when dealing with teens. Be clear in exerting your power, but not just for the sake of doing so.
If the teen is rude to you, communicate that the teen must respect you, even if they don’t like you.Have your partner say, “When you disrespect your stepparent, you disrespect me.”

, Your stepkid may push your buttons and really frustrate you. Even if they push you away, don’t take it personally. It’s unlikely that they are trying to hurt you, and may lack the skills to express their emotions in a better way. Any distance you experience isn’t personal either; teens want to (and need to) spend time with their peers as part of developing their identities.If your teen is angry or upset with you, resist the urge to fight back. Stay calm and in control.


When you start to get angry, take some deep breaths and delay responding right away. If you don’t feel calm, defer to your partner, the child’s parent, to control the situation.

, Focus less on negative behaviors and instead, praise positive behaviors.Find behaviors to compliment and reward. Show positive reinforcement instead of pointing out all of the negative things the teen does.


If the teen feels noticed for doing good things, they may feel more positively toward you and less combative.
For example, say, “Thanks so much for cleaning up after dinner tonight.”
You can also say, “I know getting along with your stepsister is difficult, but I see that you’re trying, and that means a lot.”

, If you fear having a difficult, argumentative, tense relationship with your teen, remember that the teen doesn’t want a conflicting relationship just as much as you don’t. Teens don’t want to fight or experience tension in their relationships, especially at home.When you start to clash with your teen, remind yourself that they don’t want conflict either. Do your best to calm any regular tensions by finding compromises. For example, there might be topics that you avoid bringing up altogether in order to keep the peace.

, Teens begin to explore their sexuality and express it in many different ways. You might find that your stepchild dresses differently in front of you (for example, walking around in a muscle shirt or bikini) or acting flirty toward you. If you notice this kind of behavior, remember that you’re the adult here. While you may not want to reprimand the teen, let your partner know of the behaviors.Keep communication open yet do not respond to any advances.
If being physically affectionate feels weird for either you or the teen, show your care through words and smiles.

Encourage your teen to look for a job when it is the appropriate time, but pushing often will cause the reverse effect you desire, so don't force the issue.,
Be your teen's advocate whenever you can be, without compromising your beliefs or ethics.,
Never give up.",How to Turn Your Troubled Teenage Child Into a Responsible Adult," This seems classically obvious, but often it is not. If there is a peer issue, chances are it has developed gradually and without apparent cause. Friendships are the support network for many teens, and when friends change or leave, new ones fill their space, and behavior often reflects this situation. Teenagers often can be radically changed by peer pressure, and may adapt to new friends by imitating or trying to act like them.;
, There are lists upon lists of what to watch for, but difficulty concentrating, a drop in school performance, and personality shifts are associated with drug use. Dealing with this problem may mean seeking counseling.

, It is said the common conversation with a teen involves you asking a number of questions, and listening to ""nothing"", ""I dunno"", and ""Yeah, right"" from their end of the talk. This may be true some of the time with some teens, but when the communication channel is open with them, make the best of it by listening to what they have to say.

, Keeping this avenue open means accepting their friends, and being friendly with them. Keep your home open to them as much as possible, offer to let them come over for an evening meal, to watch a movie, or other activities they enjoy. Often, a friend of your teen's will come to the realization your son or daughter has a problem they need help with, and be willing to tell you what is going on, if you are on good terms with them.

, To become a responsible adult, a teen needs to have responsibilities as a teen. If you have set a ""chore"" list, see to it that your teen follows it. If they get an allowance, make them accountable for it, especially for their discretionary spending. Obviously, if your teen buys their clothes and meals with their allowance, you cannot deprive them of these, but money for entertainment and snacks is not a physical necessity. When they spend their money irresponsibly, let them do without these.

, The first step here is for them to respect you, and secondly, other adults including teachers, coaches, police, and your friends with whom they may have social contact. Disrespect is a growing problem in society today, and teaching and instilling respectful behavior is essential for dealing with people successfully.

, Have your teen sit down for an evening meal at least several nights each week, and engage them in discussions on family issues when possible. Tell them what is going on in your life, and other family members, like grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins. If they are interested, share about your work, hobbies, or other things you are involved with.

, Eating disorders are commonplace among teens, and the home is still the primary place for them to come for food, so watch what they eat, and have healthy snacks and beverages there for them. Make dental appointments and schedule checkups on a regular basis.

, Gangs are probably one of the more troublesome involvements they may get into, but there are also cults which can prey on teens and lead them into serious trouble. Steer them away from these if you have any doubt of their intentions., Many common problems among teens behave like an epidemic, and it may be that other teen's parents are dealing with the same issues you are, and by networking with them, the chances of finding solutions to problems increases.

, Telling a teenager you are behind them, and then failing to back up your words will only make it less likely they will come back to you when they have a problem later on. By the time your child is a teenager, they will have made decisions about how they will react to you, and how much help they can expect from you, but never stop assuring them of your caring and love.

, This is especially true concerning drug use, since one ""bad trip"" or experiment may leave them in serious legal problems or worse, but it also should have your attention regarding their mental health. Teen depression is a serious issue, and teen suicide is all too common. These are areas where the advice should be coming from someone specifically trained and qualified.

, A better technique might be to talk to people who might be potential summer employers and talk to neighbors and friends who might need odd jobs or lawn work done.

, There may be times when he or she has no one else to turn to, and if they know they can depend on you, you will be their refuge and strength when they need you.

, Many parents have been through the trials, thinking all along hope was lost, and then, almost miraculously, their child emerges from those trying years intact, competent, and ready to face life head on.

Really talk to her.,
Get to know your daughter’s interests.,
Talk openly about social media.,
Have a serious talk about drinking alcohol and doing drugs.",How to Understand Your Teenage Daughter1," Though you can start by asking how her day at school was, don’t stop there. It’s important for you to really talk with your daughter in order to understand her.


Begin the conversation with small, open ended questions such as, “Tell me about your day.” If your daughter doesn’t seem to be responding, let her know you’re there when she’s ready to talk.
If you start with broader questions, follow up with more narrow ones. For example, “How was your day?” “Did your chemistry test go well?” “How do you think you did?”
Try not to rapidly fire off questions though, as you don’t want her to shut down.
Remind her that it’s OK to discuss whatever’s on her mind and that she won’t be judged or criticized for it.Take advantage of talking with your daughter while you’re in the car together. You’ll both be less distracted, plus you can find inspiration for conversations based on what’s happening as you drive.
You can use the same method while you’re watching your favorite shows together. Instead of pre-recording the program, use the commercial breaks as an opportunity to chat.;
, One of the many advantages of talking with your teenage daughter is actually getting to know her. You’ll probably be surprised to learn how much her interests have changed since she was younger. Knowing her interests will help you to relate to her and bond with her.


If you notice, for example, that your daughter is into music ask her to tell you about some of the bands she’s interested in now. Tell her you’d like to listen to some of her favorite songs by that group. Even if you don’t like the music, refrain from expressing that.
If your daughter is into fashion, ask her to show you some of her favorite online stores. You can spend time looking at clothes together and can even plan a trip to the mall to visit more stores there.
One of the goals of getting to know your daughter is understanding what motivates her and what makes her happy. That means learning about her aspirations as well as her inspirations, so understand who your daughter looks up to, whether it’s a friend, older sibling or a celebrity.

, Many teenagers depend on social media to make them happy. Discuss what social media sites she is on and what she hopes to achieve in using the sites.Keep the discussion from feeling like an inquisition by asking her about some of her favorite sites. You’ll probably be surprised to discover there are sites you have never even heard of.
For sites you’re unfamiliar with, ask your daughter to show you around. Learn how the site works and what the basic features are.
Ask your daughter about times where she had uncomfortable experiences online. Discuss what steps she takes to protect herself from unwanted attention, such as using privacy settings.
Online etiquette should also be discussed. Talk about what type of language is appropriate to use and what cyberbullying means. Most states have rules surrounding cyberbullying, so read up on your state laws prior to the discussion., Make sure that you discuss the dangers of drinking and doing drugs, without being overly preachy. Talk about some of the repercussions for using drugs and drinking alcohol as a minor.


Remember that her brain isn't great at processing risks right now, so help her out by explaining some of the negative consequences associated with drinking.
You may want to share some of your experiences to help her feel more at ease about opening up to you.
Even though you shouldn't ever encourage her to drink, let her know that you're always available to drive if she is in a bad situation.
Reiterate that she should never get into the car with a drunk driver and that you will come and get her, without fear of repercussions.

Let your daughter know her feelings matter.,
Respond with a hug.,
Take mental health issues seriously.",How to Understand Your Teenage Daughter2," Whether she’s frustrated, embarrassed or angry, let your daughter know her feelings matter too.

Don’t roll your eyes or tell her she’s overreacting. For example, respond by saying, “I hear what you’re saying. It sounds like you’re really angry with your friends. That must be difficult.”
If you’re in a heated discussion or just having a serious conversation, always give her the opportunity to speak. Don’t just brush off what she says. Make eye contact, nod while she’s speaking and really listen.
Repeat back what your teen said so that she knows you have listened to and acknowledged her feelings.

, One of the best ways to validate your daughter’s feelings is to show your support with a hug. Sometimes your teen doesn’t want to talk. Sometimes she’s simply needs your affection and attention.


If your daughter is really upset you may want to say, “It sounds like you’re going through a tough time. Can I give you a hug?”
A hug can be a good resolution to an argument as well. Take a few minutes to cool off, then approach your daughter and summarize what her side of the argument was. Ask her for a hug afterwards to show that you love and support her.

, You may think she's too young to experience such issues, but if your teen mentions she’s depressed or suicidal, acknowledge what she’s saying and act on it.


One in five teenagers are diagnosed with mental health issues, so it’s important to acknowledge her feelings.Although occasional moodiness or bouts of sadness is fairly normal for teenagers, take note if she's withdrawing from friends and family or suddenly has lost interest in all of her favorite activities.Be supportive and let her know she's loved and that this issue is worth your time and attention.
Show that you’ve acknowledged her feelings by scheduling an appointment with a mental health professional. Go with her to the appointment, take notes and ask questions about treatment plans.

"
Understand that teens may challenge your authority to demonstrate independence.,
Let her have some alone time.,
Allow independence that’s age appropriate.,
Let her make decisions too.",How to Understand Your Teenage Daughter3," These days it may seem as if your daughter is constantly challenging your authority. This struggle for control is perfectly normal, though and is a sign that your teen is seeking greater independence.

Your daughter is not only growing physically, but mentally as well. She is forming opinions about how the world works and oftentimes, her opinions do not align with yours.
Think of some areas where you can be more flexible and are willing to give up some control, to allow her to be more independent. For example, if you typically shop for and choose her outfits, give your daughter the responsibility of choosing her attire. Set some ground rules for appropriate attire, but ultimately leave the decision up to her.

, For a teenage girl privacy is very important. Respect her wishes that she might want some uninterrupted time alone once in awhile.


Knock on the door before entering and ask her if you can come in.
Let her demonstrate responsibility during this alone time. Don’t assume she’s doing something she shouldn’t be.If you notice your daughter is spending too much time in her room and seems withdrawn, you should talk with her about what’s going on. There may be a larger issue at hand, such as depression.
If you still have concerns about her spending time alone, talk about expectations and boundaries ahead of time. For example, she shouldn’t expect to have alone time when there’s a boy in the room.

, Let her go out with friends or attend a concert on a school night. Try to find the right balance between being overly protective and completely loose when it comes to rules.


Even though she’s getting older, your daughter should still have boundaries. For example, letting her go on a date is fine, but be sure to establish a curfew and discuss appropriate venues for the date.
Trust her to spend the night at a friends house without constantly checking in on her.

, As a parent you tend to make a lot of decisions. However, it’s important to let your daughter in on the process as well, whether it’s establishing a bedtime or setting a curfew; you need to allow her to start making her own decisions.


As your teenager transitions into an adult, she needs to practice making decisions on her own. Let her take the lead when it comes to the way her room is decorated or how her hair is cut and styled.
You may even want to involve her in family decisions such as where to go on vacation.
Every teenager is unique and matures at a slightly different rate. Start with small decisions and see how she does before moving on to bigger ones."
"
Recognize the teenage brain is constantly changing.,
Know that sleep may also be altered due to changes in the brain.,
Understand your teen's emotions are affected by brain circuitry changes.",How to Understand Your Teenage Daughter4," Part of understanding your daughter is recognizing that, in addition to all of the other changes occurring, her brain is actually developing as well.Different parts of the brain mature at different times. The parts of the brain associated with things such as impulsiveness, reward and motivation actually mature earlier than parts of the brain associated with weighing the pros and cons of ones actions.
As a result, your teenager may not consider consequences in the same way you would. This is why it may be important to discuss risk taking behavior and their consequences, with her.

, It may be difficult to believe, but your daughter's tendency to stay up until the wee hours of the night is due in part to her changing brain.

Though the tendency may be to stay up late, lack of sleep further contributes to irritability and depression.
It's important to still regulate your teenage daughter's bedtime and to encourage her to get a full night's rest.

, It's not just your imagination; your daughter's emotions are heightened during the teenage years. The intensity of the emotions is also different than yours, so keep that in mind when you're in the midst of a discussion or an argument with her.If you notice your daughter is overreacting, give her some time to cool down. She may react strongly at first, but be sympathetic to the fact that her brain is going through a period of change as well.

Allow them levels of independence.,
Accept their social needs.,
Respect their privacy.,
Recognize their sleep habits.,
Let them make their own mistakes.,
Listen actively to your teen.,
Ask questions to show interest.,
Support their activities.,
Recognize cultural influences.,
Let them express their emotions.,
Be sensitive to their moods.,
Get professional help for your teen if they exhibit extreme behaviors.,
Get involved in their mental health.",How to Understand a Teenager," Slowly support your teen in developing their independence as they mature.For example, let your younger teen choose how to decorate their room and style their hair. Older teens may be able to use the car, attend activities without an adult, or hold a part-time job.


A controlling parent may face increased conflict with a teen who seeks independence. Ask your teen what independence they’d like and come to some compromises.;
, Teens are often concerned with social relationships, fitting in with peers, and making social decisions such as whether to use drugs or engage in sexual activity.They will likely want to spend more time with friends than with their family. While it’s important for them to be a part of the family, make sure that you respect their need to engage in friendships, be with friends, and create their social identity.

Allow your teen to join clubs or groups or do other social activities (such as go to the skate park, join sports teams, or hang out with friends).

, Teens want increasing independence and this includes needs for privacy, too. It might feel like your teen is tuning you out or ignoring you, but they are likely wanting some space to be alone (or with friends). Respect their desire for privacy and consider giving them increased privacy as they get older.If your teen isn’t forthright in talking to you or wants to spend less time with you, don’t take it personally and instead, see it is a developmental stage. You do, however, get the final say in their activities and should look out for their safety.

, It’s natural for teens to fall asleep later (after 11 p.m.) and sleep in the next morning.Be mindful of these sleep patterns, but also encourage them to get adequate sleep. Not getting enough sleep can affect their moods, memory, and concentration.

If your teen struggles to get restful sleep, remove electronic devices from their bedrooms (cell phones, televisions, tablets, etc) so that the light does not stimulate them instead of relaxing them.A consistent bedtime can also help with getting more restful sleep.

, No matter how many warnings you give, teens often prefer to learn experientially. Some teens may need to fail or make mistakes in order to learn from them and be responsible. As a parent, it’s difficult to watch your child fail. Let them know that you support them, love them, and you will be there for them, no matter the outcome.Be there to comfort your teen when they are disappointed, even if you want to say, “I told you so.”

, If you remember being a teenager, then you probably remember that it wasn’t easy. If your teen is complaining about their difficulties, don’t immediately brush them off or say, “I had it worse.” Instead, listen in. While their problems may sound trivial to you, they feel big to your teen. Practice empathy by hearing them out and imagining yourself in their place.Relate to how problems can feel big even when they are small.

, One of the best ways to build connections and understand your teen is by being curious and asking questions. Don’t pester your teen, but show curiosity toward them and ask them about their interests, friends, goals, and dreams. When asking questions, keep them open-ended. For example, instead of asking, “Did you have a good day at school?” say, “What activities did you enjoy at school today?”When your teen does share with you, listen and respond thoughtfully.

, Whether your child is a star athlete or master chess player, support the activities that interest them, even if they interest you very little. Understanding their likes and interests can give you a glimpse into their life. If you’re concerned or don’t understand their interests, do some research and learn about them.Find ways to support their chosen activities. Attend athletic games, go to plays, and support their after-school activities.

, Teens want to have a unique identity, yet also want to fit in and feel accepted by their peers. Feeling included (via sports, clothes, music, or interests) aids in their sense of belonging. They may also look up to athletes, academics, or actors as role models on how to talk or dress.Teens might look to social media and the internet for what’s acceptable or how to fit in.
Spend some time watching television shows your teen enjoys or get to know the activities they like. Do activities together that your teen enjoys.

, Adults often tell teens to stop sulking or being upset or angry, but let your teen express their emotions. If they avoid their feelings or stuff them down, they will likely come out in a more negative way later. Teens are learning how to identify and manage their emotions, so allow them to do this. It’s important for them to recognize and accept their feelings as they happen and find ways to release their emotions, like talking to a friend.Remind your teen that there are no good or bad emotions, but there are good and bad ways of dealing with them.

, Give teens space to manage their emotions on their own. Leave them be in their room or back off after arguments. Have some empathy toward their moodiness as it can result from triggers such as a breakup, academic disappointment, or social or family problems.If mood swings happen frequently (days instead of hours, for example) or intensely, you may want to ask a professional about mental health treatment., Notice any sudden or major changes to their behavior. This might include extreme weight gain or weight loss, changes to sleeping or eating habits, failing grades, sudden changes in friends, skipping school, or signs of using substances or alcohol. If your teen exhibits some of these symptoms, get them professional help. See a therapist or make an appointment with their physician.

, If your teen has a mental health diagnosis such as ADHD, anxiety, or depression, do some research on it. Talk to their physician or mental health counselor about how you can support them and aid in their treatment.This can help your child feel supported and understood.Take them to appointments, talk to their therapist, and understand their treatment.
Ask them about their diagnosis in a non-invasive way. For example, say, “What is it like to have ADHD?” or, “How does anxiety affect your academics?”

Consider your reason for asking.,
Practice what you’ll say.,
Ask them directly.,
Ask about their friends' sexual activity.,
Ask someone else to talk to your teen.,
Be prepared for their answer.",How to Tell if Your Teenager Is Having Sex1," Taking a moment to think about the reason why you want to ask your teen about their sexual behavior before you do so can help you to have a productive conversation with them. Ask yourself questions like:

“What is my purpose for asking them about their sexual behavior?”
“Am I concerned about them?”
“Am I trying to educate them?;
, Talking to your teen about sex might not be one of your favorite activities. You might be nervous or worried about asking your teenager about their sexual activity. If you go over what you want to say, it can make it easier for you to talk to them and also find out if they’re having sex.


You can write down what you want to say ahead of time and read through it, practice in front of a mirror, or role play with another parent or friend.
Consider working in a bit of humor to face the awkwardness head-on: ""I'm sure you'll be as excited about this as I am, but it's time for us to talk about S-E-X."", This is a good way to ask your teenager about their sexual behavior if you know your teen will be honest with you. Being direct about it will let you know whether your teen is having sex quicker than any other way.It will also show your teen that you think they’re honest and mature enough for you to ask them directly about such a serious topic.


For example, you might skip the speeches and jokes and simply ask your son, “Tez, have you started having sex?”

, If you don’t think your teen is going to be honest with you if you ask them about having sex, you still have options. One alternative is to indirectly ask your teen about their sexual activity by talking about what their peers are doing.For example, you might say, “Are any of your friends having sex? What’s their opinion about sex?”
If the conversation is going well, you may want to ask for their opinions about sex, share some of your own views and experiences, and then ask about their personal sexual activity.

, If you aren't comfortable talking to your teenager about sex, that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t try to find out if they’re having sex. If you need to, ask someone that you and your teen trust and respect, such as an older sibling or close family friend.


Try if at all possible not to violate your teen's trust by asking this third person to ""spill the beans"" on the discussion without your teen's knowledge. Be clear from the start that what they discuss will be shared. Or, better yet, engage in the conversation all together.

, Whether your teen is honest with you or not or whether they are having sex or not, you have to be able to accept the answer. Remain calm while you’re talking to your teenager and accept whatever response they give.For example, if your teen tells you that they are having sex, don’t get angry. Stay calm and let them know you accept their answer even if you don’t like it.
Or, if they say they don’t want to talk about it, avoid getting angry. Instead, revisit the talk at another time.
Even if your teen does not give you an answer, be willing to accept that. Depending on your relationship with them, they might not feel comfortable talking with you about this subject.

, This gives your adolescent some control over the outcome of their choices. It enables them to feel independent, while maintaining family rules.

, By overlooking minor, non-threatening assertions of adolescent individuality, you demonstrate that you love your son or daughter no matter what. Trying to alienate you visually is often a bid for attention, so take the cue and give them your time.

, Listen to whatever they share, resisting the urge to tell them what to do and trying to fix their predicament. After living with you over ten years, they know what is about to be said, and they would rather think of it as their own wisdom than yours. When they ask your advice answer them honestly.

, Be fair. Be patient. Be a wholesome role model. Teens will mimic parental behavior. Telling adolescents to behave differently than you requires that they reject your lifestyle.

Look for the obvious.,
Examine social media.,
Watch for changes in behavior.,
Do not accuse your teen of anything.",How to Tell if Your Teenager Is Having Sex2," While not all signs of sexual activity are obvious, there are some signs and clues that should leave no doubt that your teenager is having sex. Don’t overlook the obvious hints, instead trust what you see and what your instincts tell you.


For example, if you find a used condom wrapper, pack of birth control pills, or pregnancy test among your teen's dirty clothes and clutter, it’s most likely a sign that they're having sex.

, The numerous and various apps and social networking sites available today give teenagers more access to sexual content. It also makes it easier, and sometimes seems to encourage them, to share personal information about their sex lives. While you may not want your teen sharing sensitive and potentially damaging information through text, posts, or emails, examining these outlets can give you an indication of what your teen is doing.You don’t have to become an internet troll or break into their electronic devices, but you should regularly review what they're posting to see if anything is inappropriate or gives you a hint about their sexual activity.
You should also be on the lookout for sexts (sexual texts) to and from your teen. These may include sexual text messages with or without images included.

, Teens will be moody and temperamental whether they're having sex or not, but changes in typical attitudes and behaviors might indicate that they've become sexually active. Do they seem more secretive, or unwilling to share where they're going or who they're hanging out with? These aren't sure signs of sexual activity, but they might raise red flags.


Keep an eye out for indications of unusually obsessive or aggressive behaviors related to sex, or signs that sex is viewed as a means of validation or building self-esteem. These could point to a more significant mental health issue that should be medically addressed.Be aware that how your teen dresses may also indicate that they are thinking about sex. For example, if your teen dresses provocatively, then they may be considering sex.

, Accusing your teen of doing something that you find inappropriate will only make matters worse. By accusing your teen, the may be unwilling to talk with you or confide in you in the future. They may also feel like you are judging them. Even if you have strong suspicions, do not accuse your teen of anything."

Know their friends and partners.,
Support their interests.",How to Tell if Your Teenager Is Having Sex3," The best way to stay actively involved in your teenager's life is to keep the lines of communication open. Although teens are notorious for being hard to talk to, you should still make the effort. Knowing that you are available and willing to talk can make it easier for your teen to talk to about sex and for you to tell if they’re having sex.


Talk about everyday things like social issues, their day, their friends, and anything else that they’ll discuss.
You should also talk about serious issues such as drugs, alcohol, and sex on a regular basis so that you’re both comfortable talking about it.

, Teenagers generally have friends and partners that reflect their morals and values, and have similar opinions. Getting to know the people in your teen's life can help you learn a great deal about their sexual activity. The more you know about the people your teenager chooses to have in their life, the more you will be able to tell about your teen and the types of things they might be doing, including sex. For example, if most of your teen daughter’s friends seem very into dating, romance, and intimacy, it’s likely your daughter is also.
Encourage your teenager to invite their friends over. You don’t have to stay in the room with them the whole time, but just them being there can give you a sense of them.

, When you show an interest in the things they enjoy and participate in, it lets your teen know that you care.

Has your daughter talked to you in the past about becoming sexually active? Does she have a steady boyfriend?Has your daughter engaged in risky behavior in the past? If your daughter has a tendency towards sneaking out or substance abuse, she may participate in behaviors like unprotected sex.However, keep in mind these are just general guidelines.

Try to understand how your teenage experience was both similar and different to your daughter's experiences. You likely remember the pressure and excitement of being a teen. Was there anything different about your daughter's experience? Have there been any specific pressures put on her that might have contributed to her becoming pregnant?Go into the conversation without expectations. Do not confront your daughter expecting her to be immediately open to your help. However, do not go in expecting an argument either. If you rev yourself up for a particular outcome, it can be hard to recalibrate if something different occurs. You do not know how your teen will react when you ask her about a potential pregnancy. Therefore, do not try to guess. Go into the conversation as prepared as possible with no particular expectations., Remember, you want to show your teen respect. Even if you're upset with the situation, coming from a place of judgement will only serve to alienate your teen. In the event your teen is pregnant, you want her to feel she can see you as a source of help and guidance throughout her pregnancy.


To start, do not assume anything. Go into the conversation assuming your teen had a good reason for making the decisions she made. Even if it does not seem like a good reason in your eyes, your teen probably saw it that way at the time. Do not pre-judge the situation or your teen's behavior. Even if you feel her becoming pregnant was reckless, try your best to leave this judgement behind. It will not help the situation in the present moment.Never assume you know what's wrong. Even if your teen is displaying signs of pregnancy, you cannot know for sure without confirmation. Therefore, do not enter the conversation by saying something like, ""I know you're pregnant"" or ""It seems like you're pregnant."" Instead, ask. Say something like, ""I'm concerned about some of your behavior. Do you think you might be pregnant?"", Teenagers are still very much children but are also old enough to crave some autonomy. Advice during a stressful time like pregnancy may not be taken well. Therefore, try your best to understand your daughter's feelings, actions, wants, and needs before offering any guidance.


Listen to what your teen tells you. Try to withhold judgement as she explains how she became pregnant. Ask nonjudgmental questions for clarification when necessary. Ask if she's made any decisions. Remind her she's very young and it's okay to take some time to make a decision about her pregnancy.It can help to practice active listening. This is a way of listening that promotes understanding and can be useful during difficult conversations. Give your daughter non-verbal cues, like nodding on occasion, to show you are listening. Briefly paraphrase her words back to her when she finishes talking to show you heard what she said. If you have any questions about what's being said, wait until she's finished her sentence to ask., Remember, guidance is better than outright advice. Pregnancy is extremely difficult for a teen and you want to make sure your daughter makes a good decision. However, you want to make sure your teen is able to think for herself in this situation. Help her process her own thoughts and emotions rather than telling her what you think she should do.


Discuss the potential implications of various options with your daughter. Walk her through the difficulties, financial and otherwise, or raising a child as a teen. Go over options like abortion and adoption, helping to weigh the pros and cons. If you're unfamiliar with such subjects yourself, you can look up information online with your teen to help her explore her options and make a decision.Ask her what she thinks throughout the conversation. For example, you can say something like, ""I know when your Aunt Rose was in this same situation, she kept the baby. She thought it was the right thing to do for her. How do you feel about that?""Help your daughter consider all the factors. Pregnancy can be overwhelming. Gently walk your teen through some of the decisions she'll need to make down the road, such as choosing a doctor if she keeps the baby, informing other friends and family members of her pregnancy, and so on.Don't force your views. While you may feel strongly that your daughter should choose a particular option, you need to allow her to make her own decision. Forcing your teen's hand can cause tension between the two of you. It is very important your teen sees you as a source of support during her pregnancy.

, Finding out your teen is pregnant can be emotionally devastating. However, you should avoid criticism as much as you can. Even if you feel your teen has made a huge mistake, criticizing her can backfire. You do not want your teen to feel she cannot ask you for help as she makes a decision.


Your teen is probably already aware she's made a mistake. Nagging or criticizing her now will not help matters. Therefore, it's best to avoid telling what she should have done. Instead, try to be proactive and move forward in the present moment.Your teen may get mad during the conversation. Even if you're trying to be patient and understanding, your teen may lash out at you due to her own anger or fear. Try not to take this personally. Do not react to feelings of anger taken out on you. Simply remain calm and say something like, ""I'm sorry you feel that way"" and proceed with the conversation.Provide some reassurance. Tell your teen, while the situation is difficult, the two of you will work together to find a solution. It's very important your teen feels safe when discussing her pregnancy with you., You may experience a lot of feelings yourself if you find out your teen is pregnant. Your own hopes and dreams for her have dramatically changed. It's normal to feel sadness, anger, and pain when your teen reveals she's pregnant. However, during the initial conversation keep the focus on your teen's feelings over your own. You may need to occasionally take a deep breath and count to 10 in order to stay calm. Do so as necessary throughout the course of the conversation."

Allow your daughter to vent when necessary.,
Form a plan.,
Seek out prenatal care.,
Confront difficult questions.,
Find a therapist.",How to Tell if Your Teenage Daughter Is Pregnant3," Pregnancy is scary for teens. As you move forward with your teen's pregnancy, allow her to vent to you. She should be able to come to you with fears, frustrations, and concerns throughout the process of making a decision about the pregnancy. Listen to what she has to say without judgment and allow her to feel what she's feeling, good or bad., After you discuss your teen's pregnancy with her, you'll need to help her form a plan. Essentially, she has three options: keeping the baby, giving it up for adoption, or having an abortion. Help her weigh the pros and cons of each option so she can make an informed decision she will be comfortable with.


If there is a health center for teens in your area, you may want to take your teenager there to talk to a doctor or counselor. You may not have all the necessary information about abortion, adoption, and teen pregnancy at your disposal.
Remember, allow your teen to make her own decision. Even if you have your own strong feelings about the situation, this is your daughter's baby. She needs to make a decision that sits well with her.

, In the event your daughter decides to carry the baby to term, it's important you get her prenatal care. You'll need to have regular prenatal visits with a doctor to monitor the baby's health. You'll also need to stock up on prenatal vitamins and work on establishing a healthy diet and exercise routine. Make an appointment with a doctor as soon as possible if your daughter decides to keep the baby. This way, your daughter and her doctor can develop a health and lifestyle plan for the baby's wellbeing., If your daughter wants to keep the baby, help her confront the difficult questions. There are a a lot of factors to consider during a teen pregnancy. Guide your daughter as she makes a variety of decisions regarding her baby.


Consider the father. What role will he play in the baby's life? Will he and your daughter stay together romantically? What will the baby's last name be? Where will your daughter live after the baby is born?Consider things like school. Will your daughter finish school? Who will watch the baby while she's at class? Can your or another family member help out with childcare while your daughter finishes high school? What about college? Is this a possibility?Also take your financial situation into account. Who will support the baby financially? Are you able to assist your daughter financially? What about the baby's father and his parents? Can they help out with medical bills and the costs of childcare?, As teen pregnancy can be stressful for your family, it's a good idea to find a family therapist. You can ask your regular doctor for a referral or ask your insurance company for a list of providers in your network. A qualified family therapist can help you and your family cope with the stress of a teen pregnancy.

Have you ever tried any drugs?”
Don’t dismiss your suspicion if your teenager says that they are not using drugs. They understand that admitting to drug use could get them into trouble. It may take time for them to come clean to you about their drug use.;
, It is important to have regular discussions about drugs with your teenager. You don’t have to directly ask them if they are using drugs to have a good conversation about it. Be sure to mention how dangerous and life-threatening drugs can be. This conversation may help you get a better sense of whether or not your teen is using drugs.Consider making the conversation about someone else. Ask your teen if they know of anyone who is using drugs.
This conversation should feel relaxed and spontaneous. Try bringing up the topic while you are driving in the car alone with your teenager. This is an ideal place to talk to your teenager as they will not be busy doing other things.
It is best to start talking with your children about the dangers of drug and alcohol use early rather than putting off the conversation until there is a problem. Talk to your kids about the dangers of drug and alcohol use well before they reach their teens. Many children begin using substances before they reach their teens.
Provide your kids with age appropriate videos, pamphlets, and other materials that can help them understand.Check with your child’s teacher, school counselor, or other professionals who might be able to help you.

Monitor their eating habits.,
Keep an eye out for more serious side effects.,
Seek emergency medical attention for your child in severe situations.",How to Tell if Your Teen Is Using Drugs2," When they come home be sure to take note of their smell. You don’t need to have a breathalyzer to detect the use of drugs or alcohol. You can often smell alcohol, marijuana, or cigarettes long after they have been used.Just because their clothing smells like cigarettes or marijuana doesn’t mean that they were smoking them. They could have been hanging out with friends that were smoking.
If you smell drugs on your teen, you should consider asking them about it. Say something like, “Have you been drinking?”
Methamphetamines are commonly used among teens, and this drug may leave a cat urine smell.
Excessive cologne or perfume could be an attempt to mask the smell of smoke or alcohol., Nosebleeds, scabs around the mouth and nose, and bloodshot eyes can be a sign of drug use. This is especially true if you see more than one or all of these facial changes. It can be a sign that they are currently high or that they are snorting drugs up their nose.If you notice continuous facial changes, ask your teen if they need help by saying, “I’ve noticed that you have had a lot of nosebleeds lately. Is everything okay? Do you need to see a doctor?”

, They may not care as much about their physical appearance. Showering less, not brushing their hair, wearing dirty clothes, or just generally looking unkempt may be a sign of drug use or of a mental health problem. This is especially alarming if your teenager hasn’t done this in the past., Some drugs cause you to have a loss of appetite. Over time this could lead to considerable weight loss. On the other hand, other drugs cause you to have an increase in appetite. Over time this could lead to considerable weight gain. Monitor your teen’s eating while they are home and ask them about their meals while they are not home.Eat family meals together, and ask your teenager what they had for lunch at school.

Notice your teen’s desire for privacy.,
Observe any changes in interest.",How to Tell if Your Teen Is Using Drugs3," You may begin to see a pattern of missing items from your home. You might also notice money being taken from your wallet or purse without your consent. If your teen is desperate for money to purchase more drugs, they might start to steal from you or sell their valuables for cash.If you notice money or valuables that are missing from your home, ask your teen if they know where the item went.

, You may start to notice that some of your prescription or over the counter medication is missing. Over the counter medications such as cough syrup can be abused. Prescription medication such as opioids or stimulants can also be abused and are very addictive.If someone in your home has been prescribed a commonly abused prescription medication, consider hiding that medication or keeping count of the pills in the container. Some commonly abused prescription medications include opioids, sedatives, and stimulants.Lock up your medications if you suspect that your child may be abusing them.

, If your teen is doing drugs, their grades are likely to suffer. They may be skipping school, not turning in homework assignments, or simply not focusing during class. Schedule a time to talk with your child’s teachers, school counselor, or coaches to discuss your child’s academic progress.Many schools now report grades to parents through a web-based system. Monitor your teen’s grades and attendance closely.

, All teens want respect for their space and privacy. However, if this need for privacy becomes extreme, it may also be a sign of drug use. It should be considered alarming if your teen considers their room “off limits” and refuses to allow you access to their room or personal belongings.Your teen’s bedroom is not the only place that may contain clues of drug use. There may also be information on their phone, computer, or in their car.
Take note if your teen makes sudden “privacy” demands.

, Your teenager may start to listen to more drug related music. They may wear t-shirts or hang posters on their wall that are related to drugs. If you aren’t familiar with these images or artists, do your research. Their new fascination could be a sign of drug use."

Observe changes in personality.,
Take note of their friends.,
Watch for your teen to lie to you.,
Check for changes in energy level.",How to Tell if Your Teen Is Using Drugs4," Your teen may become more aggressive, angry, moody, or even relaxed if they are using drugs.

, All kids lie to their parents, but if your teen is on drugs they will be excessively deceitful in order to prevent you from finding out about their drug use. Go with your gut feeling. Your natural parental instincts will likely alert you to any lying going on. When you do question whether or not your teen is telling the truth, follow through with uncovering the truth. It is easy to bury your head in the sand because you don’t want to know the truth.The teen may lie about who they have been with, where they have been, or what they have been doing.

, Some drugs could cause your teenager to become very hyper-active and more productive. Other drugs may cause them to be more sleepy, lethargic, and unmotivated. If your child’s sleeping habits have drastically changed, this could be a sign of drug use."
"
Accept that your child is growing up.,
Give your teen the attention they need.,
Be more flexible.,
Give your teen some privacy.,
Allow them to take responsibility for their actions.,
Avoid setting too many rules.,
Show your teenager that you trust them.,
Understand that teenagers will break your trust at one point or another.,
Realize that even well-behaved teens will make bad choices.,
Give appropriate punishments.,
Communicate with one another.,
Explain what the teenager has to gain from having your trust.,
Use positive reinforcement.,
Have faith in yourself.",How to Trust Your Teenager," In order to trust your teen to do things and make decisions on their own, you need to accept the fact that they are growing up. They are now at an age where they don't want their parents doing everything for them or hovering over them all the time.


Give your teen space to discover things for themselves. They need to try new things and push their limits in order to gain experience and discover who they really are.
Accept that your teen is now a person in their own right and give them the space they need to grow and make mistakes. Once you've done this, you will find it a lot easier to trust them.;
, Although teenagers need space to learn and grow, they also need to know that you are there for them and will still require your undivided attention from time to time.


You can give them this by listening to them when they need to vent or work through some issues. Teenagers are surprisingly willing to open up about their lives if they feel that you are not judging them and that they can trust you.
If you start nagging, judging or punishing them for something they've told you, they'll close up like a clam and you will have lost their trust. Remember that it's much easier to trust your teen when they trust you in return.

, Your teenager is trying to establish his own identity, separate from you. He wants to be an autonomous individual and take on more responsibilities. However, he still needs your guidance, advice, and love.


Therefore, being flexible means providing your teenager with whatever they need at the time – whether that's a parent, a friend, a comforter, a confidant, a host, or just a listener.
Being there for your child when they need you is more important than anything else. This will give them the confidence they need to make the right choices, which will, in turn, help you to trust them.
Being flexible also means being open to negotiation and listening to what you child has to say. For example, if your child wants to get a nose piercing, don't just refuse them outright. Give them a chance to put forward their arguments and then have a reasoned discussion about the pros and cons of such a decision.

, Having their own personal space is very important for teenagers. Therefore, you should allow your teen's bedroom to be their own private space, which they are in control of.


Don’t barge into your teen's room uninvited or stick your nose into their business. Always knock before entering and advise other siblings to do the same. This will prove to your teenager that you trust them and are willing to give them their space.
However, you should still supervise younger teen's online activities to ensure their safety, so it may be best to ban them from using internet in their room after a certain time.
Privacy rules also do not apply if you suspect that your teen may be engaging in some kind of harmful or illegal activity in their room, such as drug use.

, You can show your teenager trust by making them responsible for their own actions. For example, they should be able to complete their household chores and complete their homework without the need for constant nagging from you.


If your teen fails to take responsibility, rather than punishing them for this, you should allow them to experience the consequences of their actions. For example, if your teen fails to bring their dirt laundry to the wash, allow them to go without clean clothes for a week.
If they spend their Saturday hanging out with their friends instead of working on an important school paper, wait until they get a bad grade before passing any remarks.
Most sensible teens will soon see the error of their ways and start to take their responsibilities more seriously.

, Ever heard the phrase ""rules are meant to be broken""? This is a mantra most teens seem to live by. You can get around this by steering clear of making too many rules in the first place.


This doesn't mean that you should give your teen no guidance whatsoever, but instead of expressly forbidding something, try to give them all the information they need to make an informed decisions and then let them know that you expect they'll make the right choice.
For example, instead of telling your teen that they are forbidden to smoke, explain all of the health risks associated with smoking, such as cancer, premature aging and yellow teeth. Once they are fully aware of all of the harm that smoking can do (and they understand that they are free to make that choice if they want to) they will be much less inclined to take it up.

, Parents cannot just say, “I trust you,” to their teenagers - you need to give them evidence of that trust.


When you give your trust to your teenagers, make sure that it is the total package. Don't give them permission to hang out at the park with their friends, then sit in your car and secretly watch them the entire time. The trust needs to be real.
However, you also need to make sure that your teen understands the consequences of breaking your trust. Remember that consistency will help to keep them in line because they will always know what expectations their parents have for them and what they can do to meet those expectations.

, There are always situations in which teens abuse the trust that was given to them by their parents. When this happens, it can be difficult to learn how to trust them again.


As parents, you must acknowledge the things that your teen has done and the consequences they have to face. Most importantly, parents need to be consistent in their expectations and punishments.
Otherwise, the teen will not take you seriously and do whatever they want, knowing that there will be no consequences.

, Even though you might have total trust in your well-behaved teenager, there will be times when they disappoint you and do the wrong thing.


There may be times where even though your teen knows what the right thing to do is and wants to do it, they change their mind as a result of peer pressure. Even though this is more understandable, a bad choice was still made and your teen will still have to face the consequences.
Let them know that one consequences of their actions is that you have lost your trust in them. Sometimes the knowledge that they have disappointed you will be enough to get them back on the track.

, Make the punishment harsh enough where they learn their lesson but not too harsh that they end up resentful. The punishment should fit the crime. You want your teen to strive to get your trust back, not try rebel against it even further.


Taking away freedoms is also a great way to teach teenagers that they were in the wrong. For instance, if a teen is late to curfew, you can give them a second chance, but deduct the time they were late from their normal curfew so they must come home earlier. This system is both fair and effective.If they do not obey, show them that trust and freedom are earned privileges by keeping them in the house for a few days. If they follow these guidelines to your satisfaction, slowly start giving back their freedoms. This will show them that you are starting to trust them again and hopefully they will start to respect that trust.

, It is important to talk to your teenager about what trust was broken and how. During this talk, it's a good idea to reinforce the boundaries that you have set.


Hear your teen out and give them the opportunity to explain themselves. There may have been extenuating circumstances which caused your teen to act the way they did.
Even if there weren't, it's important that you accept the teen's apology and tell them that you still love them no matter what.
Plan on reevaluating your teen's progress after a set amount of time to ensure that they are actively working on it.

, It’s important to share the benefits of trust with your teenager. Since teenagers tend to be inherently selfish, you need to explain why being trustworthy is beneficial for them.


Explain that you will be much more inclined to let them go out with their friends and make their own decisions if they have already proven to you that you can trust them.
For example, rather than failing to send you a text which let's you know exactly where they are (which may result in being grounded), explain to them that a simple message that communicates their whereabouts and when they'll be home will set your mind at ease and eliminate the possibility of being grounded, which makes everyone happy.

, Yelling all the time without giving any positive feedback does not help your teen at all, and does not encourage trustworthy behaviors. Instead, you need to give them positive feedback when they do something that makes you happy so you can reinforce good behavior.


For example, think about how you would react if you found out that your teenager was at party where alcohol was being served, but they were not drinking.
Instead of focusing on how they found themselves in that situation to begin with, focus on how proud you are that they didn’t partake.

, Most importantly, you need to have faith in yourself as a parent. You need to feel that you set reasonable expectations that are achievable for your teenager and be confident that trust will be regained.


Have faith that you raised your children to grow into responsible adults that will choose to make the right decisions (at least for the most part!) as they grow older.

Take notice of cuts and scratches.,
Be on the alert for cutting tools.,
Notice whether your teen covers up more than usual.,
Pay attention to any talk about self-injury.",How to Tell if Your Teen Is Cutting1," Teens who cut are often depressed, anxious, or under a lot of stress. If your child’s mood or self-esteem has taken a turn for the worse, it doesn’t necessarily mean they are cutting, but it does mean you should be on the lookout for other signs of a problem.For example, if your child seems more withdrawn than usual, doesn’t seem to enjoy doing many things, or says they feel overwhelmed, they might be at risk for cutting. They may also appear depressed, sad, or blue and seem to lack energy to do anything.;
, Everyone gets cuts and scrapes now and then, but if your teen seems to get hurt frequently, or if their injuries never seem to heal, they may be cutting themselves. They may also make a lot of excuses about where the marks came from.For instance, they might say something like, “My arms got scratched hiking in the woods” or “My friend’s cat scratched me.”
Marks that look intentional, such as rows of parallel scratches, are typically a sure sign that your teen is cutting.
Keep an eye out for bloody tissues or bandages in the trash as well.

, All kinds of things can be used to cut or scrape the skin – knives, razor blades, safety pins, paper clips, and even fingernails. If you notice that your child has an assortment of sharp objects in their room or backpack, it may be a sign that they’re cutting., If your teen wears long pants and long sleeves in hot weather, they may be trying to hide cuts on their arms and legs. Other warning signs may include wearing bracelets that hide their wrists and refusing to change in a locker room., If your teen mentions cutting or self-harm, even as a joke, you should take it seriously. Talking about self-injury is a giveaway that the behavior is on your child’s mind for some reason.If your teen mentions self-harm, use it as an opportunity to start a conversation. Ask them whether they know anyone who self-injures and how they feel about it. This can give you a better idea of whether your teen is at risk for cutting.

Ask your teen if they’re cutting.,
Empathize with your teen.,
Don’t make it about you.,
Tell your teen you want to help them.",How to Tell if Your Teen Is Cutting2," If you think your teen is cutting, don’t freak out – at least, not in front of them. Take the time to regain your composure and let your feelings settle a little. Wait to talk to your child until you’ve calmed down. If you panic or yell at them, you’ll only make them feel ashamed or defensive, and that won’t be productive for either of you.It’s normal to feel a lot of negative emotions if you find out your child is cutting. You might feel scared, angry, confused, and sad all at once. These feelings are valid, but it’s not a good idea to take them out on your child.
Remember, your teen isn’t cutting to upset you. They’re dealing with their own painful feelings. A calm, compassionate approach will work best with them.

, Be straightforward. Say something like, “I’ve noticed that you have a lot of scratches on your arms these days. Are you cutting yourself?”Use a warm, gentle tone. If you sound accusatory, your teen might get angry or defensive.
If your child admits that they’re cutting, ask follow-up questions to understand them better, like, “What makes you want to cut?” and “How do you feel after you cut yourself?”

, Make your child feels understood and loved, not judged. Listen to them and do your best to see where they’re coming from. Say something like, “I know you’ve got to be struggling a lot right now.”, Your child’s cutting affects you deeply, of course, but making them feel worse won’t solve anything. Don’t say anything like, “I’ve been a terrible parent to you” or “How could you do this to me?”It’s not your fault that your teen is cutting. However, if you take the right steps, you can be part of the reason why they stop.

, Make sure your teen knows they have your love and support, no matter what. Emphasize that they don’t need to feel guilty or embarrassed about asking for help.Say something like, “I want to help you feel better however I can.

Help your teen manage the problems that made them want to cut.",How to Tell if Your Teen Is Cutting3," It’s hard to accept, but the decision to cut or not to cut is your child’s alone. Someone who wants to self-injure will always find a way to do so. Instead of trying to control your child, focus on supporting them and helping them get to a better state of mind.You may still want to lock up razors and knives, but be aware that you probably can’t get rid of every sharp object in the house.

, Make an appointment with a medical professional, like your teen’s pediatrician. They can evaluate your teen’s health and refer you to a therapist or psychologist for treatment., Tell your child how talking with a therapist will help them deal with their emotions and feel better. Take a positive, casual tone. Don’t talk about therapy like a kind of punishment or make your child feel guilty for needing it.If you’ve ever been to see a therapist yourself, tell your teen about it. This will help normalize the idea for them.

, Sit down with your child and brainstorm some ways they can deal with their negative feelings instead of cutting. Offer to provide practical or emotional support however you can.For instance, offer to take a walk with your teen when they need to talk about a problem, or cut back on their household chores if they’re overwhelmed with schoolwork.

Take time to really consider the medication before you give it to your child.",How to Treat Bipolar Disorder in Teens1," Psychotherapy is a general blanket term for different therapies that involve your child going to talk to a psychiatrist or psychologist.Psychotherapy offers your child a chance to express himself and learn about different ways that he can manage his mood swings. Different types of psychotherapy that are generally prescribed for kids with bipolar depression include:


Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).
Family-focused therapy.
Interpersonal and social rhythm therapy (IPSRT).;
, The main principle behind CBT is that your actions are influenced by your thoughts and so negative thoughts can lead to negative actions. Depression is seen as such a negative action, even if it is a subconscious one, and it is the result of thoughts that are extremely pessimistic. In CBT the therapist will help your child identify the thoughts that lead to depression and will therefore be able to reduce the severity of the condition.For example:


The therapist might ask your child to pick a recent situation when he or she was experiencing depression. Then, the two of them will carefully examine that situation and will finally reach the depressive negative thoughts in the bottom. Next, the therapist will help your child restructure those thoughts so that they are not so pessimistic.
A specific example of restructuring a thought is: Let’s say one of your child’s negative thoughts that leads to a depressive episode is “I am doing very badly at school, so I must be stupid”. A CBT therapist will strive to restructure that thought into something along the lines of “I might not have the best grades in school, but I am very creative and that is a big advantage of mine”.
If your child is very young, the therapist might use drawings or toys to achieve the same result.

, This is a form of psychotherapy involves the entire immediate family participating in the therapy sessions. In psychology, the child is seen as a unit of the family, so the child’s depression is influenced by the family and the family is influenced by the depression. Remember that your child’s depression is not your fault and that there is no one to blame. However, the interactions in the family should be understood better and worked on.A therapy session might include:


The therapist observing your family’s interactions with one another, including body language, the way you talk to each other, etc.
Each family member getting to talk freely and expressing their feelings and perceptions of the situation.
Insight into your child’s depressive episodes and how you can better help him or her.

, This approach was developed specifically to deal with bipolar disorders. It is very effective in treating children and adolescents with bipolar depression. The approach will help your child learn about and understand his daily actions and routines. By encouraging your child to keep close track of his moods and feelings, your child and the therapist will be able to discover which situations and everyday actions provoke depressive episodes.Once your child has pinpointed what makes him experience a depressive episode, the therapist will help your child structure those actions and behaviors into a daily routine. People with bipolar depression have shown improvement when given a daily routine to follow. The routine will also involve sleep patterns that will help your child get rest so that he is less likely to experience an episode.

, Keep in mind that the exact procedure for doing this varies for every child, as the course of this therapy is largely determined by individual characteristics and needs.

, It is essential not to decide on a medication kind and dosage for your child on your own—every child requires very specific treatment and even slight discrepancies can cause very unpleasant side effects and additional problems. However, medication is a must when it comes to bipolar depression. That is why you should talk over every detail with your child’s doctor.Common medications prescribed include:


Lithium.
Carbamazepine.
Divalproex.
Lamotrigine.
Valproate.

, While medication is necessary to treat bipolar depression, there are still some issues you should consider when choosing a medication. These considerations include:


How frequently your child will need to take this medication.
How this medication will interact with any other medications your child is taking.
What the side effects are of this medication.

"
"
Try to accept that your child is depressed.,
Take the time to listen to your child.,
Spend quality time with your child.,
Be prepared for mood swings.,
Try not to make your child feel guilty.,
Share your thoughts and feelings with your child to encourage him or her to share with you.",How to Treat Bipolar Disorder in Teens2," Parents can sometimes have a hard time accepting that their child is actually depressed, rather than just sad sometimes. If your child is diagnosed with bipolar depression, it is important that you try to accept his condition so that you can do everything within your power to help him.


Tell your child that you know that he is experiencing something very difficult and that you are there for him.

, Bipolar depression can make your child feel isolated, worthless and hopeless. One way to be there for your child is to listen to him when he feels like talking about what he is going through. Make your child feel important. Always encourage your child to talk to you, even when he is not feeling depressed, so that he knows that he can come to talk to you when he is feeling sad.


Ask your child questions like “How was your day?” or “How are you feeling today?” so that he knows that you are interested and willing to listen whenever he is ready to talk.

, Like listening to your child, spending time with your child is a way to show him that he is not alone, even if his depression makes him feel like he is. Depression can cause your child to lose interest in things that he loves. Try to keep him interested in those things by offering to do them with him. Again, make your child feel important and show him that you want to spend time with him.


For example, if you child loved baseball but has recently lost interest in it because of his depression, get out two gloves and offer to throw the ball with him.

, Children with bipolar disorder can go from extremely happy to incredibly depressed in a matter of minutes. You must try to be prepared for this as best you can. Keep in mind that your child might become very sensitive when he enters a depressed state, so monitor what you say to him. Things that you might say to him as jokes when he is happy might upset him when he is depressed.


Keep in mind that there may be times when your child expresses his love for you and talks to you about what is going on, while other times he may be very reserved and acts like he hates you. Try not to take his mood swings personally.

, There may be times when your child yells at you or suddenly gets very angry and storms off. Try not to get visibly upset by his actions. Instead, when your child has calmed down, talk to your child about how he made you feel without blaming him for his actions.


Try to remember that he cannot control his mood swings and that it his condition that makes him act this way, rather than his nature.

, Sometimes it is best to lead by example. When you take the time to share your thoughts, feelings, and problems with your child, he will learn by your example and may begin to share his thoughts and feelings with you.


Try to talk to your child openly and honestly about his condition. Try not to make him feel guilty, but discuss the condition and what you both can do to make his life—and yours—easier.

Choose a destination that your teenager might enjoy.,
Try to compromise.,
Bring some items to keep your teen busy.,
Bring some snacks along with you.,
Have a budget.,
Set some ground rules.,
Ask your teen for help.,
Compromise when necessary.,
Try to be patient.,
Make the most of your accommodations.,
Go to a souvenir shop.,
Let your teen sleep for longer during the trip.",How to Travel with Your Sullen Teenager," Before you decide on the destination of you vacation, ask your teen where he would like to go. Let him or her do some research on possible vacation spots. Involving the teen in planning your vacation will hopefully make him more enthusiastic about the trip.


Have a brainstorm of ideas about it. You could do this during dinner when the family is complete, or a chill Sunday while everyone is up for relaxing and watching television.
However, it's important not to start an argument. Try to create a positive attitude about your adventure together. Express your excitement and stress the fact that you want everyone to be happy, including the teenager.;
, Choose a vacation that meets everyone's expectations and needs. For example, if your teen would like to go on an adventure trip but you want to go to the beach then maybe you could settle for a cruise.


If your teen likes to play games or sports but his other siblings want to go swimming then maybe you could go to a recreation resort.
Just try to find something that everyone will enjoy.

, It's a good idea to plan on bringing some items that will distract your teen and keep him happy while travelling.


Bring some gadgets (tablet, cell phone, mp3 player, etc.) with headphones. You can let your teen use these while travelling in the car, or waiting to board the plane.
You could also surprise your teen with some new books or magazines that they could read while travelling.

, Plan on bringing some snacks to keep your teen from getting too hungry, especially if you are in a place where food is not easily accessible. This is really important, as hunger will put your teen in a bad mood.


Give your teen snacks at regular snacks but don't allow him to overeat, otherwise he will lose his appetite for the next meal and won't want to sit with the family.
Some good snack options are fruits, yogurt, vegetable pizza, etc. You can choose other healthy snacks depending on your teen's preferences.

, This is one of the most important factors to consider before traveling. You have to figure out how much you’re going to need if you want a stress-free vacation.


Make sure that you set aside some spending money for your teen as part of your budget. He can use this money to buy souvenirs for his friends, buy ice cream, sodas, etc.

, When you arrive at your destination, agree on some ground rules like, “no gadgets allowed.”


Of course, you can adjust this rule according to your preferences. If you want, allocate specific times when your teen is allowed to use gadgets, for example, before going to sleep. Make it clear that the rest of the time is family time.
This rule is important because you don't want your teen to miss out on fun things like sightseeing and tours. Otherwise he may be physically present but mentally absent, just because he is too immersed in his smartphone.

, Take an advantage of the fact that your teen is so into the internet. Ask him to help you look for tourist attractions. Your teen might feel more excited when he knows more about where you are going.


This is also a good way to make him feel more involved, as it gives him a sense of authority and makes him feel like he is in charge of the family outing.
Assign a task for your teen. This could be something as simple as putting him in charge of preparing the food, for instance. This prevents your teen from getting bored, while also teaching him to be more responsible and independent.

, While you need to consider your teen’s interests, you shouldn't make the whole trip about him either. He need to understand that this is your vacation too and that you deserve to enjoy it.


Maybe you could agree to split each day in two - for the first half of the day he gets to choose what he wants to, but for the second half of the day he has to go along with whatever the rest of the family wants.

, If you want to make your vacation as pleasurable and relaxing as possible, try to be as patient with your teen as you can. Don't let him stress you out with his sullen mood.


Keep an open-mind as your teen may be really moody for a particular reason (though sometimes they will just be moody for no reason at all). Try to talk to your teen and see if there is something in particular that's bothering them.
When you have a disagreement, try to be as calm and understanding as possible. When you are composed, you are inviting your teen to be calm as well; and things won't escalate into a full-blown screaming match.

, Whether you are staying in a hotel, apartment, camping area, etc., try to make the most of it by planning some activities.


Take advantage of the leisure facilities of the hotel or apartment, as this is a fun way to hang out with and bond with your teen. You could use the swimming pool, fitness room, spa center or bike hire, for example.
For camping areas, you have unlimited “facilities” that you can take full advantage of - that is nature itself! Embrace the opportunity of being one with nature by doing yoga with your teen. You could also lie down under the stars with your teen and just talk about life.

, Souvenirs serve as something that will remind both of you of where you have been, along with the memories that you created with each other.


You could consider buying something related to your teen’s favorite activity from the trip, like a t-shirt with a surfboard on it.
Make your teen happy by allowing him choose some souvenirs to give to his friends.

, This may be his one chance to take a rest from the stress of school, exams, etc. You will also appreciate your teen getting enough sleep, as he may be less grumpy the next day if he's well-rested!

Give her space.,
Be there for her.,
Tell her how much you value her and love her.,
Let her express herself through fashion, but have limits.,
Get to know your daughter's friends.,
Help your daughter maintain a healthy body image.",How to Raise Teenage Girls1," More often then not, your teenage daughter is going to want to spend less and less time with you. Don't get upset about this, it's natural and nothing personal in most cases. Your daughter is wanting more independence and subconsciously wants to prove her adulthood to those around her. She may shut her door instead of leaving it open like she used to, or she may have private phone conversations in a hidden corner of the house. The important thing is not to threaten her privacy or try to barge in unexpectedly, or she may pull away even more.Though you may desperately want to know what's going on in your daughter's life, saying things like, ""What were you talking about with your friend?"" or ""What were you doing alone in your room for so many hours?"" will actually make her distance herself even more. If she wants to share something with you, she will.
If she storms into the house, or just looks very upset and runs up to her room, you can say something like, ""I know you're upset right now and you probably don't want to talk about it. But if you want to talk about it later, I'm always here for you."" This will reassure your daughter without pressing her to talk when she's not ready.;
, When your daughter is down, ask her what's up. If she doesn't want to tell you, then it's fair enough, but be her shoulder to cry on. Have good advice at hand to help her out. Let her know that your door is always open, and remind her that hey, you were a teenager once and you managed to survive. Sometimes she may not want to talk and will just need a shoulder to cry on. Be there for her then, too, without forcing her to tell you what's up.


If your daughter is down, eat some ice cream and watch TV with her. Be there as a comforting parent and friend.
If she needs your support for something in school, be there for her, whether you're watching her tennis match or her debate tournament.

, It sounds very cheesy, and she may act like she hates it, but you never know what's going on inside her. It could be the one thing that keeps her going. Let her know how special she is to you and mention all of the great qualities that she possesses. Though you don't want to do this too often or she may feel suffocated, you should tell her often enough that she knows its true.


Many teenage girls are incredibly insecure, and you should make your daughter feel better about herself. Don't criticize her looks, tell her to lose weight, or try to force her to hang out with the popular kids. If your daughter feels like her own mother or father isn't happy with who she is, then her self-esteem will plummet.

, She might want to wear something one time that you don't approve of. Or, she might want some clothes that are ridiculously expensive. Remember your personal morals here, and try to reason with her. Peer pressure will be setting in, and you don't want to outcast her totally from her friends.


Be reasonable. If you make her dress like a Puritan, she will likely change into something more provocative once she leaves your home. However, if you feel like her friends are all really wearing incredibly provocative clothing, you can talk to her about why you don't think that's a good idea.

, Though you don't have to act like you're so cool that you're BFF with all of your daughter's friends, you should get to know them a bit. Invite them over for dinner. Let your daughter have a sleepover or just invite her friends over to watch a movie or something. Ask them questions about their lives without being too intrusive or nosy. Besides, seeing your daughter's friends and getting to know them will make you less nervous about what she does when she goes out with them. You'll feel more safe knowing that she's in good hands.


If you don't like one of your daughter's friends, don't criticize the friend in front of her unless you think she is a really, really bad influence. This will only make your daughter want to hang out with this person more.

, The oddest comment, from one of her friends, one of her enemies, or even you, could trigger her sensitive emotions. Try to notice signs of depression, bulimic traits, or anorexia, as these can be very serious. Many teenage girls develop a poor body image as well as eating disorders, and it's important to make sure your daughter is eating three healthy meals and also feeling good about eating, instead of punishing herself for it.


Do not ever tell your daughter she could lose a few pounds. Unless she's obese and her weight is really hurting her health, this is absolutely the worst way to make her feel good about her body.

"
Put safety first.,
Let her date.,
Talk about sex.,
Prepare for her period.,
Know how to handle the mood swings.,
Talk about smoking, drugs, and alcohol.",How to Raise Teenage Girls2," You don't want to be too controlling, but at the same time, you still want to keep your daughter safe. Invest some money in buying her a cellphone for her, or ask her to help you out in saving. If she has one, she can have it on her at all times for when you need to get a hold of her. Talk to her about emergency scenarios. For example, say something like, ""If you can't get a sober driver to take you home from a party, I'll pick you up. I don't care if it's four in the morning -- I'd rather drive you than have you get in the car with a drunk driver.""


Sure, your daughter will groan a little if you're obsessed with her being safe, but it's much better than not caring and having her get into a dangerous situation.
With teenagers spending more time online than ever, it's important to encourage cyber safety. Talk to your daughter about not talking to anyone online whom she doesn't know, and about definitely not meeting up with anyone she meets online unless she has good reason to trust this person.

, She's going to come to the age where she has a boyfriend. You have to be accepting, no matter what you think. The strictness and fairness rules apply here, too. You need to be there for her during the relationship. Though you don't want to pry or ask too many questions, you should be involved and know what she's doing and where she's going.


Though it may kill you to see your daughter dating someone who may potentially mistreat or take advantage of her, you have to help her be a good judge of character herself instead of telling her if you think her boyfriend is a no good loser. If you try to discourage your daughter from dating a certain person, she'll only want to be with him even more.
Face it: it's just not realistic to keep your daughter from dating someone she likes. This isn't the Stone Ages, and the fact of the matter is, there's only so much you can do to stop your daughter from dating. You can't keep her locked in her room like a princess trapped in a tower. One day, she'll go off to college or will just move out of the house, and she'll be free to date whomever she wants.
Plus, you don't want your daughter to resent you for not letting her date. If you don't let her do what the rest of her friends are doing, which is perfectly natural at her age, she'll be bitter towards you.

, You need to be comfortable with mentioning it, even though she's going to squirm and get embarrassed (and even if you are, too!). Don't panic about mentioning safe sex and pregnancy around her, just to get the message into her head. However, don't talk about it when friends are around. Don't be too old fashioned with your principles, as this will just enhance the risk of a rebellion with her.


It's far better to talk to her about safe sex than to have her end up in a dangerous situation. Stress the importance of only having sex when she's ready, and of not letting a guy convince her to go further than she wants to go.
Of course, everyone would feel better if their teenage daughters were virgins. But the average age to lose your virginity hovers around 16 years, so it's better to talk about the importance of having safe sex and even considering taking birth control pills than to preach abstinence.

, She's going to start her period at some point, and you should have pads and tampons on the side ready for her. Like sex, don't be afraid to mention periods before she starts. You don't want her freaking out if she doesn't know. Talk to her about period pains and cravings, and give her access to books and websites that will explain more information to her. Many girls get their period as preteens, so you should be prepared for this even before her teenage years, especially if she is developing quickly.

, Yelling at her when she's highly emotional isn't going to help at all. Let her emotions sort themselves out because she can't help it. Much like a menopausal woman, your daughter will be going through many changes with her emotions, and it's important to be patient and to understand that she may not always be the happy-go-lucky little girl you remembered. Know that it will get better and that your daughter won't always feel like this.Be patient with her and let her know that she won't always feel that way. At the same time, though, don't stress the fact that she's going through a lot of hormonal changes too much, or she may say, ""It's not hormones!"" and may get defensive, insisting that she's feeling this way just because things aren't going well for her.Remember that while it's important to resolve conflicts with your daughter, it's also important to pick your battles. If you fight and argue with her over every little thing, especially when she's upset, you'll develop a combative relationship and she won't want to come to you when she's in trouble because she'll just expect a fight.

, You may have your personal views on smoking and drugs, but have your best interest in your daughter's health when you govern rules over these issues. Talk to your daughter about the danger of drugs and smoking, and let her know that she should avoid underage drinking as much as she can, because people her age can act very, very irresponsibly with alcohol. However, realistically, many people drink before they turn 18 and 21 and it's better to talk about safe drinking habits than to categorically ban it.


Make sure your daughter knows her limits when it comes to alcohol. Talk about how she shouldn't have more than a drink per hour, should avoid any mixed drinks at parties, and that she should avoid taking shots or she will quickly feel sick.
You don't want your daughter to avoid alcohol and know nothing about it until she goes to college and starts drinking her heart out. She should have a firm knowledge about what her limits are before she starts drinking with strangers.
Also, talk to her about drinking with care around guys and about not leaving her drink unattended at any cost.
You don't have to act like you were a saint when you were her age. If you had some bad experiences with drugs or alcohol at her age and learned from them, you can share some of these experiences with her (with discretion, of course).

Don't try too hard to be a ""cool"" parent.,
Be more than just a disciplinarian.,
Lay down the law.,
Establish rules for checking in with your daughter.,
Consider giving your daughter an allowance.,
Motivate your daughter with rewards, not threats.,
Be a good role model.",How to Raise Teenage Girls3," Sure, you want your daughter to like you, but that shouldn't compromise your values or her safety. You can try to be cool, while having a firm hand over her at the same time. If she comes to you asking to go to a party one evening, this can come as a shock. Whatever you do, do not say no straight away; ask for details on who's holding the event and when and where it is. Come up with valid and reasonable responses to her proposal, even if it is that she's not allowed to go. This can be applied in many situations.


Of course, everyone wants his or her daughter to think he or she is a cool parent. But that shouldn't compromise your expectations of your daughter. In the end, when your daughter is all grown up, it won't really matter if she thought you were cool when she was sixteen. What will matter is that you raised her right.

, It's important to lay down the law, but it's also important to be friends with your daughter as much as you can. Of course, though every parent wants to be friends with his or her daughter, this is not always possible. You cannot be one hundred percent your teenager's friend, as your main role is to be her parent. This doesn't mean you can't have a fun conversation with her or spend an evening doing some fun activities together. Make sure your daughter sees you as more than just an authority figure, but as someone she can turn to in a crisis or just for sharing a fun experience.


Of course, this is a delicate balance. If your daughter is the type who says, ""My mom is my best friend,"" she may be less likely to listen when you tell her she can't go to a party until she does her homework.

, It's important to have some base rules for your daughter, such as a curfew. However many times you hear the phrase ""None of my friend have a curfew,"" more often then not, it's not true. Girls need boundaries, and letting them stay out can be dangerous. You can even consider having a set ""lights out"" time, even if you don't call it a bedtime. Growing teenagers also need their sleep. They're not going to grow properly or get the grades they deserve if they don't get enough rest.But, don't get too hung up on these times. Have some flexibility on the times, and this way your daughter will respect you more.
Make sure your daughter is clearly aware of these rules, so she doesn't bother arguing whenever they come up.
Though some flexibility is necessary, it's also important to be consistent. You don't want to be flaky or erratic in your rules, or your daughter will never know what you want or expect.
If you have a two-parent household, then it's important to agree on the rules with your spouse. You don't want to be known as the strict or lenient parent; your daughter should see you and your spouse as people with similar views about how she should be raised.

, While you don't want to call or text her every two seconds when she's with friends or on a date, you should make it clear how often you expect her to check in. If she knows that you'll call her if she doesn't text you every three hours, she'll be much more likely to check in. Find a balance between knowing where your daughter is and not being too overbearing.

, Not every parent gives their daughter an allowance, but if you do, then you have to carefully consider the amount. How much money do you give your child? Think about what she's going to be spending it on -- most often, parents buy the clothes their daughter needs, and the child buys the ones that they really want but don't need. Be reasonable with the money.


You should also instill a work ethic in your daughter. She can have a part-time or a summer job to make some money on her own. She can't always think that all of her money will come from her parents.
Some parents give their children a set amount of money for doing chores, but this isn't for everyone. You may want your daughter to feel like doing chores is just part of her duty of being your child, and that she shouldn't have to get paid to do the dishes or help out around the house.

, Teenagers respond better to rewards then threats. So, when you want your daughter to tidy her bedroom, say something like, ""If you tidy your room, you can go out on Saturday."" Say this instead of, ""If you don't tidy your room, I won't let you go out on Saturday."" Both things mean the same thing. However, the first one will be far more effective. Wording is everything.


You want your daughter to look at you as someone who gives her opportunities to do things, not as someone who keeps her from doing what she wants.

, This doesn't mean you should try to be an absolutely perfect parent. We're all only human, after all. However, if you want your daughter to respect you and to listen to you, then you have to demonstrate the behavior you expect to see from her. You can't yell at her every second if you tell her never to raise her voice. You don't want to be mean, spiteful, or nasty toward other people if you expect her to treat everyone with respect. If you don't want her to be a gossip, don't gossip about your friends in front of her. If you want her to be kind to others, then model this behavior for her.


If you make mistakes, it's best to apologize than to pretend nothing happened. Let your daughter see that you're only human and are sorry for what you did, and in turn, she'll be more likely to apologize when she's made a mistake, too.

"
Be congruent—if you believe something, then speak of those things often and then do those things.,
Teach them the tenets of your faith early (as soon as the child can speak), and not just when they go to the places where these ideas are taught, but teach them at home, in the car, on the playground, and when something significant happens.,
Be the primary teacher of all things spiritual.,
Be positive when speaking about others (especially spiritual “authority” figures.,
Leave space for difference.,
Remind them often that the rituals that go with your belief are not mandatory.,
Keep your spiritual beliefs as a part of your very being.,
Demonstrate your faith in your own life.",How to Raise Spiritually Fit Teens," Let your teens see you behaving in ways that equal your belief. For example if love and acceptance is what guides you spiritually then you must not just talk a good game, you’ve got to live the game. Sometimes you have to “play” the game. In other words, you have got to make extra efforts to allow you teen to hear and see you doing what you believe. For instance, when one of their friends gets caught skipping school, you have got to be there with some response at sounds understanding. Like, “What got into Mike; he is not that kind of kid at all.”;
, Look for teachable moments in every situation. Then quiz them on what they know. Ask question like: “Jon what do you believe about God?” When he answers, ask him why he believe that. If he is unclear on some area, then clear him up and then quiz him on his clarity. Note: you are doing this in a light now threatening way. Accept whatever answer he gives, making sense of what he says. Remember the only way you can have this conversation is that Jon feels no condemnation from you, so be sweet. Remember, your teen has been listening and watching out for about 13-years. Depending on how well you showed yourself to be spiritual, you will have an easy time getting him to join you in these conversations.

, You do not want anyone else to be this primary in your child’s life, as you know what you “ideally” want him or her to embody when it comes to spiritual things. Primarily, you want to make the first impression, letting your child know that spiritual things are important in life. Then you want to set the proper foundation, so that yours is the one that your teen measures everyone else’s by. The way to check out what others are teaching is to ask your teen what they learned at your place of spirituality. I always asked my children this question. When I did not agree with what they were told, I would not dispute what they were told, but I would add to it, giving it my own spend and allowing for more flexibility in my son or daughter’s understanding.

, Always do your best to speak of others in a positive light. You want to model what it means to be gracious, forgiving, accepting and loving. For one, you will want these attributes to be directed to you from your teen, so you want to show them how it’s done. Also, you don’t want to give them the impression that anyone, including you, is without faults. This is especially true for spiritual leaders. Never do you want to give them the impression that these men and women are any more “holy” than any other human being (check out the news). However the best way to show grace is by the way you respond to them when they break some house rule or misbehaves at school. You want to show them what loving and accepting looks like. Discipline does not have to be without a heart. So discipline your child, but do it without unnecessary cruelty—abusive, degrading talk or taunting.

, Your teen may find a way to be spiritual that is different from yours. Give her or him space to do that. Acceptance is a spiritual value that crosses all lines of beliefs. The last thing you want to do is to show a lack of respect for someone else’s personal spiritual walk. Even if your beliefs are that your teen’s ideas will lead his or her certain demise, you want to share your difference (which he or she already knows remember, but if you must tell them again) and respectfully accept her or his. Trust me, the quickest way to lose your teen to some “radial” idea forever is to show lack of respect and honor for his/her beliefs. Recently, a friend of mine shared with me that she asked her 16-year-old son about his spiritual beliefs. The first thing he said was that he did not want tell her because she would not agree—he knew what beliefs were. But she insisted that she would not be upset. When he told her, she respectfully asked, “Tell me about it?”

, In other words, you are not going to church, temple, synagogue, mosque; or do you pray, chant, or meditate because you have to, but because you want to. You want your teen to know that these practices are self-enhancing and you do them for those reasons. Further, your teen needs to know that you worship or practice the way you do because of your own personal or inner convictions, not because you fear rejection or ostracizing. It is important that your teen know that your beliefs come from within and that you would practice as you do no matter what anyone else around you practices or believes. Your inner convictions will be a sign of your devotion as an inner strength.

, You must embody your beliefs, so that you don’t have to practice them, they are apart of your thought processes and they influence your every move. Whether at work, at school, at home, in the community, with friends, children, or adults your spirituality shows up in every thing you do. “Being” is what will make it easier to show your teen how to be. You are still and will always be the most influential person in your teen’s life. So be spiritual and respect them as spiritual beings and you will raise teens that are spiritually healthy too.

, Make being part of a family of believers important. Your kids will benefit from the connections of that community. Develop a network of accountability with other in your church. By establishing a strong link with a family of believers we anchor there sense of beliefs.

Pay attention to their school grades.,
Reflect on how they view school.",How to Recognize Teenage Anxiety," These might include unexplained stomachaches, headaches, or even panic attacks, in certain situations. Some of these symptoms may sometimes be ignored because teens think that they are caused by something else.;
, For many teenagers, they feel that substances are the only way out of their anxiety.

, This could include being unable to fall asleep because their mind is racing, waking up many times during the night or feeling tired throughout the day. Parents often put this down to teenagers being lazy and such, but sleeping problems are an important factor in recognizing anxiety.

, This is the first and most obvious symptom of anxiety is an intense fear or long lasting worry about events other people wouldn't think twice about.


Look at how they are acting. They may be unable to relax and enjoy themselves if they're always high-strung and worrying.

, In many, but not all, teens their social life is very important to them. Not wanting to participate in activities with their friends or making plans but then canceling them because they are too afraid are common signs of anxiety.

, Having extremely low self-esteem is a common sign of anxiety. Signs of this could be that the teen is using self destructive terms, being overly critical of their abilities or talking about how hopeless or pointless their life is.

, Mood swings and irritability can often show anxiety. Like many of the other symptoms, people can think that this is just part of being a teenager, but it isn't. Try to ask them how they are and work out how they're feeling.

Pay attention to your teen dressing inappropriately.,
Beware of frequent injuries.,
Notice if the teen is fearful or anxious around caregivers.,
Spot signs of withdrawal or shying away from touch.",How to Tell if Your Teen Is Being Abused1," If you suspect that your teen is being beaten by someone in their life, you will want to pay close attention to their dress code. While all teens have different styles and preferences, be on the lookout for any clothing that is out of the norm for your child.


For instance, your teen may try to hide the signs of abuse (e.g. scratches, burns, bruises, bite marks, broken bones, etc.) by wearing long sleeves or pants. They might keep a hoodie on even when indoors. Beware of any strange changes in their attire that aren’t appropriate for the weather or setting.You may also notice that a teen who once took pride in their appearance stops grooming themselves or putting any effort into what they wear or how they look. This may be caused by depression, or the trauma of abuse.;
, Has your teen had multiple bruises recently? Unexplained wounds, bruises, or broken bones could be a sign of physical abuse. Also, be suspicious when your teen’s explanation doesn’t align with the injury, or if they refuse to give an explanation at all.Let’s say your teenage daughter comes home from a date with a huge bruise on her shoulder. You ask about it and she replies, “Oh, I bumped into the roof of the car when I was getting out,” then averts her eyes. This could be an indication that she is ashamed of the bruise and trying to cover up abuse.

, Are you a co-parent or relative who is suspicious of the detached relationship your teen has with other caregivers? Being reluctant to be in a room with the caregiver or seeming very cautious or “on guard” in their presence could be a warning sign of abuse. A teen who is physically abused may also fear going home.They may also show a general fear or anxiety in regards to any social interaction, not just when around their caregiver or possible abuser.

, Another common indicator of physical abuse is your teen shrinking back or flinching after sudden movements. This jumpy behavior may have developed because they fear being struck."

Accept your teen.,
Back off with punishment.,

Help your teen discover ways to cope with stress.,
Be curious.,

Acknowledge your teen’s feelings.,
Approach talks/fights with self-awareness.,
Avoid unhealthy coping strategies.,

Seek therapy.",How to Reduce Stress when You Have Young Teens," Traditionally, parents tend to see themselves as knowing more than their child, with a responsibility to guide the child through daily life. As a child becomes a teen, however, he or she learns to function more autonomously and wants more independence. The more you try and control your teen, the more likely pushback will become. Then, the gap between teen and parent can widen when a teen’s desire to live more autonomously is not met.By accepting your teen, you can lessen conflicts and reduce stress.


When you feel the urge to tighten the reigns on your teen, take a moment and ask yourself, “How can I allow my teen to grow and respect his or her need for independence while still prioritizing safety?”;
, While punishment was an effective way to parent a young child, it will likely lead to more conflict with a young teen. When your teen misbehaves or makes a mistake, change your approach and help your child to understand his or her emotional motivations and make repairs.Don’t see it as trying to get your teen to do what you want, but as allowing your teen to make mistakes, understand the mistake, and then repair any damage. Instead of enforcing external rules, lead by example and enforce values, not rules. Teens who have their own personal motivation are more likely to engage in positive behaviors than those who are forced (such as, “I make these choices because I know they have a better outcome for me and other people” than, ” I follow rules because I’m told to or because otherwise I will get punished”).Sit down with your teen and ask what happened. Help him or her sort through emotions and understand what led to the action.Then, guide him or her in how to make things better.
If your teen makes a mistake, accept it (and your teen). Make sure that the mistake is seen through the lens of learning more than punishing. For instance, if your teen mistreats a younger sibling, ask him or her, “what led to you yelling?” and, “If someone says something to you that you don’t like, does that justify the same kind of behavior? Why or why not?” Once you talk about emotions, think about a solution. Ask, “Your sister is upset. What do you think you can do to make things better between the two of you?”

, When adults makes a risky decisions (such as speeding), they know that consequences occur and they make decisions based on those consequences. Teaching the same principle to your young teen is fair and allows for him or her to build responsibility. Be clear in behavioral expectations and consequences upfront, not after-the-fact.It’s important to teach the teen that he or she has the power to affect outcomes, based on the behavior he or she chooses. Being upfront in expectations means less fighting and less stress later.


Have a discussion with your teen about the freedoms he or she is gaining as a young teen (such as a cell phone, later curfew, or more time with friends). While introducing these freedoms, discuss consequences if these freedoms are pushed by the teen. Come up with consequences together so that you are each in agreement.

, Teens experience high levels of stress, and if unarmed with how to deal with it effectively, may turn to drugs, alcohol, video games or tv, or other unhealthy ways of coping. Teens struggling with stress may experience irritability, anger, worrying excessively, sleeping problems or eating problems.Help your teen find ways to manage stress. Ask her what physical activities interest her, or what sports he wants to explore; exercise and physical activity are great ways to work through stress.Encourage activities such as journaling, going for a walk, talking to friends, drawing or coloring, and listening to music.
Modeling healthy coping can go a long way: get adequate sleep, eat healthfully, get some exercise and engage in coping strategies of your own and show your teen that you value coping strategies for stress., When talking with your teen, avoid an interrogative approach and instead approach with curiosity. Discussions with your teen don’t have to include advice or judgments (and these often create distance between parents and teens). Instead, ask your teen about his or her feelings, opinions, and views.This allows your teen to learn and express the self and build emotional vocabulary. Then, talking with your teen will be less stressful and more helpful for both of you.


If your teen tends to give one word answers, be proactive in asking open-ended questions that allow for elaboration. See this as a time to get to know your teen. Instead of saying “How was your day?” with the typical, “good” or “fine” response, say, “What was the most interesting part of your day?” or “Tell me something you’re looking forward to this week.”
When talking about feelings, you don’t have to say things like, “How did that make you feel?” Ask, “What was that like for you?” or “what are your thoughts on this?”

, Before immediately disagreeing with your teen, allow him or her to speak without interruption. Showing that you are listening and hearing your teen respectfully may make it easier for the teen to share his or her opinions, thoughts, and feelings with you.Showing respect to your teen allows him or her to see that you acknowledge the words and feelings, and you are interested in what is being said. Feeling heard and understood is important to a teen.


Even if you wholeheartedly disagree with what your teen is saying, listen anyway. Allow your teen the time and space to express how he or she feels, then share your feelings.

, It’s been suggested that parents should say 50% less than what they do when talking to their teens.Chances are, your teen understands you and you don’t need to keep repeating. By keeping your words simple, you may avoid prolonging arguments or disagreements and decrease negative feelings between the two of you.


Remember when you were a teen and your parents would go on and on about something while you were thinking, “Okay, stop, I get the point”? Keep your words simple so your teen doesn’t get there, too.

, When talking with your teen, keep in mind that he or she wants to feel heard, acknowledged, recognized, and to have approval.Finding these things at home may mean he or she doesn’t look for them outside, which can be harmful. Avoid focusing on the negatives, and reinforce (and keep reinforcing) the things your teen is doing well. Acknowledging and appreciating your teen may encourage him or her to seek you out to talk.


Avoid giving compliments and focus on acknowledging effort, hard work, and intrinsic traits in your teen.For instance, avoid saying, “Good job with the ‘A’ on your exam.” and instead say, “Your hard work really payed off. You studied hard for that exam and I’m glad you see the evidence of that. I can see you value studying and your schoolwork.”
If your friend is being kind to another friend, acknowledge that. “You’re a really supportive friend and I can tell you value your friendships.”

, Arguments aren’t just about outright disagreements; they can help you understand your own beliefs and reflect what’s going on inside. You may find things in your teen that mirror feelings you have that you’ve effectively hid from yourself. See it as an opportunity to learn about yourself. Consider your reactions to your teen and ask yourself how they reflect back to you.If you feel rejected by your teen, ask yourself, “How have I felt rejected in life?” or “How do I reject aspects of my own self?”

, For your own health and for the purpose of modeling positive coping strategies, don’t turn to quick fixes when faced with stress. This can include overeating, planting yourself in front of the tv or video games for hours, smoking, drinking alcohol, consuming drugs, or taking out your stress on others.If you find yourself using these strategies, try replacing them with healthier strategies.


While these can temporarily alleviate stress, they do more harm than good in the long run, and set a poor example for your teen.

, Exercise is good for both your body and your mind. Even brief exercise, like a walk, can benefit your mood and help you deal with stress.Not sure what do to? Go for a walk with your dog, jump on the trampoline, or swim laps at the pool.


Lots of gyms offer classes you can take, such as yoga, weight training, or dance basics.
If you’re interested in sports, join a local league and get involved in baseball, basketball, racquetball, or anything else that interests you.

, Make sure you have friends outside of your nuclear family to spend time with regularly. Spending time with friends allows your body to feel calm and safe.Surround yourself with people you consider good listeners (and make sure you’re a good listener back). Just being around people you enjoy automatically allows you to calm down and feel less emotionally defensive.While a phone call can be beneficial, make sure you have friends nearby that you can spend time with face-to-face.
Don’t have many friends in your life? Check out How to Make Friends.

, While being a parent is hard work, make sure you have at least one thing you do every day that brings you enjoyment.This can be as simple as enjoying a perfect cup of coffee, writing a novel, reading a great book, or playing the piano. Communicate to your kids that this is time set aside just for you, and it is not to be interrupted.


Sometimes it’s easiest to have this time early in the morning or late at night.

, Meditation has many health benefits, including allowing your mind and body to relax and focus.There are lots of different ways to meditate, including silencing the chatter of the mind or practicing loving-compassion. If you’re new to meditation, start with 5-10 minutes, and if you choose, you can increase the time.


Try this: sit or lie down and make your body comfortable. When you notice your attention wandering (and it will wander), gently bring it back to your body and your environment. Then, shift your attention to noticing the inhalation and exhalation of your breath. You don’t need to analyze it, just notice it. Any time your mind wanders to plans for the day, memories, or other thoughts, gently bring your attention back to your environment and your breath., If you continue to struggle with dealing with your young teen, it may be time to seek outside help. A therapist can help your teen improve communication, work through emotional or mental disturbances, and help find coping strategies. Many therapists who work with teens also work with parents in order to improve relationships. If you notice your teen increasing aggressive or violent behavior, drug/alcohol abuse, promiscuity, runaway behavior or brushes with the law, consider seeing a therapist.If you find yourself resorting to violent behavior such as hitting to discipline your teen, this a an indication that further help is needed.

Take note of sexual promiscuity.,
Notice trouble walking or sitting.,
Beware of depression or suicidal thoughts.,
Look for unhealthy coping through substance abuse.,
Look for signs of self-injurious behavior.",How to Tell if Your Teen Is Being Abused2," If your teenage daughter or son seems hypersexual and has advanced knowledge of sex that’s abnormal for their age, watch them closely. Victims of sexual abuse tend to fall into one of two categories in terms of sexual behavior.Some adolescents who suffer from childhood sexual abuse go on to avoid sexual contact because they see it as “dirty.” On the contrary, other victims of abuse react by engaging in excessive sexual activity simply because they view it as the only thing they are worthy of.
Their self-esteem has become intertwined with sexual desirability. Therefore, they engage in sex to feel good about themselves and feel valued as a person.If you are unclear about what is age-appropriate behavior, consult with a counselor or therapist. They can let you know if your teen's sexual interest or activity is normal or if it indicates abuse or another issue.

, A teen who has been molested or assaulted may show signs of physical pain in their genitalia or anus. Your teen may walk differently or demonstrate discomfort when sitting., A survivor of sexual abuse may internalize feelings of guilt or shame, which is why many sufferers never speak out about abuse. The aftermath of sexual abuse varies among victims, but many will experience intense bouts of depression and may even consider taking their own lives.Signs of depression in victims of sexual abuse may show up as withdrawing from loved ones, feeling sad or “blue”, making self-loathing statements, being exceptionally hard on themselves, experiencing changes in eating or sleeping habits, and having thoughts of suicide.It can also show up in ways you might not expect depression to present, such as rage, unexplained irritability, or aggressive behavior.
If your teen shows signs of depression, you need to get them to a mental health professional such as a psychologist or psychiatrist right away. If you think your teen is at risk of suicide, call a suicide hotline such as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK., Substance abuse is highly linked to the experience of sexual abuse. In an effort to numb self-blame, shame, or guilt, your teen may develop a problem with drugs or alcohol.


If you notice sudden changes in your teen’s social group, an increased need for money, theft or missing items in your household, decreased performance at school or work, and loss of interest in activities they once enjoyed, your teen may be using substances., Another prominent indicator of sexual abuse in adolescents is the onset of self-injury. If you have recently discovered your child has been burning, scratching, cutting or engaging in some other form of self-injury, you need to get them help as soon as possible.Self-injury is incredibly common in teens with depression or other psychiatric illness. Self-harm alone may not necessarily point to sexual abuse, but when coupled with other signs it’s a strong indicator for abuse.

Check for inappropriate behavior according to their age.,
Identify poor self-esteem.,
Spot signs of malnutrition or untreated illness.,
Notice poor hygiene and dress.,
Identify behavioral or academic problems.",How to Tell if Your Teen Is Being Abused3," In addition to physical and sexual abuse, you might also be concerned that your teen is being emotionally abused or neglected by a caregiver. One of the most common hallmarks of this type of treatment is a teen who acts inappropriate for their development.


For example, a 13-year-old may have to help younger siblings with homework or get them ready for bed because the caregiver is absent/disengaged. A teen may have to cook meals for younger siblings, walk them to school or sacrifice their own leisure time to act as the “grown-up.”
However, teens who are emotionally abused may also act childish in comparison to others their age. Because the child does not receive attention or affection from their caregiver, they may act out in tantrums or suck their thumbs like a much younger child., Teens who suffer from emotional abuse often feel worthless and lack self-confidence. The abuser may call them names, belittle them, or treat them like they’re nothing. Over time, the teen has grown to internalize the abuse and starts to think less of themselves, too.


Emotionally abused teens may be slow to join in on social activities, appearing withdrawn or disinterested. You might notice your teen saying things like, “I’m a loser,” or “Nobody likes me,” which indicates low self-esteem.Your teen might also drop out of the activities they once enjoyed. They may withdraw from friends and social activities they used to love.

, A clear indicator of neglect is a teen who is persistently sick or appears underweight. Because neglected children may not receive adequate food, hygiene or healthcare, they may get sick more often and have a harder time getting better after illness., Teens who are neglected may also appear disheveled and unclean. They may demonstrate poor hygiene with overgrown nails, unkempt hair, and oversized or too tight clothing.


Neglected teens may also dress unsuitably for the weather. For example, they may not wear a jacket in the winter., Both emotional abuse and neglect may also manifest in a teen’s school performance and behavior. A teen who was once a stellar student may lose interest in school, be consistently tardy, or suffer from failing grades. The teen may start hanging with an unsavory crowd, get into fights, or even start skipping school."
"
Call for help if your teen is in immediate danger.,
Encourage them to speak up.,
Get them to a safe place.,
Connect them with appropriate mental health services.",How to Tell if Your Teen Is Being Abused4," If you suspect that your teen is in harm’s way due to physical or sexual abuse or neglect, you need to get appropriate help. It’s important for your teen to know that they have an ally, that they are not alone.


Get help by calling the Childhelp National Child Abuse Hotline at 1-800-4-A-CHILD. You can speak with a trained professional who can help you seek out resources in the community and get you and your teen necessary assistance., Beyond noticing the warning signs of abuse, you need to offer your teen a safe place to receive advice and comfort. Many victims of abuse fear speaking out because they worry the abuser will punish them. Validate your teen’s feelings, but also remind them that speaking up can help them get the help they need.


You might say, “I know you don’t want to talk about the sexual assault. But, if you don’t use your voice, this person might get away. I will go with you to the police station to seek help if you wish.”
This will be easier if you have already established open lines of communication between you and your teen, allowing them to feel comfortable to approach you. Try to talk regularly with your teen about their lives, interests, schoolwork, and friends. This lets them know you are interested in their wellbeing and you are someone they can talk to.
Remember, too, that your teen may feel ashamed, and they may not want to share every detail with you, or even have you present when they speak to the police. Make sure you respect their timeline and allow them to talk with you at their own pace.

, Experiencing abuse can have resounding effects on your teen’s future development and relationships. The only way to minimize this damage is to get your teen to safety as soon as possible. Your teen needs to know that you are an advocate and source of comfort.


If they are still in the household with the abuser, see if they can come live with you. If you both live with the abuser, try to stay with family or friends.
Work with the teen to choose the next steps together, so that they feel comfortable about the decision., Teen victims of abuse have to manage a plethora of difficult emotions. They may have trouble trusting caregivers, developing intimacy, or rebuilding self-esteem. See to it that your teen receives the necessary services they need to talk about the abuse and learn to cope with its effects.


Often a child abuse hotline will be able to provide you with a referral to local therapists and community resources to move forward after abuse."
"
Keep communication open with your teen.,
Make personal connections with them.,
Volunteer together.,
Watch movies with them like Blood Diamond, Tapped, and Black Gold.,
Engage your teen in reading with you.,
Watch very carefully and try to gauge your teen's self esteem.,
Encourage real, supportive, active listening.",How to Raise an Empathetic Teen," Get into the habit of asking them how their day was and also making sure they ask you how yours was. Be a parent, but also be a human being and share some of your appropriate woes with your teen so they get used to the idea that they are not the only people on the planet with issues and their parents are human beings too.
, When your teen shares their problems with you, they are likely going to be things you have gone through yourself at that age. Try to connect to that time and place in your life and share your experience with your teen, but focusing on them. Let them know just enough so they understand they are not alone. That it is part of growing up.

That you can just be there for them without judging because you know what are going through first hand and then just listen and support, without judgement...even if you want to scream, ""What on earth were you thinking?"" or ""Don't worry; every teen goes through this!"" One is judgmental and will make your teen close off. The other is placating and unhelpful. You want to connect with your teen because nothing makes people feel better and learn better when they feel truly deeply connected with another human being.

, Try to find some time, even if it is one hour a month where you and your teen can go together to volunteer somewhere at a shelter, or food bank, or any other place where they can see what other's go through and have a chance to forge connections with them and observe that everyone has problems of various kinds and they are not alone. Encourage them to sit and really listen rather than try too hard to cheer people up first. Encourage them to share some tough issues they have had too with strangers even so they see that people are just people and it's good to listen and share with others., Movies that show how others around the world live and talk to them about how they feel about what they saw. Open their minds up beyond their teenage concerns. Teens are forming their personalities and images and are very protective and defensive at that age, but perhaps showing them what other people their age have to live through, or empowering them with information that can allow them to make a difference in the world with the choices they make will make them feel strong enough to shoulder another's burden as well., Choose books you can read together about the importance of empathy and self esteem and how they go together., People with low self esteem can often be in defense mode all the time and seem selfish because they are too busy protecting themselves to empathize with others. If you feel your teen has low self esteem, you need to address it. It may happen through heat to hearts, or you may need to seek counseling for your teen to help him or her develop a healthy self image. One where he or she feels empowered enough to lend an ear and a helping hand to others which will further build their self esteem and ability to be empathetic., Teach them how you can both help increase someone else's sense of self and belonging ,and your own through empathy, by just being there to listen to someone and being able to say to someone, ""What I need from you right now is just to be with me and listen.""

Make sure your teen knows empathy doesn't require you to solve other's problems or take over their burdens, but it means being present with that person and helping them just by listening, being there and simply asking ""What can I do for you?"" ""How can I help you?"" vs saying this like. 'Yeah man, that really sucks!"" or ""Well, at least....x, y or z."" because that is superficial sympathy. Empathy requires giving of your self through being present and helpful.

Explain that marriage is a big deal.,
Communicate concerns about things moving too fast.,
Make it clear that it isn't their partner you dislike, but the idea of them getting married so young.",How to Prevent Your Underage Child From Getting Married," In most states, your child will need your permission to marry before the age of 18, so one way to stop your child from marrying is to not sign the paperwork.;
, The higher the education your child receives, the less likely they are to want to enter into a marriage as a minor.


Foster your child's potential by offering incentives for good grades and perfect behavior.
Set the standard high for your expectations of your child, and be up front about your expectations for that child's future.

, Also take the opportunity to instill in your child a sense of self-worth.


Grow your child's self-esteem by praising and complimenting them.
Teach your child to work hard to hit goals. By working hard, they can strive to attain hopes and dreams.
Speak about your own successes and short comings, and share with your children what you wish you would have known when you were their age.

,


Relationships that have minors performing in sexual acts are dangerous to the minors both in the sense that they risk STDs and also that they put themselves at risk for a pregnancy that neither probably wants at that age.
Check out the abstinence programming through Planned Parenthood.
If your minor child does choose to be sexually active, you can discuss various birth control methods with them using the visual aid found through Planned Parenthood. An educational trip to Planned Parenthood may help them learn about the responsibilities and realities of safe sex.

, Marriage works best once both parties know how to take care of themselves. They should know how to be independent before they try to become interdependent. They should be old enough to have figured out what they want in life (in terms of career, lifestyle, and partner).


Mention that many people wait until sometime in their twenties to get married, and this is a good idea because they usually have a good sense of what they want and how to care for themselves.
If your child is disabled and can't be independent, then they should know how to live on their own with whatever level of disability services they need. They'll also need to work out how much their spouse can and will help them.

, Make ""I"" statements about your worries. It may help to focus less on the relationship itself (which they might think is criticism of their love), and more on practical challenges of marriage: managing a household, planning a wedding, staying organized together. Tell them that you'd be more comfortable if they took things one step at a time, so they didn't get overwhelmed.

, Explain that you want the best for them, and don't want them to jump in before they're ready. Encourage them to try staying engaged for a while, or live together.


Suggest a trial marriage. They can move into a mutually agreeable place, like a guest room or an apartment over the garage. They can see how well it works.

Learn the appeal of gangs.,
Investigate gang activity in your area.,
Familiarize yourself with the warning signs your teen is involved with a gang.",How to Prevent Your Teen from Joining a Gang1," There are many reasons why a teen might join a gang. Learning the potential draw of gangs for teens can help you identify if your teen is at risk.


Teens might seek out gangs for a feeling of belonging. If your teen feels like an outsider for any reason, he or she may seek out a gang for a sense of community.Peer pressure is also a major factor in teens joining gangs. If your teen has friends who are in a gang or associated with one, your teen may consider joining as well.Teens also don't always realize the danger of gangs. The idea of being part of a gang might be exciting, especially if your teen has been exposed to video games and other media that glorifies gang violence. If your teen has an underlying mental illness, such as a personality disorder, he or she might seek thrills through joining a gang.;
, Location is a big risk factor when it comes to your teen joining a gang. Be aware of any gang activity in your area so you know what your teen might be exposed to at school or in the community.


You can research gang activity in your area by browsing police reports and police data online. Most areas have a police blotter website where you can enter your zip code and see of any recent arrests or disturbances in your area.Talk to officials at your teen's school. Principals and superintendents should be aware if there is any gang activity occurring in their jurisdiction. Make an appointment with an official at the school and ask him or her about gang activity.
Many people feel certain locations make them immune to gangs. If you live in the suburbs, for example, you might think your teen is immune to gang violence. However, in a lot of big cities gangs eventually move into the suburbs. In the Chicago suburb Evanston, for example, gang activity has been on the rise in the last few years. Be vigilant about potential gang activity regardless of your location., Make sure you know the warnings signs regarding gang activity in teens. You should be concerned if your teen is displaying any of the following signs:

Describe your child using positive words.,
Teach your teen their voice matters.,
Help your teen express feelings.",How to Raise an Introverted Teenager1," The most important thing you can do as you raise your introverted teen is to accept them as they are. Don’t try to make them become extroverts or get them to be more outgoing. Accept their personality for what it is. This will help them develop a better sense of self.It is also important to validate your teen, so make sure that you tell your teen that it is normal to be introverted. For example, you might say something like, “Being an introvert is totally normal. There is nothing wrong with being an introvert.”
According to scientific studies, extroverts and introverts have different brain chemistries, which means their brains are hardwired differently. This means they are naturally and biologically made to be an introvert.;
, People may use negative or unflattering words to describe your child. You can rephrase these descriptions into something positive. This helps your child refrain from adopting negative labels and descriptions for themselves and instead create a healthy, positive image.You should also use positive words in your own mind when thinking about your child.
For example, if someone says your child is “standoffish,” you can say “reserved” or “careful.” If someone calls your child “timid,” you may say “quiet” or “contemplating.”

, Many times, introverted teens don’t feel like they have a voice or the ability to speak up. This means they may let people bully them or run over them. They also may not speak their mind when they do have an opinion. Teach your teen that their voice is important.If your teen is being bullied, help them learn how to speak to a trusted adult or to address the issue. You and your child may be able to come up with a phrase that can work, like, “Stop treating me this way” or “Do not speak to me like that.”
When your child speaks, listen to them. Ask questions and encourage them to talk to you. Make sure they know that you value their opinions and ideas.
Teaching your child to be more assertive may also help.

, Introverted teens may have trouble expressing their feelings or talking about what they are thinking. Because they focus on their inner self and keep things internalized, they may have trouble figuring out how to communicate their feelings. Help your child learn how to express their feelings.


Create an environment where they feel comfortable sharing their feelings. Don’t make them feel embarrassed or wrong for their feelings.
If your teen doesn’t want to share feelings or ideas verbally with you, try getting them to express themselves in other ways. Get them to write in a journal, create art, or play music to express their feelings. You may also encourage individual sports, like boxing or martial arts, to help them release frustration.

If your child is interested in science or computers, consider science and computer camps.

Help your child find other introverts.,
Encourage new experiences.,
Avoid forcing your teen to do things they don’t want to.,
Use technology to communicate.,
Allow your teen to prepare for new situations.",How to Raise an Introverted Teenager3," Just because your child is an introvert doesn’t mean they don’t want to have friends or socialize. They will probably do better becoming friends with other introverts than extroverts. Take your teen to places where they might meet other introverts, like library teen events, teen book clubs, or board game cafes.If your child has introverted friends already, make your home a safe space for them to interact without expecting them to be extroverted or going out of their comfort zone.
Ask your teen’s teachers or other parents if they know any introverted students who may be similar to your child.

, You should help your teen try new experiences even though they may be nervous. Do this slowly and gradually. Don’t force them to go somewhere they don’t want to, but also don’t let them miss all new experiences. Gently encourage them to do things, like go to a birthday party they were invited to. However, respect their limits if they refuse to do certain things.If your child is resistant to trying new things, talk to them about it. Tell them, “The way you feel about things is normal. However, you should try some new experiences. There’s nothing to worry about when you try something new. You may discover you like something you didn’t know you liked. If you don’t like it, then that’s okay. At least you tried.”
Reinforce the positive outcomes when your child takes a chance. For example, if your child goes to a party, say, “Even though you were hesitant, you went to the party and had a great time. You even made new friends.”
Give positive reinforcement when your child goes outside of their comfort zone and tries something. Say, “I’m proud that you tried that new activity. I know that was difficult for you.”, Many people try to force introverted kids to be extroverted. Introverts are sometimes passed over because they’re not as outgoing, or they are told they are wrong for being introverted. This leads to people trying to force them to socialize more, be more outgoing, and go out of their comfort zone. Try to avoid doing this with your child.Realize that your child has their own unique personality. Not everyone needs to be outgoing to be happy or fulfilled. Don’t make you teen do things they are uncomfortable with or act in ways they don’t want to.

Maintain an open line of communication.,
Initiate conversations about sexting.,
Understand your teen’s perspective.,
Establish time limits on device usage.,
Monitor computers and devices.,
Obtain monitoring software.,
Collect devices at teen gatherings.,
Offer your teen other activities.,
Speak with other parents and school officials.,
Learn about technology.,
Remind your teen that sexting is illegal.,
Explain non-legal consequences.,
Impose consequences for non-compliance.",How to Prevent Teens from Sexting," Keep an active interest in your teen’s life by encouraging open and honest conversations. This can help build mutual trust and may help you identify cases of sexting involving your teen.

, Because sexting is such a sensitive and possibly embarrassing topic for your teen, do not approach it in an accusatory or hostile manner. Start by talking about something else first and then transition into a conversation about your teen’s exposure to or involvement in sexting.

For example, you might want to ask “How is your biology class going? Have you learned anything cool lately?” Keep the conversation light to help relax your teen. Then you could say “did they talk to you at school about the recent sexting scandal?”
Make sure to weave into the conversation the reasons for how and why sexting is wrong.

, While it may seem obvious to you that sexting is wrong, your teen may not agree or not fully understand why. In an age where texts, e-mails, pictures, Tweets, blogs, and everything in between are constantly sent and received, the serious nature of sexting may be lost in the shuffle.In addition, she may be sexting as an impulsive behavior, because she is being blackmailed, or because she thinks it’s harmless flirting.

Being open to your teen at any time can do wonders with helping her trust and confide in you about possible sexting.For example, you can say, “I know a lot of kids are doing this and I really understand that it’s considered a normal part of being on social media, but I want you to understand that I’m looking out for your well-being right now and down the road.”
If you are monitoring your teen’s web usage, which is a significant part of most teens’ lives, it’s also important that you be honest with her about this so that she doesn’t feel unduly threatened. You could say “I’m putting this monitor on the computer to protect you from anyone that may be sending you or try to send you inappropriate material.”

, Consider setting time limits for Internet and cell phone use.

This may keep your teen from indulging in sexting for other types of online engagement.You may not feel your teen is not responsible enough for a smart phone with camera and Internet capability, so give her a basic cell phone on which she can make calls and send text messages without images. Be aware that this will make you unpopular with your teen, but allowing her to prove she can be responsible may help prevent her from sexting in the long run.
Your cellular and data provider may be able to set limits that your teen cannot control from your home. Ask the respective company if this is an option for you.
In some cases, you can set restrictions on certain apps and features on smart phones. Most smart phones have information on establishing restrictions readily available online., Place your family’s communal computers in a public area of your home, such as the living room or kitchen. Make sure your children know that you monitor their devices for what websites they are viewing, which may help prevent them from curiously looking up sexting or engaging in it online.

Know which social media sites your teen uses and have a policy about her online “friends” to show her not only that you care, but that you won’t tolerate any sexting or similar behaviors.Have a strategy for monitoring your teen’s devices. For example, you can tell your teen that you will check her device every day for browsing history and what text messages she’s sent.Make sure to check chat logs, emails, files, and social networking sites for inappropriate content from friends or strangers.Consider setting up your own social media profile, which may help deter sexting. This is one of the most effective ways at helping to control such behavior.Be aware that even if you are vigilant about monitoring your teen’s devices, she can still delete potentially problematic content.

, Install monitoring software on your teen’s and family devices which can track different types of content including images.

This may further deter your teen from sexting or inviting unwanted attention. You can get monitoring software from a variety of sources including:Commercially-available programs.
Your Internet provider.
Downloads from your computer or device.
Parental controls available on computers and devices.Use this software as often as you deem necessary or whenever you receive a warning message.

, Studies have shown that peer pressure, especially at parties, can contribute to sexting. Gathering the devices at parties or other events may help deter your teen and her friends from sexting or other suggestive behavior.

Realize that taking away devices may make you very unpopular with your child and may have consequences for her from her friends. Try offering alternatives such as giving them disposable cameras for fun.

, If your teen has a boyfriend, offer her other activities that can serve as an alternative to sexting. Introduce her to social media that can highlight her cooking skills or something that doesn’t objectify her. You could offer to take beautiful pictures of her that she can post or send to her friends or boyfriend.

Try and keep your teen active and engaged. Boredom may lead to increased web use, thereby creating temptation to take part in suggestive behaviors.
Don’t repress your teen’s natural curiosity about sex. Not talking to her about sex, sexting and their consequences may make her more likely to engage in these behaviors.

, Just as maintaining open communication with your teen is important, it’s also vital to stay in contact with other parents and school officials. This can alert you to potential problems and help your teen proactively deal with any negative situations.

Your school may have an alert system in place to inform parents about issues related to sexting.
Meeting your teen’s friends’ parents occasionally may also help you identify potential problems.

, One of the most effective ways to deter sexting and help your child recognize the potential consequences of it is to learn about the various technology kids are using. Consider exploring the Internet yourself or taking a class that may give you useful information.

You may want to keep your teen a part of your learning technology. Ask her to teach you about social media or other sites she uses frequently.
If you do “friend” your teen on social media, don’t be a nuisance by stalking her or maintaining a very visible presence. This may embarrass her and cause problems with her friends that are otherwise avoidable.

, As a part of openly communicating with your teen, emphasize that taking and sending nude pictures or videos of anyone can be a serious offense.

You may want to draw upon examples from the media or even have a lawyer or law enforcement officer speak to her to help her understand the gravity of sexting.In many sexting cases, teens have been convicted of felony charges for the production, possession or distribution of child pornography or pornography even if the person is over 18.Make sure your teen is aware that any person involved in sexting with her may be legally culpable for any images sent or received. This also includes you as the owner of the device., In addition to letting you teen know about possible legal action that can come as a result of sexting, make her aware that there are also other uncomfortable consequences of sexting. If she knows that her emotional health or reputation may be damaged, she may be less likely to sext.

Talk to you teen about the ways in which any person with whom she shares the photos could circulate or post what she thought was an innocent photo on the Internet. Tell her this could hurt and make her feel violated knowing that many people have seen the most intimate side of her.Tell her that sexting and possible circulation could severely damage her reputation or prevent her from getting a job or even getting into the college of her choice.
Advise your teen that if he is convicted of a sex crime, that his name may end up on the sexual offender registry for the rest of his life.Make your teen aware that sexting could also result in expulsion from school, sports teams, or other activities in which she participates., Make sure you teen knows that you will impose consequences for sexting if you catch her, even if there is no law enforcement involved. You can punish her through means such as confiscation of her cell phone or grounding.

You can forbid your teen from attending school activities or going out with friends, especially if they were involved in any sexting.
Keep the consequences commensurate with the infraction. For example, if your teen sent suggestive photos that don’t contain nudity, you could simply place restrictions on the phone. However, if the images border on pornographic, you may want to confiscate the phone altogether and ground her.
Make sure your teen understands why you’ve imposed the consequences you have and ways in which she can rebuild your trust.

This a stage children start forming perspectives in all matters. And it is based on limited knowledge with huge areas of ignorance and misconception. Determination to rebel against established practices is also often evident in adolescents. Handling them at this stage can be a tight rope walk for parents and this is a stage where many parents falter. Friction at this stage can create emotional scars which remains permanently etched in the memory of the child. Perceptions from these conflicts can influence behavior towards the parents during the later part of their lives, so it is important give a patient listening to the child’s views. Try to understand their viewpoint and gently guide them to a clearer understanding by pointing out fallacies or fallacious assumptions on the child's part.;
, The fault may be with one of the parent or both. There may be an ego problem. The best solution in such situations is for the parents to consult a psychiatrist and frankly explain him the position. The psychiatrist will decide whether it is the parents or the child or both who need counseling and take appropriate action to set right the situation.

, Listen to them and give them a feeling that you are giving a good listening to their views. Put special efforts to read and be up on the topics of interest to them like: movie gossip, latest fashion, trends, celebrities, electronic games. Discuss these with them as a friend. This will help remove inhibitions and make the children more comfortable coming out with their problems. This will also give them confidence that you are in tune with the current trend, so what you say will have more relevance.

, Participate in the discussion with their friends. Give a friendly poke wherever you feel you need to correct the direction. They will not mind it.

, Nurture the entrepreneur quality in the child, giving room for exploratory do-it-yourself behaviors that encourage individual cognitive styles and creative innovations. This an approach that may, in time, lead to more incisive thinkers who can be creative in their thinking throughout their career.

, Children in this age group usually develop attachment to careers and professions without full knowledge of the details for a particular career path or considering potential pit falls fully. It is the parent's responsibility to encourage the child to explore each career in detail. Together, you might list the pros and cons for a profession. Make it a game. You might try to come up with more pros than they list, for example. If, after examining all aspects of a profession and with full and complete understanding, the child insists on pursuing their chosen profession, then you should be supportive of that choice and work with them to ensure success.

, It is very important to correctly assess the monetary needs of your child and fulfill them. Your perspective of needs may be too conservative; their perspective may be too liberal in relation to actual needs. A middle of the road approach is needed, a compromise acceptable to both. Shortage of money may lead the child to make bad decisions on how to acquire money or possessions. An excess reinforces unwelcome spending habits. A child should habitually make a realistic budget and periodically review spending with an eye to conforming to their budget.

, There is nothing wrong about that. Always be supportive of your children, even if their choice of friends may upset you. Experimentation at this age is normal, perfectly normal. The parents need not get alarmed so long as the relationship stays within decent limits. With the passage of time the infatuation subsides and the child is back to normal. Always be attentive, especially when you suspect an unhealthy relationship. Be supportive of your child and make sure that they can always feel comfortable asking for advice.

, Smoking and drinking are consider vices by some families and habits by others. It is better to talk about these behaviors with your children. Tell them about your own experiences. Let them know that they don't need to start unhealthy behaviors just because their friends do. Offer to buy the cigarettes, but talk about the long-term health effects and let them know that their decision to smoke is an unwise lifestyle choice. Teach them how to drink properly. They should eat something first, but nothing sweet and they should not mix different types of drinks. Let them test their boundaries at home in safe surroundings so they know how much they can drink without getting out of control or becoming a danger to themselves or others.

, Certain parents exercise too much control over their children in the name of discipline. The children grow up in an atmosphere of fright and subservience. Such children often grow up with low self esteem and seldom become good leaders or decision makers. It is important for children to have respect for the parents but they should not be afraid of the parents.

Large stressors can include loss (such as a romantic breakup or a large fight with a friend), violence in the home, confusion about sexual orientation, being bullied, or being victim of physical or sexual violence.To an adult, a teen’s problems may appear minor. However, teens often have not developed skills to handle distress, which can make the distress feel much larger. A fight with a friend may feel like a much bigger deal to a teen.;
, Lots of factors can contribute to suicidal feelings, including situational, psychological, and social factors. Teens that have been diagnosed with a psychological disorder or disability (such as depression, anxiety, autism, or bipolar disorder) are at higher risk., Depression can manifest differently with kids and teens than adults. Teens may present as irritable, grumpy, or hostile. A teen may experience sudden explosions of anger and may feel more sensitive.Failing grades, withdrawal from social contact, and alcohol use can also signal depression.For more information about depression, check out How to Deal with Depression.

, While not every teen will respond the same way when debating suicide, there are some warning signs that can clue you in if a teen is thinking of suicide. Consider if you’ve noticed:Talking about death or dying
Seeking out means (obtaining a gun or pills)
Verbal hints (saying “I won’t bother you for much longer”)
Alcoholism or drug use
Changes in personality (sad, withdrawn, irritable)
Changes in behavior (sudden drop in grades, not wanting to be with friends)
Eating/sleeping habits (eating more or less than usual or sleeping more or less that usual)
Acting erratically
Believing things will never get better
If major changes have occurred in the teen’s behavior and now the teen is often hostile, angry, and negative, these changes may signal depression.

, If a teen has previously attempted or had thoughts of suicide, it can increase the likelihood of suicidal thoughts or re-attempting. Reflect on personal history and recognize any past history with suicide.This can include suicide attempts or talking about suicide.
Ask the teen if there have been times of feeling suicidal in the past. Be open to hearing, and listen as the teen talks. Ask about what feelings drive the thoughts of suicide. Reassure the teen that you support and love him.

, Some psychological risk factors can run in families, such as a family history of depression, psychiatric hospitalization, or suicide.

It does not mean that genetics cause suicidal feelings.

, If you are concerned about your teenager attempting suicide, make the home safe. Remove all firearms from the home and lock them somewhere safe where the teen cannot obtain them. Lock up any pills that could be used for overdose. You may even consider locking up kitchen knives. Keep the home as safe as possible., If a teen is feeling suicidal, you may need to be the voice of reason. Communicate clearly with the teen, and collaborate on creating a safety plan that ensures she will be safe during a certain time span. Creating a safety plan shows that you care, are invested in the teen’s life, and are creating boundaries around the crisis.Contract with the teen that she will not attempt suicide for the next 24 hours.
If the teen is feeling suicidal, have a trusted contact to call that will always respond.
Include the names and numbers of your medical doctor and therapist.
Enlist the help of friends or family members that can be available in an emergency.
Agree on some techniques or activities for the teen to engage in when feeling suicidal, such as relaxation techniques, listening to music, drawing, etc.
Know the nearest hospital to go if a crisis erupts and the teen must be cared for immediately.

Be there for the teen and be a support.If the teen is threatening suicide, take her to the emergency department at your local hospital. They will do a crisis evaluation, ensure the teen’s safety, and create a safety plan before letting her go home.

, A teen may feel embarrassed or ashamed of being suicidal. Don’t be afraid to ask how he is doing, ask about depression, or ask about suicide. You won’t be giving any ideas to the teen, but showing that you care. Showing that you are concerned can go a long ways in showing the teen that people do care and that you want to be a support.Approach your teen calmly at a neutral time and ask how he is doing. If he is shying away, mention that you are concerned about how he is doing, and that you would like to talk about the possibility of suicide. Be sincere and supportive, but let the teen know you are concerned.
It can be nerve-wracking to have these conversations, but know that you may be saving a life.

, Allow some space to grow between thoughts, feelings, and action. If you feel like you must go through with suicide, wait 24 hours. Having thoughts of suicide varies quite a bit from actually going through with suicide. Recognize the difference and allow some time., It may be easy to convince yourself that nobody cares or that nobody understands, but that is rarely the case. Talk to someone like a parent, aunt, friend, coach, or church leader that you feel safe around. Don’t worry about anyone judging you are shaming you; it’s important to be honest and enlist the help of someone who cares. Talking with someone can release some of the tension of holding suicidal feelings to yourself.If you are a friend to someone who is suicidal, provide a listening ear and stay supportive. If you are fearful a friend will go through with suicide, talk with a trusted and supportive adult who can help intervene. Don’t stay silent.

You cannot change the past, but choose to experience now. This can de-stress your body and your mind.Choose one sense and focus on it. You may choose to focus on listening. Listen to all the noises around you and recognize how much you tune out. Or tune in to your body and feel what it is like to have your feet on the ground, your back against a chair. Focus on your body and your senses as a way to calm yourself.

, You may feel like your mind is racing or you cannot keep your thoughts together. Or you may be in so much emotional pain that it feels like physical pain. Use relaxation to calm your mind and your body and allow stress to begin to melt.Take some deep breaths. Focus on the air coming into your body, then release it, feeling it leave your body. Breath slowly and methodically.
Relax your muscles. Notice any tension in your muscles (your back, your arms, or your neck) and release the tension. If you feel tense all over, tighten all of your muscles for three seconds, then release.

, If you’re struggling with a situation, know that the situation will pass. If you feel like your mental health problems are too much to handle, know that you can seek treatment. If you have a mental disorder, symptoms of depression, anxiety, bipolar, and schizophrenia can all be treated. Remember, when suicide feels like the only option, know that there are options you currently cannot see., For ongoing mental health problems, a therapist can be highly beneficial. Many people who experience thoughts of suicide struggle with depression. A therapist can help find coping strategies that work, address suicidal thoughts, and help work through depression symptoms.Keep in mind that there is nothing bad or wrong about seeing a therapist. Lots of adults and teens see a therapist, and it’s one way of contributing to a happier life.
For more information, check out How to Tell if You Need to See a Therapist.

, Make sure the teen has friends that are caring and supportive. If there are people in the teen’s life that will shame or embarrass the teen for feeling suicidal, encourage other friendships.Parents, listen to your teen and make time to talk (and listen). Show that you care and are invested in the teen’s health and well-being., Spend time with your teen, and give them the opportunity to open up to you. Validate their feelings and allow them to feel sad and cry; sometimes this is what they need. Examples of helpful things to say include:


""I'm here for you.""
""That sounds really difficult.""
""I care about you, and want to help.""
""I'm sorry to hear you're going through so much pain.""

, Parents can model to their teens ways to cope with distress. Engage in problem-solving skills, conflict resolution, and resolving problems in non-violent ways.If family life is difficult, consider engaging in family therapy, which can help families understand each other better and find solutions to problems more easily.

, People who feel suicidal may be experiencing distorted, highly negative thoughts. They may feel like no one loves them. You can remind them of the truth by being a little extra loving towards them. Offer hugs, tell them how much you love them, spend time with them, and do things for them to remind they they are loved.

, People suffering from mental health problems may begin to self-isolate, and may fall into a spiral of loneliness and inertia. Invite your teen to go out (for a walk, to a restaurant, to the movies, wherever) and spend time with you and others. A change of scenery, and spending time with others, can help keep them engaged with the rest of the world.


Expect to take initiative. Your teen may be too exhausted to start doing something themselves.
Don't force them to go out. Sometimes your teen just needs a little push to get going, and sometimes they really are too tired. Offer, but don't pressure.

, Engage the teen in healthy activities that allow the teen to feel at ease and happy. Engaging in fun activities can help ward off depression, create a social network, and can give a sense of purpose. Find a hobby like sewing, start practicing martial arts, or volunteer at an animal shelter.Keep trying new hobbies until the teen finds one that clicks. The teen may find out he loves hiking or painting or writing. Engaging in things you love will help create meaning in life.

Start off with a quick game.,
After the game, move the group to a relaxed, comfortable setting.,
Provide snacks or food.,
Pick an interesting, short Bible passage.,
Analyze the passage as a group.,
Relate the meaning of the passage to the life of a teenager, for instance choose ""just one"" of these: white lies, lying versus joking, word tricks and twisting words of others (use each one for another lesson/session).,
Ask open ended questions.,
Avoid ""yes/no"" questions, except when they are voting on the meaning or you're taking a poll.

,
Go around the group before praying at the end of class: Have everyone say one thing that they want to pray for -- also, about any answered prayer (testifying, similar to in court).

,
Keep a record by writing these prayer requests and results down.",How to Make Studying the Bible More Interesting for Young Teens," A game can wake everyone up and break the ice. The game doesn't even have to relate to the same topic as the Bible study; however, it can add a fun element to the lesson, if it does.


If you want to play a game that relates to the lesson, try to incorporate the main theme of the story topic into the game. For instance, if your Bible passage has to do with trusting God, consider doing Trust falls using ""spotters"" to push them back up for instance.
If you have enough space, play a large hide-and-seek-tag related game, like release or capture the flag.;
, Bean bags, couches, mats and cushions are great additions to a Bible study room. Your pupils will be able to concentrate more when they are comfortable.

, Apple slices in baggies could work. A large community bag/bowl of chips is easier than passing out snacks before you read the study passage. If the kids are too hungry, chances are their concentration levels will be lower. If you are playing games that involve walking/running around, make sure that the food is simple, not too messy, and easy on the stomach.


Depending on the time that your group meets, consider occasionally providing dinner for the class. Ask a different parent or guardian to bring an entrée once per month. Or, you could transport the students to a fast food restaurant as a celebration once every 3 months, if you have parent permission. Someone could bake a few frozen pizzas or bring takeout party tacos or wings. Provide a paper towel for each person. Pasta, such as ravioli, and simple salad make a great meal that almost everyone likes. Always remember to cater to the needs of any vegetarians and kids with food allergies, too.

, Say, ""Who wants to read the passage? If nobody volunteers, then I'll pick someone."" Pick someone!


Get attention: Never read the passage yourself, nobody will pay attention. If people are talking, get one of them to reread it aloud. If one of their peers is reading or talking to the group, chances are they will pay more attention.
""Accept"" it when they explain the passage. But, repeat each verse, one by one, and ask (and wait 5 seconds/count to 5) for a group member to say it in other words that the group can understand, call on someone, or ask why your purposely messed up explanation makes or does not make sense, if no member gives an answer.

, Pick a different person to summarize what the group just said, and ask whether anyone had any different understandings/interpretations. -- Do not comment negatively on their understandings or experiences.

, Ask whether they have ever gotten in trouble or been upset from results of a misstatement/misrepresentation (theirs or others'):


Sharing their real stories that come up during the lesson/discussing on the scripture or Bible story can be fun, and it can be tied in with the lesson and made to come ""full circle"" -- from the words -- to everyday life -- and connected back to the words of scriptures.
If you are reading a passage about lying, make this an opportunity to share stories about lies that the teens/kids told, and what the results were. -- Do not allow put-downs or cut-downs (mean comments) about each other's stories or interpretations of meanings.

, Let them use their experiences (ask and wait/count for 4 seconds -- to allow gears to turn), to make personalized connections about how God is revealed/real, in their daily lives, connected in the words of the Bible, so have someone read that part again to see how it fits either implied or directly, as you proceed in discussion.

,,, Take this very seriously (get someone who will ask for names to be repeated when necessary, and such, to get it right) -- and later, you or another parent can add it to the prayer journal. The group should bow their heads, and you should pray for all the things they suggested, using the notes of requests.


Allow the class members in coming weeks to tell about progress in these things and for answered prayers in the requests that were written down and other prayer results that they wish to relate.

Communicate.,
Always be there for them to talk to and ask advice of.,
Don't compare yourself and/or your teen in ways such as, ""Why can't we be more like ____?"",
Give your teen a break.,
Be clued in.,
Set down ground rules, and make sure they're obeyed.,
Punish bad behaviour, and make sure your punishment is effective.,
Reward good behaviour.,
Be fair.,
Be positive.",How to Parent a Teen," Many parents stop trying to keep a bond with their child after a few harsh words. The best way to keep your relationship is to continue trying to communicate with your teen. Don't give up if it doesn't usually work—once in a while it will. Be careful not to be pushy, though.;
, If your teen feels like they can come to you and that you'll always be behind them every step of the way, they're more likely to open up to you. This may sound stupid, but it will actually help. Not only will your relationship with your teen improve, but you are more likely to be aware of what they're up to and what's going on in their heads. So make sure you're supportive of your teen, and that you always seem approachable. Don't judge them, and don't lecture them for making mistakes. Mistakes are a huge part of life. ""Live and learn,"" is a very popular quote for a reason. Be supportive when they have made a mistake, and help them to see: the way out; the lesson in the mistake; how to avoid such mistakes in the future; the faulty thought process leading up to the poor choice; etc.

, Teens can't be perfect right now - they have a lot more to deal with than parents think. Teen years are very stressful, as teens have to find time to finish homework (so parents don't get mad at bad grades) while balancing social life. Teens have to deal with other things, too, such as living above the influence, not going out with ""bad"" people, and dealing with gossip. The list goes on and on.

, Once in a while, your teen might get a little out of control, causing yelling or having an argument with you. Some times your teen doing this to protect himself. For example: if you think s/he is doing something wrong and you give a huge lecture about it, its only of the teenage nature to be defensive and non-admitting to it. No one (even parents) likes to be wrong about things. Other times s/he may be trying to talk to you. Its hard to communicate with a parent who is constantly yelling. Some times s/he may say things like, ""You don't understand,"" because it really does feel that way. Try to find a friend or someone else your teen can talk to if that happens.

, If you're easy to lie to and trick, teens are going to take advantage of you. Also, if you have no idea of what's going on in your teen's life, big changes could be happening and you'll have no idea, so be clued in. Make sure you always know where your teen is, and that they are actually where they say they are. Know who they hang around with, know what sports teams and clubs they're a part of. Don't let yourself be tricked. And don't let yourself be lied to-don't accept everything that comes out of your teens' mouth. Some parents may think their teenagers would never lie to them, but you'd be surprised.

, If you just start making up rules every five seconds, your teen is going to be confused and things will get out of hand. So come up with your basic rules and conditions, and clearly explain them to your teen. Make sure your teen obeys them. If they have to do their homework before going anywhere, make sure that actually happens. Don't be a softy -- be strict but fair with the rules.

, If you punish your teen by taking away their stereo when they have an iPod they can take everywhere with them, things aren't going to work out too well. Confiscate things that you know they only have one of. Take away privileges. Make sure you master the art of punishments-don't ground your teen for half a year for forgetting to do their chores. At the same time, don't ban TV for a week if they've vandalized someone's house. Make sure your punishments fit the ""crimes"".

, If your teen improves really well on a subject, treat them. If they do something good without being asked, reward them. You don't have to go out and buy them a car for every good thing they do, obviously, but if your teen does something really good, then treat them. Let them have a party if they usually aren't allowed to-that kind of thing. If it's a smaller thing, you may not want to do anything big, but make sure you praise them. A few rewards go a long way.

, If you're a fair parent, your teen is more likely to obey your rules. Make sure that you always make fair rules, and always take their side of the story into consideration. Don't automatically assume they've done wrong, and don't unfairly punish them. If you're fair, your teen's behaviour will probably be better. However, don't let them push you.

, Instead of telling your teen, ""You aren't doing a good enough job,"" or, ""I expect better of you,"" try saying something like, ""I like that you did that but ______."" Telling your teen that s/he isn't good enough or things like that not only damages his/her self esteem but makes him/her even more stressed and mad. Compliments help greatly.

Notice if your teen’s academic performance declines.,
Keep an eye on your teen’s social life.,
Be on the lookout for physical complaints.,
Notice your teen’s sleeping habits.,
Ask yourself if your teen has been acting out lately.",How to Know if Your Teen Is Stressed1," Poor grades and a sharp decline in interest in things they used to enjoy are strong warning signs of stress in teenagers. This is especially true if your child usually makes good grades.Stress can sap a teen’s motivation and make it difficult for them to concentrate, both of which can lead to worse academic performance.
However, there are other reasons your teen's grades could be slipping, such as too many obligations like work or extracurriculars, problems with bullying, or intellectual issues such as an undiagnosed learning disorder.;
, Withdrawal can be a warning sign for stress. If your teen avoids spending time around family members or no longer wants to see their friends, they may be feeling stressed out.You might notice that they want to be in their room all of the time.
Other abrupt changes in socializing habits, such as abandoning old friends for a new group, can also signal that a teen is under stress.
Changes in your teen's social life could also be caused by bullying, so ask questions to see what the root of any changes could mean. You might ask, ""I notice you never hang out with Billy anymore. What happened between you two?""

, Stress can take a toll physically as well as mentally. If your teen gets sick frequently or often complains about headaches or stomachaches, consider whether stress could be the cause.Watch for significant weight loss or gain, changes in appetite, or fatigue and lethargy.
If your teen frequently says they don’t feel well, take them to the doctor first to rule out other possible causes.

, When a teenager is under chronic stress, their sleeping habits are often the first thing to change. Notice whether your child is staying up later than usual or whether they mention having a hard time sleeping at night.You may also notice that your teen is sleeping all weekend, getting to school late, or going to bed soon after returning home from school.


Teens need more sleep than adults. On average, they require 9 ¼ hours of shut-eye every night.Not getting enough sleep can reduce teens’ ability to cope with stress, making the problem worse.
Again, there are other possible causes to be on the lookout for pertaining to your teen's sleeping patterns. Use of drugs or alcohol or an undiagnosed mental illness like depression or anxiety could also influence how much they are sleeping.

, Stress can cause many types of uncharacteristic behavior in teens. If your teen has been acting overly sensitive and emotional, or if they seem angry or defiant, it might be an indication of stress.If your teen is having a hard time managing their behavior, particularly if they are hurting themselves or threatening to hurt others, seek counseling or another type of professional intervention for them. Stress could be the cause, but there could also be an underlying issue at play.

Be clear about your intentions.,
Ensure that the meeting with the teen is in a neutral place away from the teen's usual environment (unless the teen requests to meet somewhere of their choosing).,
When engaging the teen it helps to come across as being energetic and interested.,
Listen more than you talk.,
Be mindful of your facial expression and body posture.,
Provide appropriate feedback.,
Identify the root cause.,
Know what is best.,
Practice caution.,
Offer positive encouragement.",How to Mentor Teens," Ask yourself why you would like to fill that particular role as a ""mentor"" to young people. Also you should ask yourself if you can commit to this for the long term. (Do you have the energy/passion and free time?) Remember that to be a mentor there has to be trust and there can be no trust without a sort of relationship between the ""mentor"" and the teenager and that takes time to build.;
, This way you get to control the type of atmosphere that the teen will be exposed to. This is very important as teenagers often adapt to the atmosphere of a place more easily than an adult would. A place with open space that's quiet is great as it promotes relaxation (encouraging the teen to talk more freely).

, Ask the teen how he/she is doing/feeling and inquire about what has been happening in their lives. The goal is to get them talking without their psychological ""protective walls"" in place.

, Pay close attention to key words that they might use in their sentences that would indicate strong feelings or intent. Never interrupt them while they are talking, let them say all that they wanted to say before commenting or asking questions.

, If you seem distracted or uncomfortable, they will notice and negative feelings/thoughts will cause them to think that you do not really want to be there.

, After you are satisfied that the teen has expressed his/herself fully, think about the key words and facts that were mentioned. Ask the teen what he/she's desired outcome would be in their current predicament. (how do they want their situation to end). Focus on what the teen really wants to talk about. Try to relate to those points and use your experience to guide the teen in a safe direction towards their desired goal.

, Some issues will be easy for most adult to relate to and offer good positive advice like how to choose a good career or relationship problems, etc. However, there might be something far worse happening in the teen's life. These are issues like abuse, drug/alcohol addiction, suicide thoughts etc.

, In cases such as those mentioned above, this article strongly suggests that the reader (mentor) encourage professional help. The best things for a ""mentor"" to do in these situations are to listen and show the teen that you (the mentor) can be trusted with the information that is shared. Pay close attention to detail in the conversations as it might be of help later on. Try to guide the teen into deciding to seek professional help and pledge your support (if possible) for the duration of those sessions.

, Be careful not to get too involved in the situation. There is a fine line between offering advice and telling someone what to do. As a ""mentor"" you cannot be the ""judge"". Most of the time it is not as simple as right or wrong. This article encourages the ""mentor"" to engage in conversation in an attempt to fist clarify and simplify the problem/challenge and then assist the teen in helping them to find the right answer themselves while bestowing trust and encouragement trust of the teen's ability to reach the desired outcome.

, When the conversation is at an end and the time has come to go separate ways, try encouraging them by stating how wonderful it was to be in their conversation and let them know that you believe in them, trust them to make positive choices in their own life and remind them of the strong good person that you see in them. This will give them the motivation they need to start positive change in their life.

Strive for empathy.,

Learn what is important to your teenager.,
Look for signs of depression.,
Look for signs of anxiety.,

Allow small failures.,
Let your teenager state his own goals.,

Limit arguing and lecturing.,
Make things fun.",How to Motivate Teenagers," In order to motivate your teenager, you must develop a relationship of trust. To do so, strive to empathize with your teenager's emotions, needs, wants, and goals.


There are two types of empathy: affective and cognitive. Affective empathy is based in feelings, experiencing an emotional response in regards to someone else's situation. Cognitive empathy is based on facts, objectively understanding the reality of another person's situation. This is the type of empathy you should strive for with your teenager. You want to understand where he is coming from and what road blocks are keeping him from success and motivation.In order to effectively empathize with your teen, you need to communicate with him. Practice active listening. When your teen talks, listen to what he has to say without judgment and without offering advice. When it's your turn to speak, simply reiterate what he has said in your own words to show you are listening and trying to understand.To start, do not be reactive when your teen issues a complaint. Before correcting him or offering him your own insight, respond by asking him to clarify his feelings so you can understand. For example, say your teenager comes home in a bad mood and says, ""My basketball coach hates me."" Instead of immediately correcting him by saying something like, ""I'm sure your coach doesn't hate you,"" push for elaboration. Say something like, ""Why do you feel that way?""
Empathy is important to building a relationship with your teenager. You want him to feel like he is understand and that he can talk to you about any problems. Oftentimes, a lack of motivation is rooted in issues with self-esteem or anxiety. A teenager who feels he's able to communicate with his parents and older relatives is more likely to reveal these kinds or problems. If you know your teenager is high stress or feels bad about himself, you can effectively intervene.;
, While you may think pressuring your teen to succeed is helpful to assuring a positive future, this technique often backfires. Teenagers fail to learn how to self-motivate and fall behind later in life.


Pushing your teenager to succeed, and putting a lot of focus on his performance in a variety of fields, means you serve as the primary motivator for your teen. Your teenager fails to learn how to develop self-motivation, judgment, and autonomous thinking. These are skills your teen will need later in life for success.Also, high pressure can lead to excessive stress. Many teens underperform or underachieve due to high stress or anxiety over success. If fear of failure is high, a teen might think it's easier to simply not try at all., Teenagers need to be autonomous to a degree in order to properly motivated. Understand what's important to your teenager and what his own goals, dreams, and ambitions are.


Few teens are 100% unmotivated. If you think your teenager is underachieving, chances are he simply lacks motivation in fields that you value. For example, if you come from a long line of doctors and your teenager is pulling a C-average in chemistry, you may label him as unmotivated. However, look at his other grades. Is doing well in art, English, history? Maybe chemistry simply isn't that important to him. He may be very motivated, just not in the directions you would like.
Rather than berating your teen about the areas where they lack motivation, talk to him about the areas where he seems most motivated. Ask your teenager, ""Why are you so dedicated to reading?"" He might respond that he loves books and hopes to study English in college. You can help motivate him in other areas by telling him getting into a good school requires a high overall GPA, so even if he's not as interested in his algebra course it might benefit him longterm to channel some of his motivation for literature into math.

, Lack of motivation is a common cause of depression. With all the hormonal and chemical changes going on in your teenager's body, it's possible to sometimes overlook signs of a bigger issue. All teens act out occasionally, but depression is more sustained and severe. Depressed teens are likely to experience irritability and anger, unexplained aches and pains, and sensitivity to criticism, as well as other signs. If you notice these or any of the following, talk to your teen about seeing a mental health professional (or at least your physician):Feelings of sadness or hopelessness
Feelings of worthlessness or like a ""failure""
Frequent tearfulness or crying, mood swings
Withdrawal from friends and activities he used to enjoy
Lack of enthusiasm, motivation, or willpower
Changes to sleep and eating habits
Fatigue, exhaustion, or lack of energy
Trouble concentrating
Thoughts or feelings of self-harm

, Anxiety is another common culprit of lack of motivation in the teenage years. Teens are likely to show some signs of anxiety because of the many pressures they're under, but be on the lookout for signs of more severe anxiety, such as poor school performance, missing school, and withdrawing from social interactions. These can be signs of Generalized anxiety disorder.If your teen displays these signs or any of the following, see your physician or mental health professional:Persistent worry about concerns that are out of proportion to their importance or impact
Trouble ""letting go"" of worry
Inability to relax or rest, feeling ""keyed up
Bodily symptoms like shaking, sweating, headaches, or nausea
Fatigue or exhaustion
Dizziness or lightheadedness
Shortness of breath
Trouble concentrating or making decisions

, Remember, while it's important to let your teenager make mistakes, at some point you may need to step in. If your teen is consistently not keeping up in school, there may be an underlying psychological issue at play. Think about when you first noticed the symptoms, and how long they have been going on. You can also talk with your physician or pediatrician to help you determine whether you have cause or concern.


If your teenager seems chronically unable to concentrate, make an appointment with a psychiatrist to see if he has Attention Deficit Disorder or some kind of learning disability.

, Protecting a teenager from failures by constantly forcing him to do his homework or to study means he'll lack self-motivation long term. Allowing for the occasional small failure can help your teen become more motivated.


Think of your teen's adolescence as a narrative. The small stories that go into that narrative, such as one test or one essay, are merely part of a larger, evolving story. If your teenager gets a ""D"" on a chemistry quiz, for example, that may seem like a disaster. However, look to the bigger picture. Maybe this failure will motivate him to work harder in the class, which will result in him getting a high grade on the actual test.While it's important to encourage good study skills in your teenager, you have to eventually step down a bit and let him make his own decisions. At first, he may forgo his homework to watch YouTube videos but if he begins to see the consequences of his actions he'll eventually learn to push himself., Your teenager will not learn much about motivation if you are always holding the reins. While you can guide your teen to make good decisions, allow him to set his own goals independent of your wants.


Motivation requires moving toward something. Your teenager needs to feel like he's moving in the direction of a known outcome. The best thing you can do to motivate your teenager is help him figure out what he wants for himself.Ask him to consider his personal values and how he envisions these in his life.For example, perhaps both of you value Achievement, but define these differently. Perhaps your idea of achievement is a high GPA, where his is doing well on his sports team. See where you can find common ground before you encourage him to think about things that you want for him.
Avoid putting additional pressure on your teen by saying things that emphasize performance over process, such as ""Don't you want to get into a good college?"" Saying things like this is unlikely to help motivation or performance. Instead, focus on learning and development as a process, not a single goal. This will allow you to contextualize roadblocks and mistakes as part of the process, not as ""failures.""

, If your teen gets a poor grade on a test, do not berate him. Instead, ask him questions. What do you think happened to cause this? Did you have enough time to study? Did you feel like you understood the questions? Did you get nervous during the test? Often, teenagers feel demotivated when they do poorly in school, but they may not realize why they're doing poorly.


Know what is actually important to your teenager. If your teenager says ""I hate chemistry,"" for example, you do not need to correct him by saying, ""No, you don't."" Everyone has subjects that come more naturally to them, and it's okay to lack interest in one area. However, try to help your teenager learn to succeed despite reservations and help him see how getting a decent grade in a subject he dislikes can help him long term. Say something like, ""I understand you dislike chemistry, but how can I help you succeed so you can survive it?"" Often, teenagers will say they ""hate"" a subject because they don't understand it. Ask questions about what your teen hates. This will help you determine whether something like tutoring or even extra help with homework could be helpful.

, Teenagers often have trouble remembering, simply because of how their brains are wired. Occasionally reminding your teen of a deadline or important date can be helpful.


Between school, extracurriculars, and a social life teenagers have a lot to keep track of. They may occasionally forget certain obligations and might need some extra help staying on track.Visual aids, like charts and calendars, can be helpful. Establishing certain routines, like having quiet time during certain hours of the day for homework, can also help your teen stay on task.Constant verbal reminders can come off nagging. As many teens have a rebellious streak, they may resent being told what to do. It's better to use visual clues and establish routines, teaching by showing rather than telling., Remember, the most important ways to motivate teens is to help them develop a sense of personal responsibility. Setting external rewards or punishments means consequences come from an external source and not from an inner sense of achievement.


Using money, food, or increased freedom in exchange for performance is a bad idea. Do not tell your teen that if he keeps his grades up, he can go on the end of summer camping trip with his friends. This is a short term goal that blocks his ability to see the benefits of academic success long term.Do not use fear as a motivational tool. Oftentimes, parents try to scare their teens by telling them certain behaviors will land them in trouble and compromise their future. While a teen should understand behaviors have consequences, scare tactics only increase anxiety. This can affect your teen's ability to live up to his potential.Encourage your teen to make his own choices. Explain, objectively, what the consequences of certain behaviors might be long term and allow him to make an informed choice on his own., Being over-scheduled or overcommitted are major problems for modern teenagers. Oftentimes, a teen will resist beginning or completing a task due to too much stress.


Allow your teenager to decide on his own what commitments are truly important to him. If he's overdone it on after school activities, for example, there's nothing wrong with allowing him to cut back a bit. Loosening up a schedule can allow the flexibility to help your teen stay motivated in regards to what's really important to him.
Help your child break down what he needs to do into manageable chunks. This can help combat stress. Say your child has five things to do that day. Break down those five tasks into individual components and help him make a schedule to complete the tasks in order of their importance.

, Arguing with a teen, or excessive lecturing, often does not pay off. It only increases tension in your household, which can distract your teen and lessen his motivation.


Remember, most people are only willing to listen to advice when they request advice. Your teenager is no different. Rather than repeatedly telling him what he should be doing, wait until he comes to you with a problem. You can also give him the opportunity to ask your for advice. If he seems to be struggling staying on task, say something like, ""I see you're having trouble with this subject in school. Is there anything I can do?""Arguments are an inevitable part of any relationship, including your relationship with your teenager. However, you can minimize arguments by taking a break from conversations when things get heated and giving you both a time to cool down., Most people, not just teenagers, find it easier to engage in an activity if it is fun. Finding a way to make work and school enjoyable for your teen can help him stay motivated.


Teenage boys especially respond to competition. Encouraging him to get involved with team sports might help him learn about teamwork, motivation, and self-reliance.If there's a video game, television show, or movie that can be educational, see if you can get your teen to watch or play it.Try to get a sense of what your teen enjoys and build fun activities around their personal interests, goals, and ambitions."

See if your teen is overwhelmed with academics.,
Consider whether your home life could be taking a toll on your teen.,
Think about any recent situational changes.,
Look closely at their relationships.,
Consider whether your teen may be involved with drugs or alcohol.,
Watch for signs of a mental health issue.",How to Know if Your Teen Is Stressed2," As a parent, it can be hard to distinguish between challenges that are helping your child grow and those that are merely wearing on their health. School is one of the primary sources for stress in teens, and, oftentimes, parents don't help with matters.Listen for complaining or signs of overwhelm in your teen. If they say something like ""I don't know how I will get all this work done over the weekend,"" try to help rather than responding ""Oh, you're doing well. Keep up the hard work."" Your nudging could be adding to the stress, and this type of comment may also come across as dismissive.
Instead, see if your child is taking on too much like college-level classes or various club and organizations responsibilities. They may need to cut back or seek guidance on managing their academic work better.
You may also consider talking with other parents who have teens around the same age to get an idea of what is “normal.”

, Many parents don't realize the impact environment can have on a teen's mental health and well-being. Take an honest assessment of your home life to see if there are any factors that could be adding undue stress on your child.For example, if you or your spouse were just recently fired from your job, your teen could be worried about how the family will make ends meet. Or, if a parent is struggling with a mental illness or substance abuse problem, your teen could be negatively affected as well.

, Seemingly minor circumstances in your teen's personal life could also contribute to stress. If you are seeing signs of stress, reflect on the previous days or weeks. Has there been any upset in your teen's life? Maybe you thought it was small, but it could be having a major impact on your teen's functioning.


For example, maybe your daughter was really excited about trying out for the cheerleading squad. However, after try-outs, she learned that she didn't make the squad. She may have minimized the issue in front of you, but not achieving this goal could be affecting her more than she is letting on., Teenagers are at the point in life when relationships such as romantic connections and friendships become more important than previous years. A recent change in a relationship could foreshadow major stress down the road.For instance, if your teen son was dumped by his first girlfriend, it could have a negative impact on his ability to focus in school and cause him to have trouble sleeping. Don't shrug the matter off as ""puppy love."" To him, it was important, and the consequences are affecting him even if he doesn't say so.

, The teenage years are a common time for teens to begin experimenting with drugs and alcohol. Pay attention to any signs that your teen may be using drugs. Sincere there are many different types of drugs, there are many different signs to watch for.


Talk to your teen if you suspect that they might be using drugs or alcohol.

, Teenagers may suffer from depression and other mental health issues just like adults. If you notice that your teen has been withdrawing more than usual, seems sad, or has lost interest in things that they used to enjoy, then they might be suffering from depression or another mental health issue.

Talk with your teen and take them to see a therapist if they express that they have been struggling with depression, anxiety, or other mental health issues.

Check in regularly with your teen.,
Practice active listening with your teen.,
Encourage your teen to express their feelings.",How to Know if Your Teen Is Stressed3," Having regular conversations can help you stay clued in to what’s going on in your teen’s life. Make a habit of asking your teen how their day went or what they’re working on at school.Be sure to share about your own life too, as long as it is age-appropriate. This can help to build trust between you.


If your teen is used to talking with you, they’ll be more likely to tell you when they’re having a hard time.
Scheduling regular family activities, like exercising or cooking meals together, can provide a good time to talk with your teen about what’s going on in their life.

, Your teen will be more likely to share their thoughts and feelings with you if they feel like you’re actually interested in what they have to say. Pay attention when your child talks to you and avoid interrupting them. Focus on understanding them instead of judging what they say., Finding social support is one of the best ways to battle stress. Tell your teen that feeling stressed now and then is normal, and emphasize that they can come to you for support if they need it. Be on the lookout for ways your teen may be expressing stress already. Do they frequently say things like “I’m never going to get all this done” or “I can’t keep up with everything”? Phrases like these are usually giveaways of stress.
Leading by example is also a good strategy. Try saying out loud when you feel stressed and say what you are going to do about it.

Model healthy behaviors.,
Help your teen adjust their schedule.,
Encourage your teen to exercise.,
Help your teen get enough sleep.,
Seek professional help.",How to Know if Your Teen Is Stressed4," Your teenager might not always want to admit it, but they still look up to you. If you demonstrate positive ways to cope with stress, they’ll probably adopt these coping strategies too. Practice healthy behaviors like eating a balanced diet, making time for sleep, getting regular exercise, and working relaxation into your day.Avoid coping with your own stress by smoking cigarettes, drinking alcohol, or using drugs. Your teenager may start doing the same things.
Make sure to model good problem solving skills as well.

, Overscheduling is a common source of stress in teens. If your child is having a hard time getting everything done, help them look over their schedule and see if they can cut any activities out.If your teen regularly tries to pack their schedule too full, make some rules about how many activities they can participate in.

, Exercise is a potent stress reliever, but many teens don’t take advantage of its benefits. Encourage your child to play a sport, take up running, or just work more walking into their day.If your teen doesn’t like to exercise, make it a family activity by suggesting that you start walking or going to the gym together.
One good way to get your teen to exercise more is to limit their screen time.

, Sleep is essential for managing stress. Teens need between 9 and 9 ½ hours of sleep every night, so make sure they have a quiet environment that’s conducive to a good night’s rest.If your teen has trouble falling asleep, help them create a bedtime routine to wind down and relax. Suggest that they stop using electronics at least an hour before bed and read a book, write in a journal, or do another soothing activity instead. If you are met with resistance on using electronics before bedtime, then you may need to make it a rule.

, If despite your best efforts your teen continues to experience the symptoms of stress, they may need to see a professional mental health therapist. A therapist can serve as an unbiased person who your teen can talk to about matters that they may not feel as comfortable sharing with a parent. In addition, a therapist can teach your teen relaxation techniques and problem-solving skills to better cope with stress now and in the future.Contact the guidance counselor at your teen's school for help, or reach out to your family doctor for a mental health referral.

Check more than just the forehead.,
See what's their reaction to school or activities.,
Determine their homework status.,
Find out what they are doing when you come home, or when you see them.,
Figure out how long they have been 'sick'.,
Know your teen's history with sickness.,
Be up to date on any viruses going around the school.,
If they have a fever for longer than a week, take them to the doctor.",How to Know if Your Teen Is Faking Sick," This is a common mistake. However, the Internet is flooded with ways for teens to unnaturally heat up their foreheads- even wikiHow has them! Try the neck or stomach. That'll catch them off guard.;
, Teens usually won't complain about skipping school if they're sick, although they might grumble a bit. If they really are sick, they'll be feeling awful. All they want to do is stay home and rest, even if they do actually love school. Their reaction should be a kind of ""meh- okay"" response. They shouldn't fight insistently- that probably means they're faking.

, Are they faking illness just so that they can skip school and finish homework? Most teens will have already finished their homework because they don't expect to skip school the next day. You have to be careful though- some students develop their sicknesses from staying up too late (which might lead to them not finishing homework), and so that might be the very reason they are sick the next morning.

, If you answered ""laughing along to an online video"", ""jumping up and down hysterically while watching TV"", or ""practicing their dance routine"", you probably have a faker on your hands. A sick teen should be sleeping, reading, drawing, watching TV on the couch, or doing something similar. Anything physical is out of the question. In fact, if you don't sometimes find them asleep when you return, they might be faking. A sick body needs more rest than a normal one.

, When did they start complaining? Although young people sometimes get sick overnight, it usually takes a while for a real ailment to develop. Some time over the weekend or a day or two before your teen skips school, they should complain of typical cold symptoms like stuffy nose, itchy throat, nausea, etc. That can develop into a fever or strep throat, or another skip-school-abling sickness. They might still get the sickness overnight, but that is unlikely.

, Do they normally get sick often? This doesn't necessarily mean they are diseased- unless they're getting sick something like three/four times a month (either take them to ER, or they are definitely faking)- sometimes they are just more vulnerable to small illnesses, or they are around a lot more people. Maybe they don't wash their hands, or ignore other common hygiene practices. Keep in mind that viruses don't follow routines, so it's completely believable if your teen doesn't pick anything up for a year, and suddenly they get sick two months in a row. It's called flu season for a reason.

, Look for little hints. If half of your teen's English class was out sick last week, chances are the stuffy-nosed child you see in front of you isn't faking. Did your fever-ridden uncle come to visit the family over the weekend? There's your answer. However it's important to be careful with this. You don't where or how your teen got the virus, so this just raises the probability.

, If they don't confess to a faked illness, and they don't complain the whole ride there, then you should be worried. If the doctor finds that there is no fever, you have the best faker in the world on your hands. If he does, you made the right decision by consulting the doctor. Either way, don't take this lightly. If your teen shows no sign of getting better, it's dangerous.

Teach them what can happen.",How to Help Your Teen Overcome Peer Pressure to Drink," Talk to he/she or them about the dangers of drinking alcohol. Tell them that they will face peer pressure throughout all their teens and you will not be there to help them when they face it.;
, Go online and look up peer pressure and drinking. Show your kid(s) the consequences of alcohol, peer pressure, and binge drinking.

, Tell them that it could lead to: sexual activity, physical harm, accidents, drunk-driving and a lot of problems that may and could interfere with their personal health.

, Drinking can cause them to:


You will look ludicrous. The notion is that drinking is cool, but the nervous system changes that come from drinking alcohol can make people do stupid or awkward things, like throwing up or peeing on themselves. Drinking also gives people bad breath, and no one enjoys a hangover.






Teen drinkers are more likely to get fat or have health problems, too. One study by the University of Washington found that people who regularly had five or more drinks in a row starting at age 13 were much more likely to be overweight or have high blood pressure by age 24 than their non-drinking peers. People who continue binge drinking well into adulthood risk damaging their organs, such as the liver, heart, and brain.






Teens who drink put themselves at threat for obvious problems with the law (it's illicit; you can get arrested). Teens who drink are also more possible to get into fights and commit crimes than those who don't.






People who drink daily also often have difficulty in school. Drinking can damage a student's ability to study well and get decent grades, as well as affect sports performance (the coordination thing).

Talk about your teen's interests in a very general sense. From there, try to narrow things down to explore a variety of careers based around a broad interest. Together, write down a list of interests. From each interest, jot down potential career paths. You can come back to this list as you continue to explore your teen's career.For example, say your child is interested in singing. Try asking questions like, ""Would you want to do something with singing for a career? What kind of work do you think you can do with singing?"" You can think of practical careers, like being a music teacher, while also considering pursuing more challenging paths, like singing professionally.;
, Most people are unsure what they want to do with their lives when they're young. It can be helpful for your child to hear your personal career story. Let them know how you found yourself in your field and what guided you in that direction.Talk to them about why you chose the path you did. For example, say you became a lawyer after witnessing a local scandal where a lawyer in your home town successfully advocated for worker's rights.
Let them know what experiences and interests led you down your career road. For example, maybe being on the swim team in high school led you to become a PE instructor professionally. Hearing how you chose a career will help your teen find concrete ways to fuel their interests into a career.

, A good way to identify one's passions is to figure out what experiences define a person. Ask your teen to think about what experiences were most meaningful for them. Ask them something like, ""What event do you think really defined who you are as a person? When was a time you learned something about yourself?""The answer your teen gives will reveal something about their passions and interests. This can be helpful when it comes to choosing a career path for your teen.
For example, maybe reading a particular book was very defining for your teenager. If a book had a huge impact on your teen's life, maybe they would love to work with literature. Talk about careers in editing, publishing, or teaching literature professionally.

, Have your teen make a list of their top strengths and weaknesses. Talk to them about what careers would match well with your teen's skill set. For example, if your teen has strong analytical and mathematical skills, they could go into something like engineering.However, let your teen know they can work on developing skills they feel they're lacking, especially if such skills are required for a career that interests them. Never discourage your teen from trying when identifying their strengths and weaknesses.

, You can see what kind of homework your teen takes to and use this as a jumping off point to discuss careers. If your teen seems very interested in something at school, maybe your teen could pursue that interest for a career.


For example, you see your teen is extremely invested in their science fair project. Ask them if they're interested in science as a career.
Ask about the specifics of the project. What are they working on? Maybe it's a project involving food sciences. Your teen may want to work in food sciences professionally after graduation. Explore colleges where you teen can get a relevant degree.

, Talk about broader life goals in addition to career goals. Where does your teen see themselves in, say, five years? Ten years? While teens will not have everything figured out, they may have a vague idea of the life they want. This can help them pinpoint potential careers.


For example, if your teen wants to live in a particular type of area, like a city, talk about job opportunities in that area.

, Your teen's school counselor is there for a reason. School counselors can help teens identify potential career paths and have the training necessary to help your teen form a concrete plan.Call your school and request you and your teen have a meeting with the student counselor. The two of you can talk about potential career paths, and practical ways your teen can achieve their goals.
Ask the career counselor how you can be supportive as a parent. There are probably many things you can do to assure your teen gets off to a good start with career planning out of high school.
You can also ask counselors to put you in touch with relevant colleges and college recruiters. This can help your teen pursue the right education for their potential career.

, Encourage your teen to explore books on career planning at the school library. You can also take your teen to a local library to check out books and other resources on a variety of careers.Talk to a librarian and let them know you're looking for books on career planning. Librarians are trained to help people find the right resources to meet their goals, so take advantage of the librarian at your teen's school.

, There are many career assessment tests you can find online. These are questionnaires a teen fills out regarding their interests and strengths. Such questionnaires will provide a list of possible careers after your teen finishes taking them.Many career assessment tests also provide databases at the end of the test highlighting potential careers, including information on career paths.
These tests ask your teen a variety of questions about what interests and inspires them. Then, the tests will provide a list of potential careers.
Make sure you're using a legitimate career aptitude test. There are many fraudulent or unreliable tests online, so ask your teen's career counselor for recommendations.

, Seek out help from your friends and family members. If your teen is interested in a particular career path, let them meet with professionals from that field.For example, say your child is interested in engineering. Maybe a friend's spouse works as an engineer. See if that person would be willing to meet with your teen to talk about the field.
Meeting a career professional can help your teen figure out whether a career is right for them, as they'll be able to ask questions about what it's like to work in the field. It can also help them develop a solid plan to pursue a particular career.

, As your teen begins narrowing down their career choices, discuss the education necessary. Some careers will not require higher education, or may only require a few years or months at a trade schools. Others will require a four year degree, or even a masters degree or PhD. Make sure your teen knows how much education they're signing up for when selecting a career.


This is also something to discuss with your teen's guidance counselor.

, A solid work ethic can help your teen follow their chosen career path. You do not want to push your teen, but model good behavior yourself and praise your teen for working hard.Acknowledge it when your teen does something well that reflects responsibility and dependability. For example, ""I'm glad you got up for school this morning on your own without me having to ask.""
Praise your teen for raising their grades, emphasizing how this can help with a career. For example, ""I know chemistry is not your favorite subject, but I'm glad you studied so hard for the test. Good grades can help you get into a solid college.""

, Be on the lookout for things like job fairs and programs in your area that allow your teen to learn from professionals. See if you can have your teen shadow a professional in a particular career for a day. This will help your teen get a sense of whether a certain path is right for them.You can always call a professional you know and ask. If your teen is interested in becoming a vet, contact your veterinarian and ask if your teen can shadow them for the day.
Many companies and organizations have programs in place where teens can shadow professionals, so ask directly. If your teen is interested in medicine, for example, reach out to a local hospital to see if they have any programs in place for a teen interested in being a doctor or nurse.

, Internships provide invaluable experience and can look good on a college resume. If a teen is very interested in a particular career path, help them pursue an internship related to that path.Many businesses and organizations have internship programs in place for teens. You can usually find information for this on company websites. For example, go to your local library's website and see if they offer summer internships for teens if your teen is interested in a career in literature.
You can also make another appointment with your teen's school counselor. A school counselor can help your teen do things like write a solid resume in order to apply for internships.

, Your teen can explore their interests via community involvement. If your teen is interested in a particular subject, encourage your teen to explore that interest in a concrete way. This can help your teen figure out a potential career. Look for part time jobs and volunteer opportunities in your area. You can find information online, at a local job fair, or simply be on the lookout for places recruiting volunteers or workers around town.For example, say your teen is interested in animals. Encourage them to volunteer at a local animal shelter, animal rescue, or veterinary clinic. Your teen may find they enjoy a particular aspect of working with animals. For example, your teen may enjoy the science behind veterinary sciences. This may encourage your teen to become a vet.

You need to give your daughter space to vent and share her feelings. Telling her what to do or how to feel will discourage her from opening up to you.As your daughter talks, refrain from searching for the right thing to say. Sometimes, there is no right thing to say in these situations. Focus more on listening than planning your response in your head.
To keep the conversation going, repeat your daughter's feelings back to her or ask for clarification instead of offering insight. For example, ""So you feel blindsided because your boyfriend broke up with you completely out of nowhere?"";
, Most people go through bad breakups at some point in their lives and get over them; however, saying as much to your daughter when she's upset is a bad move. Your daughter may feel you're dismissing how she feels. Allow her to feel her emotions, even if they seem over-the-top or very intense.Simply continue to listen to your daughter and allow her to share what she's feeling. Do not try to force her to feel better.
You may be inclined to say something like, ""You'll feel better a year from now."" While this very well may be true, it does not help your daughter in the moment. You want to make sure your daughter knows you're here now and care now. Later, when she's calmed down some, you can offer some perspective.

, Do not ever tell your daughter not to cry, or dismiss tears. Crying helps people process emotions and can be very cathartic, especially after a bad breakup. Encourage your daughter to cry if she needs to. Say something like, ""It's okay if you need to cry. I won't judge you."", Even if you disliked your daughter's boyfriend or girlfriend, refrain from saying so. If your daughter is still a teenager, relationships can be unpredictable. Your daughter may get back together with this person. She also may have lingering feelings for him or her. Therefore, refrain from passing judgment. Even if your daughter's significant other treated her poorly, do not take sides at the moment. It may backfire.You want your daughter to feel comfortable talking to you about romantic relationships, especially when she's very young. If you bash her ex, only to have them get back together, she will not come to you if there are problems in the future.
If your daughter says something negative about her ex, do not respond with negativity in return. Instead, say something like, ""It's normal to feel angry after breakups.""

, Keeping things open is vital as time goes on. After the initial breakup, and your first talk about it, tell your daughter you're always there to listen. Your daughter will probably need to talk quite a bit in the ensuing months, so say something like, ""If you ever need to talk about this more, just ask."", After your daughter has had some time to grieve, she may want some perspective on the situation. At this point, you can tell her a bit about your own romantic history. This can help her see breakups are normal and people do get through them.Try to find a story where you went through something similar. Almost everyone has very rough breakups in their emotional history, so feel free to share yours with your teen.
This will also increase the sense of intimacy between you and your teenager. Having a close, intimate bond can help your relationship stay strong through future hardships.

, Once your daughter has calmed down enough to see perspective, give her some hope. Remind her things do get better with time. Do so in a way that does not negate how she is feeling now, however,Do not say something like, ""I went through the same thing when I was your age and I don't even think about it anymore. You're going to be fine.""
Instead, acknowledge what she's feeling and still give her hope. For example, ""I know it hurts a lot right now, but remember that's not forever. I went through something similar, but there are better relationships out there for you.""

, Your daughter may want to lock herself in her room for a few days. It's normal to want to be alone after a bad breakup; however, do not allow her to wallow for too long. Remaining preoccupied with the relationship and breakup may develop into larger issues down the road, like depression. Gently encourage her to keep up with regular activities and continue seeing her friends. This will help her heal.You may want to let your daughter sit out of her normal extracurricular activities at first, but make sure she returns to her usual sports, clubs, and hobbies. Staying busy will help prevent her from having obsessive thoughts about the relationship and help show her that life goes on.
You can try to offer to have her friends over. Making your home hospitable to your daughter's friends may encourage her to be social.
Help her stay engaged in hobbies and activities. If she likes to sew, consider buying her some new fabric or helping her start a new project. If she loves the outdoors, schedule a family hike.

, It's normal to be sad after a breakup, and it is not unusual for teens to experience severe depression after the end of even short-term romantic relationships. Watch for signs that your daughter's reaction is abnormal or prolonged. She may need help from a counselor.If your daughter is still extremely sad after a few weeks, she may need help from a therapist. If she's lost interest in activities, still cries a lot, and continues to isolate herself, get her help from a therapist.
You should also seek counseling if your daughter engages in behavior like self-harm or drug and alcohol abuse after a bad breakup.

, In the age of the internet, many teens will vent about their ex online. If you find out your daughter has been posting about her ex, especially posting very embarrassing things about him or her, have a frank talk with her about appropriate online behavior.Advise your daughter to go easy on her online updates. Remind her sharing personal information online could affect her in the future. You could tell her she may want to take a technology timeout until she's calmed down.
Remind her that badmouthing her ex may reflect poorly on her. Encourage her to open up to close friends and family members rather than going overboard online.

, When your child is hurt, it's normal to feel sad yourself. No one likes to see their child experience pain and heartbreak; however, try to keep your own emotions under control when talking to your daughter. You want to make sure you do not end up worrying her in the process of trying to help.If you need to talk to someone, discuss your emotions with your spouse or a close friend. Venting to others can help you keep your feelings in check, allowing you to be strong for your daughter.

, If a relationship was abusive, physically or emotionally, your daughter may need therapy to recover. Crisis centers and teen help lines can help your daughter deal with abuse. You should also find a regular therapist for your daughter. Regular therapy sessions can help your daughter work through the emotions surrounding an abusive relationship.If you need help right away, try calling the National Domestic Abuse hotline at 1-800-799-7233.You can also call the hotline for LoveIsRespect.org, which focuses on teens in abusive relationships. The number is 1-866-331-9474."

Teach your child to shop around.,
Encourage your child to be realistic when buying.,
Ask your teen to think about opportunity costs.,
Remind your teen to check their receipts.,
Discourage your child from providing extra information when making a purchase.,
Be a wise consumer yourself.",How to Help Your Teen Be a Wise Consumer1," For big-ticket items – snowboards, stereo systems, and musical instruments – your teen will be able to find similar or identical products at different price points. Tell your teen that it’s best to look around at several shops for more affordable items before settling on the one they want to purchase.Encourage your child to look up prices while on the go. For instance, if they find a great pair of jeans in one store, urge them to hop on their phone and look up the price of the same jeans at other retailers. If they locate the same item for a lower price elsewhere, suggest that they shop at the location with the lower price.
Show your teen online options for buying, too. Craigslist and eBay are great for finding rare and second-hand items.;
, The first questions your teen should ask when they make a purchase should be, “Do I really need this?” and “How often will I use this?” If they have any doubt that they will get substantial use and enjoyment out of whatever it is they’re considering buying – especially if it’s a big-ticket item – they should think twice before sinking their money into it. Other important questions your teen ought to ask include:Is this durable?
How long will this last?
Will this be a lot of trouble to take care of?

, Opportunity costs are the costs associated with not being able to buy or do something because you spent the money in some other fashion. For instance, if your teen wants to go to the theme park with his friends, but he can’t because he spent all his money on baseball cards, he has paid an opportunity cost. Help your child understand the dynamics of opportunity costs. Encourage them to save their money and spend wisely so they are not faced with a situation later where they can’t leverage their buying power., Consumers are often accidentally overcharged through system errors or mistakes made by checkout clerks. Sometimes items that were advertised as on sale really aren’t on sale, or are marked as on sale but haven’t had their prices adjusted in the retailer’s computer checkout system.Suggest to your teen that they can avoid a lot of hassle later if they ask pointed questions to clarify the price of a given product before checking out.
For instance, if your teen wants to buy a book that was found in the 50% off rack, but the book is not visibly marked as 50% off, instruct your teen to ask the checkout clerk, “Is this book 50% off?”
If the clerk answers in the negative, have your teen say, “I found it on the 50% off rack.”

, Many retailers collect additional information at checkout such as email addresses, phone numbers, and home addresses. This information might be collected as part of a customer outreach or newsletter effort. Retailers might entice consumers to provide their personal info with promises of coupons. But this information might be sold to third parties who use it to send spam emails, unwanted phone offers, and junk mail. Plus, company databases are targets for hackers, and if successful, hackers could use your information to steal your identity.It can be hard to avoid providing information like home addresses if your teen buys online. Remind your teen to never save login information on their computer and change their passwords frequently.

, One of the best ways to you’re your teen become a wise consumer is to model the behavior for them. Children – including teens – continue to look to their parents for guidance. If you demonstrate intelligent buying habits, your teen will, too."
"
Suggest to your teen that they ask their friends for product information.,
Help your teen discover relevant online reviews.,
Direct your teen to reliable review publications.,
Teach your teen to doubt advertisements.",How to Help Your Teen Be a Wise Consumer2," For instance, if they’re in the market for a new skateboard, and their friends all have skateboards of their own, they should find out what sort of skateboards their friends have, where they bought the skateboards, and whether or not their friends are satisfied with their boards. Your teen could even ask their friends to take a spin on their friends’ boards to get a feel for different brands before purchasing on themselves., By simply typing a word string into their favorite search engine, your teen could locate dozens – even hundreds – of reviews for products of all sorts online. For example, continuing with the skateboard example, your teen could type “best skateboard for teens” into their search engine of choice. They’ll get a mix of longer, more in-depth professional reviews, and shorter consumer reviews.Help your teen identify and understand average product ratings. Some ratings are on a system of 10, others on a system of five, or based on some sort of star rating system.
Remind your teen that a single good review – or a single bad review – should not cause them to finalize or discount their decision to buy a product. Smart buyers will invest serious effort into understanding the pros and cons of an expensive product before deciding whether it’s worth it.

, Consumer Reports is a magazine available at many public libraries that includes systematic ratings for all major new products. If your teen is thinking about buying a car, for instance, help them locate a copy Consumer Reports’ most recent review of automobiles., Many people engage in impulse-buying because they see deals that urge them to “Act now” or buy an object that’s available “For a limited time only.” However, these phrases and terms that encourage immediate action are often misleading. Explain to your teen that ads are designed to sell things, not to provide a balanced worldview or accurate information.Help your teen understand that sales are cyclical, and occur with regularity around holidays and during the end of seasons.

Explain how to budget.,
Encourage off-label purchases.,
Encourage your teen to work.,
Make your teen pay their own way.",How to Help Your Teen Be a Wise Consumer3," Basic budgeting requires that your teen can identify their wants, needs, and income. As a parent, you meet their needs, but you can help them understand the concept of wants versus needs by doing the monthly family budget along with them. Armed with a better grasp of how budgeting works, your teen will be wiser about how they spend their money.In one column, list all the needs (and their costs) the family spent on in a given month – food, utilities, rent, and so on.
In another column, list all the wants (and the price of each) that your family spent on – going to the movies, buying tickets to a concert, and so on.
Use receipts and bills to reconstruct accurate totals in both the wants and needs column.
In a third list, combine the income totals for the household – your income, your partner’s income, and – if you wish – your teen’s income.
Subtract the wants and needs from the income totals.
Explain to your teen that if your income exceeds your expenditures – the total cost of wants and needs – you’ve budgeted correctly and have extra money to save. Explain that if income does not exceed monthly expenditures, you’ll need to reduce spending on “wants.”
Suggest that your teen should save at least 10% of their income per month.

, Major brands are able to reap a premium for their products, even if they are not substantially better than the smaller or less popular brands. Share this useful tidbit with your teen in order to help them think about whether they’re paying for a product or paying for a brand., Nothing helps your teen develop wise consumption habits like a good work ethic. There are many avenues of part-time work available to teens throughout the school year, and some full-time work available when school is not in session. Jobs teens could do include:restaurant work
lawn mowing
babysitting
pet walking or petsitting
selling old toys and games online

, Teens begin to want more expensive things as they grow. If your teen wants a new computer, a set of golf clubs, or even a car, they should be willing to contribute some or all of the money toward it. If they don’t have a job, they should be willing to kick in money they’ve saved over the course of birthdays or other holidays. This will help them mold their consumption habits in a way that matches their income, which is the very foundation of wise consumption."
"
Encourage your teen to carry only small amounts of cash at once.,
Discourage your teen from buying on credit.,
Discourage aimless shopping.,
Limit the amount of television your teen watches.",How to Help Your Teen Be a Wise Consumer4," When people have lots of money – no matter their age – they often feel justified in spending more. Encourage your teen to only carry a small amount of money in their wallet at any given time. That way, if they need money for a large purchase, they’ll have to make a special withdrawal. The time that elapses between the urge to buy and the large cash withdrawal will allow your teen time to think their purchase through., Credit cards are great for making large purchases that you’d otherwise have to make a large cash withdrawal for. But remind your teen that credit card fees – whether for late payments or exceeding their credit limit – can add up fast. If your teen pays using a credit card, encourage them to pay the balance off in full at the end of each month., If your teen goes to the store without a particular object for purchase in mind, they’re likely to buy something (or several somethings) they don’t really need. This could lead to buyer’s remorse – the feeling that they wasted their money – later on.Teens often go to the mall or other retail outlets with friends. If their friends are all buying things, they might feel pressure to conform and buy something, too. Help them find ways to cope constructively with feelings of peer pressure.
For instance, if your teen’s friend asks them, “Hey, do you want to go to the mall?”, encourage your teen to say, “No thanks. Why don’t we go to the park instead?”
Tell your teen to explain to their friends that they’re saving money if their friends encourage them to buy something.
For instance, if your teen’s friends ask, “Aren’t you going to buy something?”, encourage your teen to reply, “No, I’m saving my money.” In this way, your teen can be a positive role model for wise consumption among their friends.
Explain to your teen that occasional splurging is okay, but excessive impulse shopping will ruin their finances.

, Television advertisements have significant influence on buying habits. Almost 25% of each hour of television is devoted to commercials. By discouraging television viewing in your house – and thereby curbing the number of ads your child is exposed to – you can cut your teen’s desire for unnecessary material wants.Most teens should watch less than one hour of television per day.
Encourage your teen to paint or read a book instead of watching TV.
Try an online streaming service if you want to provide ad-free television entertainment for your teen.

Choose a location with your teen.,
Decide if you want a theme for your teen's party.,
Pick a date for the party.,
Help your kid decide who to invite.,
Come up with ideas about the invitations.,
Plan the party along with your teen.,
Set some rules.,
Help them get ready for the party.,
Let the kids party and don't forget to check in every now and then.",How to Help Your Teen Throw a Party," Consider throwing the party at your own place only if your house is large enough; kids need a lot of space to party. Try to make a reservation at a local restaurant or pub, if your teen is over 15 (more sophisticated locations are preferred rather by older teens); if they're younger, a pool party, a picnic, the mall or a richer friend's house will do. Don't forget to consider your kid's opinion; although it's very likely that their wishes are a bit more costly than you can afford, negotiate and try to find something that would match both their wishes and your budget.;
, This is more expensive and more difficult to plan; keep that in mind when deciding the theme for your teen's party.

, Remember that the worst days to host a party is during school week and on Sunday night, because your kid will have to go to school the next morning. Try to host the party Friday or Saturday night. Talk to your kid and ask them how many of their friends are likely to come at that date; maybe they're going on a school trip you don't know about yet, or something.

, If you know most of the kids your teen wants to invite, and they're okay, then you don't need to worry. But if most of the kids on the list are people you don't know, ask your teen if you can meet them. They will most likely be against the idea, but explain them your reasons. Make sure your teen is being honest with you; they could lie and tell you they'll invite only the good kids at their school, when in fact they're not.


If there's someone on the list that makes your teen feel bad about himself/herself but whom your kid desperately wants to fit in with, try to convince your kid not to invite those people, no matter how popular they may be. You don't want them to ruin your kid's party, do you?

, If you happen to know somebody that is good at designing invitations, contact them and ask them to make them for your kid. If they're original and personalized, the better. Don't forget to specify the location, the date, and the hour the party starts at in the invitation; review the text to make sure it gives all the details.

, Hire a caterer and a decoration company if you're on a higher budget. Otherwise, do these yourself.


Keep the food light: no soups, spaghetti or such food. Chips, peanuts, candies, cookies, and chocolate will do.
Decorations are very important at a party. Abandon the classic confetti and balloons and go for something more original. If it's a theme party, make sure the decorations suit the theme. In matters of decorations, you have 2 choices: either you make them yourself or you buy them. Specialized stores have great decorations, but the handmade ones are truly original, if made properly. Check the Hobbies&Crafts section at wikiHow.

, Teenagers do a lot of crazy things at parties and they often need to be set some rules.


Don't allow them to drink alcohol.
Set a reasonable time for the party to end. This depends on your teen's age.

For kids 13 to 14, midnight is the best option; make sure all the parents drive their kids home, though; it's not safe to allow a 13 year old kid to come home by themselves at midnight.
For kids 15 to 16, 01:30 is enough for them to party. Again, drive them home; most of the kids this age are still not safe enough to wander the streets alone at night.
For kids 17-21, you may set a time limit between 03:00 and 'till the morning. No need to drive them home this time. At this age, kids are already mature enough to defend themselves.


Instruct them regarding the things they are allowed to do at a party.

If the party takes place at your home or somebody else's, make sure they don't break anything, search through the host's personal stuff or steal things from there. In this case, somebody must come at regular intervals to check everything is okay.
If the party takes place somewhere else, instruct your kid not to insult the staff, not to break anything, not to fight with food and other things you assume your kid may do.



, Give them enough money to pick a good outfit, make them relax, tell them the party is going to be awesome. A host is often nervous before the party. Drive them to the location if needed.

, Call them or drop by to make sure everything is okay."

But if you see a noticeable change in your child's behavior, trust your instincts and talk with them about what they're feeling.Notice if your teen seems unmotivated to take care of themselves. Poor hygiene (not bathing, not changing clothes, being unable to get out of bed) and changes in sleep patterns are often early indicators of depression.
Identify if your teen is focused on death, dying, or feeling empty inside.
Note if there are sudden shifts in their interactions with you, their friends, and others.
If the dramatic change in their behavior lasts for a day or two, this may be a temporary change in mood. If it lasts for two weeks or more, then evaluate their behavior more seriously.;
, Depression can be triggered by a negative event, or it may seem to come out of nowhere. Clinical or major depression may require medication to help with depressive symptoms. Minor depression may be a matter of getting help during a difficult time or life transition.


Evaluate if there are any difficulties at home such as family conflict, a recent divorce, a death in the family, or abuse.
Determine if there are any challenges at school with friends, bullies, peer pressure, poor grades, or other changes.
Assess whether the teen feels safe, loved, and accepted. Many teens face new challenges with peer relationships. If they are going through a break-up or a loss of a friendship, they may feel lost.

, Consider spending more one-on-one time with the teen, so that they feel more comfortable with opening up about their feelings. Be willing to listen to their problems and concerns, not matter how small.


Listen attentively and understand their perspective on things that are bothering them. Avoid interrupting them when they're talking about how they're feeling.
Avoid dismissing their feelings as small or trivial. For teens, feeling accepted and appreciated by others, including their peers, is very important.
Consider saying things like, ""It seems like it's been a tough week for you. How are you feeling today?"" or ""You know I'm here for you. It can be hard sometimes, and I want to help in any way I can.""

, Clinical depression lasts for more than a few days. It is a combination of feelings that often linger for two weeks or more. It could last for months or years if untreated. Think about these warning signs:Being constantly sad, irritable, or angry
Activities that were once fun seem pointless
Feeling worthless, empty, guilty, or just ""wrong"" in some way
Feeling hopeless or no reason to live
Feeling apathetic — feeling low energy, lack of motivation, diminished emotions
Sleeping too much or not enough
Gaining or losing weight, or having a dramatic change in appetite
Being unable to concentrate on school activities, or even things that once were fun
Withdrawing from others
Thinking of death, suicide, or self-harm

, If a teen indicates feelings of suicide, address their concerns in a serious way. Stay calm and supportive during this time. If they are thinking of or have a plan to harm themselves, and have the means to do so, this needs to be addressed immediately by a professional.Call the National Suicide Prevention Hotline, and talk with a counselor on the phone. Reach out by phone or chat: 1-800-273-8255 or http://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/

If they are already in treatment with a therapist, consider calling their therapist for guidance about crisis services or next steps available.
If the teen is making threats about violence or suicide, expresses an intent to commit suicide, and/or has a plan for suicide, contact 9-1-1. Even if it doesn't seem as though the teen is going to act immediately, just having a plan and intent is enough to get evaluated by a hospital and possibly admitted for treatment.

, Resist the urge to pass judgment or criticize a teen's opinions or behaviors when they are depressed. Provide a safe and calm environment for them to open up about what they're feeling. Don't talk over the teen to provide advice or tell them what to do. Listen to what they need to say before you react.
Show that you are paying attention by putting away electronic devices, turning away from things you're doing, and providing your undivided attention.
Maintain eye contact and nod your head to show that you understand what they are saying.

, Instead of telling a teen, ""It's not that bad,"" or, ""Get over it,"" acknowledge their feelings. Even if their thoughts about a problem seem silly or irrational, for them those feelings are real. By making a teen feel understood, it can go a long way to helping them through their depression.


Consider saying, ""I'm sorry about what you're feeling. I'm here for you. I care about you.""
Acknowledge that their pain and sadness is real. Consider saying, ""I see you're in pain and feeling sad. That's a tough situation, but know that I support you. I believe in you.""

, When a teen is depressed, they may want to ignore or withdraw from you and other people. They may isolate themselves as a way of coping with what they're feeling. Even if they seem reluctant to spend time with you, try to stick by them.


Avoid taking their behavior too personally.
Understand that when someone is severely depressed they are impaired in their ability to make decisions. They may need you to provide care for them, even if they don't say so.
Try to spend time with them doing things that aren't too stressful. Consider doing activities with them that are one-on-one rather than in large groups or with the whole family.
Do activities like going for a hike, taking a walk, going out to lunch, watching a movie, or playing a game together.

, Depressed teens likely have low self-esteem. They feel worthless or unloved. Provide positive reassurance that they are loved, and that they have worth.Tell them with encouraging words. Consider saying, ""You are an amazing person,"" or, ""I love you and I believe in you.""
Remind them of the things they do well, or the parts of their personality that are admirable. Consider saying, ""I love how you draw. You're so creative.""
Give hugs on a regular basis.

, A teen who is facing depression may feel isolated and without someone to talk to about what they're feeling. Encourage them to seek help from a school counselor, therapist, or professional counselor.Discuss about the benefits of counseling with them. Consider saying, ""There are lots of people who benefit from talking with someone. It can be good to let out what you're feeling without feeling judged. Counselors are good at helping people cope with what they're going through and making you feel like it's a safe place to talk.""
Talk with the teen's school counselor about your concerns. See if the counselor can talk with them directly.
Make a counseling appointment through a local counseling center or a private practice therapist. Consider going with the teen to provide emotional support.
Understand that there are different types of treatment options including individual and family therapy, inpatient hospitalizations, and outpatient programs. Talk with a professional about what may seem most appropriate.

, Consider medications to help a teen who is going through depression. Many people who are depressed have a medical need for medications to help stabilize their mood. Often a combination of medications and therapy are most beneficial for people who have depression.Talk with your primary care doctor about medications or referrals to see a specialist such as a psychiatrist for medication options.
Be aware if your teen stops taking medications due to side effects. Consider alternative medications or different dosages if your teen is still struggling with the medications provided. Talk with your doctor about any issues with medications.

, Remind them that they can turn to you in times of need. Identify other people they trust or safe places where they can go. Talk with community centers or the school about other resources.

, Often teens who are depressed will use unhealthy ways to cope with their feelings. This may involve alcohol, smoking, or using drugs. Teens are particularly influenced by their peers, and may see using addictive substances as a good way to mask their pain.Consider removing all alcohol, cigarettes, and drugs (including prescription drugs) from areas where the teen has access.
Identify if your teen may be using these substances as a way to cope. Understand that they may need help with addiction in addition to their depression.

, Show them that healthy eating can improve a person's mood and energy level. Instead of telling them to eat better, be a role model. Make the change and eat better yourself as a way to show solidarity.Limit high fat and high sugar foods.
Encourage them to cook and prepare meals. Make this an activity that you both can do together.
Have dinners or meals with them regularly. Make meals a time to connect.

, Exercise has shown to boost mood and well-being. Identify activities that they enjoy or have enjoyed in the past. Try to do them together. Consider finding other relatives or friends that can help to motivate them.Go for walks together.
Play sports like basketball, tennis, soccer, or other games together.
Consider taking a fitness class together, or enrolling them in one.
Take a yoga or martial arts class.

, Be a source of support. Act as a mentor and caring friend. When a teen is depressed, it can be isolating and overwhelming. Provide them with the reassurance that you will always be there for them.


Check in with the teen regularly. Make sure that each day or each week involves some quality time.
Give hugs, smiles, high fives, or other forms of physical support that show you care and are proud of the teen.
Be a positive part of the teen's life. Be a role model in your actions and words. Give them a sense of reassurance.

Gain your daughter’s trust.,
Don’t overreact.,
Lead by example.",How to Help a Teenage Daughter Deal With Emotional Issues1," Your teenage daughter will not open up to you if she feels she cannot trust you. How you've treated her in the past will influence this part of your relationship, but if you show genuine respect for your child's feelings, you can grow her trust in you.


Show your child that it's safe to open up to you. Even if she reveals something that is punishable (experimenting with alcohol or drugs, sneaking out, etc.) most of the time understanding is a more effective course of action than consequences.
Take off your ""Parent Hat"" once in a while. Your daughter will feel more comfortable telling you things if you come to her level at times instead of always acting as the authority figure. She may tell you things that don't make you particularly happy, but she will be more likely to share with you if she knows you won't explode and ground her for life.For example, if your daughter comes to you and says, ""I'm thinking about sleeping with my boyfriend,"" talk to her about birth control, safety, and taking care of herself emotionally and physically. Don't just blurt out, ""No way! You're not allowed to have sex yet!"";
, Be careful how you react to the information that she may share with you. In other words, don't flip out if she says something that surprises or angers you. The way you react will either encourage or discourage her from sharing her feelings and concerns with you in the future.

, If you want her to trust you, show her what it means to be trustworthy. Do what you say you're going to do, and always keep your promises to her. She’s watching to see how you deal with situations in your life, so she will know how to deal with the situations that arise in her own life.Practice resilience. After a stressful encounter (with your daughter or otherwise,) let her see that you have the ability to bounce back and refocus. Modeling this for her helps her learn to do the same thing.

Talk to your daughter.,
Try to keep an open line of communication going.,
Set the proper tone for your relationship.,
Remain calm.",How to Help a Teenage Daughter Deal With Emotional Issues2," This may sound silly, but never shut your daughter out or give her the silent treatment because she hurt your feelings. Teenage girls can sometimes say hurtful things to their parents, but remember that it might just be the hormones talking. You raised her, so you know the person underneath the angst.


Decide on whether or not you can let the issue go. If either of you is upset, waiting to talk about about it is usually a good idea. Giving yourself some time will allow both of you to think, calm down, and proceed rationally when your conversation resumes.
""Let's set a time to talk about this tomorrow,"" or ""Why don't we go for a walk after dinner to discuss this?"" are good ways of giving each of you some breathing room.

, Talk about everything – not just the “big things.” Don’t pressure her to talk. Sometimes it's enough to let her know you’re interested and wait for her to respond. Knowing that you’re concerned might encourage her to come talk with you later. Try to keep an on-going dialogue with her about her friends, school, relationships, hopes, and dreams.

, Remember that you are the adult, so you are the one who sets the tone for your relationship with your child. If you are condescending or sarcastic with her, chances are that she will be that way with you, too.

, It’s tempting to lash out when your daughter is being mean or aggressive toward you, but don’t do it. Even though it’s hard not to “fight back” or defend yourself, if you do this it will only escalate the conflict between the two of you. This will eliminate the chance for the two of you to have a productive discussion.Make a habit of pausing every time you feel emotionally triggered by your daughter. Instead of focusing on her, notice your own emotions.
Intentionally relax your body. Instead of tensing up when you feel angry or emotional, try to relax instead.
Just breathe. Your brain functions better when you take deep breaths and you will slow down your emotional reaction.
Visualize your emotions. Picture water running over a rock and think of how your emotions are doing the same thing. You’ll be surprised how much it helps you calm down.

Acknowledge her feelings.,
Tell her it’s okay.,
Listen to her.,
Empathize with your daughter.,
Spend time with her.,
Support her.,
Reassure your daughter.",How to Help a Teenage Daughter Deal With Emotional Issues3," Be patient, and remember that acknowledging and validating her feelings do not necessarily mean that you condone bad behavior. Sometimes your daughter may just want to feel that you acknowledge her struggles.For her, it makes a difference to know that you've heard her and that you care.Try saying things like, ""I know that you're hurting right now,"" or ""I can see how you might feel that way.""

, Make sure your daughter knows that it’s okay to accept whatever she’s feeling. Remind her that ignoring or pushing her feelings aside won’t help, and that it’s always okay to “feel your feelings.”

, It’s important to remain non-judgmental and open-minded when your daughter talks to you. Be open and honest, and try to really hear what she wants to say to you. Remember that an important part of listening is acknowledging her feelings.If you have trouble understanding what she means, try repeating her words back to her to make sure that you’re getting it. For example, ""So what you're telling me is that you're feeling worried about your test scores,"" or ""What I'm hearing is that your friend is pressuring you to try a certain drug.""
Put your phone away so you can give your daughter your full attention. Make sure she knows that she’s the most important thing to you – not your newest email or text message.

, Try to remember how it felt when you were a teenager and assure her that you can understand a lot of the issues that she may be going through. Give her examples from your own past experiences.


For example, ""When I was a teenager, I remember fighting with my mom all the time because she wouldn't let me stay out past 10pm and all of my friends got to stay out until midnight!""
Or, ""I remember feeling like the only girl on the planet who had to wear braces and glasses at the same time. It was awful!""

, Some teen girls feel that their parents don’t spend enough time with them. Make it a habit of doing one-on-one activities with your daughter, whether it’s for game night, shopping, exercising together, or just going to dinner or the movies. Spending your time with her lets her know that she is a priority in your life.

, Don't dismiss her concerns just because you don’t think they are important. Things that may seem trivial to you, like not being invited to a certain party or which dress to wear to the dance, may be huge problems in her eyes. Remember that even though certain things may not seem important to you, they may be very important to her. Be careful not to minimize or dismiss her struggles.

, Make it clear that your child knows that no matter what is troubling her, it can always be resolved. Make sure that she knows that there is no problem too big that the two of you can’t handle it together.Tell her that you believe in her and her abilities to handle things.
Remind her that you've been through tough times together before, and that you will get through this, too.

, If you suspect that your daughter is involved in a bullying situation, either as the victim or as the bully, take immediate steps to resolve the problem.Stop it on the spot. It's fine to intervene and separate the people involved. If it's on-line bullying, restrict internet access for the time being.
Find out what happened. Get the story from several sources, and try to get the facts without placing blame prematurely.
Support the children involved in the incident. Reassure them that bullying is wrong in any situation. Give advice about what to do if the situation occurs again. Try role-playing to help prepare your child for real-life situations.

, Remember that no one sign means that there’s a problem. Examine the severity, nature, and duration of the problem before deciding on a course of action. You will know when your child is acting out of character and having difficulties, so don’t be afraid to act on your parental instincts.

, If you find that you’re in over your head, don’t be afraid to ask for help with sorting out the problems your daughter might be having. Contact a licensed therapist or counselor to get their opinion., A medical professional will be able to evaluate if there is significant cause for concern and can give you a plan for addressing physical or mental issues."

Be as detailed as possible when giving the unit your teenager's history.,
Learn the names of the doctors, nurses, and aides that are spending time with, and treating, your teen.,
Participate in ""patient centered rounds"", or the doctor's rounds that include the parents.,
Connect with one or two nurses who are assigned your teen often.,
Speak to the social worker assigned to your teen every two days or so.,
Visit your teen often.,
Be sure to follow up with aftercare.",How to Handle Your Teen's Stay in a Psychiatric Unit or Hospital," Do not worry about the staff judging you or thinking you are a ""bad"" parent. You have done the best you were able to with the situation you were dealing with.


Without all of the details, the staff at the hospital will not be able to help your teen to the fullest extent. If necessary, allow your teen to tell his version of the history first, then ask to speak to the staff privately so that you can fill them in with your version of what has been happening in your teen's life and what may be causing the suicidal feelings. This can be a delicate process, and emotionally draining, take it slow if you need to, the staff will understand.;
, By doing this you have direct contacts when you need them, and can call daily and get updates from the staff rather then just your teen. Their accounts of what is happening may be quite different from your teen's, and you need to tell the staff what you are seeing and what your opinion is regarding your teen's behavior while they are hospitalized.

, Most hospitals have one or the other. Patient centered rounds are when your teen joins you, the doctor, the social worker assigned to the case, the charge nurse and sometimes the educational director, as well as anyone else that is assigned directly to your teen. Very often these types of rounds are scheduled once or twice a week very early in the morning. Doctor's rounds with parents are usually large meetings that include the staff that is working closely with your teen (including the people mentioned above) and just the parents—the teen is not included. These meetings can be anytime during the day, but are usually only scheduled one day a week. While this can be inconvenient, it's worth going to in order to get information directly from the staff working the closest with your teen. These meetings allow you to get the inside view on what is happening, as well as spend a much more significant amount of time with staff members then is regularly provided.

, Get to know them by name.  If you know the nurses' and aides' names, they tend to be friendlier and more receptive to talking to you on a more compassionate, personal level. Be cordial and polite to them; many parents call and yell when they are displeased so your attitude will be a welcome change. Never yell at them, no matter how frustrated or angry you may get at something that is happening at the hospital. Staff tend to turn off when a parent is yelling or swearing at them and will not listen as intently as they will if you are polite and explain your concerns in a calm way. Having a personal connection that you can call at the hospital to check on your teen and express concerns to is a resource that many parents do not cultivate.  If you have trouble reaching staff, remember they are often very busy. Try not to call when shift change is occurring. In most hospitals this is usually at 7 a.m, 3 p.m, 7 p.m and 11:00 p.m. There is a shift change meeting which usually takes place a half hour before the staff changes over—do not expect anyone to be available to speak to you during this time, as most of the staff are in the meeting, other than the few taking care of the teens.

, There will be a social worker assigned to your teen who helps determine after care when hospitalization ends. You want to keep the lines of communication open with them. It can be pivotal in what happens to your teen when he leaves the hospital. The social worker is the one who calls other facilities such as a substance abuse treatment center, a day treatment program, or placement and gets insurance approval for any after hospitalization treatment other than doctor's visits. There are usually very few social workers and many teens, so do not expect calls every day from them. Be proactive about calling them if you don't hear from them every few days, as well as returning their calls. The social worker assigned to patients usually only works business hours, so don't expect to reach them after hours. There is normally another social worker who is an emergency and admissions social worker that is at the hospital after hours, but they will not know your teen as well as the day social worker.

, Show him that you are supportive and loving. Understand that while there can be circumstantial reasons your teen is suicidal it is often a chemical imbalance that needs to be corrected, and that it is not your teen's fault. Tell your teen you are proud for getting help and that you will be supportive when he returns home. If you don't visit, at least some of the time, it can increase the feelings of loneliness and abandonment that many teens who are suicidal feel. Sometimes visitation can just be a time to sit there and hold hands with your teen. There doesn't need to be any conversation at all, other then ""I love you"".

, Plan on helping the social worker and your teen work out plans for after your teen is released from the hospital. Often, teens regress somewhat after hospitalization and need assistance with taking their medications, going to doctor's appointments and just life in general. Be patient with your teen, understand that with work he will hopefully feel better at some point, it just may take a while. During that time be as supportive and helpful as possible. Reduce your expectations so you aren't disappointed and make sure you have your teen do all of the after care recommended by the doctor. Doing so may help your teen recover faster.

Pick a venue(s).",How to Have a Girls' Night out With Your Teenage Daughter," You may spend a lot of time working, or maybe your daughter spends a lot of time alone in her room. Either way, make sure you know her interests and hobbies, her likes and dislikes. This may require a little bit of research. Just talk to her whether it be over a home cooked meal or during commercial breaks on the couch.;
, It's probably best that she knows and likes the idea of spending the day with you unless you two are already pretty close. Say something casual to her like, ""so, I was thinking that sometime soon the two of us could go do something together."" Try to avoid terms like , ""let's hang out!"" Or ""we should go chill together."" You don't want her to be too creeped out.

, You may want your daughter's help on this one. You definitely want to pick a date that works with both of your schedules. Pick a day that you are totally off work and she doesn't have plans. This may also affect what you will be doing. Think about if you really want to pull your daughter out of school or not. Do you want to spend all of Saturday (or a day in the summer) together? Or were you thinking a Friday night out?

, This will be easier once you know your daughter's interests. Does she love sports? Take her to a college softball game. Does she love theatre? Take her to a local performance. Does she love to shop? Save a little bit of money up so you can take her on a shopping spree. Looking for something both of you will enjoy? Get manicures or see the latest chick flick. Make sure you plan ahead and book appointments/buy tickets if needed.

Your teen should know you're there for him or her at all times. Let your teen know that you're always available to talk and will support him or her unconditionally.Teenage years are a time when many children seek independence. Teens may feel alienated and pressured if you ask a lot of questions about their mood or social life. Try to provide support without pressuring your teen to share information with you he or she wants to keep private.
Refrain from interrogating your teen. Instead of asking about what is bothering him or her, say something like, ""If you need to talk to me about anything, I'm always here to listen."" Allow your teen to open up to you at his or her own will.
Your teen may shut you out at first. Anxiety and feelings of sadness and stress are hard to talk about at any age. However, be persistent and let your teen know that you love him or her and that you really want to help. For example, you might say something like, ""I understand that this is difficult to talk about, but I love you and I want to help."";
, Having a process for making decisions may help your teen to deal with anxiety by making tough decisions seem more manageable. Work through problems with your tee to help him or her develop and improve problem solving skills.


Help your teen work through problems by teaching them about the problem-solving process. There are different versions of the process, but they generally boil down to the following six steps:

Identify the problem.
List the options and possible outcomes of each. (Both positive and negative outcomes, including potential effects on others.)
Compare the options.
Choose the best option.
Make a plan to follow through with the option.
Reflect on the problem and its solution. What worked? What would you change?For example, your teen might identify a poor test grade as the problem, then list options such as “ask for extra credit” and “study harder for the next test.” Your teen might decide that studying harder for the next test is the better option since it will be more likely to bring up his or her overall grade. Your teen might decide to study harder and set up a study schedule to stay on track. Then, your teen might reflect on how she prepared for the previous test and make connections between her poor grade and lack of preparation.
Teens will also need to learn the difference between things that are within their control and things that are out of their control. If something is not within your teen's control, help your teen refocus onto something else that will be more productive. For example, if your teen is upset because she did not get accepted to her first choice for college, then you might encourage her to focus on the colleges that did accept her.

, Anxiety and stress can be sources of embarrassment. There is a lot of stigma surrounding mental health issues, and many people are afraid to address how much they struggle with managing emotions. If your teen talks you about his or her anxiety, listen without judging.The most important thing is that your teen feels comfortable communicating with you. You do not need to offer advice or feedback. You simply need to listen and understand.
Show your teen you hear what he or she is saying. Say something like, ""I understand you're worried about your social life"" or ""A lot of teenagers stress about college."" Do not try to talk your teen out of a bad mood. Tell your teen it's normal to be sad or anxious sometimes.
Do not try to talk your teen out of how he or she is feeling. Even if you know the anxiety is irrational, it's not always helpful to point this out. Your teen probably knows a lot of his or her anxiety is baseless, but may be unable to shake the feeling. Do not criticize or pick apart your teen's line of thinking. This can alienate your teen, making him or her less likely to communicate in the future.

, While anxiety can reach a point where it's harmful, it is a normal part of life. Let your teen know that it's okay to feel sad, anxious, and stressed sometimes. Even if your teen's worries are irrational, acknowledge them. Do not try to talk your teen out of a bad mood, as this can make your teen feel that you're dismissing how he or she feels.If you're unsure of what to say, it can help to reiterate what your teen has just said. This can show your teen he or she has been heard, and encourage him or her to explain more if you don't fully understand. For example, you can say something like, ""I'm hearing you're feeling stressed because of going to college in a few years.""
Emphasize that feelings of anxiety are, to an extent, normal. Life has ups and downs, and your teen should know it's okay for him or her to be sad or unhappy some of the time. Reassure your teen it's okay to feel anxious.

, Oftentimes, teen anxiety is labeled in a way that feels dismissive or demeaning. Avoid referring to your teen as ""shy"" or ""nervous."" Instead, try to phrase things in a positive way. Your teen is trying to overcome emotional difficulty. Try referring to your teen as ""brave"" or ""a fighter"" instead. This can reduce feelings of shame your teen may be experiencing due to his or her struggles with anxiety., If your teen is struggling with an anxiety disorder, then he or she may occasionally have panic attacks. Panic attacks are moments of extreme and sometimes sudden panic, in which a person may sweat, hyperventilate, and show other signs of distress. If your teen is having a panic attack, takes steps to help.Reassure your teen things will be okay. Say things like, ""We'll get through this"" and ""You're going to be okay."" Panic attacks are scary, but they're rarely dangerous. Some people who experience panic attacks feel like they're going to have a heart attack or faint due to the fight or flight response in the body triggered during a panic attack. Let your teen know that the physical response can be alarm, but it will not cause him harm.
If you have ice or something cold on hand, have your teen press this into his or her hand. The sensation can distract from the panic.
Have your teen engage in deep breathing. Deep breaths can help ground someone during a panic attack. You can also try distracting your teen by stimulating his or her mind. Have your teen engage in a simple day-to-day activity, like taking a shower or grabbing something from the car.
Benzodiazepines are a type of fast acting anti-anxiety medication that you use as needed throughout the day. These pills tend to take effect within 30 minutes to an hour. If your teen has been prescribed any medication of this kind, you may want to offer your teen his or her medication to help quell a panic attack.Keep in mind that benzodiazepines can be highly addictive. You may want to keep them locked in a cabinet to prevent your teen from taking them too often.

, Some types of anxiety that your teen may experience are normal, such as asking a crush out on a date, giving a presentation in front of the class, or moving to a new place and going to school for the first time. If your teen has an anxiety disorder, then he or she might always feel anxious or become anxious about seemingly small matters. It might be difficult for your teen to relax. Your teen may have an anxiety disorder if he or she:feels anxious or worried most of the time
finds that anxiety interferes with daily activities, such as going to school or spending time with friends
has irrational fears that he or she cannot seem to overcome
avoids going certain places or doing certain things out of a fear of experiencing anxiety
experiences sudden onset of panic, such a fast pulse or cold sweat

, Anxiety is often a symptom of an underlying mental health problem, like depression or generalized anxiety disorder. If your teen's anxiety does not seem to go away on its own, you should seek out help from a professional therapist.You can find a therapist by asking your regular doctor for a referral. You can also see what therapists in your area are covered by your insurance provider. Make sure any therapists you find is willing to treat teenagers.
Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has shown to be very effective in treating anxiety disorders. CBT focuses on talking through problems, recognizing negative thought patterns, and engaging in exercise aimed and changing the way a patient thinks and behaves. You may want to look into therapists who practice cognitive behavioral therapy in your area.

, A wide array of psychiatric medication is used to treat anxiety disorders in teens. Medication is usually avoided in teens, as it can be habit forming and comes with a variety of side effects. If your teen is severely depressed, a doctor or therapist may suggest medication. The decision to take medication is personal and difficult. You should talk through this choice with your teen, your teen's doctor, and your teen's therapist.There are a variety of medications available to treat psychiatric issues in teens. Your teen's specific medication options depend on his or her diagnosis and medical history. All medication comes with a risk of side effects. Make sure you ask your doctor or therapist about all potential side effects before putting your teen on medication.
Talk therapy alone is often effective for teens suffering from anxiety. However, if your teen's anxiety is severe and debilitating, medication may be recommended. If your teen is on medication, he or she should be carefully monitored by doctors and mental health professionals to watch for poor side effects. In many cases, medication is an effective means of treated anxiety disorders in teens.

, Your teen may benefit from talking to other people his or her own age about anxiety, depression, or other mental health issues. Ask your teen's doctor or therapist if there are any support groups in your area for teens. Many teens feel embarrassed or alone if they suffer from mental health issues. Your teen will benefit greatly from knowing he or she is not alone.

, In rare cases, anxiety disorders and depression can lead to thoughts of suicide. If you worry your teen is suicidal, it's important to seek immediate medical attention to make sure your teen does not harm him or herself. Signs of being suicidal include:Talking about committing suicide
Romanticizing death or talking about death frequently
Writing stories, poems, or songs about death
Giving away valued possessions
Seeking out weapons, pills, or other dangerous substances
Engaging in reckless behavior
Engaging in self harm

, Your teen's physical well-being can play a big role in how your teen feels emotionally. Help make sure your teen eats healthy and gets enough physical activity in throughout the day.Stock your fridge with healthy foods and serve nutritious meals throughout the week. Keep fruits and vegetables on-hand for snacks. Make meals rich in whole grains and lean proteins like fish and poultry. Avoid having beverages high in sugar or caffeine in your home, as both of these substances can lead to an increase in anxiety.
Encourage your teen to get in some physical activity each day. Consider taking a nightly walk together as a family. Have your teen join a sports team or sign up for physical education courses in school. You can also enroll your teen in a yoga course, as yoga has been known to help reduce anxiety for many.

, Sleep is often a major concern for teenagers. Between seeing friends, homework, and extracurricular activities, your teen may not be getting enough sleep each night. A lack of sleep can make anxiety worse. Talk to your teen about good sleep habits, and help him or her establish a nighttime routine.Encourage your teen to go to bed and wake up at the same time each day. The body will adapt to a regular sleep/wake cycle and your teen will begin to feel tired at bed time and energetic in the morning if he or she has a regular routine.
You may want to set a rule in your house about the use of electronics. The light from cell phone and laptop screens can be stimulating, resulting in your teen having difficulty sleeping. It can be helpful to have your teen power down his or her cell phone and laptop close to bedtime each night.

, If you want your teen to learn how to cope with anxiety, try to model positive behavior yourself. Show your teen effective ways to deal with stress in day-to-day life. Your teen can learn from you how to cope.Remember to be positive throughout the day. When you're in a stressful situation, try to practice positive self-talk and self-love. For example, say you forgot about a deadline at work. If your teen sees you're stressed about this, say something like, ""I know I screwed up, but everyone makes mistakes and this is an opportunity to learn.""Set aside time for yourself each day. Your can show your teen how important downtime is by giving yourself some rest and relaxation at the end of the day. For example, you can make a point of having a cup of tea every night after dinner.Learn to say no. Teens are often anxious due to over-commiting themselves. If you're very busy one week, let the dishes sit in the sink overnight. If you don't time to be on this year's PTA board, let someone take the reins., When you're feeling anxious or stressed, it's important to stay connected with others. Make sure your teen makes time to hang out with family members and friends despite struggling with anxiety.Allow your teen to have friends over. Provide a warm and hospitable environment for your teen's social circle. Let your teen know it's okay to invite friends over as long as his or her friends are respectful of house rules.
Make sure your teen spends time with the family. Try to have a sit down family dinner at least a couple times a week. If you're going to see relatives in town, bring your teen along.
Encourage your teen to open up to others about his or her stress and anxiety. It can be helpful to open up to others and ask for support during times of stress.

, You can help your teen a lot by encouraging him or her to have a positive outlook on life. Try and get your teen to feel positive about the future. Encourage him or her to pursue passions and interests. Support your teen's wishes and dreams, letting him or her explore ambitions for the future. Many milestones of teenage years, like going to college and completing high school, can cause anxiety. Try to get your teen to view such milestones with excitement instead., You should help your teen think of ways to relax when he or she is feeling stressed. There are a variety of coping mechanisms you can help your teen practice to help keep anxiety away.Deep breathing, meditation, yoga, and other exercises that keep you grounded in the present can be great ways to combat anxiety.

Discuss your concerns in a calm and loving way. Be compassionate when listening to them respond or fail to respond. The teen may not be willing to open up every time.Consider saying something like, ""I noticed a change in your behavior (and then explain what change you've noticed). I wanted to check in with you, and see if you wanted to talk. I know it can be tough to share what you're thinking or feeling. But know that I'm here and ready to listen.""
Offer up examples of what you struggled with as a teen. Maybe you had difficulties at school, with friends, or your family. Give them advice about how you overcame those challenges or what similarities you and the teen both faced.
Try to be patient. Some teens may not open up at first, and it may take some time to gain their trust. Let them know you are there to listen whenever they feel ready to talk.;
, Avoid getting upset or raising your voice if possible. While your troubled teen’s actions may cause you to be frustrated or anxious, find ways to show them you are a strong and reliable support system.


Be available for them. Avoid over-scheduling activities with other friends or family, and leaving no time to be a reliable support to your teen.
Be cool and calm. If you feel that you can’t, ask to excuse yourself for a few minutes, and say that you’ll come back to this situation when you’re calm. Show them how to handle their emotions effectively without offending or hurting others.
Be willing to apologize. Teach them it’s okay to make mistakes because everyone does from time to time, even you. Emphasize that mistakes are learning opportunities and that making them is a normal part of life.

, If you see a troubled teen act impulsively or behave strangely, try to listen to their concerns without judgment. Instead of trying to fix all their problems, be a guide and advisor that listens with empathy and kindness.Avoid distractions and maintain good eye contact. To show that you’re truly listening, you need to focus on them and only them. Be present and avoid electronic devices that could distract you from a serious conversation.
Don’t jump in and start telling them what to do. Avoid saying things like, “Well, I know better than you do.” or “I’ve been on this Earth a lot longer than you.” Your teen may shut down and zone out once you start to act this way.
Give them room to say what they want to say, even if it seems silly or petty. For example, let’s say the teen just wants to talk about being dissed by a friend for wearing a certain outfit. If that’s all they’re willing to talk about, at least that’s a start. Listen to them with kindness and sincerity because sometimes it’s all about small steps.
Try not to minimize their concerns. If something matters to them, then it is important.

, Even as a teen grows up, it’s important to monitor and supervise what they’re doing and who they’re with. Parental and adult supervision can help to reduce negative and troublesome activities. Just make sure to avoid being too strict or overly protective.Be balanced in your approach to setting rules and boundaries. Give them opportunities to do things independently to show that you trust them. But if or when they break your trust, it is important to have boundaries and consequences.
Get your teen involved in setting the rules. By having them participate in how rules and consequences are created, they will be more likely to respect these rules and respect you. For example, you could talk with the teen about what happens if they break curfew. Learn what they think is an appropriate punishment, and focus on coming to a consensus between you. This teaches them accountability and to be responsible for themselves.

, Are you very strict and focused on punishment for every little thing? Do you give a lot of leeway or freedom? Do you feel more overprotective or more relaxed in your approach?


Be aware of how your actions may affect your teen's behavior.
Set a tone of mutual respect, while also setting rules. Being authoritative may work sometimes, but it must come from a place of love and understanding.
As a teen ages, they may pull away from you. Make sure to show them that you're still a strong and reliable presence in their lives. If you show them this, they're more likely to turn to you for help, rather than ignore you.

, Make sure to have quality time with the teen. While they may be hesitant to spend time with you, make a point of doing activities together in the evenings and on weekends. Work on keeping the relationship strong and intact, even as they grow older.You may have many demands from your work, your spouse, your children, your relatives, and friends. Make sure to have one-on-one time with the teen more often, so that they know they are a priority in your life.
If you see them acting out, avoiding you, or showing signs of depression, this is not the time to pull away from them. They may be in distress. Make sure to attend events with them, and have them join in on parties and events with other family and friends. Make sure to include rather than exclude them.

, If your teen is facing pressures at school, feeling isolated, or lacking guidance in what to do, focus on getting them into activities that will boost their confidence, make them feel worthwhile, and show them they can overcome what they’re facing. Consider these healthy activities:Get them involved in extracurricular activities at their school such as joining a sports team, joining band, or theater.
Encourage them to use their creative side. Find art, photography, or technical classes available in the community or at school. Identify areas that may interest them but that they’ve never tried before.
Get them involved in groups and afterschool activities that have adult supervision, through school or community programs like those at the YMCA.
See if there are youth groups through your place of worship or other community centers that focus on teens who may be struggling with depression, fitting in, or feeling peer pressure. Avoid forcing them to attend, but instead provide encouragement.
Volunteering for a cause they care about can help them feel engaged and valued.

, Show the teen that it’s not a sign of weakness to ask for help. Show them that utilizing the guidance and support of others is a sign of maturity, growth, and strength.Provide them with examples of how you may have been hesitant to ask for help in the past, and how that may have hurt you in the long run.
Show them that it’s okay to feel awkward, unsure, or confused from time to time. Provide that emotional reassurance that when they come to you for help, you’re ready and non-judgmental.

, If the teen has thoughts of suicide, self-harm, or harming others, identify resources to help immediately. Be an advocate for this teen's safety and the safety of others.


Notice any warning signs like intense mood swings; destructive habits like throwing things or threatening people; saying things like, ""There's no reason to live,"" or ""I just want to die;"" repeated alcohol intoxication; drug abuse; or psychotic symptoms.
See if the teen is willing to talk with the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, or call yourself on their behalf: http://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/ or 1-800-273-8255. A counselor can help to assess the teen's crisis situation and provide options.
Consider taking the teen to the nearest emergency room for evaluation, and options for mental health treatment in the community.
If there is immediate danger to yourself, the teen, or others, call 9-1-1 and ask for an officer with mental health training.
No matter the urgency of the crisis, avoid leaving the teen alone. Make sure that there is an adult supervising them to ensure their safety.

, Be active in monitoring the teen’s grades, poor study habits, or difficulties with others at school. Get the teen’s perspective on what the issue is, but also reach out the school staff to get guidance about next steps. Be a go-between between the teen and the school, but avoid taking sides.Reach out to the teen’s teachers to understand their views of the teen’s actions in class and overall academic performance.
Contact the school principal or head of school administration to understand any policies related to truancy, failing classes, detention, or other issues that may led to severe consequences.
Talk with the school counselor about any issues you have seen at home or after school that are concerning to you. Ask about the different options available in the community to help the teen.

, If your teen continues to act out in anger, be destructive, or has expressed thoughts of self-harm, it is important to get professional help to make living and being with them more manageable. It can be tough and stressful to see a teen who is suffering or continuing to get worse.Find a counselor or counseling center that offers individual and group therapy. Talk with them about the behaviors and concerns you’re having. Even if they aren’t able to help, they may be able to provide an appropriate referral.
Discuss with a mental health professional about behavior therapies and other treatment options. They may be able to recommend a doctor for medical evaluation if needed. For many teens with mood disorders such as depression or bipolar disorder, a combination of medication and therapy is often most effective.
Take into account any medications your teen may be on, which may be causing a change in normal behavior.

, There are many programs available nationwide to assist teens and families with the challenges of growing-up and acting-out. If you have concerns about a teen, be an advocate and identify programs that may help. Encourage the teen to attend programs that may help them find help and confidence.


Contact community groups that help at-risk youth. Find mentoring or other activity programs through the Boys and Girls Clubs of America: http://www.bgca.org/

Discuss residential treatment options and other program to help troubled teens and at-risk youth via the Boys Town Hotline: 1-800-448-3000 or http://www.boystown.org/

Identify programs such as wilderness, art, or recreation therapies in your community that help to teach teens to appreciate others and themselves. Talk with the teen's school counselor, community centers, or counseling centers about options for teens.

Tell your child that their body is strong and powerful, and that fat teens are capable of exercise. This will help empower them to run, jump, climb, swim, and do the things society says that fat people can't and won't do.


Show them pictures of fat Olympic athletes. Discuss the athletes' awesome performances over the dinner table.;
, If your teen loves their body, they will take good care of it. They will be willing to put on that swimsuit or jogging outfit and go have fun, instead of shyly standing and watching because they're too afraid of others seeing their body move. Following sections will cover how to improve your teen's body image.

, Don't mention weight loss—instead, reinforce the idea that good health is for everyone. Find ways that your whole family can eat well, not just your heavy teen. If you're stricter with a heavy daughter than with her skinny sister, your heavier daughter will get the message that health is not equally important for everyone.


Have everyone (yes, everyone) in the family fill at least 1/3 of their plate with fruits and veggies.
Don't buy red meat often; try lean meats and fish instead.
Incorporate fruits and vegetables into snacks and desserts: carrots and dip, apples and caramel, strawberries with whipped cream, bananas with hazelnut spread, etc.

, Making it a multi-person activity will help make it more enjoyable, and make your teen feel less singled out. Take walks, go swimming, hike, or play backyard sports. Keep sports equipment in the house, like various balls, basketball hoops, a volleyball net, etc.

, Your teen may not want to exercise with their peers, for fear of taunting and bullying. This would only humiliate them and make them hate exercise. Instead, let them know that you'd be happy to support them if they joined a team, but there is no pressure whatsoever.

, If your teen comes in because of head pain, a fifteen-minute lecture on weight loss is not an appropriate way to begin the appointment. Your child deserves to feel comfortable and safe in the doctor's office.If your doctor begins spouting unsolicited advice on weight loss, tell them that's quite enough and find a new one.


Ask doctors to assume that your teen has heard it all already. (They have. Many times.) Any advice should be specific (e.g. ""2 hours per week of exercise isn't quite enough for you; 5+ would be better"") and driven by long-term evidence (not simply ""DIETING = GOOD."")
Drop any doctor who automatically blames a problem on obesity. A good doctor will test for potential underlying causes (e.g. asthma, arthritis, lung problems) before reaching a conclusion.Failure to investigate a problem could cause preventable complications.Do not accept weight loss as a prescription for pain or hardship. If someone is in pain, they need pain treatment. If something is very wrong with their knee, they need to see a knee doctor. There is no maximum weight for receiving prescriptions or other medical care. Any lifestyle changes can be made during or after treatment.

, There is no maximum BMI for eating trouble.Restrictive eating and other problems can cause long-term metabolic and psychological damage. Remember, fat people still need 1600+ calories per day, and still need some carbs and fats in their diet. Disordered eating patterns need to be taken seriously, and the complications can be very dangerous at any weight.Watch for...



Restriction—refusing to eat certain food groups (e.g. no dessert), closely counting calories and portion sizes, complaining of cravings or metabolic problems

Purging—disappearing into the bathroom for long periods of time

Bingeing—secretive out-of-control eating, deep shame about food

Over-exercising—obsessively exercising, pushing themselves to the point of nausea/overheating/vomiting/etc.

Fad diets—see-sawing weight, taking diet pills or other interventions with unproven long-term efficacy, obsession with food, metabolic problems
A mix of these traits
Any behavior that would cause concern if it happened in a thin person

, Obese kids are at risk for self-esteem issues, which could lead to eating disorders, anxiety, depression, eating disorders, and other health problems. If you notice them saying lots of negative things about themselves, take them to a doctor and explain what's going on. The sooner you stop it, the easier it is to fix it.

Notice any signs of depression.,
Observe changes in behavior.,
Notice sleep disturbances.,
Observe changes in eating habits.,
Notice if your child exhibits any risk factors.,
Take suicidal threats seriously.,
Approach the teen calmly.,
Talk with the teen.,
Ask the teen if he has a suicide plan.,
Assess suicidality risk.,
Call emergency services.,
Go to the hospital with your teenager.,
Follow up on the psychiatric plan.,
Store firearms safely.,
Hide alcohol, knives, and medications.,
Engage in treatment.",How to Handle a Suicidal Teenager," Depression correlates highly with a risk of suicide.Symptoms of depression should be taken seriously. Be on the lookout for the following symptoms associated with depression:Apathy
Excessive guilt
Sadness
Hopelessness
Social withdrawal
Loss of energy
Difficulty concentrating
Memory loss;
, A sudden change in behavior can indicate thoughts of suicide, especially if the behavioral changes are dramatically different than normal. Behavior changes can include:Decreased school/work performance
Decreased time devoted to social relationships
Decreased involvement in activities such as sports or hobbies
Increased irritability
Anxiety
Exhaustion
Erratic behaviors (such as drug use or dangerous activities)
Self-harming (such as cutting)

, If your child can’t seem to get out of bed all day, or if your child has stopped sleeping, these are concerns. Sometimes teens have a different sleeping schedule than adults or children, preferring to stay up late, but be conscious of what your teen does if he stays up late and whether the activities are positive., This can include loss of appetite, or overeating. Both overeating and undereating can indicate problems with mental health. Assess when the changes began to occur, and if any other changes occurred around the same time., Risk factors are any associations that can contribute to an increased risk of teen suicide. Common risk factors include:Previous suicide attempts
History of mental health diagnosis (having Schizophrenia, Depression, Anxiety, Bipolar Disorder)
Alcohol or other substance use
Aggressive behavior
Recent/serious loss (death, parents' divorce, broken romantic relationship)
Confusion or lack of support with discovering sexual identity
Being bullied or being a bully
Family history of suicide
Family history of domestic violence

, Don't brush off any suicidal threat. In some instances, the threat of suicide is a cry for help, one way of saying ""I don't know how to cope"". If ignored, the teen may choose to act on the impulse. It is better to err on the side of caution when dealing with a human's life.

, If he is actively threatening, crying, pacing, and/or yelling, try talking to the teenager in a very caring, calm tone. You do not want to escalate the situation. Be conscious of staying calm, and try to de-escalate the teen to feel calm as well.

, Ask your teen to talk about what is going on and what feelings he is experiencing. Don't be afraid to use the word suicide. Listen closely and don't interrupt; let your teen express all he has to say. Don't dismiss his problems or get angry, it's his time to talk. Let him express the negativity he is feeling. Ask him what he needs in his life that will help him keep living. Remind him of the positive things that he has in his life, or events coming up that he can look forward to experiencing. Tell him that his life matters to many people. Remind the teen that he is loved and supported, and that you will be there for him.DON'T blame your teen or make any accusations. This is your turn to listen and refrain from judgment. Be supportive. The teen's safety is the first priority.

, A plan is the way that he wants to carry out the suicide. If the teen has plan, follow up with asking if he has the means to carry out the plan (pills, gun, etc). Then ask when the teen intends to carry out the suicide, and finally, ask if he truly intends to follow through on the suicide., After asking questions about intent, plan, and means, assess the teen's risk of committing suicide:Low – Expresses some suicidal thoughts, does not have a suicide plan. Says he won't commit suicide.
Moderate – Expresses suicidal thoughts. Has a vague plan that isn't very lethal. Says he won't commit suicide.
High – Expresses suicidal thoughts. Has a specific plan that is lethal. Says he won't commit suicide.
Severe – Expresses suicidal thoughts. Has a specific plan that is lethal. Says he intends to commit suicide.

, If you determine that the threat is serious and his life is at risk, do not hesitate to call emergency services. Especially if he is admitting he is suicidal, he may need more help then you can give him at home.You can drive the teen to the Emergency Room, or if he is uncooperative, request an ambulance.

, A hospital provides a safe environment that can monitor your teen and give any immediate care he may need. Medical and mental health professionals will work with him to feel better. The hospital can and will keep him safe and de-escalate the situation.

, Most hospitals will help the teen create a plan to deal with suicidal feelings in the future, and ways to cope now. Be clear on discharge instructions and follow through with hospital orders. It is common to refer back to the teen's physician or to a mental health worker for follow-up continued care.

, The risk of suicide increases dramatically when teens have access to firearms at home, and nearly 60% of all suicides in the United States are committed with a gun. Safely keep all guns in the home unloaded, locked, and kept out of the reach of children and teens., Access to means can increase the risk of teen suicide. Keep alcohol, knives, and any potentially lethal medications locked away if you are concerned about your teen using them as a means for suicide. Use a lock on a cabinet in the kitchen for alcohol and knives, and use a safety deposit box for medications.

, Seek out a therapist to help your teen learn coping skills for depression and thoughts of suicide. Family therapy can be helpful so that family members can understand the teen's feelings and how to support the teen in the future. Some teens may start taking medications, which can be prescribed and monitored through a psychiatrist.

Assume that any problems they tell you about are real.,
Don't force them to hang out with bullies.,
Report school bullies to the teacher/principal.,
Speak sternly to any adults who give unsolicited comments on your child's weight.,
Be ready to bring in outside help.,
Teach your teen how to handle bullies.,
Never say that losing weight is the answer.",How to Handle and Emotionally Support an Obese Teenager2," If they say they were left out, teased, pushed around, beaten up, or assaulted, believe them. Your teen needs a safe environment with supportive adults.

, If the boys on their sports team are mean, tell them you'll support them whether they choose to stay or quit. If Aunt Bessie makes snide comments during the family reunion, suggest that they hang out in the kitchen away from her, and run interference if she bothers your teen. If doctor visits end in sobbing, offer to find a new doctor.

, Send the message that you will take any bullying or harassment seriously. Work with the school to make sure that the bullies are handled seriously, and that they are not allowed to continue making your teen miserable.

, Your teen knows they are fat. They know how to diet and exercise. People who point it out do not have your teen's best interests in mind. Teach them that advice is only to be given if asked for, and that it is not acceptable to comment on others' health or weight. These are important life lessons that unfortunately some people do not understand.

, If your child feels unsafe, or is assaulted, this is a situation for the police to get involved. If the school refuses to stop bullies, or allows a teacher to bully your teen, threatening to call a lawyer can make them reconsider their harmful actions.


Practice saying ""So you brought me here to ask if I intend to sue the school for the harm done to my child?"" This can make unhelpful teachers and principals stop in their tracks.

, You can educate people, but you cannot change the world. Your child will face bullying and discrimination. ""Just ignore them"" or ""Tell an adult"" won't always solve their problem. They need to know how to...


Walk away
Keep the bullies out of their heads (""I'm okay, you're mean"")
Tell trusted adults
Cope if an adult refuses to take it seriously, or sides with the bullies
Find emotional support

, This sends the message that people need to be below a certain BMI in order to be treated with human dignity, and that any bullying is the child's fault for failing to meet that standard. Make it very clear that bullying is always wrong, and your child's weight is their business (and theirs alone).

Love yourself, and show it.,
Don't allow ""fat"" to become a dirty word.,
Introduce them to the fat acceptance movement.,
Take plenty of time to do fun things with your teen.,
Practice patience and good listening.,
Don't pressure them.",How to Handle and Emotionally Support an Obese Teenager3," Children learn self-talk from their parents. If they hear you saying ""I need to diet more, I'm so fat,"" their thought will be ""If Mom's really fat, then by comparison, I must be a whale!"" Instead, treat yourself with the love that you'd show to a friend, or the same way you'd like your child to treat themselves. Recognize that your body is beautiful (yes, yours!) and let your teen see you recognizing that.


Avoid fad diets or restricting. This will encourage unhealthy eating patterns in your child (and be bad for your body too).

, This step may surprise you, but it matters. Your teen knows that they are fat, so if fat is something to be horribly ashamed of, your child will be horribly ashamed of themselves. Teach your child that everyone deserves respect, no matter how much adipose tissue they have.


Don't criticize people from being fat. In fact, there's no need to mention people's weight at all.
Don't treat fatty foods like the devil—teach moderation instead.
Remember that all fat people—like your teen—are more than the size of their pants.

, The fat acceptance movement holds that fat people deserve equal employment opportunities and other social forms of equality, and that they should not live in shame. This movement has been shown to actually increase the health of its followers, because they feel better about their bodies and are willing to take better care of them.The Health At Every Size movement emphasizes ways that fat people can feel healthier and take better care of their bodies.

, The focus shouldn't be on diet and exercise—put your relationship first, and have fun together. Health should be part of but not all of your relationship. Ask how their day was, talk about their hobbies and interests, and do fun things together. This will strengthen your relationship and the teen's self esteem.

, Your teen needs to know that you'll be there for them when they're struggling, and that their feelings matter to you. Patience and listening will help them know that you value what they have to say.


Practice validation. ""I'm happy/sorry/pleased/etc. to hear that."" ""That must have felt awesome/difficult/inspiring.""
Ask questions. ""Then what did you do?"" ""What do you think about that?""

, As an adult, it's tempting to want to take the reins and tell them what to do, because you're older and wiser. However, this doesn't help in the long run. Your teen needs to know how to weigh information, consider options, and decide what they want. Instead, offer unbiased information and support. When they feel responsible for their choices, they often choose well.

Recognize teens' need for independence and privacy is strong during these years.,
Choose wisely the times and locations where your teen is most likely to talk with you.

Teenagers want to feel cool and independent like their friends. Don't be afraid to lay down some rules and when they abide by them, give them a little bit of slack. DON'T allow them to do whatever they want when they are acting up and not following the rules. You are the parent, not the teenager.;
,,,(their friends, t.v., magazine article, etc.) as a way to take the spotlight off your teen.

, When your teen opens up to you, be grateful instead of prodding for more. Their likelihood of sharing will be greater if you do not try to know too much.

, School is not on the top 3 list of teens despite their academic goals.

,,, There is nothing more mundane to a teen than the question, ""How was school?""

Love them unconditionally.",How to Get Tweens to Talk," Your tween probably has several passions, and they would love it if someone cared about them. Ask some questions and get to know what's on their mind.


Let them teach you new information. People love to feel like experts.
Ask follow-up questions. ""So are they your new favorite band now?"" ""And what did you do after that?""
Pay attention to their outfits, books, music, and friendship activities for conversation idea starters.;
, This lets them know that you care what they have to say, and that you're willing to get feedback. It will encourage open communication. Ask what they think about the little things, and watch them open up.


""Melanie really wants to go to a football game this season, so I'm thinking of buying some tickets. Would you be interested in coming along?""
""I don't know what vegetable to make for supper. Do you want corn, broccoli, or carrots?""
""I know you think I dress like a funky old man, so before we're seen together, how about you help me pick out a shirt? I can't decide.""

, Friendships are important to many tweens, so they may be interested in talking about their social groups. Keep the questions open-ended.


""I heard that Lauren was having a pool party soon. Are you going to go?""
""Last week, you told me that Shawn had broken his arm. Is he doing okay?""

, You may talk one-on-one with no distractions, or while doing a task that doesn't take too much of your attention. Here are some examples of things to do while talking:


Driving
Cooking and housework
Arts and crafts (drawing, knitting, etc.)
Going for a walk
One of their hobbies

, Tell them about what you did today, and what you've been thinking about. This lets them know that you want them to be involved in your life. It may also encourage them to start telling you about their day.


""Work was rough today. My boss kept telling me my project wasn't good enough, and it seemed like nothing would please her. I'm so glad to be done today. What about you?""
""I did a ton of housework today—vacuuming, dusting, laundry, all the works. I noticed that your bedsheets are starting to get ripped, and I think it's time to get you new ones. Do you want to go to the store with me this week to pick some out?""

, If your son loves to draw, take out some colored pencils and sketch with him. If your daughter is into astronomy, look at stars together, and let her teach you about how black holes form.

, It's hard for children to feel heard if you're constantly interrupted by people or chores. Put away your phone, tell your other kids to ask Mommy instead if they need a parent, and let your child feel that they have your full attention.

, Letting them do most of the talking and steering the conversation will help them feel heard. Many psychologists recommend listening for 70% of a conversation and talking for 30% of it (the 70-30 rule).

, They no longer need you to pick their clothes or brush their hair, but that doesn't mean they don't need or want you. Reach out, and make yourself part of the fun parts of their lives.


Attend events they're a part of (band concerts, dances/plays, sports, math competition)
Drive them and their friends around
Take them to events: concerts, sports games, etc.
Drive them to lessons (piano, martial arts, whatever) and use the driving time to chat

, Bring them up when you find something related to it. (For example, have ""the talk"" when they stumble upon a sexualized advertisement.)

, This is okay—wanting space sometimes is part of growing up, no matter how close the parent/child relationship is. Give them their freedom and trust that they will come back to you when they are ready.


If you try introducing 1 or 2 topics and it falls flat, then they probably want to be left alone right now.
If they don't want to discuss a subject, try saying ""You don't have to tell me if you don't want to, but I'm here for you if you ever do."" This works wonders.

, Your tween needs to know that you want to understand, and that they can come to you without immediately feeling judged. Get the full story, keeping a calm and even tone of voice to let them know that you are not angry with them.


Get clarification. ""So she just assigned this mountain of homework with no notice.""
Ask how they felt. ""So you were mad at him when you found out he was talking behind your back?""
Ask what happened next. ""What did you do after she ran out of the classroom?""
Ask how they intend to handle it. ""What do you think you're going to do when you go back to school tomorrow?"" (At this point, they may ask for advice.)

, You can worry about punishments or what to do next later. Right now, the most important thing is that they know you understand and care.

, Let them know that it is okay to feel the way they feel, and it is not wrong or silly (even if it feels trivial to you). This helps develop their self-esteem and trust in you.


""That sounds rough.""
""I'm not surprised you were mad at him. You had every right to be, after what he said about you.""
""I'm so sorry to hear that.""

, While it's natural to want to help out your child, sometimes the only thing you can do is be quiet and let them figure it out on their own. Talking over them can stifle them and make them feel unwilling to talk to you, so check first to make sure that they want advice before you give it.


""Are you looking for advice, or do you just want to vent?""
""Is there any way I could help?""
""I'm sorry. I'm talking over you, aren't I? Please continue.""

, Encourage them to think for themselves about how to fix the problem, acting as a guide and sounding board rather than a lecturer. This encourages strong problem-solving skills and self-confidence. Here are some useful phrases.


""What do you think you could do?""
""What would the consequences of that action be?"" ""What might happen if you did that?""
""Do you think that would work well?""
""Would _____ make your idea even more effective?""
This strategy only works well when they have the energy to brainstorm. If not, ask if they are getting worn out and if they would like to talk about it later. If so, then switch to something fun.

, Letting them know that you care about them no matter what will keep your relationship strong.

Don’t be afraid to offer feedback.,
Offer an explanation.,
Use “I” statements instead of “you” statements.,
Don’t attack your teen’s character.,
Request a change in future behavior.,
Never criticize your teen about their body or appearance.,
Don’t compare your teen to their peers or siblings.,
Choose the right time to offer constructive criticism.",How to Give Your Teen Constructive Criticism1," Many parents and guardians are hesitant to offer constructive criticism to their teens. This is counterproductive as feedback helps teens grow into stronger, smarter adults. Your teen will be more receptive to feedback if it is a normal part of their lives., Teenagers are at an age when they are beginning to question everything and they want to know why certain things are required of them. Therefore, offering your teen an explanation may help them to understand why you are asking them to do something differently and to see why the request is important.


Try saying something like, ""I know it's a drag to have to do chores, but I need you to do the dishes every night. I can't do all of the house work alone and your help goes a long way.""

, Rather than framing feedback in terms of “you,” try using “I” instead. Using an “I” statement will make your teen feel less defensive as the statement is about you instead of them. This can help teens become more open to constructive criticism.Instead of saying, “You should really work on being more optimistic,” try saying, “I really enjoy the optimistic side of your personality.”
Don’t say, “You make me so angry when you leave your socks on the stairs!” Instead try, “I get upset when you leave your socks on stairs. Can you work on putting them in the laundry room instead?”

, Instead of criticizing their character, instead offer criticism of the behavior or a decision the teen made. Criticizing a teen’s character will foster self-doubt, or even self-loathing. This can be particularly harmful to a teen’s mental health.Don’t say, “You are a complete slob. Clean your room!” Instead try saying, “I know you are busy with school and soccer practice, but I need you to make keeping your room clean a priority.”
Avoid saying things like, “You’re the most irresponsible member of this family!” Instead try saying, “I am very upset that you neglected to pick your sister up after school today. I need you to work on being a responsible member of this family.”

, Instead of pointing out negative behavior in the present, ask your teen to change her actions the next time around. This method of constructive criticism will go a lot further than simply criticizing your teen’s present behavior.Don’t say, “You need to stop leaving the front door open!” Instead try saying, “In the future I need you to close the door behind you when you take the dog out.”
Avoid saying, “I can’t believe you spent the night drinking with friends. You need to sober up now!” Instead try saying, “I am extremely disappointed you chose to drink. I advise you to make better decisions in the future. We will discuss the repercussions of your actions tomorrow morning.”

, Teens are under immense pressure from their peers, the media, and even their own parents to look a certain way. Criticizing your teen’s body and appearance can cause damage mentally and physically, even leading to serious medical conditions such as anorexia.For example, try building your daughter’s self-esteem by taking her out for a new haircut, makeup, or clothes that flatter her body type. You could say, “Amy, it’s been a while since I’ve taken you to get your hair done. Do you want to make an appointment for next week?”
Instead of making comments about your son’s acne, take him shopping for some new skin care products the next time you head out for your own. Try saying, “Mike, I’m heading to the mall tomorrow night to grab some new moisturizer. I heard they had a new line of men’s skincare products. Do you want to come with me to check it out?""
Try cooking healthy dinners together as a family rather than criticizing your teen’s weight. You could say, “I’m not feeling very healthy lately because we’ve been eating out too much. Do you want to help me plan some healthy dinners we can all enjoy as a family?”

, Comparison is never a good strategy for offering constructive criticism. When you compare your teen to someone else, you are fostering feelings of inadequacy, which can have long reaching negative effects. Instead, focus on your teen, their behavior, and the things they might be able to improve.Instead of saying, “Alan, I wish you could be respectful like your brother,” try saying, “Alan, I really want you to work on having more respect for your grandparents.”

, Don’t criticize your teen in front of their friends. Your teenager is more likely to respect your criticism if it is offered from a place of kindness and concern, and not in the company of others, which can lead to embarrassment and shame. You should also refrain from constructive criticism when your teen is emotionally overwhelmed.


Take some time to talk to your teen when no one else is around. Try saying, “Andrea, I am concerned about your grades but didn’t want to mention it in front of your friends. Can we sit down and talk about it one-on-one?”
If your teen is having an emotionally difficult day, is dealing with personal drama, or is overwhelmed with academic obligations, it is probably not the best time to offer feedback. Instead opt for a time when they are having a good day.

Let them know you'll be there for them.,
If your preteen girl gets her period, don't make a huge deal out of it.,
Remember, she is still a kid.,
Occasionally do things together.,
Don't criticize your preteen.,
Don't judge them.,
Never play favorites.,
Always be fair.,
Give them privacy when asked.,
Don't punish them for accidents.,
Don't push them into being a different person.,
Don't set expectations too high.,
Avoid being an overprotective parent.,
Occasionally let your inner child out.",How to Get Along With a Preteen," With a preteen's new hormones, body development, the new pressure to fit in, more bullying and peer pressure, it's no surprise that they'll likely need some support. Although it might sound like second nature to go to a parent, for a preteen with these new problems it can be difficult to go to a parent, especially if they think they may be judged or punished. However, if the child seems not to want to talk about something, it's not your fault; it can actually be good for them to solve problems on their own. If the child has unexplained scars, marks or bruises; seems sad or upset even when something good happens; shows sign of an eating disorder; or is showing signs that (s)he may be abused, then it's time to step in.Take him\her to a doctor and get rid of the root problem. They will likely be mad, but they'll thank you for it in the future.;
, If you stress over it too much she'll think it's a scary, unnatural thing. If you tell every one she might be humiliated. It might be natural, but the fact that it happens from inside her body embarrasses her.

, You can expect more responsibility out of them, but don't force responsibility that should be given to a teen or adult unless you are 100% sure that they can handle it and that they don't mind.


What they should do: Turn in schoolwork, study, clean their room etc.
What they might have to wait till they are older: Babysitting, taking care of a baby while you sleep etc.

, For a preteen, it can be more relaxing than trying to talk to you with everyone else around, and can strengthen the bond.

, Nobody wants to be called fat, ugly, bad etc. But do offer positive criticism. Example:


Positive: That's a great top you're wearing. Maybe it would look good with a scarf.
Negative: That's an ugly shirt. Try a scarf.

, Just because your child is goth doesn't mean they are about to kill themselves.

, There is a fine line between being fair and playing favorites. If they are the ones being favored, they might become spoiled or self-centered and may struggle keeping their spot. If they are not being favored, they will have lower self-esteem and be more sensitive. It also puts them at risk for depression.


Playing Favorites: Giving one child more gifts or attention, a less severe punishment even though they did the same thing, giving them different bedtimes even though they are the same age etc.
Being Fair: Giving more attention to a much younger child or baby, giving them an earlier bedtime than older siblings, etc

, Don't spoil them but don't be the only person to not give them a present on their birthday. When punishing, do not make it too harsh.

, Preteens need privacy just as teens do. But if they are in privacy more than a few hours a day or skipping meals take them to a doctor. It might be a serious problem.

, If they get a bad grade, just tell them you're there to help them if they need it. If they accidentally drop your favorite cup, tell them it's okay and you know it's not their fault.

, Expecting them to be respectful and responsible is good. Pushing them to become someone else is not.

, There's nothing wrong with expecting at least a few A's on a report card. But expecting all A's is setting standards too high; they will struggle often and will think they are not good enough for you.

, Parents like this often want the best for their children, but they may end up causing more harm than good. Keep a close eye on them, but allow some freedom. Let them make little decisions once in a while. A good example is to give them an allowance and see if they spend it wisely.

, Get messy in the mud, eat ice cream, or just have fun.

Begin with a positive statement.,
Sandwich constructive criticism between two positive statements.,
End with another positive statement.",How to Give Your Teen Constructive Criticism2," Rather than launching into what you think the teen needs to improve upon, begin your conversation with positive feedback. Focusing on the positive at the outset, instead of the negative, will help your teen be more receptive to the constructive criticism that follows.For example, you can say, “Anna, I think you are doing a really great job making your art and music lessons a priority.”

, Once you’ve given your teen some positive feedback related to the situation, let them know your thoughts on how they can improve their performance or behavior. Be honest, but not overly critical or mean with your feedback.


Try saying, “Since you’re devoting so much time to art and music, I notice your grades are slipping. We need to work together to bring that D in chemistry up to a passing grade.”

, After you’ve given your teen criticism, it’s important to remind them again of the positive work they are accomplishing socially, emotionally, artistically, or academically. This will help remind the teen of all the great things they have been accomplishing and can even boost self esteem.You can end by saying, “While you need to work on your chemistry grade, I was really excited to see you got a B on your English paper, Anna! You should be really proud of yourself for working so hard on it and earning an awesome grade!”

Encourage your teen daily.,
Let them make mistakes.,
Make sure criticism is only a small part of interactions with your teen.,
Develop your relationship with the teen.,
Seek professional help if your teen is struggling with self-esteem.",How to Give Your Teen Constructive Criticism3," It’s important that teens develop a positive self-image. Healthy self-esteem will help them successfully transition to adulthood, and daily encouragement can be a key part of this process. Try giving your child words of encouragement on a regular basis.If your teen is taking on extra responsibilities around the house, such as folding laundry or unloading the dishwasher without being asked, make sure you give them positive feedback.
If your child is struggling with school and making an extra effort on their homework, make sure you encourage them to keep doing so.

, Making mistakes is an important part of being human. Don’t shelter your teen or make decisions for them. Instead let them make their own decisions and mistakes. This will help them see you have confidence in their abilities to decide things on their own and bear the weight of any consequences.For example, don’t interfere with your child’s romantic endeavors unless their partner is posing a risk to their mental or physical health. Let them make their own choices and learn from mistakes. If you do perceive a threat, however, you should intervene immediately.
If your child wants to spend the night before a big game playing video games until midnight, don’t interfere. If they are exhausted and perform poorly, they will learn an important lesson about prioritizing their time and energy.

, Encouraging and reinforcing your teen’s strengths and abilities should instead take priority. Reminding your teen of their talents, abilities, and strengths will help them build self-esteem. Try making a habit of telling them they are good at school, sports, art, or being a good friend or family member. Building them up will help pave the way for their entry into the world as a confident adult., Your teen will be more likely to respond to constructive criticism if you have a strong relationship as your foundation. Some things you can do to improve your relationship with your teen includes:



Empathetic listening. When your teen shares something with you, don’t just acknowledge it. Try to consider their perspective and how they might be feeling. For example, if your teen shares with you about a fight she had with a friend, then she might be feeling worried, sad, frustrated, confused, or a combination of these emotions. Use this understanding to help you respond appropriately.

Trust building and respect. Offering your teen your trust and respect will help them to feel more comfortable with you. Avoid nagging your teen or constantly looking over their shoulder. Allow them to do things on their own, while also letting them know that you are there for them if they need you.

Acceptance and non-judgement. When your teen shares something personal with you, do not reject them or judge them for it. Let them know that you love and accept them no matter what.

, While it’s normal for teens to doubt themselves, teens struggling with serious self-esteem issues are at a higher risk for mental illness, suicide, and violence. Talk to your insurance provider about what mental health services are covered by your plan, and seek out a mental health provider who specializes in teen issues.

Encourage them to set priorities.,
Build self-discipline.,
Find something motivating.,
Use competition.",How to Encourage Your Teen to Procrastinate Less1," Remind your teen to do important tasks first, then move onto smaller or less important ones. Have them write down everything they need to do, then number them in order of importance. That way, your teen will know how to attack the list of things that needs to get done.You can help your teen set priorities on weekly basis, or help them tackle their homework this way each day after school. This is also helpful in planning projects.;
, Help your teen build their discipline by learning cause and effect. For example, they must complete their chores before they go out with friends. Have them use a schedule to plan their time so that they know what’s next and what to anticipate. Getting into a routine can help with discipline.Joining a sport, taking music lessons, or doing other activities can help your child build discipline through practice, repetition, and sticking with something even when it’s difficult.Help your teen understand that they don't need to resist every unpleasant activity and emotion. Resisting emotions only intensifies them. Instead, help them practice dealing with them in a moderate way., Help your teen brainstorm ways to stay motivated on tasks. Less exciting tasks may be easy to push off or forget about. Keep your teen motivated by having a reward for getting tasks done. For example, they are allowed to watch television once they complete their homework or can go on the computer once their chores are completed.Get feedback from your teen as to what motivates them. They may want to finish homework to watch television, play on their tablet, eat a snack, or get dessert.

, If your child is motivated by competition, devise ways they can beat their past performance and improve their stats, so to speak. For example, if your child cleans the bathroom in 30 minutes, see if they can make it just as clean in 25 minutes. If they complete five chores in one week, see if they can complete six or seven the next week. Have your child be competitive with themselves, their time, and their performance.You can use competition for homework as well. For example, your child might want to see how many math problems they can finish in 10 minutes, then try to beat their record the next day.
Don’t encourage siblings to compete against each other, as this can damage their relationship.
When possible, try to make things genuinely interesting. Stimulate their sense of natural wonder rather than having them rush through everything.

Keep your teen busy at home.",How to Encourage Your Teenager to Get a Job," Before you can even start to motivate or encourage your teens to get a job you have to get them excited about the idea. Most teens will question the reason for everything until they are satisfied with the answer.


Usually, it is not that the teen is “lazy” or that he does not want to do what is being asked of him, it is rather that he needs to have a personal connection to the motivation, a reason for why he is going to do this or why he is being asked to do it.;
, For the teen, motivational reasons for wanting to get a job could include:


The chance to get valuable work experience.
The chance to improve inter-personal skills.
The chance to learn new skills like time management and more.
The freedom to have spending money which teaches additional skills like responsibility and budgeting.

, The teen that has shown no interest in getting a job may not be lazy but may be dealing with other problems.


Teens that are playing sports or trying to excel in school realistically may not have enough free time to pursue a low-paying, part time job and may not want their prior commitments to suffer. Over scheduled kids are often overwhelmed and may not see a way to add something else to his already overly busy schedule.
Another issue could be a sense of low self-esteem. The teen does not want to try to get a job because he already feels as if no one will want him anyway. For this teen, preparation will be crucial because rejection could send him into a dangerous spiral of depression and despair.

, Most kids will have some sense of fear because this is a new process for them. As a parent, it is important to separate normal fear and anxiety from the laziness and proceed accordingly.

, If your teen is under age (18 in most states) help him to research the child labor laws in your state so that you will have an idea of how many hours he can work, what times he will be restricted to working and other legal information like wages, holidays and more.


This will not only help you to know when your teen will be working but may help him to be better prepared for the interview process.
You may also need to find out if he will need a work permit before starting a job.

, Most places do have applications online but others require you to come in and ask for one. Ask your teen if he would like for you to go with him to do this - he may have you wait in the car or he may want to do this on his own.


Set a reasonable goal with him and then make sure that he complies with the goal. Asking him to get five applications for a day is not asking too much.

, Now is the tough part. The teen will need to fill out the application for himself. Answer questions and clarify things if he is stuck but do not stand over him while he does it and do not offer to fill them out for him. That is undermining the entire process.


Remember, you are not the one that is trying to get a job. Have him look up information for himself but give him some hints about where to find it.
If he does not know his social security number by heart, for instance, you can tell him it is in your baby book and then let him go and get it.

, Most teen's resumes will have virtually nothing on them beyond their school information but that is fine. The key is to teach him the process of creating and then updating a resume.


If you have not already done so, use a resume making program or a template to make the process easier (most word processing programs have many built in).

, Before your teen takes any of the applications back to turn in, talk to him about rejection. Remind him that almost no one gets a job on his first try to that he likely to be passed over for a lot of the jobs that he is applying for. Eventually though, he will get called for an interview.

, When your teen gets a call about an interview, you'll need to run through the basics of the interview process with him. Go over tips for what to wear but do not micromanage. Offer to do mock interviews with your teen so that he gets a feel for what to expect.


Ask him questions that he is likely to encounter during the interview and let him answer as he sees ft. After the mock interview is finished go over it with him. Did it go well in his opinion? What does he think could have been better?
While it might be tempting to correct every single thing you found “wrong” wait for him to ask before offering advice. Part of the process is learning to fail with grace and dignity. Your teens will never learn that if they know you are always going to swoop in and fix everything for them.

, It is important to be positive about your teen's chances of getting a job but not overly so. Be realistic but try not to make it all sound hopeless and dour.


Your teen needs to know the reality of what he is facing: adults who can work more hours in the same workplace, kids with better penmanship, a better appearance or better interviewing skills.
Remind him that most of those things are things that he can work on - he can’t change competition in the workplace but he can be the best that he can be and that is good enough.

, Remind your teen of the goal that they set for themselves and what they are working for, but do not withhold allowances or cut off all money thinking that this will be the key.


This can backfire and make them think that your love is conditional at a very critical time in their development. This can impact their self-esteem and may cause them to stop trying.
Your job as a parent is to have healthy, happy and well-rounded kids that make it to adulthood with most of their joy and positive energy still in place.

, Some teens will resist any effort and will do so with a lot of eye rolling, back talk and even outright disrespect.


The most important thing is to remind them that although they are almost adults, they are still living in your home and they need to follow the rules established there and contribute to the household.
Set up a meeting with your teen and establish an agenda. Take a firm but loving approach and tell them that there will be no more of their behavior and that they will be following through on a job plan

, For example: ""I will look for 5 jobs to apply to by the end of this week. I will follow up on 2 jobs by the end of next week."" Do not critique their plan unless it is obvious that they are not even trying.

, At this point, some of the words of the experts are going to have to give way to what works. If you cannot motivate your child out of a sense of pride or responsibility, hit him where it will hurt.


For example, you could tell your teen ""if you fail to meet your goals, then your cell phone bill will not be paid for the month."" Some family plans will let you turn numbers off for brief periods- so if you need to do that you can do so without penalty.
When the teen has to use your phone for social or school related things, then he might pay attention to what you are trying to say.

, If you are just letting your teen slouch on the couch while he is home and not earning his keep, then you are sending mixed signals.


Give him chores beyond what he normally does and tell him that if he is going to live there without a job then he will have to pitch in more.
Sometimes one week of doing some of the more menial house tasks is more than enough to get even the most resistant teen up and out the door.

Ask open-ended questions.,
Listen to your teen.,
Repeat or reflect back what they are saying.,
Express empathy.Empathy is the ability to understand your teen's experience from their perspective.Begin to show empathy by respecting the teen's intelligence, and experience.",How to Gently Influence Teenagers1," When trying to gently influence your teen it is important to keep communication open to better understand where they are coming from. The best way to have open communication with your teen is to ask open-ended questions.Open-ended questions are questions in which the answer requires more than a simple “yes”,“no”, or one-word answer.This method allows for your teen to share as much detail as they feel comfortable with, while urging a longer response. Try asking questions the following way.


Instead of asking, “How was your day?” say “Tell me about school today.”
Ask them a question about their interests. “If you could be a professional athlete, what sport and team would you play for, and why?”
Try asking “what would happen if” questions, such as “What would happen if you talked to the coach about it?”;
, Another key to open communication is to listen to your teen. Listen to their ideas, complaints, interests, and dreams. Knowing your teen better helps you determine how to nudge them or gently influence their thoughts and behavior. Having a better understanding of their experience, what they care about, and their hopes for the future, helps you give better suggestions specific to your teen. Use this information to start gently making comments about how to proceed in the direction they're interested in.


Make eye contact to show your teen you are interested in what they have to say.If you are able, put away any distractions (such as your phone) and try to limit your multitasking (such as talking to them while making dinner).Avoid using your own experience as examples, or taking the ""I am more experienced than you"" approach. It is likely your teen will react poorly or just stop listening.

, To ensure you are hearing your teen correctly and to show them that you are listening, occasionally reflect back or repeat what they are telling you.This will help show your teen you are listening to them and that you are really trying to understand what they are going through. Also, in doing this, you have to opportunity to gently influence better communication in your teen. Show understanding and gently influence better communication by trying the following.Have them pause and repeat what they said directly back to them, “Hold on, I want to make sure I'm hearing you right. You said you feel like the other girls in your class hate you because you answer the teachers questions?”
Ask for some clarification if they have communicated part of the event but not everything. “Okay. You talked about what happened, but how did it make you feel?”
Offer some slight interpretation while gently influencing communication of their feelings. “From the way you are talking about it, it sounds like you are frustrated because you want to do well in class but also want to be liked by your classmates.”

, Be there for the teen and express understanding for what they might be going through or how difficult it may be. Showing empathy will help your teen feel like you are on their side and help them open up to your advice or suggestions. Express empathy by doing the following.


Say supportive statements such as “It has to be really upsetting to work so hard at something and feel like you're still struggling.”
Ask them to help you with empathy. “I know how I see it, but I want to understand what it is like for you. Can you help me understand?”
If they are upset about something that occurred, get upset with them (at least a little). “I can't believe they did that!”

Set clear expectations.,
Break down large tasks.,
Encourage time management.,
Work on orderliness.,
Create a distraction-free zone.",How to Encourage Your Teen to Procrastinate Less2," If your teen is procrastinating on tasks at home, be clear in what you expect of them. When it comes to school, you may tell your child that you expect them to put in a good effort, not just get all A’s. If you ask your teen to clean the kitchen, be specific in what needs to be done such as washing the dishes, clearing the counter, washing the floor, etc.If you have certain expectations for their role at home, put these things in writing so that they can reference them if they need to.

, A large project may seem overwhelming to your teen, and the thought of starting it may worry them, leading them to avoid it. If your child is delaying a project, encourage them to start working on it. They don’t necessarily have to complete the whole task, but they can at least complete a part of it.For example, help your teen break down their research assignment by having them first choose a topic then researching it and writing notes. Once it comes time to write, help them create an outline and fill it in. Make sure, however, that you aren’t the one doing the actual work!

, Your teen might wait until the last minute to start a project, only to run out of time or do a sloppy job in order to finish. If your teen tends to underestimate the time needed to complete something or think they have plenty of time to finish, help them learn to better manage their time. For example, have them plan extra time than they think they might need to account for any problems that might occur.For example, if your child thinks they need two hours to write a paper, tell them to plan for two and a half hours so that they can properly edit and review it.

, From supplies to ideas, help your teen get organized. When doing homework, make sure your teen has all the necessary things nearby, like a pen, pencil, calculator, or other items. Create a box or area for school supplies or project supplies. Encourage your teen to use sticky notes as a way to remember what needs to get done or go with them in the morning.If your child really struggles to get organized, color code things and have a system for what goes where and what comes first.

, Have an area set aside specifically for doing their homework. If your teen usually works at the kitchen table yet is easily distracted by the television, pets, siblings, or other things, move their homework area. Choose a space that is quiet and clutter-free. It should be well-lit and comfortable, yet not distracting.Put a desk or table in a quiet place in your home and designate this the homework space.
Consider having your teen turn off their phone during study time and use a program or browser extension that allows you to block certain distracting sites.

"
"
Consider problems with anxiety.,
Assess problems with inattention or learning.,
Teach positive thinking.",How to Encourage Your Teen to Procrastinate Less3," If your teen is a perfectionist and uses procrastination as a way to come up with perfect ideas, or just won’t start a project until they’ve created it perfectly in their mind, they may have symptoms of anxiety. Some signs of anxiety include perfectionism, fear of making mistakes, constantly worrying, intrusive thoughts of worry, inability to relax, “what if” fears, and self-criticism.If you think your teen may have problems with anxiety, talk to a school counselor or therapist in your community to help them cope with these symptoms.

, If your child just can’t seem to sit still or pay attention, this can be a problem greater than simple distraction. Your child may want to accomplish projects but lack the skills to stay on task or maintain their attention on one item. If your child struggles with learning and puts things off due to them being extremely difficult, this might indicate a learning disorder. Both attention and learning problems can be addressed by a psychologist, who can then offer recommendations and accommodations for school and home.Set an appointment with the school psychologist or see a psychologist at a local mental health clinic.

, A teen that thinks negatively about their work or its outcome may be prone to negative thoughts that lead to procrastination. If you hear your teen talking negatively about their abilities or performance, challenge them to see themselves or their work more positively. Build hope and confidence in their abilities.For example, if they say, “I can’t start my paper because I don’t have any good ideas,” challenge this. Say, “You’ve written lots of interesting papers in the past and I’m sure you can write this one, too. What are some different ways of looking at your topic?”

Create a stable and loving environment.,
Model the behaviors you wish to influence in your teen.,
Avoid negative communication.,
Act according to your own beliefs and values.,
Show them how to cope with their emotions.",How to Gently Influence Teenagers2," Your teenager is testing their limits and exploring independence out in the world. Allow your home to be a place of love and support where you can offer them gentle guidance instead of constantly pushing back or arguing. Create a stable environment by modeling calm, reflective practices that your teen will be able to apply to their own life as they push for independence., Role models can have positive or negative effects on a teenager.If you would like to influence certain behaviors in your teen, begin by showing them how it is done. Influence is often greatest when you avoid telling them what to do and instead illustrate the qualities you wish to see in them such as hard work, kindness, or respect. Consider the following specific ways in which you can gently influence your teen.Adopt a growth mindset. Show your teen that in every experience there is an opportunity to learn and grow.
Illustrate that failure is necessary for success. Allow them to see your failures as well as how you use them to succeed.
Talk to them about inspirational heroes. Discuss who your heroes are and ask your teen who theirs are (and why).
Participate in initiative building activities with them where you both work towards completing something, allowing them to take their own path or their own initiative., It is possible to gently influence your teen without being aware of it; and sometimes without intending to. Any negative communication your teen witnesses in you, will influence how they speak to others as well as how they feel about themselves. Be careful about how you communicate with your teen and how you communicate with others in front of your teen.Try to avoid the following.


Nagging. Nagging can be continuous urging or persistent faultfinding.
Curse words.
Name-calling.
Blame speech. Try speaking using “I” statements instead of “you” statements, such as “I feel upset!” rather than “You make me so mad!”
Shaming. Avoiding shaming is especially important for children and teens.

, Teens are often told what to think or believe through media, popularity, and peer pressure. It is difficult for them to know how to navigate what everyone else is telling them without a strong internal sense of direction. You possibly have a strong sense of who you are and what you want from your principles, beliefs, and values. Show your teen how to act according to your values, despite what the media or other people say.Gently influence them to stay true to who they are by applying something like the following.


Treat others with interest and respect. Show the teen that you should care about others as people, not just in how others behaviors reflect on you.
If you value family, make your family a priority and let your teen see it.
Work hard and celebrate work accomplishments if you would like your teen to have a good work ethic.

, Regulating emotions can be very difficult for a teenager. Show your teen how to handle their strong emotions in a healthy way, by behaving like you would want them to behave. Modeling this behavior for your teen may take some work on managing these emotions in yourself. Work towards a healthier expression of emotions for you and your teen by adopting the following.


If you are angry, try not to react violently (throwing things, screaming, etc.). Instead state that you are angry, take a cooling-off period, and then talk through your anger.Respond to negativity with grace and forgiveness. Process through your emotions by seeking out the support of others.Deal with your emotions in a healthy way such as through a creative activity (journaling) or an exercise (running) and share your process with your teen.

"
"
Point out obstacles or inconsistencies towards their goals.,
Support their autonomy.,
Encourage attention to schoolwork or work.,
Guide towards healthy sexual behavior.,
Caution your teen against media influence.",How to Gently Influence Teenagers3," As you are communicating with your teen there may be some points where you objectively notice some inconsistencies. Try and discuss these very gently with your teen. Try asking them if its okay to tell them what you see.Then, using some of the open communication techniques, gently point out contradictions.


Begin by restating what they want. “So you really want to make the band?”
If they have shared the emotional aspect of it, confirm that as well. “You are worried that you are not going to get in?”
Gently point out the problem. “You've been spending a lot of time at football practice. If this is more important to you, maybe you should spend time practicing guitar instead.”

, You want to gently influence your teenager. Hopefully, your goal is to influence them so they can navigate their life a little bit easier and be more successful and happy as they grow. As you are gently guiding them along, try not to forget the goal of functioning well on their own one day. Support your teens efforts to be independent and try things on their own.The more supported they feel by you, the more likely they are to come to you for guidance or advice when things get difficult.


Your teen's brain is still growing and developing. They are learning new ways to prioritize, critically analyze, and identify consequences in their actions and the larger world. Support their autonomy but help them to make safe choices when necessary.

, It can be difficult at times for teens to see the importance of schoolwork or a strong work ethic. Help your teen connect how they perform now with where their goals are in order to influence them to put a little more effort into their work.Encourage your teen to talk with you about their struggles and develop a plan to overcome those challenges together.


Know your teens dreams, wishes, and aspirations. Not every teen dreams of being a doctor. If your teen loves building or woodworking, encourage them to focus their efforts on mathematics and engineering.
If your teen dreams of going to a particular college, help them research where their grades need to be or what other clubs and activities could eventually help their application.
Influence your teen by showing them the pride and sense of accomplishment you can achieve from something you worked hard at.

, Teenagers are put under an incredible amount of stress during a time where they are trying to determine who they are. Help your teen develop a healthy sense of self and a respect for themselves and their bodies. Encourage them towards safe and healthy sexual behavior based on their beliefs and their comfort, rather than what others think they should or should not be doing. Remember that your teen will be influenced by your beliefs and your actions as well. Tyr to gently influence health sexual behavior with the following. Make sure your teen is aware of the risks of unhealthy or unsafe sexual behaviors, such as unintended pregnancy, STDs, emotional consequences of sexual activity before they are ready.
If you have had a difficult experience in your teenage years, talk to your teen about it. Mention that “I was very hard for me, and I wouldn't want you to have to go through something like that.”
Encourage your teen to ask questions, and give honest answers.
Set family or house expectations (such as age they can date, or what time they need to be home) that may impact your teens sexual behavior and stick to them., Teenagers can be influenced by anything in their environment. With the use of technology today, a large influence on teens comes from media.Media influence can be deliberate, such as advertising aimed at their age group, or indirect such as sexualisation of images, shows, and music.Talk to your teen about their ideas and gently challenge where those ideas come from. Encourage them to make their own decisions about what is beautiful, exciting, or cool instead of following what media or popular culture tells them. Caution your teen against potential media influence of the following.


Body image, weight, or the idea of what is beautiful.
Violence.
Risky behaviors such as smoking, drinking, or criminal activity.

, It'll be easier having him or her stay with you if he or she has already become somewhat acquainted with your teen.

, Tell him or her to be understanding and hospitable so that your exchange student may feel as comfortable and welcome as possible.

, Teens will be teens, so just keep in mind that things will get better.

, Your teen may feel that you are giving the exchange student more attention and care than you are giving him or her, particularly if your own child is accustomed to being the only child in the family.

Remember that a teen, especially one hell bent on getting a piercing or a tattoo, is either influenced by peers and/or popular idols, or is flaunting his/her rebellious attitude in the opinion of some.,
Decide how to deal with whatever the source is.,
Show them the negative side of getting tattoos.,
Make them realize the long term consequences.,
Warn them that body piercings aren't much safer.,
Health issues aside, make teenagers see the financial aspects as well.,
Don't hold back information of disfigurements caused by tattoos or piercings, for fear that the teen might find it too gory.,
While discussing the dangers and implications involved, be sure that you don't sound too bossy or commanding.,
Getting a tattoo or a piercing to show off the dark, aggressive side, however, is a bigger problem.,
See that the whole point of getting body art is self-expression.",How to Discourage Teen Body Piercings and Tattoos," Some others believe that teens just like the way it looks and want a tattoo or piercing for purely aesthetic reasons.;
, The former is somewhat easier to manage. It's common for girls to have their ears pierced at a very young age, but getting more piercings in other parts of their body (this applies to both boys and girls) can be an attempt by teens to fit in with their peer group. Make the person see that what seems trendy and fashion-forward now may seem like a huge ugly splotch to them later.

, For one, tattoos are expensive and very painful. For another, they have permanent consequences. Tattoos that are easily visible and somewhat scary make it harder to get a steady, 'clean' job. Tattoo removal is even more expensive than actually getting it done, not to mention excruciatingly painful.

, What is considered beautiful now, may be seen as being remarkably hideous later on. Make the teen imagine having to give a job interview, or meeting a new friend, with the words 'sexy babe' tattooed on the neck. Absurd, isn't it?

, There are numerous complications that accompany piercings in areas other than the earlobes- prolonged bleeding, scarring, tetanus, abscesses, boils and chronic infections (eg.halitosis), hepatitis B and C infections, prolonged infections and often permanent disfigurement of the particular body part. Allergic reactions are also very common. Makes one wonder why people bother getting pierced in the first place.

, They have to realize that for adults, body art is perceived as more of an investment, not a temporary, fleeting fashion rage. They would, after all, be responsible for costs of any medical treatment required in case of an infection or other harmful reactions.

, After all if he/she is ready to go for it, it's necessary to see the possible results so that the person can be prepared.

, Teens are hard-wired to rebel against their parents and authority figures according to some. Make sure you come across as involved and concerned. Find out WHY your daughter or son wants a tattoo or piercing in the first place, and suggest alternate means and safer ideas.

, Teens are usually rebellious by nature, but actually being willing to get their body tampered with is very dangerous. If you suspect that this is the case, never EVER over-react and get carried away by your emotions. Wait till you calm down. Your teenager may be rejecting your advice or your beliefs, but remember that this is also a cry for help and attention. Ask yourself how to help him/her out. If depression and increased aggression are evident, counseling may be required to get into the root of any underlying problem.

, It may seem drastic to some people, especially parents, but everyone is entitled to his/her opinion. If your teenager is sure that she/he wants a tattoo, make him/her wait for a few years. If later, as an adult, the tattoo is still significant, it's a matter a personal choice.

Treat them like a teen, not a child or adult.,
Be flexible with their freedoms.,
Focus on trust, not suspicion.",How to Deal With Your Teenager (for Parents)1," Your teen is not a small child anymore, so it’s important to adjust your expectations and not treat them like a child. However, teens are not quite adults and cannot be held responsible as an adult. The teenage brain is in the middle of a critical stage of development, and teens need you to help them through this part of their lives. They are not quite developed in their decision-making, reasoning, or in managing impulsivity. Instead of assuming they will act and think like an adult, be prepared for some seemingly irrational behavior.If you’re disappointed because your teen keeps making the same mistakes, have some compassion and recognize that your teen is still learning a lot and nowhere near being an adult yet. Part of being a teenager is learning through failure and mistakes. Frame the negative experiences in their lives as learning opportunities.;
, If your teen is making an effort and showing their responsibility, allow more freedom. If they are making bad choices, be more restrictive. Ultimately, show them that their behavior gives them freedom or restrictions and their own choices determine their outcomes.If your teen is asking for permission to do something you’re inclined to say no to, hear them out. Say, “I’m not comfortable with this, but I want you to show me that you’re responsible enough to go to this concert with your friends.”
Likewise, say, “I gave you freedom and you weren’t prepared for it, so we need to scale back now.”

, It’s true that teens can get into a lot of trouble, but don’t focus your attention on the bad things they’ve done in the past or the risks they might face. Even if your teen has greatly betrayed your trust, it is important for both of you to repair that trust. If you think your teen may be up to something, have them explain it to you fully. Ask questions instead of jumping to conclusions. If you’re not sure, say to your teen, “I’m concerned, but I’m choosing to trust you on this.”If your child does break your trust, take away a privilege and have them earn it back. For example, if they stay out long after curfew, say they cannot drive for one week, and they must earn the use of the car after that by showing they can be responsible with time.

, You may have to work to earn his or her approval, but he or she should do the same to earn yours. Like in any relationship, the first impression is important, but often it will be entirely wrong.

, They may not know how to treat you at first, so be prepared for roughhousing and/or shyness when you first come.

,, They'll be eager to hear from you and it will be interesting for them to see how these new experiences are affecting you.

Put yourself in your exchange student's shoes; read up on his or her culture, ask him or her about his or her interests, and really make an effort to be hospitable and warm toward your new guest.

,
Have patience.",How to Deal With Teens and Exchange Students3,", At first, your exchange student will most likely be nervous and anxious to make a good first impression. You probably want to as well, so remember to be empathetic and understanding.

Stay calm.,
Establish boundaries and stick to them.,
Enforce consequences.,
Be reasonable.,
Handle conflicts.,
Use effective communication.",How to Deal With Your Teenager (for Parents)2," If you are angry, take a moment and gather yourself. Take a few deep breaths or walk away and come back when you’re calmer. This way, you’re more likely to give fair and reasonable consequences. Especially if your teen knows how to push your buttons or set you off, it’s especially important to keep your cool and not discipline them out of frustration or irritation. If you feel anger or upset coming on, tune into your body. Notice where you feel upset: do you have knots in your stomach, feel shaky, or start sweating? Notice these signs and recognize it’s time to back off.Keep a journal of how you feel when you’re upset. This can help you blow off steam and reveal patterns in you or your child’s behavior.

, The teen should know what is expected of them. Set some boundaries around when they can go out, what time they need to come home, and what their role is in the home. Teens will want to push the boundaries, so remain firm when you set a limit.Discuss these boundaries with your teen, and let them have a say in how they work. They are more likely to follow rules that they helped establish.
Put boundaries and rules in writing so that there’s no confusion as to what’s expected of your teen. Have the teen sign off on the agreed rules. If they break the rules, you can bring out the signed document.
For example, you may decide that your teen is not allowed to do extra activities without completing their chores or housework. If your teen makes a request, say,, ""Oh, that sounds fun, but you never did your chores this week. I'm so sorry you can't go."" Make it clear that they can go once their chores are complete.

, Learning to navigate problem behaviors can be tricky. If you’re too lenient, your teen may think they have no limits or you don’t take their behavior seriously. However, if you’re too strict, your teen may grow to resent you or they may rebel. Be firm in enforcing consequences, and don’t let your teen sway your decision. When your teen breaks a rule, calmly tell them what they did and why they are in trouble. When deciding on a consequence, make sure it’s proportional to the behavior and not given out of anger.Do not become a dictator. This can cause your teenager to rebel and become resentful. If they do something wrong, don't criticize or insult them as a person. Simply state the facts and the consequences as agreed upon previously.
Assign your teen more housework or take away privileges (such as television time or computer time) as a consequence.
Consider setting rules and their accompanying consequences beforehand. That way, when your teen breaks a rule, they know what they did and what consequence will result.

, Don’t set impossible rules. It’s not reasonable to tell your teen to go to bed at 7:30 or that they cannot hang out with friends. Teens want freedom and independence, so be reasonable in allowing them these things. One of the best ways to be reasonable is to listen to your teen’s perspective. Ask them what time they think is appropriate to go to bed on school nights. When they’re in trouble, ask them what a reasonable consequence might be. Get their input and consider their perspective. Ultimately, the decision lies with you.Consider your teen’s strengths and limitations. If your teen is naturally messy, it may be unreasonable to demand a spotless room. If your teen needs some chillout time after school, let them do so before starting their homework.

, Sometimes, your teens may want to prove themselves to you or test their independence in your home. Refuse to fight with them. You can avoid major conflicts by monitoring your own reactions to your teen, even if you think they’re being outrageous. If either of you are having a hard time managing your anger, count to ten or take some deep breaths. If things get too heated, take some time out before talking. Speak calmly, and if need be, agree to disagree.Let them know it’s not worth fighting over petty things. Using empathy in your voice, develop one-liners, such as, ""I bet it feels that way” or, “I know this is difficult for you.”
Avoid yelling at your teenager. If your teenager has done something they are not allowed to, explain calmly and rationally what they have done and why it broke the rules.
Teenagers may need some space to handle conflicts, especially if they are upset or stressed. Often emotions can get in the way of rational thinking. Try to pick your battles, and let them calm down before you discuss a conflict.

, If you keep the lines of communication open, you may help them make positive, informed choices or come to you when they need help. Keep a path of open communication between you whenever possible so they can ask questions, admit mistakes, and reach out when they need help. Instead of jumping to conclusions about your teen’s behavior, ask questions. Try to understand their position without assuming they’ve been doing something wrong.Learn to make compromises with your teen. That way you retain much of the control and neither of you will end up completely dissatisfied.
If your teenager doesn’t talk to you, communicate through texts or notes. You don't have to get upset with them; just show that you’re available.

"
Have fun together.,
Develop empathy.,
Honor and respect your teen.,
Support your teen’s interests.,
Open your home to your teenager's friends.,
Be available to them.",How to Deal With Your Teenager (for Parents)3," Make sure you find time to enjoy your teen. Even if they are making your life difficult at times, do activities together and with the family that you know everyone will enjoy. For example, set up a family game night once each month and play board games your teen enjoys. If your teen is adventurous, take them go-karting. If your teen is artistic, take a painting class together. Find common ground and have fun.Even if the time you spend together is just walking the dog once each day, it’s still quality time with your teen you may look back on fondly.
Understand that as your teenager gets older, they may want to spend more time with their friends and less with their family. Don't force them to do family activities. Plan activities that they genuinely want to do, and respect their personal boundaries.

, At this crucial time in their life, your teen is looking for someone to understand what they're going through. If you’re having a hard time connecting with your teen, find ways to relate to them. Put yourself in their shoes and think about what it would be like to live a day in their life. If your teen comes to you with a problem, hear them out. They generally don't need you to fix their problems for them (they'll figure that out for themselves), but they need someone who'll listen to and empathize with them. Sometimes loneliness (or any other issue) can trouble teens and can impact their exam marks negatively. Don't immediately punish them. Instead, understand and support them so that they don't experience loneliness, isolation, or some other negative feeling from the parental side either.
Don't belittle or discount your teen's problems as being unimportant or caused by hormones. Their problems and struggles seem big to them.

, Just as you want your teen to treat you with respect, treat them with respect as well. Be a good role model and show them what respect looks like, even when you’re fighting or disagreeing. Constantly yelling at a child can damage their emotions and cause them to feel insecure. Respect their opinions and ask for them.Show respect by speaking calmly and listening to your teen. Increase their independence and let them know that you trust them. Give them responsibilities and let them show you that they can come through.
Don't forget to praise them for what they do right. Recognize their efforts when they have done well in school, sports, social activities, chores, or family events.

, If they like sports or activities, sign them up and go to their events. If they are musical, pay for lessons and go to their recitals. Get them involved in the activities they enjoy and show that you support them. This shows that you care and are invested in their skills and happiness.


If they win any awards, make a big deal out of it and take the whole family out to dinner in their honor. These are easy, fun things you can do for your teen that will cement a lifelong healthy relationship between the two of you.
Sometimes teenagers may want to celebrate in ways that don't include the whole family. Make sure that when you celebrate, you celebrate in the way that they choose.

, Your teen is looking for a place to hang out with their friends. Be a good sport by opening your own home to them. Create a space where they can hang out by themselves but you can casually walk through. Have some healthy snacks around and let them listen to their music, hang out, and play video games. Make yourself available, too. You'll be surprised how many of their friends might need a listening ear.


Having your teen’s friends over at your house means that you can casually monitor what they’re up to and make sure they’re being safe.

, Teens may not always want your physical affection, but they do want your love. Show your love to your teen by being there for them. Don’t just notice their academic achievement or athletic excellence, praise them for who they are as a person and for the traits they possess. Show your love through actions, too. Whether this includes going to their sports meets or packing their lunch every day, tell them these are acts of love.Not all teens want to talk with their parents, but let them know you’re willing to listen.


Unconditional love and acceptance is the greatest gift you can give them, one that will not only boost their confidence to face another day, but will also steer your relationship with them in a positive direction.

"
Engage any support network, friends, or family you may have.,
Ask sisters, brothers, and grandparents to call and check in on your child if he/she is home alone.,
Talk to your child about the fact that you can’t be there all the time and let them know what you expect.,
Give your child chores to do to earn money or to earn favors (like going out with friends on a Saturday night) to keep them busy while you are gone.,
Know your child’s friends.,
Listen and pay attention to your teen.,
Above all, make time to talk to your child and do things together when you are home.,
Try to understand the root cause behind any irrational behavior of your child, rather than losing temper.",How to Deal With Teenagers As a Single Parent," A proper networking with like-minded individuals can help a lot. First, if you know and trust the parents of your child’s friends, ask them for help. That doesn’t mean you expect them to take on your parental responsibilities, but to assist you in fulfilling them better. For example, if you have to work late, they might agree to feed your child dinner and give them a safe environment in which to do homework. You can pick your child up on the way home and return the favor to these parents by having their child stay overnight at your house on a weekend when they want to go out and need to know where their child is and what they are doing. It will really help single parents to meet new people and reduce the stress of daily responsibilities.;
, Without interrogating the child, casually ask them what they are doing, whether they have eaten or not, and if their homework is done. Studies show that even latchkey kids without parental supervision do better in school and socially if they know that there is someone checking on them – someone who cares. A random visit during the afternoon or evening as your brother swings home from work is not a bad idea either. “I’m just stopping by to drop something off for your dad”. You can come up with something. You can win their trust by showing your concern and affection for them. A little bit of supervision can infuse the confidence in them.

, Ground rules are important. Homework is done first before they play video games, etc. Lock down dangerous websites on your computer. If your child is more computer literate than you are - get a computer literate person at work to teach you how to check and monitor your child’s browsing history so you can see where they are going on the internet. Again, let your child know your expectations. A child is very curious by nature and it is very obvious for your child to explore new things. There is a possibility for a child to visit a website that is not suitable for him/her. If you lock down certain websites, it will help your child understand the limitations.

, Laundry, vacuuming, walking the dog, making dinner, whatever you need done. Remember, you are a team! Giving your child a little bit of independence will do wonders for parent and child bonding.

, As your child matures, they are exposed to more people and their circle of friends may change from when they were in elementary school or middle school. Get to know these kids and if you have a concern about their influence, watch things very carefully and make a move if you must.

, Know what classes they are taking, which teachers they like, which bands they like, who are their favorite teams. Try to relate to your kids without lecturing them. Teens want independence, but they like it when their parents have a clue about what's important to them.

, Don’t just sit in front of the TV. Go to a movie. Go shopping. Take them out to lunch and talk. Ask questions gently, and don’t demand information, but find out what they are interested in now as they grow and mature. Stay in touch. Call from work to chat on a break. Leave notes. Schedule special dinners or outings to do things you both enjoy. Find one person you can trust whom you can bank on to help you when feel unable to cope. You may instead speak to someone official about when it's getting 'too much' but always bear in mind that you are probably talking to someone who hasn't been in the position that you are in. Sometimes it can feel like banging your head against a brick wall explaining your situation but be persistent. This doesn't mean you should silently take it.

, Being a single parent it’s even easier to lose patience. It gets frustrating at times that your child is not behaving the way you want them to. You need to be more understanding towards your child’s behavior. Teenagers are quite stubborn by nature. Despite your love and affection, not being able to win them to your way of thinking might bother you quite a lot. In these tough situations, you should not lose your cool. Any friction might make them go astray. Staying positive and spending more time with them can help."

Stay calm.,
Find out what’s going on.,
Don’t attempt to act as a lawyer.,
Hire an attorney.,
Share information with your attorney.,
Gather documents that support your child.,
Address the issue.,
Reassure him.,
Stay supportive and work together.,
Ensure your child knows his rights.",How to Deal With Your Teen Getting Arrested," If you have just received a phone call from the police informing you that your teenage child has been arrested and is being held at your local station, it’s important that you keep your composure. You will most likely be angry, upset and concerned, but you need to stay calm to deal with the situation as effectively as possible.Don’t rush to judgement, either of your child or the police officers who arrested him.
You need to act quickly and go to where your child is being held, but you should find out more information about the situation before taking any actions beyond this.;
, Once you receive the call you should head to the station straight away. You need to try and find out as much information about the arrest and the circumstances around it as possible. Try and speak to your child face-to-face, but understand that you have limited rights. You will generally be able to speak to your child before he is interviewed, but you don’t have a federal right to be present during the interview.


The rules vary by state, and some states do require consultation with parents for questioning.
Your child has a right to have a lawyer present, but not necessarily to have a parent present.
In most instance it is at the discretion of the investigating police officer, whether a parent is allowed to be present., You will probably be angry and upset with your child, but it’s important that you act calmly and get professional legal help. Don’t try to act as a lawyer or do anything which might encourage your child to incriminate himself. The best rule is not to say anything until you have a lawyer present.Well-meaning parents can hurt their child’s case by inadvertently waiving their rights, or agreeing to a search of their home unnecessarily.Even if you think your child has done something wrong, you shouldn’t make him talk to the police and confess to anything.
The police may have a very weak case, and a criminal record can have a big impact on the rest of your child’s life., If the police intend to charge your child with a crime, you should not hesitate to get professional legal help. You should hire an attorney who is a specialist in Juvenile Law. A Juvenile Law attorney will be more focussed and experienced in dealing with teens, and will work towards finding a solution that is in the best interests of your child.


This could include a drug treatment programme, counselling, or something else.
Criminal law tends to put these elements secondary to the punishment of the offender., If you have any information that may help your child’s case, you should be sure to share this with your attorney as soon as possible. The attorney needs as much information as possible to best argue your child’s case. For example, if you know of witnesses that could support your child, you should inform the attorney immediately.


If your child has a learning disability or mental health problem, explain this carefully to the attorney.The resolution to a case will take into account these factors. Even if you think it’s not relevant, give your attorney the information, and discuss how to proceed with her.

, One thing you can do which might help your child if the case continues and ends up in court, is to gather together documentation and reports that testify to your child’s character. Try to find records of your child’s achievements and certificates. Collect all his school report cards, and think about who to contact to ask for character reference letters. You could ask teachers, people from the local church, employers and neighbours.


Be careful about how you approach the character reference requests. You will have to be honest and explain what you need them for.
You will often be asked to submit school report cards to court in any case.
Do not take it upon yourself to write to a judge about your child, or submit any documents directly.
Always consult with your attorney and follow her advice on what is appropriate and what isn’t., Your child will most likely be released on bail and you need to take the time to talk through everything with him. It might be painful and difficult, but it’s important that you confront the issue head on and try to work out a way forward together. How you react to the situation can have a big impact on how your child moves on. Try to talk as directly as possible about any underlying issues that may have contributed to criminal behaviour.


Say something like, ""This is a serious situation, and I need you to explain to me how we got here.""
It’s important that he understands the seriousness of the situation.
If your child finds it hard to talk to you about it, encourage him to talk to a trained counsellor.
Sometimes people find it easier to explain their emotions and problems to a stranger., Being arrested is a difficult experience and your child will be feeling scared and uncertain, even if he doesn't appear to be. It's important that you find the right balance between ensuring he understands the seriousness of the situation and takes responsibility for his actions, and reassuring him that there is a way through this.


Explain that you will support him and help him to turn things around.
Say something like, ""You've messed up, but you can put it right and learn from the experience.""
Reassure him that you still love him, but explain how his actions are hurting you.
If he comes to realise the impact of his actions on you, it might help him to change., It’s important that you take on your responsibilities as a parent and understand that non-custodial sentencing is to a significant extent reliant on the parents. You have to work together with your child to ensure that he sticks to whatever programme he has been assigned to. It could be a drugs treatment programme, a schedule of counselling appointments, or community service commitments.


All programmes will require active participation, and if he fails to attend he may be remanded in custody.
Often the parent will be required to attend these programmes with her child, so it’s crucial that you work together to get through it.Try to think of it as a chance to correct mistakes before the consequences get too severe.

, As well as working to correct any criminal behaviour and seeking help for any drug or alcohol related problems, it’s important that your child learns about his rights when arrested by the police. For whatever reason, your child may be arrested again. Acting calmly and with a full knowledge of how to react can make a big difference. A repeat offence is generally much more serious than a first offence.


Make sure your child understands that he must request to speak to a lawyer before speaking to the police.
He should understand that a police officer can act as if he has more information than he actually does.
He must recognise that everything he says to the police can be used against him. Something that seems harmless at the time can look different in a court.
As a rule, don’t talk to police before speaking with a lawyer."

Ask questions.,
Be direct.,
Keep an open mind.,
Establish an honest relationship.,
Begin the conversation early.",How to Deal With Your Sexually Active Teen1," One of the best ways to deal with your teen is to work on effective communication. This is especially true when they become sexually active. It's important for the two of you to have productive conversations. Asking good questions is a big part of that.If you are unsure if your teen is sexually active, you can ask. Try saying, ""Jenny, has your relationship with Bob progressed? Are you having sex?""
Try not to spring the subject on your teen. Depending on the individual, many teens feel embarrassed when asked about sex.
Instead, say, ""I wanted to talk to you about something important. Do you have a minute?""
If you know for sure that your teen is having sex, there are a lot of questions you should ask. One of the most important is, ""Are you practicing safe sex?"" You can also ask, ""Do you need anything from me?"";
, When talking to your teen about sex, it is best to be direct. This indicates that you are willing to have an open and honest conversation. It lets your teen know that it is important to speak clearly about this topic.Try saying, ""I'm aware that you and Stacy are having sex. I need to know that you are using some form of birth control.""
You can also directly let your teen know that you are there to be supportive. You can say, ""If you need to talk at any time, I am here.""
Clearly state the facts and your opinions about sex. For example, make it clear that oral sex is a form of sex, too.

, Try to put your emotions and personal feelings aside when you are discussing sex with your teen. You have a right to your beliefs and values, but you also want your teen to know it's safe to talk to you. Make it clear that you are willing to listen objectively.You can say, ""I might not personally agree with your decisions to become sexually active, but I love you and support you.""
Be a good listener. Indicate through your words and body language that you are open to hearing what your teen has to say.
Nod your head and maintain eye contact. You can also offer statements that show you are listening, such as, ""That's interesting. Tell me more.""
Don't expect your teen to have the same experience with sex that you have had. Maybe you chose to wait for marriage, and that doesn't feel like a realistic option for your teen. Try to be understanding.

, After you have an initial discussion about sex, it's important not to just let the issue drop. Make sure to keep the lines of communication open. Check in with your teen frequently to see how they are handling sexual activity.Your conversations do not have to be explicit. You can say, ""How are things going with Bill? Are you having fun together?""
Try to have an honest relationship with your teen. Make it clear that you will be there to listen and to offer advice, if necessary.
Your entire relationship doesn't have to--and shouldn't--revolve around your teen's sex life. Remember to have other conversations, too.
Don't forget to say things like, ""Tell me how your art project is coming along."" Or you could ask about platonic friends.
Have fun with your teen. Don't let sex alter your relationship. Continue to do the things you enjoy, such as cooking or watching a ballgame together.

, Don't wait until your teen is sexually active to begin talking about sex. Start the conversation when your child is younger. The specific age is up to you, but many parents start talking to their children about sex towards the end of elementary school.Explain what sex is. This way your child won't be confused by rumors being spread on the playground.
Establish early on that you are open to talking about sex. That way, when your teen becomes sexually active, you will already have established some rapport.
You can also explain your sexual values to your child. Help them to understand the emotional implications of sex, in addition to the physical components.

Explain to your teen what it means to be independent.,
Allow your teen to be in charge of his studies.,
Let your teen lead a prayer before mealtimes.,

Be aware that independence will allow your teen to exercise his faith.,
Consider how independence can help your teen to survive the difficulties of life.,
Know that being independent will make your teen more successful in life.",How to Encourage Independence in Teenagers," During adolescence, your teen is just starting to explore and understand the things and people around him. Therefore, this is the best time to instill a sense of responsibility in your child, which will make him a stronger, better person in the long run.


This includes explaining how to become independent and what it actually means to be independent. Explain to him that he must do some things on his own and exercise his ability to make decisions for himself.
Explain that this will make him a stronger person and will help him to be more successful in life. If you can convince your child to actually want to be independent, you'll have won half the battle.;
, Let your teen study alone and do his assignments without your help, at least for the most part.


You can still guide him in the right direction by giving him some tips on where to find information, but then let him do the research on his own. Doing your teen's assignments for him is not a good idea, as he won't learn anything from it and won't develop the skill of thinking for himself when it comes to exams..
Also allow your teen to set his own schedule in terms of when he does his homework. If he prefers to have a break for a couple of hours after he comes home from school before doing his homework, that's fine. Along as the homework gets done in the end, you should allow your teen to find his own balance between leisure time and schoolwork.

, By leading the family in prayer, your teen can express himself and show what's in his mind and in his heart. Let him speak for himself and for the family during praying time.


This is especially important if your teen tends to be shy and has difficulty expressing himself. Encourage him to express how he feels and let him know that he can't go wrong and there is nothing to be embarrassed about.
Letting your teen lead the rest of the family in prayer will also give him a sense of leadership and responsibility. This will help to make him more confident and independent.

, You can also encourage independence in your teen by finding their talent and helping them to develop it. For example, if he loves to cook, sign him up for a cooking class. If he loves sports, encourage him to sign up for the school team.


Finding a talent and working hard to develop it will help your teen to become more independent. This is because being good at something will give your teen confidence and motivate them to try their hardest and become disciplined, without you needing to push them every step of the way.
Getting involved in a group activity or class will also allow your teen to meet new people and make new friends - another essential part of becoming independent.

, In order to become independent, teens should be allowed to have a little privacy and to take ownership over their own bedrooms. Allow your teen to decide how he wants to decorate his room, and give him the right to refuse other people entry (within reason).


However, make it clear that being in charge of his own room requires responsibilities. Make a deal where you agree not to enter his room without permission, provided that he tidies and vacuums his room at least once a week, and brings his dirty clothes to the laundry on a daily basis.
Allowing your teen to be responsible for his own room and to have his own space will help him to feel more grown up and independent., Self-expression is hugely important during the teenage years and plays a large part in becoming independent. Therefore, you should allow your teen to wear clothes and style his hair in a way that matches his personality.


For example, your teen may just want to wear soccer jerseys and running shoes everyday and refuse to put on a shirt or proper shoes. Or he may want to just wear black all the time, and never wear any colors. Don't worry too much about this - this is all a normal part of growing up and becoming independent.
Of course, don't be afraid to offer your opinion if they ask for it, or if you really think something is inappropriate (you are the parent after all), but try to give your teen as much personal choice as possible, as this will help them to become independent and make decisions for themselves.

, Encourage your teen to express his feelings and opinions in an open and honest way. Try to listen to what he's saying and avoid being judgmental or condescending.


Although you want him to be independent, you still want him to feel like he can come to you with his problems, not feel like he has to hide them from you.
Ask for your teen's opinion on certain matters, like a news item you just saw on tv or an article you read in the newspaper. This will help your teen to develop his own unique opinions and thought process and allow him to feel more grown up.However, you should help your child to understand that there are certain rules regarding self-expression; he should be rude or talk over other people, or believe his opinion is more important or more valid than other people's.Encourage him to think before he speaks, so he can practice being independent in a responsible way.

, Allow your teen to hang out with her friends by herself. Do not constantly nag your teen to find out where she is or what she is doing. Instead, set rules that you expect your teen to follow. If you do not hover over your teen at all times, you may find that she is more likely to respect your rules.

, Discuss situations with your teen, and ask her how she thinks she will handle it. If she isn’t sure, talk to her about looking both the pros and the cons, as well as the consequences of certain choices. Asking how your teen will handle something, rather than telling them how to do so, may help her to take responsibility for actions and her time.


For example, ask your teen about how she plans to manage her study time and her free time. If she isn’t totally sure, talk to her about the pros and cons, as well as the consequences of having more or less free time.
Always acknowledge when your teen has taken responsibility for something and managed it well. This will encourage her to continue to take responsibility.

, Be clear and consistent when you implement rules. You may opt to write down all of your policies so that your teen knows your rules are concrete. When coming up with the rules, talk to your teen about them so that you can work together to create fair expectations.


Similarly, keep your forms of discipline consistent. For example, if your teen comes home past curfew, then she is not allowed to hang out with her friends the following night.

, Just as your expectations should be concrete, so should the discipline that you give your teen when she does not meet those expectations. This does not mean your discipline should be strict or harsh; your discipline could instead simply be sitting down with your teen to talk about what happened.


Again, talk to your teen about what discipline she thinks is fair for not meeting your agreed upon expectations. For example, if your teen goes to a party, rather than studying for a test, and fails the test, then the discipline may be not being allowed to hang out with her friends in the week leading up to the next test.

, Making mistakes can help your teen to figure out what she should do in the future to avoid the mistake she made. The mistake will teach her about consequences to choices that she makes.Do not punish your teen when she makes a mistake. Instead, talk to your teen about what happened, and how she can learn from her mistake.

, Being independent begins with being responsible. You can assign your teen a number of household chores such as washing the dishes after dinner, taking out the garbage, cooking lunch for the whole family one or two nights week, bringing the dog for a walk, vacuuming the house, etc.


Make your teen responsible for completing these tasks on a weekly basis, without having to be reminded. You shouldn't need to bribe your teen into doing his chores - he should understand that he needs to contribute to the household and pull his weight around the house, rather than leaving everything to you.
Making your teen responsible for household takes will help to foster independence and will really stand to him when he eventually leaves for college or moves out of the house and becomes truly independent., While your teen may have a newer, larger amount of freedom, it is still important to promote a healthy family relationship. Plan some fun activities, like going on a hike or going to the beach, that your whole family can do together.


Find an activity that both you and your teen enjoy, and then do that activity together.
Have your teen help you to plan a trip for the family, even if it is just a day trip. Allowing her to pick out some of the activities may help her to get over her resentment of not being able to hang out with her friends.

, Your teen should have the ability to deal with safety and emergency situations. This is imperative because it is impossible for you to be with your teen 24/7 and unexpected events certainly happen.


Some emergency procedures you must teach your teen are related to fire, water, road, food, and natural disasters.

, Being independent will force your teen to be more responsible, which is an important quality for him to develop. The best way for him to learn how to be responsible for himself and do things on his own is by giving him the space to do it.


When your teen goes to summer camp for example, he will have the chance to interact with different people from the same age bracket without your supervision. He’ll also have to learn how to survive without your support and make his own decisions.
This is a perfect of example of how your teen will become responsible by being independent.

, When your teen becomes more independent, his self-confidence and self-esteem will increase. He will realize that he can do things by himself, without anyone else's help.


For example, when your teen starts working on a school project alone, it will give him the opportunity to identify his own talents and strengths.
As low self-esteem is a huge problem amongst teenagers, it's really important that your teen finds something that they love and that they're good at.

, The best way for your teen to acknowledge and accept God is when facing adversity without anyone there to help him.


When your teen faces this type of struggle, he will look for something or someone to hold on to. He may feel like no one seems to care or has time to lend him a hand, but then he will realize that he can always turn to God for strength and guidance.
In this way, your teen will learn to look up to God as you teach him to be independent.

, When your teen learns to be independent at an early age, he also learns how to face the difficulties in life.


Learning from experience is one of the main factors that determine one’s success in life. At this point in time, your teen will start to experience small dilemmas, especially when it comes to interactions with his peers.
An independent teen is more likely to be successful in dealing with these types of situations, and even if he is not successful he will learn from his experience and deal with it better the next time.

, If your teen is independent and takes responsibility for his own actions and endeavors from an early age, he is far more likely to go on to be successful in later life.


Being independent requires your teen to show initiative and to realize his own worth - two values which will come in very useful when it comes to finding employment later on in life.

Help your teen find ways to cool down or control their anger and emotions. Have them write in a journal, listen to music, go on a run, or punch a pillow.

, If your teen is showing signs of anxiety, depression, or other mental or emotional problems, or is especially destructive or rebellious, a therapist can help.

Medical intervention can treat more than 80% of teens suffering from depression.Let your teen know about your concerns that they may have depression. Tell them that you have scheduled a doctor’s appointment to see how to deal with it. Assure your teen that depression is something that happens to a lot of other teens and adults. Make sure they know that there is nothing about which to be ashamed and seeing the doctor can help them.Tell the doctor any symptoms of depression you notice in your teen before the appointment.

Ask the doctor any questions you have after the appointment.

, The doctor may refer your teen to a mental health professional for further treatment. This may help your teen manage the depression and help you more effectively deal with it at home and beyond. If your teen doesn’t feel comfortable with the mental health professional, try another one.

In addition, they can prescribe medication that may help your teen.
Psychologist: this is a health professional who also diagnoses and treats depression. They may use different forms of psychotherapy to treat depression, including cognitive-behavioral, individual, family, or group therapy. They cannot write prescriptions for medications.
Licensed clinical social worker: this is a person with a degree in social work. They may treat your teen’s depression but cannot prescribe medication.

This is a safe treatment for teens and often has a high response rate. It can help your teen feel better relatively quickly.Transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, which is a good choice for teens who don’t respond to antidepressants.This treatment uses a coil placed against your teen’s scalp to send a magnetic pulse to the brain. It stimulates the nerve cells that regulate mood. TMS is safe and may help your teen if other treatments aren’t working., Just like professional therapy can help your teen with their depression, so can talking with you about what they are feeling. Make sure your teen knows that they can always talk to you about anything and that you’ll help them in any way you can.Avoid asking lots of questions. Instead, listen to everything your teen says with an open mind. Don’t judge or give advice unless your teen asks you for it. The goal is to make sure you child is comfortable communicating with you.
Acknowledge your teen’s feelings. No matter how trivial something may seem to you, it is important to validate their feelings. Otherwise, you run the risk of your teen thinking that you do not take their emotions seriously.

, Depression is hard on your teen and it can be hard for you to handle as well. Offering your teen unconditional love and support, even if it’s sometimes difficult, can go a long way in helping them with depression. Reinforce your love and support often. For example, you might say, “I know you’re struggling and you should know that we love you very much. If you need anything, you can always come to us.” Your teen may not believe the statements, but reminding them is important.
Keep in mind that it can be difficult to deal with your teen’s inactivity or inability. They aren't lazy — they have a disease. Reminding yourself of this can may help you deal with your teen in a more understanding and supportive way.
Avoid saying, “Snap out of it” to your teen. No teen would ever choose to have depression. In fact, if they could “snap out of it,” your teen would.

, Just as it is important for parents to support a depressed teen, it’s also helpful if other family members also offer their help and understanding. Inform family members privately in an age-appropriate way and ask them to make a little more effort to make your teen feel accepted and loved.Tell adult family members, “Hey, I wanted to let you know that Colby is having a really tough time with depression. Please don’t say anything about it, but think about showing a little more understanding and love when you get the chance.”
Let other children know, too. For example, to younger siblings you could say, “Taylor, you know what? Colby isn’t feeling so great right now. Let’s make sure we let her know how much we love her. She may also not want to play as much as normal, but you can still ask. Just don’t get upset if she can’t or doesn’t want to play with you.”
Make sure family members accentuate the positive in your teen’s life. For example, filling in family on your teen’s recent accomplishment may be a way for other member to positively approach your teen.

, Educational professionals such as teachers, administrators, school nurse, and coaches often care about your teen as much as you do. They likely also want to promote your teen’s health and wellbeing. Informing educational professionals about your teen’s depression can help them relieve stress through accommodation to schoolwork or practices. It can also provide your teen with some extra love and support. Educational professionals are required to keep the information confidential, so you and your teen shouldn’t worry about other students or parents finding out about their depression.Tell teachers, coaches, administrators, and schools nurses about any problems at school that may contribute to the depression. They should also know about any therapies or medications your teen is taking, including what side effects they can cause.
Ask teachers to be more understanding and make reasonable accommodations to the workload. Let them know your teen may not be able to complete tests or homework at times because of the depression.

, Getting some type of exercise or physical activity can increase the levels of serotonin in your teen’s brain. More serotonin may relieve symptoms of depression and promote relaxation in your teen.Encourage your teen to get physical activity most days of the week.

Try to incorporate foods like asparagus that have folic acid, which can improve mood. Foods such as avocados, which are high in Vitamin B, may help reduce stress which can contribute to depression., Depressed teens are more likely to use alcohol and drugs than others. Let your teen know about your concerns with alcohol and drug use. Provide support so they can stop using these substances. Keeping alcohol or drugs in your home locked up can also deter use.

Explain that alcohol and drugs may help your teen feel better quickly, but will make their depression worse in the long-term and may put them at risk for harm.
Let your child’s doctors and therapists know if you suspect or know your teen is using drugs and alcohol. They can help incorporate quitting these substances as a part of the treatment for depression.

, Just as schoolwork can stress your teen, so can the expectation that they will do chores around the house. Reducing their chores or exposure to other stress such as fighting can minimize symptoms of depression.Adjust your teen’s chores or help them make them more manageable with smaller parts. Praise your teen for finishing chores or even just trying to do them. This can relieve their stress.
Suggest that your teen do things that can help them relax. This might include listening to music, watching a movie, playing video games, drawing, or taking a long bath.Let your teen rest. Sleep contributes to positive mental health and this can be especially important for a depressed teen.Allow your teen to sleep for nine to 11 hours every night. This can reduce stress and the symptoms of depression."
"
Know that going through puberty can change their point of view.,
Read body language.,
Be empathetic.,
Show compassion.,
Stay loyal.,
Do not bow to peer pressure.,
Beware of aggression.",How to Deal With Teenage Boys1," Boys normally go through puberty between the ages of 11 and 16. It is during these years that they experience most of their physical changes (including growing taller and developing muscle). During and after these years they’ll normally start to develop their sexuality. They’ll start to look at themselves, and others, differently.If you’re a girl who is a friend of a teenage boy, he might start to treat you differently. On one hand because he’s experiencing changes in his emotions (and hormones). And on the other hand because your physical appearance is changing. This change doesn’t mean you’ve done anything wrong, it is an unfortunate part of growing up.
Teen boys can also become confused or unsure about their sexual orientation. He may need your help and support to figure out who he is.;
, Body language is the movements or positions of someone’s body that can show us how they’re feeling.Being able to read your friend's body language can help you determine the best method by which to deal with him.


The ability to read body language starts with the ability to observe. Practice reading body language by observing people in everyday settings like the mall, the bus or the coffee shop.Some examples of body language to watch out for in your friend:

If you see your friend walking the hallways at school with his hands in his pockets and his shoulders hunched over, he’s probably feeling dejected.
If your friend often plays with his hair or adjusts his clothes in some way, he’s probably nervous about something.
If your friend is tapping or drumming his fingers against the table, or fidgeting a lot, he’s probably impatient about something.
If your friend is talking to someone either with his arms crossed in front of him, or holding something in front of him, he’s being defensive.



, Empathy is the ability to understand and appreciate someone else’s feelings.In other words, it’s understanding what it is like to be in their shoes. Empathy allows you to understand what someone else is going through, and sympathize with them. Being empathetic also helps build better relationships.Being empathetic includes being able to listen. It is difficult to understand how someone is feeling, if you don’t allow them to talk.
When listening to your friend talk, think about how you would feel in the situation he's describing. Chances are, if you would feel a certain way, so would he.
Some examples of how to be empathetic to your friend:

If your friend is telling you a story where he’s expressing a lot of different feelings, listen carefully and repeat back some of the things he’s telling you. It shows you’re listening and actually care about what he’s saying.
If your friend is giving his opinion about something, listen without judgement. Then ask yourself why he might feel that way. Put yourself in his shoes before jumping in with your own opinion.
If your friend had a particularly embarrassing experience that he doesn’t want to talk about, open up to him by telling him a story where you embarrassed yourself. Your friend will be more likely to share his own experiences if you’ve shared yours.



, The next step after empathy is compassion. Compassion is wanting to help someone who needs help.Once you have gained an understanding for how your friend is feeling, you can determine what you need to do for him. Being compassionate is another way in which to build healthy relationships.Reach out to your friend and ask him if he needs anything. If he doesn't know what he needs, think about what you’d like in his situation and offer that.
Show an interest in your friend and use your curiosity to ask questions and get to know him better.
Be kind to your friend when you know he's being teased or treated badly by others. Don’t become part of the gossip or teasing yourself.

, One major part of friendship is loyalty. Sticking with a friend through thick and thin, through good and bad. Not allowing rumours and gossip from other people to sway how you feel about your friends. It also means making sacrifices for your friends when they need something.Loyalty and friendship might be more than keeping their secrets, it may mean breaking their confidence in order to help them.Loyalty may also mean telling your friend something he doesn't want to hear, by being honest. The truth may hurt, but it may be what he needs.

, Your peers are those around the same age as you who have the same interests as you. Most of the time your peers and your friends are the same group, but not always. Because you hang out with your friends everyday, you will end up influencing each other in both good and bad ways.However, when your peers (friends and otherwise) start to pressure you to do something you either do not want to do, or you know you should not do, it is considered a negative influence.The teenage boy you’re friends with may start to feel and act awkward. Other may attempt to pressure him into doing things he doesn’t want to do. As his friend, stand by him and support him through times like this.

, The body and the brain of a teenage boy is going through a lot turmoil and change. The brains of teenage boys are physically changing and it makes them more likely to act irresponsibly.In fact, these physical changes in the brain impact the teen's ability to respond emotionally with rage, fear, panic and anxiety. Add a large amount of testosterone to the mix, and you have the possibility of aggression and other negative behaviour.If your friend is arguing with you and appears to be becoming aggressive, stay calm.If an argument becomes too heated, and it doesn’t appear that your friend is going to calm down, walk away. Tell him you’ll continue the conversation in 30 minutes. Give him the opportunity to calm down before resuming the conversation.
If your friend ever becomes violent, your safety comes first. Remove yourself from the situation if possible. If that’s not possible, and you fear for your safety, call 911.

Know when it’s time to start dating.,
Determine if he’s the right guy.,
Understand his weird behaviour around you.,
Go on a date.,
Date for the right reasons.,
Be yourself.,
Recognize if there's love.,
Recognize a healthy relationship.,
Conclude if it’s time to breakup.",How to Deal With Teenage Boys2," There’s no rule as to when it’s okay to start dating, it’s up to you (and your parents). If you’re ready and comfortable, and your parents are okay with it, it might be the right time. The important thing is not to feel pressured to start dating when you don’t want to., Do you like him? Is he nice to you? Do you get along with him? Are you attracted to him? Do you get butterflies in your belly when he’s near? Before you start dating a guy, this may be all you have to go on. But it’s a good starting point. If you have a good feeling about him, and you’re ready, it’s worth going out on a couple of dates to get to know him better., Between the changes that happen to girls and boys during puberty, girls actually have it a little easier. There’s a big time period when puberty can start for girls, but once it starts, it finishes up pretty quickly. Boys, on the other hand, can continue to grow and change into their 20s. This means that teenage boys are constantly feel awkward and disoriented. This is made especially worse if a boy finds himself growing at a rate slower than his friends.Boys experience a chance to their voice box in their teenage years, which will eventually make their voices deeper. But their voices, while this process is happening, may sound weird to them. They may be uncomfortable having a conversation with you simply because they’re embarrassed about their voice.
This may not be something you want to think about, but one of the major changes a boy goes through in puberty is to his penis. The increase in size to his penis and scrotum, and the increase in hormone levels, can result in a lot of unwanted erections. Simply having a dirty thought about a girl might cause one. Unfortunately the boys can’t always control this, which may make them very uncomfortable about you.
Boys begin to demonstrate more mature social skills around the age of 17. Before this, they may still be somewhat immature and childish. Because girls mature faster, they may find boys somewhat annoying until their mental maturation catches up.

, When a guy asks you out, it doesn’t mean he instantly becomes your boyfriend. Start off with one date and go from there. Dates can be anything you want them to be - going to a coffee shop, theatre, restaurant, sports event, etc. Whatever you decide to do for the date, it should be something you both enjoy.If the first date goes well, go on a second date, and so on. If the date doesn’t go well, that’s okay, maybe you weren’t meant for each other.

, Some teenagers feel the need to date in order to get one-on-one attention, possibly because they have low self-esteem or self-confidence. Others feel the need to date in order to feel like they have control or power over someone else, or because they need the boy in order to gain some sort of status among their peers. None of these are good reasons to start dating.If these are the only reasons you can come up with as to why you want to date a boy, then it might not be a good idea to date him. You would just be using him in order to gain something for yourself, which isn’t fair to him.

, Whether you decide to go ahead and date a boy, or you’re just friends with one, remember to be yourself. Any boy who wants you because you’re pretending to be someone else, doesn’t actually want YOU. And even if the relationship works out at the beginning, it won’t be able to last. Eventually your true self will surface - you won’t be able to pretend to be someone else forever.You don’t have to date someone of equal intelligence. If you’re smarter than them, that’s okay. If they’re smarter than you, that’s okay. Don’t pretend to be dumb to make the boy feel better about himself - he’ll feel worse about himself when he finds out you’re only pretending.

, When you first start dating a boy you may feel like you’re in love with him right away. It’s possible that its true, but it’s also possible it’s infatuation or attraction. Sometimes it will last, sometimes it won't. If it doesn’t last, it could be because real life interferes with your ideal view of each other. Annoying habits become apparent, and character flaws become obvious.Real love takes time and effort. And you will not end up in love with every guy you date.
Love, in a relationship, involves attraction (physical chemistry), closeness (emotional connection) and commitment (dedication to each other)., A healthy relationship lasts, even when the annoying habits of each person become apparent. A healthy relationship also includes: being respectful of each other, and each other’s time; learning to give and receive; being able to share all feelings, good and bad; being able to listen to each other and support each other’s ideas and needs.If you feel any of the items of a healthy relationship are missing between you and your boyfriend, talk to him about it. If you’re able to resolve the issue, that’s an excellent sign the relationship has staying power. If you’re unable to resolve the issue, it may be time to move on.

, Not all relationships work out. People may grow apart gradually, or they may determine rather quickly that they weren’t meant for each other. Regardless of when you or your boyfriend determine it’s time to move on, don’t consider your relationship a waste of your time. Every relationship you have is a valuable learning experience.Any relationship has to meet the needs of both people involved. If your boyfriend isn’t meeting your needs, or you aren’t meeting your boyfriend’s needs, it’s time to move on.
Breaking up isn’t fun, and you will likely feel horrible, but these feelings will eventually go away. Don’t sacrifice your long-term happiness for short-term bliss.

Recognize the warning signs.",How to Deal With Teenage Boys3," Teenage boys experience surges in their hormones (testosterone), which can have an effect on their ability to feel fear and causes them to loose their inhibitions. In turn, this can cause them to engage in dangerous activities simply because they aren’t able to process how dangerous it is. And, they tend to allow their emotions, especially anger, to rule their reactions., Teenage boys need structure in their lives, overseen and directed by their parents. This structure is not due to a lack of trust, but rather the biological fact that teenage boys haven’t yet developed the brain function to make safe choices based on the possible consequences.As the parent, work with your teenage son to develop a daily routine for them. Make sure he’s involved in the process, but ensure the end result is what he needs.

, Sleep is vital at any age, but teenagers need between 8 and 10 hours of sleep every night in order to be functional. Ideally, they should develop a regular sleep pattern. A sleep pattern can help increase the quality of the sleep they get.Not getting enough sleep can slow down many of his abilities - such as the ability to learn, listen, concentrate and solve problems. It can also cause him to forget very simple items like someone’s phone number, or when homework is due.
A lack of sleep can cause health problems, including acne. And can cause him to consume more unhealthy items like coffee or soda.
Not getting enough sleep can also affect his behaviour, causing him to become irritable or angry faster than he would normally. He may end up being mean or rude to someone that he'll regret later.

, The anger felt by a teenage boy may make him feel as if you (their parents) don’t trust him. You need to make him feel that he's trusted, and loved, while teaching him the importance of family and community.Encourage him to participate in family events and volunteer in the community.
Teach him about responsible financial management.
Show him how to be respectful of other people, their rights and their property.
Rather than telling him what you want him to do, ask him. When making rules, allow him to be a part of the process.

, Teen boys need more than simple verbal reminders or instructions in order to comprehend what is needed or required of them. In addition to verbally providing him with instructions, also do the following:Make eye contact when providing instructions.
Ask him to repeat what you’ve told them.
Use short and simple sentences.
Allow him to respond and ask questions.
Don’t turn instructions into a lecture.

, Responsibility can be learned in multiple ways. Many teenagers can learn responsibility from example - by watching and mimicking responsible people. But it can also be learned by making mistakes and incurring the consequences of irresponsible behaviour. As corny as it sounds, the statement “with power comes great responsibility” is very true. Teenagers need to learn that power, privilege and responsibility are all connected. The best place for them to learn this is from their parents., Teens, in general, change often. For example, their fashion changes with the trends. As a parent, you might not be able to keep up, and you might be shocked by some of the clothes your teen decides to wear. While you may be tempted to make rules regarding clothes, keep in mind that you may also want to save your battle for something much more important (like drinking, drugs, curfew, etc.).Another change teens experience often is related to their mood. Many of their mood swings are driven by the hormonal and developmental changes. In some cases, they may not have complete control over their emotions, or their reactions.

, In the teenage years, your son’s friends will most likely have more influence over his actions and behaviours than you do. It’s not because he doesn't love or respect you, he's just trying to find his way in the world.Try not to take this personally, and try not to get angry. Your anger towards him may cause him to withdraw further from you, and in turn, cause you to withdraw from him. He may not act like it, but he still need your support., Teens are known for trying to push the limits, with you and with others. One way he may do this is by trying to get away with breaking the rules (e.g. how much later can he come home after curfew before you say something). It’s important that your enforce the rules you’ve made, or those limits will continue to be tested. It may also influence how your teen reacts to rules outside the home. You want to set a good example of how important rules are, and that they need to be followed., ‘Normal’ teenage behaviour is one thing, but some teenage behaviour can indicate a much more serious problem. Watch for signs of more serious problems, and seek professional help as soon as possible.Extreme amounts of weight loss or weight gain.
Ongoing sleep problems.
Rapid, drastic and long-lasting changes in personality.
Sudden change in close friends.
Skipping school and falling grades.
Any form of talk about suicide.
Signs of smoking, or alcohol and drug abuse.
Constantly getting in trouble at school, or with the police.

Always approach difficult situations by trying to understand how your teen is feeling. If you dismiss your teen's emotions, he or she may feel rejected.Empathy is good, but ""enmeshment"" isn't.Your teen needs you to be the voice of reason. Don't let your teen's emotions -- or yours -- keep you from thinking clearly and acting responsibly.;
, Your teen is experimenting with new experiences to discover his or her identity. Don't discourage that.You may not approve of your teen's new activities, clothes, or interests, but avoid criticizing them. Part of parenting a teen is ""learning to let go.""

By embracing your adolescent's experimentation you are embracing him or her as an independent adult., When your teen is stubborn it’s easy to forget all the good things he or she might be doing. Errors command attention, but positive acts can go unnoticed because they are either expected or approved. By expressing gratitude for positive actions, you can give your teen confidence and encourage more good behavior.If you mostly give your teen negative attention he or she may come to believe that he or she only makes mistakes. If you ignore his or her good actions, he or she might believe what they do doesn't matter. You want your teen to associate good actions with attention.

, It's common for children to talk less to their parents as they reach adolescence.That doesn't mean conversation won't happen. It just means that you're not the one who will decide when it happens.


Your teen might want to talk when it's unexpected or inconvenient. Don't put it off until later.It might be your only chance to address the issue, and you want your teen to know that you're always available when they want to talk.

, If you want to connect with your teen but your interests differ, ask your teen to teach you about his or her new interests. Sharing common interests will make future arguments or discussions easier to resolve.

By casting your teen in the role of expert, he or she will feel respected and intelligent. This is key in developing healthy independence.

, Even though your teen might want his or her independence, it's important to keep a structure in place that connects him or her to the family.


Embrace your teen’s friendships.Not only will you connect with your teen, but you will also learn who influences him or her. Include your teen's friends in family activities.
Create family time. Routines like family dinners and trips will connect your teen to a functioning family unit.Keeping family close is healthy, and your child will most likely appreciate the support even if he or she doesn't show it.

, As your child grows and changes, so should the rules.Most teens will expect that they deserve a greater degree of independence, and parents should accommodate that (within reason). Negotiating issues like ""room rights"" might be difficult, but it's worth it.

Don't leave your teen guessing. Your teen will be wondering whether he or she still has a curfew, still has to do chores, and the like. Make the new rules clear. Failing to discuss how the rules have changed will inevitably lead to conflict.
Explain to your teen why the rules are what they are. Even if your teen doesn't agree, it's important that that he or she understands that the rules aren't arbitrary.

, It can be frustrating when your teen ignores you, but don't get angry. Calmly repeat your requests until your teen complies.


Don't confuse your teen's laziness or forgetfulness with an act of rebellion., You probably won’t get immediate results. But if you remain persistent and consistent, you're more likely to get the outcome you want.


Try exercises like yoga or meditation, to help you relax.If you're patient and calm, your teen will be more likely to respond in the same way

, When your child becomes a teen, it's time to discuss difficult issues likes drugs and sex. Don't put off these conversations because they're awkward.If you haven't already had ""the talk"" with your teen, it's time.Talk about sex as a natural part of life.Be honest and nonjudgmental.
Studies show that teens who've discussed sex with their parents are more likely to be responsible in their activities.Be sure to include discussion of STIs, contraception, consent, and the emotional elements of sex, among others.Drugs and alcohol should be discussed with the same sensitivity as sex. Ask your teen his or her thoughts about drug and alcohol use. Let your teen know where you stand on the issue, and decide how you will answer questions about your own past or present use.Finally, be sure to address issues like peer pressure, health effects, and impaired driving., Instead of assuming why your teen broke the rules, ask questions like, “What were your reasons for doing that?”Your teen will have to think through the situation and might end up understanding his or her error without your needing to explain it.


It's okay for your teen to feel guilty.If your teen recognizes why what he or she did was wrong, the emotions that come with that realization may serve as a more effective punishment than one imposed by a parent.

, An appropriate punishment lasting several hours or several days, depending on the violation, can be very effective.


Longer punishments often increase the chance that your teen will act out in response. But if your teen sees an end to the punishment, he or she will be more likely to accept it.

, Your teen should view your punishment as a reasonable response to his or her violation of the rules. If you let your emotions dictate the punishment, your teen is likely to see your punishment as arbitrary and cruel.


Be an example for your teen. Teach your teen constructive ways to deal with conflict, so that he or she will have a constructive model for how to act in future relationships.

, When addressing your concerns, your choice of language can dramatically affect the conversation.

Pinpoint exactly why you're upset. Using general terms like “irresponsible"" will make your teen feel attacked. Instead, outline the specific infraction.

, If you lay down a punishment and end up not following through, your credibility will be damaged.

Your teen may think they can get away with this behavior and start acting out even more., After a long day, it might be tempting to let your teen get away with breaking a rule. However, if your teen feels that the rules are arbitrarily enforced, he or she is less likely to take them seriously.

, Sometimes it takes a village to raise a child. Whenever possible, enlist the help of other parents.

Since it can feel counterproductive when other families don’t teach the same values, try talking to the parents that have contact with your teen to ensure that your rules will be enforced.

For example, if your teen is watching a movie at his or her friend's house, call the parents beforehand and let them know what types of films your teen is allowed to watch.
If you can’t get other parents to comply, don’t cave in on the core standards of behavior that you’ve set for your teen.

, Parents' advice is often discounted by teens, but the words of a teacher, coach, extended family member, or friend's parent, among others, might be taken more seriously.

Suggest that your teen stay after school and chat with his favorite teacher or coach. Allow your teen to spend time with a family member whom he or she trusts.
Make sure you know and approve of the adults your teen spends time with.

, If your teen's issues seem beyond your control, seek advice from a professional, such as a like a pediatrician or school counselor.


These specialists may provide insight into what your teen is going through and give you the tools you need to help.

Encourage your teen to exercise.,
Get your teen to try some relaxation techniques.,
Help your teen to follow a healthy, balanced diet.,
Educate your teen about the dangers of drugs and alcohol.,
Make sure your teen gets enough sleep.",How to Cope with Your Teen's Mood Disorder1," Exercise is a very important aspect of dealing with a mood disorder, as it helps to balance your teen’s hormones.


Exercise allows the body to release more feel-good hormones, such as dopamine and endorphins. These hormones provide the body with a natural high, meaning that your teen will feel happy and energetic.
What is more, mood disorders are often provoked by a poor body image, especially during the teen years, so getting enough exercise can help to solve that aspect of the problem as well.;
, Relaxation techniques are another important part of dealing with a mood disorder. Relaxation techniques such as yoga and meditation help to bring down anxiety levels in people of all ages, teens included


These activities normalize your heart-rate and breathing, which is very helpful because your mind and body are constantly interconnected and physical reactions such as heavy breathing and fast heart-rate can increase anxiety levels.
Teens might sometimes feel a bit negative towards relaxation techniques, so make an effort to do them together. This could also be a nice way for you and your teen to bond.

, A healthy balanced diet will not cure your teen's mood disorder in and of itself, but it will help to give them more energy, allow them to concentrate better in school and make them feel better about themselves physically.


Make sure your teen is getting three healthy meals a day, which include a good balance of whole grains, fruits, vegetables and healthy proteins. Don't allow your teen to skip breakfast - it really is the most important meal of the day as it kick starts the metabolism and gives your teen the energy they need to face the day.
Limit the amount of junk food your teen eats. Too much junk food can lead to weight gain, which can exacerbate issues with body image, particularly amongst teen girls. Junk food is also devoid of important vitamins and minerals, which could leave your teen susceptible to other healthy issues.

, It's very important to educate your teen about the dangers of drugs and alcohol. These substances have a more profound effect on people with disorders and can make manic or depressive episodes worse.


For example, alcohol is a depressant and can easily trigger a depressive episode in a teen who suffers from a mood disorder. Stimulant drugs like cocaine, on the other hand, may trigger a manic episode in certain people.
Of course, it will be impossible for you to monitor your teen at all times, and they probably won't appreciate you checking up on them all the time. Therefore, it's important that you calmly and clearly communicate the rules regarding drugs and alcohol to your teen, then give them some space and trust that they will make the right decision.

, Getting enough sleep is absolutely essential for teens who suffer from mood disorders, in order to keep them emotionally balanced. Teenagers should be getting at least 8 hours sleep per night and should aim to go to bed and wake up at the same time each day.


This can be very difficult for teens who prefer to stay up late surfing the internet or talking on their phones. Therefore, it may be necessary for you to enforce a bedtime or at least remove distractions such as computers or TVs from your teen's room.
Also make sure that your teen's sleeping environment is conducive to a good nights sleep - it should be dark and quiet, and maintained at a comfortable cool temperature.

Create boundaries that your teenager understands.,
Encourage new activities to give your child a new outlook.,

Reach out and know the people in their other worlds.",How to Deal With a Runaway Teen," This also means that you should dig into the deeper issues, not just the superficial ones, that could have caused them to run away. If the teen won’t talk to you, find a professional (therapist, school guidance counselor), religious figure or other relative to reach out to the teen so you can start to figure out what is really going on. Try to sit down and talk with your teen first in a compassionate way.
Most instances of teenagers running away are in response to a specific problem or stressor that teens feel they can solve by leaving home (e.g. bullying, bad grades, home pressures, pregnancy or substance abuse). You should determine whether there is a legitimate problem or just a power struggle. ;
, Some disorders a teen could be dealing with include depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, and many other disorders. While you may be aware of the problems themselves (or not), you might not be aware of how the problems are affecting your child. Sexual abuse is also a common reason teenagers run away (and must be reported to authorities). It’s possible there is something about your parenting style that the child is rebelling against. When was the last time you sat down and talked to your child about how they are feeling? They might push you away, but inside they really do want to talk. They just don’t know how.
Teens could also be dealing with problems at school. You should do more research on your child’s school. Bullying is one of the main reasons for running away from home. Verbal and physical harassment such as hitting, fighting, abusing and even teasing can also be a big reason of troubled teenager’s problems.

, Which environment is causing the teenager’s stress? Friend circles, school or home? You should do a clear and honest assessment about what it’s like in your home. If there is a situation where one parent is harming the child or parental fighting is causing a stressful home environment, get immediate help.


Any harm toward a child – physical or verbal - should not be tolerated and must be reported to the authorities. Seek help from a therapist or religious leader too.
Home violence or fights between the parents can also become a big problem in teens’ lives. Maybe it’s your marriage that needs improving rather than avoiding issues. Due to home violence or arguments, teenagers may feel depressed and abandoned. This kind of helpless feeling may force them to go away from home and also can encourage them to become an alcohol or substance abuser.

, It might be better to respond to running away with love instead of anger. Letting your teen know that you love him or her unconditionally and want to help could be more effective than creating a judgmental home environment. They will be more likely to open up and tell you what is going on.


Some homeless or runaway teens are LGBT and are worried their parents won’t accept them. If they are LGBT and worried you don’t accept them, or if you actually do not accept them, reassure them that you do and work on achieving acceptance of who they are.
Hug your teen a lot and tell your teen you love him or her. Praise and reward positive behaviors. This is a much more effective response to running away than punishment and yelling.

, Do not belittle, dismiss or invalidate the teenager’s feelings, even if the feelings seem weird to you. Things that seem inconsequential to you may actually be the worst thing that has ever happened to your teenager.


If you feel emotionally ready to do so, tell your teen that you would like to meet with them. Take them out to lunch or dinner. Ask how they are doing. Try to make your time together pleasant. Ask lots of questions but keep in mind that if you are taking an accusing tone, you are likely to put them on the defense and get no good answers. Why did they think this was the only way to be happy? What was their plan to survive and make a living on their own? What led up to this? Was it planned or impulsive?
Be patient. Whatever the problem is, screaming or jumping to punishment will probably just make it worse. Give them time clean up, eat and sleep before addressing any issues, as emotions are high for both of you, and they are probably tired, hungry and dirty. When you talk to them let them know how hurt and worried you were. Before you talk about a problem, make sure they know that you want to sort it out together. Show that you are willing to compromise to their needs and help solve any problems, whilst till upholding ground rules and values.
When it comes to teenagers running away, the best thing you can do is teach your teen, through your words and actions, that problems are to be faced and that running away creates more problems than it solves. Part of showing unconditional love is to be present. If you are always at work or distracted, try to make your teenager feel like more of a priority in your life.

, Although you should make sure that any rules are age appropriate and clearly explained, most teenagers really do need some reasonable boundaries. Too much freedom can also cause rebellion. It’s a balance.


Explain why being a runaway teen is risky, and educate them about the dangers of it. Make clear why this is not something that is okay and that you do not approve of it. Make sure they know that you are open to assisting them to work through problems they have at school, with their peers or with you so they can prevent being a runaway teen.
Don't give in to misbehavior if they threaten to run away again. They may just use such threats as a way to get out of following the rules. You need to determine whether there is just a power struggle going on or a deeper problem. Help your teenager develop problem-solving skills.
Provide clearly explained boundaries. Uninvolved parents who grant their teenagers too much freedom can give the impression to the child that they do not care. This can be a recipe for rebellion. Lay specific ground rules for your teen while letting him or her know that the only appropriate solution is to come to you rather than running away.

, Encourage your child to pursue a wholesome or just positive new activity, such as learning to play a musical instrument or mastering another language or a craft.


Perhaps you get the child involved in a youth support group or in religious activities or in a sport that will give them more of a focus or direction. Talk to them about this first, and make sure it’s something that matches their interests.
If they are being bullied for a specific reason (their glasses, the way they do their hair), help them improve their hygiene or look if they want while making it clear to them that bullying is never acceptable.

, Your instincts might tell you to relax the rules because your teenager says you are too strict. Sometimes it’s good to be strict. You can set rules that are firm even if your child chafes against them, but it’s also OK to revisit them in an open discussion with the teenager.


A teenager is less likely to rebel when parents set reasonable rules and discuss the rules with them. Having an open conversation about the rules and why they were set could make a difference. Make sure that you understand the situation clearly before deciding whether to administer loving discipline and how to do if it is needed.
Consider whether your rules are too inflexible or no longer age appropriate. For example, “because I said so” might be enough explanation for a young child but adolescents often need more – they need reasons. Maybe it’s time to relax a rule or two now that they are 15 not 8.
At the same time, it is important to exercise firmness for what is right. Many parents have found that they occasionally face a battle of wills, but they cannot give in when their decision is well-founded or anchored in positive values. However, if your teenager asks for an adjustment to his or her curfew, listen to him/her as he presents his case. A teenager who knows that he or she has been fully heard is more likely to respect and comply with the decision you make.

, There are certain behavioral changes that could indicate an intention to run away, although teenagers do sometimes run away without warning.


Packing bags, and stowing money, food, and valuables can all be signs of running away.
He or she may also threaten to run away, withdraw from family activities or seem to always disagree with you. If you notice any of these signs, take steps to reach out to your teen, and consider family counseling.

, Sometimes families are too embarrassed to share their problems with outsiders. However, if your teenager has already run away, or if you see warning signs that they might do so or are depressed or troubled, it’s absolutely time to seek counseling.


If they have a mental illness, don’t try to deny it’s really a problem. Help them seek out an appropriate mental health professional. Encourage them to see a doctor. Some issues require medical intervention. Recognize the signs of depression.
If you suspect your teen as a drug or alcohol problem that is causing them to leave home, help them try to get clean. Do your research, and see a professional right away.
If your teenager has tried to run away because of a romantic partner, talk about it with them. Talk about the choices that led up to it. Sometimes abusers seek to isolate a person from their family. Forbidding a teenager from seeing a particular person almost never works, unless the situation is such that it is reasonable to place a restraining order on the partner or if they are overage. If you are dealing with such a situation, contact police.

, The number one concern should be to make sure your child is safe. It is important to create the paper trail immediately. Running away can be very dangerous for teenagers.


The police can determine whether the teen has actually run away or whether something even more dangerous has occurred – such as an abduction. File a missing person's report.
You could also call a crisis line staffed by professionals trained in dealing with teenage runaways. Contact their circles of friends and family. Ask all family and friends to keep an eye out for them. Look for clues for where they went. What did they take with them? Are there clues on social media?
When your runaway teen comes home, spend some time away from each other before you address the problem. Once you have both cooled off enough to be objective, as your teen what drove him or her to run away, and listen. Lecture is only going to breed resentment.

, You should know who your teenager has befriended and socializes with, including peer groups in and outside of school. Pay attention to the little things (movies they're watching, books they're reading, music they listen too).


You need to know who their friends are and actually meet them. Ask them if they have a boy/girlfriend. If they do, invite them over for dinner.
Know what your teen is doing on the Internet, and on social media sites. This is a way that teenagers become in contact with people who might be a bad influence to them. It also gives you a window into their psyche.
Talk to their school guidance counselor. They may have seen behavior or have a perspective on your teenager’s problems that will be informative to you. "

Do you think that her clothes are too revealing? Does she leave the impression of promiscuity?
Is she changing her style to a more rebellious one just to annoy you?
Is her style purely tasteless and ""wrong""? Is it that the combinations she makes don't suit her?
Is it that she dresses inappropriately for certain occasions? Examples: school, formal events.
Does she have a tendency to wear rather poor quality clothes?;
, Think about dinner time, driving to school, or going out for ice cream. You may even want to have several of these ""sessions"" before bringing up the clothing issue.

, Picking a topic that you both dislike and can make fun of is a good start.

, You can start by saying ""Sweetie, I really dislike how we've become adversaries over the way you dress. I think it is making our relationship more difficult. Can we talk about it now?"" The conversation should cover three areas - how you feel about it, your standards for what is appropriate and the ramifications of her dressing as she does. When talking about your feelings always start with I. ""I get concerned, or I'm embarrassed..."" Be honest!

, Include teachers, grandparents, friends and possible friends.

, If it starts to get heated stop and take a deep breath and say: ""I think there are some things about this that you would like to say to me. In the past I may or may not have listened. Right now I'm ready to listen, so please take your time and don't be angry with me. That will make it easier for me to understand your point."" When you have listened to everything she has to say, ask her to listen to you and cover steps 4 and 5 again if you need to.

, Talk about how you can find a solution that would work for both of you. Be prepared to compromise. Insist that she not change after she leaves the house as it is childish and fosters a lack of trust between the two of you. Identify where you are not willing to compromise. Be clear and specific. After all, you are the parent. The clothing that has been identified as completely unacceptable should not be in her possession. Give it to Goodwill or the like.

She is eighteen, so chances are, that it's the normal stages of being teen-age.,
Find an activity you can do together where she won't feel judged (look through wikiHow!).,
More importantly, check on or mildly interact with her--daily, but also a few times throughout the day or whenever you are both home.,
Don't treat her like some kind of non-human just because she's a teenager.",How to Cope With a Thankless and Blaming Eighteen Year Old Daughter," If you don't ask her why she's upset, or angry, then she will pull away a little bit more. If she is not willing to talk about it, wisely put your concern aside for the moment and ask open-ended questions about her day or goals or interests or friends. However, ask interesting questions: a 'how did your day go?' Will just be responded to with a 'good.' If she begins to trust you, you may be able to share about your own. Be sensitive to how much she is willing to hear and talk about at each interaction.;
, Let her know that you want what's best for her, but she needs to open up and tell you how she is feeling, so you can talk to her about it.

, It will demonstrate that you value her opinion!

, At eighteen, you have a lot of new stress--not only with school, but also considering a career, and glimpsing into the future ahead. She may be just trying to sort out her life, and finding who she is. The way she is acting, could simply be her way of coping with all these issues of life.

, This also let's her know you care. Do an activity (or two) a couple times a week, if possible.

, (Calling her to see how she is doing counts, too). Regularity is important. Check on her just to see how she is doing. Don't be thrown off by a temper. But don't pry (until or unless she has grown to trust you when you do). If you have time, ask open ended questions with gentleness and having faith in her and her future.

, Teenagers hate being analysed like animals, and doing this will just push her further away. For example, teens hate those 'Why is your teen behaving like she is?' articles because they act like teens aren't human, and must be acting up because of some kind of thing that doesn't affect regular humans. For example, if an adult has a bad day at work, they will act stressed, and everyone will think, 'Oh, they must be stressed from work.' But, if a teenager has a bad day at school, and they act stressed, adults will try to analyse their behaviour, and assume they're acting stressed to get attention or something."

Deal with conflicts in a calm, balanced manner.,
Encourage and praise your teen for positive behaviors.,
Encourage your teen to socialize.,
Join a support group.",How to Cope with Your Teen's Mood Disorder2," It is not always easy, but if you want to build a healthy relationship with your child you need to be accepting of them and deal with any conflicts in a calm, balanced way. Try to listen to your teen and be open to their worries and concerns - the last thing you want is for them to shut you out completely.


For instance, if you find out that your teen has been skipping school, shouting at them and punishing them will do nothing but decrease the quality of your relationship, as the natural human reaction to being yelled at is to yell back or simply pull away.
So, instead of reacting in such a negative way, you could ask your teen to go for a walk and then, when it is just the two of you in a calm and serene setting, you can talk things over. Avoid asking questions that can be answered with a simple ""yes"" or ""no"" and try to ask questions that require a deeper level of communication.

, On the other hand, when your teens do something positive, do your best to encourage them and let them know how proud you are. For instance, if your teen decides to do volunteer work or gets a good grade at school, remember to praise them for it.


You may think that your child knows how you feel, but they still need to actually hear it from you – this significantly reduces anxiety levels by helping your teen understand that you really love and care for them.
Remember that teenagers need praise and appreciation – even though at this age they are striving to achieve independence, you are still a huge part of their lives and if you don’t accept them for who they are, neither will they.
Even though teens will seldom admit it, parents are still role-models and people whom they look up to, so it is up to you to fulfill that role.

, Isolation can make mood disorders in teenagers worse, as feelings of loneliness are amplified. Therefore, you should encourage your teen to hang out with friends, meet new people and engage in social activities and groups.


Offer to bring your teen and their friends somewhere fun, like the cinema, the bowling alley or to see some live music. This way, you teen can have a fun night and you can keep an eye on them to see how they interact as part of a group.
You should also encourage your teen to join a sports team or an after-school club - somewhere they can feel part of a community This will keep them out of the house and distract them from their problems.

, Dealing with a teen who suffers from a mood disorder can be emotionally draining. However, it's important that you don't allow it to take over your life. Consider joining a support group for families of troubled teens - these people will understand what you're going through and will be able to offer advice and support.


It's completely normal to experience feelings of frustration, anger, sadness and helplessness. Talking about these issues with someone you trust, such as a close family member or friend can be very helpful.
You could even consider seeing a therapist yourself if you feel like it's all getting too much. This may even help you to understand your child better and get a better idea of what they're going through.

Understand that teens with mood disorders will require therapy.,
Choose the right type of therapist for your teen's condition.,
Ensure that your teen takes their prescribed medications.",How to Cope with Your Teen's Mood Disorder3," If you really want to handle your teen’s mood disorder in a positive and efficient way, you'll need to send them to a therapist. That is definitely not to say that your teen is “crazy”, it just means that mood disorders can become complicated if they are left to resolve themselves.


A professional psychotherapist will have the experience and expertise required to really understand your teen and to get to the roots of his or her mood disorder. Your therapist will be able to help you understand the situation better and therefore handle it better.
A therapist is not someone who will tell you or your child what to do, but rather will help you see a different perspective and will teach you how to deal with anxiety, stress and negativity in a way that binds you together and makes you stronger as individuals at the same time.

, Choosing the right kind of therapy is very specific to your teen’s type of mood disorder, as well as age, previous history, values, opinions, etc.


Therefore, the best course of action is to talk things over with your general practitioner – he or she will be able to give you comprehensive information about your specific situation and will have a list of mental healthcare professional in your area.
Your general practitioner may recommend that your teen goes for psychoanalytic therapy (or ""talk therapy""), cognitive-behavioral therapy, group therapy., or a combination of the three.

, Medications are an essential part of treatment for many mood-disorders, especially things like bipolar or depression. Therefore it's important that your teen sticks to their medication schedule.


Taking medication on a regular, long-term basis is a lot of responsibility for a teenager, so you should try to monitor their medication schedule. However, you should avoid making your teenager feel like you're constantly nagging or that you don't trust them - give them the opportunity to prove that they can be responsible.
Keep an eye out for any negative symptoms caused by prescription medications and encourage your teen to speak to their doctor if they are feeling unwell. The doctor may be able to reduce or increase the dosage, making the side effects more manageable.

Make sure your teen has accurate information and decision making skills to help protect themselves from the pressure to have sex, unintended pregnancy and HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases.,
If you are having a hard time talking to your teen about sex, always admit it and keep a sense of humor.,
When you talk about sex, always use examples and case studies from other sources such as TV, Movies, articles, and real-life situations such as a friend being pregnant.,
Share your values regarding sex.,
The last thing you want to do is judge.,
Ask your teen what he or she wants to know about sex.,
Don't always assume that because your teen is asking questions about sex, they're thinking about having it.,
Don't blame the victim when discussing rape.,
Give your teen sensible reasons to wait to have sex.,
Tell your teen its okay to be a virgin and that not everybody is having sex.,
Don't assume that if they want to talk to you about a sexual situation a friend is involved in, they're really talking about themselves.,
Teach your teen ways to handle pressure from friends or other people to have sex.,
Leave age-appropriate articles or books about sex for teens around your home so your teen can pick them up on their own and read them.

,
Always talk to your teen about sex.,
Be aware your teen may take this as an opportunity to come out gay, bisexual, lesbian or transgender.,
Don't try to be the ""cool parent"" but don't act like a dictator either.",How to Communicate with your Teen About Sex,";
, That helps keep the conversation more emotionally safe. Laughing at yourself is rarely a faux pas.

, Think about this from their position - how would you feel if your mom or dad talked about personal sexual experiences? For many people not thinking about their parents having sex is part of the incest taboo, which is a natural instinct. Discussing it in the abstract or about fiction or other people's sex lives defuses this problem. This may also be why so many parents have trouble discussing sex with their teens.

, If you have beliefs that you shouldn't have sex until marriage, just admit it. Face the fact that your teen may choose to have sex despite your values. Face the fact that your teen may disagree about your values and not think it's wrong, which may be even more shocking than that your teen might do something you think is wrong. This can happen in either direction - parents with more liberal sexual mores may find their teens getting caught up in right-wing youth movements and condemning their values. ""Agree to disagree"" is a way to keep the family together. Whichever way the disagreement goes, make sure the teen is fully informed about the subject, get the teen to agree to that.

, Your teen will shut down, and you may be doing a lot of harm to your relationship with them and their attitude towards sex.


Don't lecture. This isn't a classroom. Engage your teen in respectful dialogue, listen to your teen's ideas on the subject and take them seriously. Respect is mutual, when you treat your teen with respect what you say will carry a lot more impact.
If you can imagine your teen is twenty years old and discussing this at a time when his or her options are all legal, that may help create that sense of adult respect to give impact to your discussion. If you have a lot of fears about this, it's true - in only a short time your teen will be legally adult and make their own decisions with or without your input. You need to make sure they know what they're doing when they make those choices and understand their reasons why - and know that they understand their reasons for those choices instead of getting tricked by unscrupulous people. This is also the way to establish the trust that when they really are in their twenties and run into bad situations, they are still willing to turn to you for emotional support.
Discuss relationships too, good relationships and unhealthy relationships. This is also a time to bring up the kinds of emotional trouble people run into with romantic and sexual relationships, problems they may already be facing with controlling romantic partners, unfaithful partners, lying partners. Bring up the issue of trust and sexuality, how sex without trust can lead to a lot more problems in life than it does with safer activities like kissing and making out, emotional pledges. There's a big difference in walking away from a bad relationship with or without a child. There's a big difference remembering your first experience bitterly with a bad person or fondly with someone you can still trust as an ex or a partner.

, If you don't know answers to certain aspects of sex just admit it. Find answers with your teen in books or other resources. If your teen is dismissive and wants to blow off the entire topic because he or she already knows everything about it, question them about the important points in the first step and make sure they really do know rather than just think what they know is all there is to know. This includes condom use and contraceptive information.

, More teens who are knowledgeable put off becoming sexually active than those who are ignorant. The truth is more likely to make them think twice about casual or unprotected sex.

, Educate yourself about rape. If your teen is talking to you about rape, your teen needs to know she or he can trust you if they get raped. Since sexual assault happens to one in five women during their lifetime, it's not something to avoid the topic. Discussing rape with your male teen is important too, boys and men get raped less often than women and girls but it happens. Also your boy may be at risk of becoming a rapist if he doesn't understand what rape is and why it's wrong, what its consequences are and that giving a girl a date-rape drug in order to get her consent is a form of rape that may get him prosecuted.


If your daughter or son reveals that they've been raped, listen more than talk. Respect their feelings. Leave the decision to prosecute up to the teen, encourage going to the authorities but understand and be aware of the risks and problems going to court. This includes statutory rape. They are close to adulthood, if you want a relationship with this teen as an adult, don't make this the breaking point that means they never come back when legal age. Suggest and strongly encourage counseling. Suggest and strongly encourage documenting the rape to give your teen the option of prosecuting but don't blame them if they showered and destroyed the evidence because they wanted to be clean. That's a natural reaction. If it happened long ago, there's not much chance of prosecuting anyway but you can help them heal the damage and protect themselves in future. Do not force contact or confrontation with the rapist even if that's your current spouse or domestic partner. Do not tell the teen they're lying and deny what happened, that will break your relationship with your child to no purpose.

, Tell your teen its okay to choose to wait even if he or she has had sex before.

, The decision to become sexually active is too important to be based on other people's point of view. Especially with young male virgins, tell your teen it's okay to lie about it to teasing peers and point out how many of his friends may also be lying about it. That peace-keeping white lie is more likely to be believed if they are knowledgeable about sex.

, That's a sitcom gag, not a real situation. Most often teens who are talking about a friend either know someone or heard about someone who's in a bad situation, got scared and want to know how to handle it if that ever happens to them. They may be looking for help for a real friend. Don't ask who the friend is until you've reached a level of trust where your teen knows the friend's not going to get in trouble by your knowing. Understand your legal liabilities in the situation. You may be giving good advice to a teen you don't know through your teen's friendship but if you said something directly to the teen you could be infringing on the teens' parents' rights.


Do advise the teen by way of your teen to seek help from police or Child Services if there are situations those authorities can help with, such as rape, abuse or incest. Don't advise them to run away or do anything else that's illegal.
Do make it clear to your teen and their friends that having sex under the influence of a date-rape drug is rape and the teen who gave it to them is responsible for it. Advise against taking it because it's illegal and it will also suspend your teen's judgment about sex and other activities.

, To feel comfortable talking openly with you, assure your teen that you will not punish him or her for being totally honest.

,, Your first discussion with your teen about sex should never ever be its last. Tell your teen that you are always willing to talk about anything related to sex whether its questions or concerns.

, Educate yourself on GBLT issues and deal with your feelings about them before the discussion so that you don't react in a strong negative way and destroy the relationship the first time it comes up. Chances are if your kid is GBLT, there were signs before the topic came up openly and you suspected it. Acceptance is the only way you will be able to still have a relationship with your child. Acceptance isn't necessarily approval, but at least make it clear that you understand this isn't something they can change about themselves and that you love your child for who they are regardless of the challenges this gives them. Be as supportive and accepting as you can. If you belong to a church that condemns GBLT, consider looking for a church that doesn't and talking to a new pastor about how to live with this revelation. If you prepare for the possibility before the teen comes out, you may be able to provide support where they expect rejection and build a much stronger relationship with your child.


Consider family counseling whatever your feelings are about their coming out. That can give both of you time to get over the pain if their revelation took you by surprise and shocked you. Homophobia is a real phobia, it's like fear of heights or fear of drowning, your reactions are real and natural if you were raised to hate GBLT people and never questioned that hate. A good counselor can help you overcome the fear and rebuild trust with your child even if you said things you later regret.
Really consider a GBLT-friendly congregation or church, spiritual and religious support is very important to be able to deal with this kind of situation. Jesus got that angry at the money-changers in the temple, not at people who come out different from other people and might be frightening. He was often on the side of sinners and the poor and the rejected, even if you believe acting on it is a sin then understanding that they can't help being who they are is vitally important to that acceptance and being able to keep the relationship.

, Your teenager needs to see you as open, but also someone that knows where the limits are. If you really are the ""cool parent"" you don't have to work at it because your relationship is already that strong and trusting.

Add embellishments to the box that reflect your daughter’s personality and favorite colors.You can go for a quirky tone or something more elegant, depending on your daughter’s personality. Your daughter might be the type to make a joke about her first period, or you could have a girl who’s going to want a memorable keepsake to get teary over.;
, In addition to a gift box, your daughter is going to want something to keep her essentials in when she’s at school. The kit should be something small that she can fit in her backpack, such as a pencil case. It should also be large enough to fit several pads and other essentials.Don’t put the word “period” on it or buy something red. While you might find this cute or funny, your daughter probably won’t.

, The purpose of the box and kit is to make your daughter feel ready to handle any situation related to her period. Include all the obvious essentials. If there’s room, add other items that you feel are appropriate for your daughter’s unique needs.All kits and boxes should have pads, wet wipes or tissues, hand sanitizer, and a cute pair of replacement underwear.
Most girls won’t start out using tampons. If your daughter is a swimmer, she’s an exception.
You might also want to add a little booklet of tips to the gift box. For example, you could write a note telling your daughter to keep an extra sweatshirt in her locker just in case she has a leakage emergency.

, Enough with the serious stuff. This is supposed to be a celebration! Put some chocolate or your daughter’s favorite sweet snack in the gift box. Write a card telling her you love her, and that you’re always there for her.Go for a sappy card if you’re creating an elegant keepsake.

What happened? What led them to share photos of themselves or someone else?What made them curious to engage in this type of communication?


Say, “This conversation will likely make us both uncomfortable, but it’s important to talk. Can you tell me what led to this? What were you hoping to get from this?”
If your teen received a sext, ask them why someone might send a sexual image or text.;
, Despite what emotions you feel, be careful not to shame your child. Their actions do not define them, and casting harsh judgment may affect your teen’s self-esteem long-term. Talk about the dangers of sexting and the consequences of it without making personal judgments.Engage with curiosity. Instead of making accusations, ask questions and seek to understand your teen instead of blaming them.
Use the opportunity to teach, not shame. For example, instead of saying, “I can’t believe how foolish you are!” say, “What led you to send that photo? What felt exciting about it?”

, If a photo of your teen is shared, understand that your teen will likely feel humiliated, ashamed, or embarrassed. This experience can affect your child’s self-esteem and affect their mental health.Despite your own disapproval and disappointment at your teen’s behavior, recognize that this is likely a very traumatic experience for them. Give comfort and reassurance to your teen for the difficulty they are going through.


Withhold your judgment and criticism and instead, be available for your child. You can deal with the after-effects soon enough.
If a photo is shared with your teen, say, “How do you think that person feels?”

, Any type of nude photograph, taken or shared with sexual intent, of a child under the age of 18 is illegal and considered child pornography. Any sharing of that photograph may be considered trafficked or distributed child pornography. So even if your teen sent a picture of themselves to someone else, that could be considered distributing child pornography. If the pictures on your teen's phone are of another teen, that can also be considered being in possession of child pornography.And if an adult has been sending and receiving pictures from your teen, this may constitute a crime.If you’re concerned about legal implications, consult with an attorney right away.


Let your teen know that this is very serious, could result in criminal processing, and may affect the rest of their lives.
Understand that the genders of the teens, in the context of sexting, is irrelevant. A teen sexting a picture of themselves to a teen of the same sex is no less legally or morally reprehensible than a teen sexting a picture of themselves to a teen of the opposite sex.

, Teens are still developing skills and judgment. It’s often difficult for teens to grasp long-term consequences of impulsive decisions.While flirting and exploring sexuality may feel fun and pushing boundaries is normal, technology brings an added level of danger to these actions. Explain to your teen how these actions can affect them.


For example, explain to your teen that their reputation may change if other people learn of or gossip about a sext.
Legal problems can haunt a prospective college application or employment opportunity.

, If your child receives a nude photo, have them delete it right away. If your teen has nude photos of themselves, have them delete those, too. Your family will not want to risk having what is considered child pornography in the home or with any association to any members of the family., If your child has sent photos, do not look at them. Not only will you not want to see them, but you will likely embarrass your teen greatly. If your child receives a photo, also do not look at it and do not share it. You may have the urge to say to the sender’s parents, “Look what your teen sent mine!” However, this could count as distributing child pornography.There is no circumstance where it is okay to share sexual material of a minor.

, While it’s important to handle these situations as a parent, keep your child informed. If you talk to other parents or to your teen’s school, let them know. It’s important for your teen to have a voice.This experience can affect your teen’s social life and emotional wellbeing. Staying involved can help them feel more empowered.


Taking away your teen’s empowerment around sexuality can be harmful. As your teen grows into an adult, they should know that they have choices regarding their sexuality and to choose wisely.

, If other teens are involved, find ways to unite with other parents in how to handle the situation.This will clearly communicate to the teens that the situation is serious and that appropriate action is important. Having a united front will help all teens involved recognize that they are being treated in a fair way that is consistent with how other teens are being treated in the situation.


Find out from your child what other teens are involved in the situation. Contact their parents and say, “Our teens have been sending and receiving sexual texts. Let’s unite and address this altogether.”

, Carefully consider whether to get the school involved. You may involve the school if photos or texts are sent while on school property or during school hours. While it may be good to have outside intervention through the school and disciplinary action, notifying the school may also come with some difficult side-effects. Some schools have mandatory reporting requirements, which means that they are required to report any activity to law enforcement. This would mean that the incident would become a law enforcement case and potentially become a long, drawn-out battle.While some cases it is necessary to involve law enforcement, carefully consider whether your child’s situation requires intervention.

, Teens shouldn’t solely get negative feedback for engaging sexual curiosity. Create a healthy atmosphere for your teen to talk about sex and feel comfortable doing so.While this might make you cringe, it’s important for both boys and girls to have positive messages about sexuality and choices.


Tell your teen that they have choices about what they do with their body and who they share it with. Talk about when to say “No” and how to say “No.”

, If you’re concerned about the way your teen is expressing their sexuality or you feel like sexting has negatively impacted your teen’s wellbeing, talk to a therapist. Some teens develop symptoms of depression or anxiety after humiliation or difficult situations. If you’re concerned about your child’s wellbeing and emotional health, have them talk to a therapist.Ask your insurance provider, general practitioner, or local mental health clinic for a referral to a therapist. You can also ask friends and family for a recommendation.

, If you’re worried about your teens online or phone behavior, create some limits around social media and texting. You may consider purchasing a phone with no photo capabilities or no data or internet access. You may choose to ground your teen from using their phone or limit their use.Teens are most likely to receive inappropriate messages and photos late at night. Create a family rule of no electronics after a certain time each evening.
Put family computers in public locations so that you can (casually) monitor activity.

, You might feel jolted after realizing that your teen is exploring their sexuality. It can be difficult to realize that your teen has these feelings and wants to explore them. Think about how you want to cope with these thoughts and feelings. While some may choose to ignore or push away these thoughts, others may want to help their child work through this confusing time.


Make sure you take care of yourself throughout this time. Take a daily walk, write in a journal, or take a bath. You can also begin a meditation practice to help you cope with stress.Consider seeing a therapist if you struggle to cope with the stress or have a difficult time interacting with your child after a sexting incident. You may also consider family therapy.

Ask your daughter what she wants to do to celebrate.,
Throw a party if your daughter is social and outgoing.,
Plan a one-on-one night if your daughter is private.,
Plan a period-friendly menu to make her feel better.,
Get corny with the menu if your daughter wants a laugh.,
Set up a massage train to ease cramps.",How to Celebrate Your Daughter's First Period2," Get permission from your daughter before you start planning any events, and offer her some options so she can choose what would be best for her. Keep in mind that the whole point is to make your daughter feel positively about her period. Make any party plans together.Don’t get upset if your daughter’s ideas for the party are super different from your own. It’s her party, and she should be the one who gets to control it.

, Invite some of her friends over for a slumber party and keep things low key but fun. Let the girls celebrate in their own way. Having these positive and supportive parties could become a new tradition among your daughter and her close friends!, Some girls may cringe at the thought of celebrating her period with her friends (or, even worse, your friends). If that’s the case, celebrate with just the two of you. This may mean more to some girls., There are lots of foods that can help your daughter through any tough symptoms that came along with her first period. Nuts, leafy greens, and foods that are high in iron or potassium are all great for keeping her healthy and happy during her cycle.Set out a few bowls of sunflower seeds and walnuts. Drizzle them with a little honey to add some sweetness. Serve a big spinach salad and make a banana bread for dessert.You can also ask your daughter if there are any foods that would satisfy her cravings. Chocolate brownies could be a big hit.

, If a period-themed menu appeals to your daughter’s sense of humor, get a little silly with the food and drinks. Plan a menu that celebrates your daughter’s period by choosing red foods and drinks, or dishes that symbolize fertility.A sample menu could include mini-quiches (which have lots of eggs in them), spaghetti and red sauce, and red velvet cupcakes. You can also serve cranberry juice or even sparkling pink lemonade. If it’s winter, go for the egg nog!

, If you’ve planned a slumber party for several girls, they’re not going to want to rub each other’s bellies. But giving each other a nice shoulder and neck rub relaxes tense muscles, and this, too, can help with menstrual cramps.If it’s just you and your daughter, you can talk about other ways to ease cramps. This could include showing her how to lightly rub her lower belly, or giving her a heating pad.

Spread out talks about puberty over multiple years.,
Be prepared with the right supplies.,
Talk about periods as positive experiences.,
Answer your daughter’s questions directly and honestly.,
Read a book or watch a video together.,
Reassure your daughter with personal stories.",How to Celebrate Your Daughter's First Period3," Begin talking about your daughter’s body as soon as she has questions. This will likely be as soon as she can talk. Have age-appropriate talks spaced out over your daughter’s life, instead of one, big “Period Talk.”You can talk to very young children about their body parts, and what various things are for. Provide more details as she gets older, always checking to make sure your daughter understands the information you’re giving her.

, Most girls get their period when they’re about 12 or 13, although some girls could get their period when they’re 9 or 10. Once your daughter hits these years, stock up on items for her kit. You don’t want to make a panicked, late-night pharmacy run with your daughter crying in the backseat., Avoid calling your period “the Curse,” or anything similarly terrifying. Your daughter should understand that this is something women experience naturally as they grow up. It’s an exciting sign that she’s growing up.Tell your daughter this definitely isn’t something she should be embarrassed about. Explain that all women and girls get their periods. In fact, because periods are part of becoming a mother, the survival of the human race depends on them!, Your daughter will probably have lots of questions for you. Some you’ll know the answers for, and some you won’t. Keep up a comfortable and open tone during this chat, and make sure your daughter knows that no question is a bad one.Common questions might include, “Why am I the first one of my friends to get my period,” “Can I still go swimming,” “How long does it last,” “Why does it happen,” or “Am I normal?”
Tell your daughter when she’s asked a question you don’t have an answer for. Use this as a chance to look for good, reliable answers together. You can go online, search in a book, or call your daughter’s doctor.

, Don’t just hand your daughter a book or a link to a video and think you’re done. She might not read or watch whatever you give her, and then you’re leaving her totally unprepared. Explore this stuff together and make it part of an experience that you share with one another.Some good options for books include Lynda Madaras’s What’s Happening to My Body? and My Body, My Self for Girls by the same author. American Girl also has a line of books called The Care and Keeping of You with good information.

, Your daughter might want to hear all about your embarrassing period stories, as this could make her laugh and feel more comfortable. She may also think this is weird, so let her tell you what she needs from you.Not all parents have had periods, and that’s ok! If your daughter wants to talk to someone who’s had a period, and that person isn’t you, put her in touch with a friend, family member, or doctor. By doing this, you’re still giving your daughter the support she needs, and she’ll know it came from you.

This can be a general ‘cranky’ mood that can also come with mood swings that lead her into sadness. She might ‘snap’ at you more often than usual and may seem generally unhappy. She may also suddenly spiral into deep sadness, or cry often out of both annoyance and sadness.For instance, if your teen is normally happy and pleasant, but has suddenly become moody or unreasonably angry or sad about a lot of things, she could be depressed.;
, Another sign of depression is a sudden lack of interest in activities and things that she used to have a passion for. While this could mean that she is just outgrowing a certain activity, losing interest in many activities that she has shown a great love for in the past should be a red flag.For example, if your daughter has had a passion for soccer for many years, but suddenly has no energy or desire to go to practice, this could be a sign of depression.

, If you have noticed a sudden and drastic change in your daughter’s eating habits, you should keep track of any further changes. Monitor how much (or how little) your daughter eats while at the dinner table. Ask yourself is she:


Eating more than usual?
Eating less than usual or having to be coaxed into eating?
Showing a disinterest (rather than a dislike) of the food in front of her?

, Depression can lead to feels of exhaustion but can also lead to restlessness. If your daughter is suddenly very restless or unable to sleep at night, but seemingly always tired, you may have reason to be concerned. Changes in sleep can include:


Extreme trouble waking up in the morning.
Exhaustion throughout the day.
Sleeping much more than usual, such as sleeping pretty much any time she does not absolutely have to be awake. Excessive sleeping is defined as anything over 9 hours a day.

, Physical agitation is when a person has a hard time staying still. If your teen is pacing a lot, shaking her arms or legs, or simply being unable to sit down, she is exhibiting signs of physical agitation.Some people with depression will show the exact opposite of physical agitation—they will move much more slowly than normal and will seem to be in no hurry to do anything or get anywhere.

, If your teen is depressed, she may begin to make negative comments about herself. At the same time, she might become overly sensitive to rejection, which can then lead to her saying more negative things about herself.Examples would be:


“I’m not good enough”.
“I didn’t deserve such and such anyway”.
“I am fat/ugly/stupid”.

, Depression can often lead to not caring about school or grades. If your normally on-top-of-it student is suddenly getting bad grades, skipping school, or just showing an extreme disinterest in what she is studying, she may be depressed.


Contact your teen’s teacher(s) about your teen’s grade or school performance. Teachers can often be an invaluable source of behavioral information. Ask them about any concerning behavior that they may have seen your teen exhibiting in the classroom.

, Depression can lead to physical pain like headaches and stomach aches. Take your teen to a doctor to get checked out. If nothing seems to be physically wrong with her, you may want to consider depression as a cause of the problem.

, You should call the police or hospital (9-1-1) right away if your teen is acting in this way, as she could be considering committing suicide. Other signs of suicidal behavior include:


Writing about death, including writing a will.
Giving away possessions.
Talking about how you, your family, and the world would be better off without her.
Dangerous or self-harming behavior like increased drug or alcohol abuse, or reckless driving.
Threatening suicide. Between 50% to 75%of people considering suicide will give a family member or friend some warning that they will commit suicide. While some people won’t go through with it, every suicide threat should be taken seriously.


, When a person becomes depressed, she may begin to withdraw from family and friends. Because of this, it is important to keep your communication with your teen open and straightforward. Talk to your teen about depression and follow the tips listed in the rest of this section.


Persevere—letting your teen know that you are there for her and want to talk to her about what she is going through is very important. If she shuts you out, try again.

, Let your teen know that you’re there for her, fully and unconditionally. Try not to ask a lot of questions but make it clear that you’re ready and willing to provide any support needed. Let her know that you want to talk to her about what she is going through and that you will do anything to help her., Your teen may shut you out at first, which is relatively normal teen behavior—depressed or otherwise. Talking about feelings of depression can be tough for anyone, let alone a teen going through normal teen dramas on top of depression. Respect your teen’s comfort level while still letting her know that you are concerned and willing to listen.


Be patient with your teen. It might take her some time to sort out what she is feeling, or find the courage to talk to you about it. However, if you think she is getting worse, or showing suicidal behavior and is still not talking to you about it, seek immediate professional help.


, Resist any urge to criticize or pass judgment once your teen begins to confide in you. Avoid offering unsolicited advice or ultimatums as she might see these as a threat and may close up again.It is important to remember that depression is not something your teen can control. Do not get frustrated by her feelings of depression, because she can’t help how she feels. Your role is to listen and support her through this really difficult time.

, Don’t try to talk to your teen out of her depression, even if her emotions don't make sense to you. Simply acknowledge the pain and sadness she is feeling. Let her know that it's okay to feel the way she feels, and you don't think she's being ""crazy"" or irrational. This lets her know that you care and take her feelings seriously, so she will be more likely to come to you in the future.


Examples of validating statements include ""That must be really difficult"" and ""I'm sorry to hear that.""

, If you have noticed symptoms and have talked to your teen and it seems that she really is depressed, you should seek professional help. Bring her to a psychologist or therapist who can do a proper diagnosis of what your teen is experiencing. If she is diagnosed with depression, make an appointment with a therapist so that your daughter can get the help that she needs.

, If you have recognized symptoms, talked about depression with your teen, and have taken her to see a therapist who has diagnosed her with depression, it is of the utmost importance that you show her that she has your full support. This will be a difficult time for her—and for you. Work together to build each other up and support each other.


For example, drive your teen to her sessions with a therapist and pick her up afterwards. Ask her about her session and show her that she can talk about it if she wants. Make her feel loved and supported by being there for her.

, Communication is one of the most important factors in a healthy relationship. To ensure that your teen feels like she can talk to you about what she is going through, it is important to keep communication between you two, and the rest of the family, as open as possible. Ask your teen about what she is going through and what she thinks about her therapy. You should also discuss depression as a condition openly and rationally.Remember to be empathetic and sensitive, but open and honest, in your communications about her disorder. Be loving and kind, but also be realistic about the steps that need to be taken so that she can recover fully.

, Because your teen can get bogged down by depression, you can help her by keeping track of when she needs to be at different appointments. Drive her to and from them, and use that time to talk to her about how she is feeling, or simply show your support by singing along to her favorite songs with her.


While therapy should be considered as a treatment before medications should be taken, your teen may be prescribed medication if her depression is severe enough. If this is the case, you should help her to keep track of her medications and when they need to be refilled.

, Sometimes, talking to people that are going through the same things can really help to raise awareness about a condition. Ask your teen if she would like to go to a support group. At a support group she will:


Talk to others about their experiences and get to share her own with people who really understand.
Hear inspirational stories about people overcoming their own conditions.
See that she is not alone in her fight against depression.

, Family counseling will help you understand what your teen is going through and will help your family cope with the disorder. During counseling, you can talk about what you are all experiencing, how you can make your family dynamic as supportive as possible, and how changes can be made to promote a better familial relationship., One of the things that can increase feelings of depression is the thought that you can’t achieve anything you want to. If your teen is struggling with these feelings, help her to set realistic goals for herself.


For example, if your teen’s grade in algebra has dropped to a D, help her to create goal that she will be able to achieve, like raising her grade to an A or B by the end of the quarter (depending on how much time she has). Provide further help by offering to go over homework with her, or getting her a tutor that can help her to catch up with the rest of the class.

, Depression puts a negative spin on everything, including the way your teen sees herself. In order to change these thoughts, you need to first have your teen identify these thoughts. Have her write down her various negative thoughts in a journal. Then, with your teen’s permission, go back over some of these thoughts together.Challenge these thoughts by encouraging your teen to not be so hard on herself.
Give her examples of times that she was amazing.
Have her list things that she is achieved, and help her write the list if she has trouble coming up with examples.

, Have your teen aim for 8 to 9 hours of sleep each night so that she can wake up feeling refreshed and ready to take on the day. Make sure that she gets a bit of sunlight every day, and keep her stress in check by teaching her some relaxation techniques.


Relaxation techniques include going to yoga, practicing meditation, or trying some deep breathing exercises.

, Studies have shown that pets can actually relieve depression.If you are open to the idea of getting a family pet, you should consider getting one to help your teen with her depression. Caring for another living being, and getting unconditional love in return, can be incredibly beneficial for someone dealing with depression.

, When you exercise, your body releases endorphins that create a feeling of happiness. In fact, studies have shown that exercise may be as effective as medication when it comes to fighting depression.Encourage your teen to get at least 30 minutes of exercise, five days a week. This could mean:


Walking the dog every day.
Joining a sports team.
Going a bicycle ride together.

, Don’t let your teen skip meals and offer healthy vitamin-rich snacks. Avoid providing her with too much fatty foods and junk food, as they will make her feel lethargic. Instead, focus on fresh fruits and veggies, lean proteins, low-fat dairy, and complex carbs.


Minimize sugary, refined carbs (like cookies, candy, and fruit juice concentrates) and focus on complex carbohydrates (like whole-wheat bread, beans, lentils, and brown rice).

Be a good male role model.",How to Connect with Your Teenage Daughter," A girl who has a good relationship with her mother tends to be more confident and independent. This is because a mother has a great impact on her daughter’s life, and can help to build her self-esteem and sense of self-worth, which is very important for teenage girls. Additionally:


Your relationship with your daughter can affect her mental health. Having a dysfunctional mother-daughter relationship can lead to depression, low self-esteem and bad decisions.
Being a good mother will also help your daughter to be a better mother herself in the future, as she will take what she has learned from you and implement it in her own life.;
, If you feel as if the two of you have grown apart in recent years, or if you feel that your daughter is closer to their dad, it's important that you take time to build a connection slowly. Forcing the issue can simply push your daughter further away.


This can be tough, especially if your teenage daughter is reluctant to let you in, but don’t lose hope as it doesn’t mean that it is impossible to change the situation.
To begin with, you may ask your spouse to help you repair your relationship with your daughter. Have your spouse talk to her and ask her to give you a chance.

, When trying to connect with your teenage daughter, make an effort to be there for her as a friend. As much as you can, keep an open mind about what your daughter shares with you and try to think outside the box.


Try to avoid being too judgmental or making snap decisions about what she can or can't do. Try to consider things from her point of view and to interact with her in a calm rational manner.
Of course, you're still her mother and it's your job to offer her guidance and advice, but try to do this in such a way that she listens to you. If you make too many rules or expressly forbid her from doing things she wants, she will simply rebel and go in the opposite direction.

, Try to keep the lines of communication between you and your daughter open at all times, so you can share your experiences with each other while practicing the power of active listening.


Set aside some time at the end of each day or week where you sit down together with a cup of tea and talk about your lives. Your daughter needs to feel like you have time for her
Stay in touch through texting and calling when she is out of the house, but do not do it too much as she might misunderstand you for being overprotective.

, This is the best part of strengthening your relationship with your daughter, as it bridges the gap and allows you to create some amazing memories together. Some examples are:


Enjoy some adventurous sports together. Find a common interest such as rock climbing or yoga and you will be surprised by how much she looks forward to this “sports date” with you.
Have a spa date or a total makeover. This is for both of you to relieve stress while feeling and looking beautiful.
Shop for bags and shoes. This will help you to understand your daughters style. This will work in your favor when it comes to buying a gift for her.
Travel together. This is a fun way for both of you to explore a new place while also discovering more about each other’s individual personalities.

, You will experience lots of clashes with your daughter because it is perfectly normal for moms and teen daughters to disagree on many things. However, it is how you deal with these disagreements that really matters.


Apologize,when necessary, and learn to always forgive her as well. She will appreciate it when you don't make a big deal out of her little lapses, and treat her more like an adult,
Show her the importance of letting go of the pain of her past experiences to help her avoid holding grudges.

, It is a wonderful feeling for any mother to have the opportunity to teach her daughter how to look good, including applying proper makeup, choosing nice dresses, etc.


Nonetheless, being beautiful is not all about what#s on the outside. What's more important is your daughter's inner beauty because this is what will define her as a person.
Focus on explaining to her that true beauty that comes from being positive, honest, patient, generous, respectful, loving, etc.

, Remember when you were your daughter’s age? Weren't you the exact same? Make an effort to understand her as much as possible. She will be happy to know she has a non-judgmental mom who really gets her.


However, it is best to give her some words of wisdom to help her on her way. Tell her about the mistakes that you made in the past and how you wish you could change them, but don't forbid her from doing the same thing.
Your daughter needs to make her own mistakes in order to learn from them. Just make sure that she has all the information she needs beforehand in order to make an informed choice.

, Learn to appreciate everything about her, even her weaknesses. It takes a lot of patience and commitment to be able to love someone selflessly.


Above all, do not forget to tell your daughter you love her. Don't just assume that she knows - she needs to hear it.

, Despite the fact that your daughter feels that she can already do everything on her own because she is already a teenager, she is still dependent on you in many ways. As a parent, it is important to set boundaries.


Remember that you are her mother, not her best friend and sometimes you will need to do things that she doesn't like for her safety and well-being.
Take comfort in the fact that even if she doesn't appreciate it now, she will thank you for it in the future.

, A girl who has a good relationship with her father tends to be more confident and independent. This is connected to how a father views and treats his daughter.


For example, when a father demands too much and neglects his daughter’s skills, there is a tendency for the daughter to have low self-esteem, where she stops herself from doing something out of fear of being rejected.
The relationship you have with your daughter will also influence her relationship with her future boyfriend/husband. This is because your daughter tends to look up to you as her standard when finding the love of her life.

, This is more applicable, for example, for dads who were not present while their daughters were growing up, or for dads who feel that their daughters are closer to their moms.


These situations can be tough, but don’t lose hope as it doesn’t mean that it is impossible to change the situation.
To begin with, you may ask your daughter's mom to help you repair your relationship with your daughter, as your daughter may be more inclined to listen to her.

, Listen to your daughter when she shares her dreams and fears with you. Be as compassionate as you can, and try to be sensitive to her emotions when forming a response. Show her that she can trust you and feel secure enough to confide to you.

, This builds trust between the two of you. You should also try to share some things about yourself, as this will allow your daughter to get to know you better.


After a conflicts, apologize when necessary, as you are teaching your daughter the importance of being humble enough to admit mistakes.

, This is the best part of strengthening your relationship with your daughter as it bridges the gap between you and allows you to create amazing memories together. Some examples of things you can do include


Go on a vacation. Organize a vacation for just the two of you, or even for the whole family. Use the vacation as an opportunity to get to know each other better and have some fun.
Enjoy some indoor games or outdoor sports. Challenge your daughter to a game of Foosball or table tennis, or invite her to shoot some hoops with you outside.
Beat each other at video games. Take some time to just hang out with your daughter and play video or computer games together.
Bring her to a concert. Bringing your daughter to see her favorite musician or singer can be a great way to bond.

, Fathers are known to be the ones who provide for the family and who keep them safe. Make sure that you do your duty to your daughter and make her believe that she can rely on you.


Protect her financially by making sure her educational fees are paid, or by setting up a college fund for her. Even if she doesn't fully appreciate this now, she will in the future.
Furthermore, protecting her doesn’t only mean keeping her safe physically and financially, but also keeping her safe emotionally--protect her heart from being broken.

, Tell her she is beautiful. Be careful not to make negative comments about the way she looks or dresses. A negative comment from you could be a major blow to her self esteem.


This is also a great opportunity for you to explain to your daughter that being beautiful doesn’t just mean looking good physically.
What is more significant is the character of a person and whether or not they have a good heart.

, You must know what her interests in order to be able to appreciate her skills and capabilities and to connect with her about them.


Even if you don't understand her hobby, make sure that you express an interest. Ask he to play a song for you on her clarinet, or show up to her soccer games. She will really appreciate you being there for her.
You may also teach her your own hobbies (if she's interested) as she will benefit from learning something new. For example, fishing, fixing things around the house, driving, etc.

, Remember that you are the first man in your daughter’s life. Be a gentleman, as you are also demonstrating to your daughter how a man should treat her.


This could have a huge impact on the type of partner she chooses in later life. Never be violent with your daughter and avoid raising your voice.
On the other hand, do not become too overprotective of your daughter, as you might only be pushing her away.
Do not forget to tell your daughter you love her.

Tell your teen that you are willing to listen.,
Listen actively.,
Reserve judgment.,
Accept some silence.",How to Communicate Effectively With a Teen1," Your teen may be unsure about whether or not they can turn to you when there is a problem or when they just need to talk to someone. You can make it clear to your teen that you are willing to listen by simply saying something like, “I am here if you ever want to talk.”Keep in mind that you may need to remind your teen now and then. For example, if you teen seems like they are struggling with something, you might give a gentle reminder like, “You can always talk to me about it if you want to.”;
, Being available to listen also means listening actively. Active listening shows the speaker that you are present and hearing what they are saying. Some things you can do to be an active listener include:Removing distractions.
Facing your teen and making direct eye contact.
Nodding your head and making neutral statements, such as “Yes,” “I see,” and “Go on.”
Rephrasing what your teen says now and then to show you are listening.
Asking for clarification if you need it. For example, if your teen tells you about something that happened between her and her friend Sarah, and she has more than one friend named Sarah, then you might ask, ""Sarah B. or Sarah H.?""

, Judging your teen for what he or she says may cause them to shut down and decide not to open up to you in the future. Therefore, it is best to stop yourself from voicing any judgments about what your teen shares with you.For example, if your teen confides in you that she is thinking about asking someone she likes to the prom, you should not use this as an opportunity to say that you think she could do better. Your teen is not going to change her mind about someone just because you do not approve.
It is especially important to reserve judgment if your teen shares something troubling with you, such as that she has committed a crime, that she is feeling suicidal or that she is being bullied at school. If your teen shares something like this with you, then it is normal to be upset and worried. However, telling your teen what she should do or feel is not going to help.

, Sometimes your teen will not feel like talking to you right away, or at all. Teens often need to try to work things out on their own or calm down before they can share what is going on. This can be frustrating for you, but pushing too hard to try to get your teen to talk can make matters worse. If you push too hard, then your teen may feel like you are invading her privacy and decide not to talk at all. To reduce your chances of getting the silent treatment, you may need to learn how to say less and be patient if your teen does not respond right away.


For example, instead of asking your teen lots of questions right when they walk in the door, try saying something like, “Hi honey. I hope you had a nice day. If you feel like telling me about it, just let me know. I’d love to hear all about it.” Then just go about your business and allow your teen to talk if he or she wants to talk."
"
Keep comments brief.,
Create a team narrative.,
Use technology to engage your teen.,
Respect your teen’s privacy.",How to Communicate Effectively With a Teen2," Talking for a long time can seem like a lecture to your teen, so try not to make lengthy comments or offer extensive advice to your teen. Instead, try to keep your comments short and to the point.For example, if your teen wants to know why they can’t have a later curfew, you might say something like, “I know that you enjoy spending time with your friends, but 10pm is the curfew that we agreed on because you have obligations in the morning, and because I worry about you driving late at night. We can discuss a later curfew in a few months, but right now I think we should stick with the curfew that we agreed on.”

, Finding ways to help your teen see themselves as part of a team may also help to improve communication. You can create a team narrative by telling stories about an injustice or major obstacle that someone in your family overcame, such as coming back from a job loss or standing up to someone.You can also use projects to get your teen to engage with the family. For example, you can involve your teen in redecorating the family room, putting together a scrapbook, or planning a family vacation.

, While it is not a good idea to follow your teen’s every move on social media, you may be able to use social media to connect with your teen now and then. For example, you might share a news story that you know would be interesting to your teen on your teen’s Facebook wall, or respond to an Instagram photo that your teen posted. Find out what social media outlets your teen uses most often and look for occasional opportunities to engage with your teen through these outlets.Don’t involve yourself in online conversations that your teen is having with her friends.
Don’t use social media as a way to spy on your teen.

, Teens are in transition from childhood to adulthood and they require more privacy than they once did. When you talk with your teen, avoid prying into your teen’s personal life, especially if your teen seems reluctant to share something.


For example, if your teen goes on a date, don’t request a play-by-play description of the evening. You might simply say something like, “They seemed like a nice person. I hope you had a fun evening.”

"
"
Try to be a calming presence.,
Make more positive than negative statements.,
Learn all sides of the story.,
Ask questions to work towards solutions.,
Encourage problem solving.,
Seek counseling if communication has broken down.",How to Communicate Effectively With a Teen3," If your teen is upset, then mirroring his or her distress is likely to make things worse. Instead of acting as upset as your teen, try to help your teen stay calm by being a calming presence. Try to put some distance between yourself and your teen’s problems. Avoid internalizing your teen’s problems to the point that you are reacting the same way that your teen is reacting.If you are upset with your teen or if you are distressed about something they are going through, then take some time to calm yourself before you sit down and talk. Otherwise, you may find yourself overreacting to the things that your teen shares and this could make matters worse.
Try going for a quick walk, doing some deep breathing, or meditating for five minutes before you talk with your teen.

, Criticizing your teen can result in a breakdown in communication, so make sure that you make more positive than negative statements when you have to correct your teen on something. For example, if your teen is getting a bad grade, then you might point to all of her good grades first or mention her accomplishments in extracurricular activities before bringing up the bad grade.For example, you might frame the discussion by saying something like, “Your report card is pretty impressive! You got an “A” in English and History, a “B+” in Math, and a “B+ in Biology. It seems like the only class that you are not excelling in right now is Physical Education, so we should probably try to work out a plan to get that grade up. What do you think?”

, Jumping to conclusions before your teen has a chance to share his or her side may also lead to a breakdown in communication. Before you respond to a situation, make sure that you ask your teen if there is any other information you should know about.For example, if your teen has gotten into trouble at school, you might start by saying something like, “You math teacher called me this morning and said that you were disrespectful to her in class today. I don’t think she was trying to get you into trouble. I think that she is just concerned about you. I am concerned as well. Before we talk about this, is there anything else that I should know about the situation?”

, Some questions can lead to a hostile environment between you and your teen, so it is best to avoid these types of questions. Asking “trap” questions can cause your teen to be deceptive in response. A trap question is one that you already know the answer to, but you might still ask just to see if your teen will lie or tell the truth.


For example, if you know that your teen lied to you about where she stayed the night because you called and she was not there, a trap question would be asking her something like, “Did you have a fun time staying over at Julie’s house last night?”You know that she didn't stay there and she knows that she did not stay there, so the question is testing her honesty. However, she knows that she will probably be in trouble either way.
Instead of asking trap questions, be direct with your teen. For example, if you know that your teen lied about where she was, address her in a calm, even tone with something like, “I talked to Julie’s mom last night and I know that you did not sleep over. I am not sure why you lied, but I think we should discuss this. However, we don’t have to talk about it right away if you are not feeling up to it. Do you want to talk now or discuss it after dinner tonight?” Responding in this way shows your teen that you know she lied about something and that you are disappointed, but that you want to discuss it in a reasonable way when you are both feeling calm.

, Since good problem solving skills will help your teen as an adult, you may want to use difficult conversations to teach your teen how to solve problems. To teach problem solving skills to your teen, you will need to talk them through their options when they have a difficult problem or decision to make.Allow your teen to talk through all of the options.
Make a pros and cons list together.
Ask questions to help your teen look at all sides of the problem.
Let your teen make the final decision.
Use the outcome as a learning opportunity.

, If you have not been able to have conversation with your teen despite efforts to improve communication between the two of you, then seeking counseling might be the next step. By going through counseling with your teen, you can both learn strategies to improve your communication and work towards a better relationship.You may also consider individual counseling for yourself and your teen. Individual counseling may be necessary to help you and your teen deal with issues that are outside of your relationship.

Recognize that hormones have a significant impact upon mood.,
Remember that your teenager’s brain is still developing.,
Remind yourself that your child isn’t enjoying being moody.,
Look back on your own adolescence.",How to Cope With a Moody Teenager1," Your child’s moody behavior has physiological foundations. Puberty hormones flush often-overwhelming levels of chemical input through your child’s developing brain.


Note that hormones present in adults can operate differently in teenager. Adult brains experience the hormone THP, for example, as a calming influence; in your teenager, THP produces heightened anxiety.;
, Humans’ frontal lobe -- the part of the brain responsible for impulse control, judgment, and decision-making -- doesn’t fully mature until we are in our early 20s. Your child’s brain is quite literally still under construction, even as the rest of his or her body may begin to appear “adult.” , Your child is struggling to cope with the confluence of hormonal change, body changes, developing identity, pressure from friends, and a developing sense of independence. No wonder he or she is acting out! They may be frustrated, confused, or even scared by the changes taking place in their lives. Your child needs you to provide stability and support -- even if he or she is telling you something quite different., Perhaps the best way to understand your teenager is to remember what it was like to be one yourself. Think about your own triumphs and struggles, and consider how your parents experienced them. "
"
Let the teenager vent.,
Make sure they are not in a position to hurt themselves.,
Get them to a calm, quiet setting.,
Validate their feelings.,
Speak to the teen in a calm, measured voice.,
Reassure a frightened or confused teen.,
Don't argue with delusions or hallucinations.,
Never hurt your teen.,
Do not touch your child without their consent.,
Recognize that they may not truly mean the things they say in the heat of the moment.,
Do not take their behavior personally.,
Give them time.,
Be accepting and reassuring after the event.",How to Calm Down Your Mentally Ill Teen," Even if you think they have no right to think or say what they are ranting about, let them rant. It won't make any difference to you in the long run, and the teen will feel better once they have been able to express their feelings about the subject. Listen and let them feel heard.


This works when you've said ""no"" to your teen. You have the right to say no to them, and they have the right to express unhappiness about it. Accept their feelings without changing your answer.;
, If they are in danger, talk to them and see if they will let you move them out of the way. Even if they are jumpy and excited don't let that affect how you act with them. Remain calm and gentle, and try to avoid startling them. If necessary, you can be very assertive and firm about moving them if they are in imminent danger of extreme injury or death.


If they begin self-injuring (e.g. headbanging), see if you can soften or redirect it. For example, place a pillow under their head, or have them hit their head against soft couch cushions instead of a wall.

, Nobody likes to break down in public in front of spectators. Move them somewhere quieter, or ask other people to go elsewhere. Turn off music and reduce noise in the area.


If they have a comfort object, give it to them.

, This technique can help relax them and de-escalate the situation. Help them feel that their emotions are understandable and important. (You don't have to agree with them to do this.) Examples of validation include...


""That sounds really difficult.""
""I'm so sorry to hear that. Is there any way I can help make it better?""
""You look really upset right now. It must be stressful to go through this.""
""Of course you're angry. You've had to put up with a lot today.""

, Agitation is contagious, so try to keep a level head. Often the teen is responding to stimuli you don't understand or process the same way. So remain calm and in control regardless of the teenager's response. Convey acceptance, comfort, and calm.

, Tell them that they are safe and you're here for them. This can lessen feelings of panic and make it clear to them that you're unconditionally there for them.

, Your teen may say things that you disagree with, or delusions that are obviously false. While it may seem nonsensical to you, to your teen these things are very real. Avoid escalating the situation by telling them they are wrong. (You won't change their mind.)


Keep validating their feelings, no matter how nonsensical they sound. ""It must be stressful to feel that the CIA is moving all your things around.""Challenging their view of reality may strengthen their delusions. If you voice disagreement, phrase it as your opinion, not as an absolute fact.""I don't see any dogs in the room.""

, Never hit or lose control physically. You are the adult and have a responsibility to stay in control while your teen is out of control. Never become violent; all that does is escalate the situation and worsen your teen's mental state.


If you have explosive urges, then leave. Say ""I need to calm down,"" leave the room, and ask another adult to handle your teen.

, Your teen may be in full panic mode, so if you try to touch them, they may misinterpret it as an attack and lash out. Give them as much space as they need. You can offer a hug if you want, but don't intrude upon their personal space.


If you want to offer a hug, hold out your arms and let them come to you. This way, they can anticipate it and evaluate whether they're ready for it. If they don't come, you can hug them later.
A tight hug provides deep pressure, which can be calming (especially for autistic teens).

, Sometimes the teen will threaten not to take medication, or run away, or hurt themselves. These are all ways they are trying to process their emotions. It's not healthy and you can talk about it when they are calm. But at the time they are only words; the majority of teens will not follow up with actions. Once they've calmed down they will often say they are sorry and that they did not mean any of it.


Nevertheless, ask them about it once they are calm. This way you can be sure, and they have the opportunity to open up to you (if running away or hurting themselves really has been on their mind). Keep validating their feelings and listening to them.

, Even if it feels as though you are being criticized or berated, do not take it personally. Remember that mental illness is a chemical imbalance, and that it is not the fault of the teen or yourself. This illness is part genetic and perhaps part environmental. Don't blame yourself any more than you'd blame yourself for a broken bone.


Sometimes mental illnesses cause affective flattening, or not showing many feelings. This is an illness symptom, and it's not personal. They still love you.

, Sometimes all a teen needs is time to process and then they will be okay. So check on your teen frequently, about every half hour, but leave them alone otherwise. They will process their anger, maybe yell and scream a bit, but a little while later they will be able to talk and not actively melt down.

, If your teen apologizes, accept their apology. If they don't remember what happened, give a brief, nonjudgmental explanation. Make it clear that you still love them and don't blame them for the outburst. The mental illness caused it, not them.


If you feel that you mishandled the situation, apologize to them.
Talk about why they became so upset. Did something in particular trigger it? How might the two of you work together to avoid a similar happening?
Ask how they would like you to respond in such a situation. Try coming up with a plan together.

Remain calm and consistent.,
Set clear boundaries for behavior and communication.,
Focus on your child’s behavior, not his or her personality or character.",How to Cope With a Moody Teenager2," Hormones can render teens emotional instead of logical. They may even feel unsettled by the intensity of the emotions they experience. Your child needs you to be a calm, consistent presence in his or her life., Involve your child in developing these rules. Doing so both respects her developing independence and gives you the opportunity to remind her later that she helped develop these rules and must now live by them. She may grumble, but knowing their boundaries helps teens feel safe.Set, and use, consequences for poor behavior, but make your list of rules and consequences as short as possible. Prioritize your chief concerns.
Pick your battles. If your teenager is basically behaving, ignore minor annoyances such as shrugs, raised eyebrows, or bored looks.
Sometimes, teens may be inadvertently disrespectful. (Again, their brains are developing.) Calmly ask about their intention -- for example, “That comment came out sounding pretty offensive. Did you mean to behave rudely?”, Make your disapproval of poor behavior known, but focus on what your teenager is doing, not who he is. Your child isn’t dumb, even if his decision to slam a door in frustration and trap his sister’s fingers was less than brilliant. Continue to affirm his worth as a person even as you explain why his behavior was unacceptable."
"
Spend time with your teenager.,
Stay involved in your teen’s everyday life.Sometimes this will be easier than others, but put forth the effort to ask questions about activities and events.,
Offer your child some time alone.,
Affirm your child.,
Seek a mentor for your child.,
Show your love.",How to Cope With a Moody Teenager3," Make yourself available to talk when your child expresses interest in doing so. Offer to give your teen a ride and then use the time in the car to chat; sometimes sitting side-by-side can offer a more comfortable venue for conversation., Follow your child’s sports team or attend his performances.


Consider learning more about one of your child’s interests to provide some common ground. If your daughter is a die-hard soccer fan, start following her favorite league yourself. While you should continue to allow your child space to develop her interests without feeling smothered, one area of common ground can make everyday conversation much easier.
Encourage your child to participate in stress-relieving activities such as sports, or relaxing with a funny movie., Teenagers need time to themselves to process the many changes they’re going through.


Encourage your child to write in a private journal.
Step back and allow your child the space to figure out some things on his own. You’ll demonstrate you believe he is capable of making appropriate choices and that you trust his judgment., Teenagers benefit from positive reinforcement -- and lots of it -- as they grapple with forming their own, independent identity. Tell them when you are proud of them. Praise positive behavior. Even in the midst of a more heated discussion, using positive terminology can be really helpful (“I know your teacher’s really impressed with your performance in chemistry. Let’s figure out how we can agree upon a schedule that allows you to continue acing those exams and enjoy some time with your friends, too.”)Use descriptive praise. Be specific: “I really loved the way you helped your little brother with his jump shot. I could see his pride when he made that basket -- you did a great job of helping him feel like he could improve his technique.”
Let your child know that you’re aware of, and value, her opinions., This tactic can be especially important in situations where your relationship with your teenager has become quite difficult. Another trusted adult such as an aunt, uncle, or family friend can help support your child through this difficult period in your lives.


Even in situations where your relationship is reasonably strong, a mentor can provide your child with important extra support. , Your teenager may be acting unlovable. Your teen may even be feeling that he or she is unlovable. Your job as a parent is to love them no matter what. Leave a note, give a hug, or speak words of love to your child every day."
"
Remember that you are a role model.,
Attend to your basic needs.,
Take breaks.,
Seek support.,
Remain aware of your own mental health.",How to Cope With a Moody Teenager4," If your child sees you treating others poorly or engaging in destructive behaviors such as heavy drinking, smoking, or drug use, you’ll have little recourse to criticize his own poor behavior., You’ll be better equipped to handle the stress of raising a teenager when you are well rested, eating healthy, and allowing yourself time for regular exercise.

, Ensure you build adequate time into your daily routine to relax and take a break from your children.Wake early, take a brief walk, or let your kids know that you’re taking a few minutes to read a chapter in your book and will check back in with them once you’ve finished. You’ll keep yourself balanced, even as you model good self-care for your children.

, Talk to friends or your partner about child rearing. The old adage that “it takes a village to raise a child” really does carry truth; others will offer valuable insight, advice, or simply a listening ear for you to vent concerns and frustrations.


Consider finding a support group or other source of external help if you’re really struggling. Consult your child’s school counselor or your family physician for information on how to find extra support., Serious stress can produce symptoms of depression or anxiety. If you’re concerned you may be suffering such ailments, please contact your doctor."

Learn to differentiate moody behavior from dangerous anger.,
Recognize when your child is suffering from depression.,
Take action when you have serious concerns.",How to Cope With a Moody Teenager5," Most moody teens are simply struggling with the many changes they are experiencing in their lives. Occasionally, however, teens experience more serious anger. If you recognize any of these signs of dangerous anger, immediately contact a mental health professional:


Cries for help -- statements that your child intends to do some sort of harm.
Extreme identification with one group or affiliation. If your teen expresses a desire to “go to war” with other groups, he’s crossed the border into dangerous thinking.
Complete lack of communication. It’s normal to struggle to communicate well with your teenage child, but the situation has become dangerous if your child stops talking to you or her peers altogether. This is a sign of serious alienation.
Violence. Pay attention to behaviors such as hitting or vandalism, as these behaviors can escalate.
Dropping out, not only from school but from activities your child formerly enjoyed. It’s one thing for your child to reach high school and decide he’s tired of playing soccer, but a teenager who stops identifying with others altogether may become capable of doing them harm.
Substance abuse, especially combined with any of the above behaviors. Remember that substance abuse can include misuse of common household items such as “sniffing” glue or stealing prescription drugs from your medicine cabinet., Watch for the following signs that your child needs treatment for depression:


A depressed mood or feelings of sadness most of the time.
Near-total lack of energy.
Lack of interest or motivation.
An inability to enjoy activities that he used to enjoy.
Withdrawal from family or friends.
Feelings of anger, irritability, or anxiety.
An inability to concentrate.
Significant changes in weight (loss or gain).
Significant changes in sleep patterns, from insomnia to sleeping all the time.
Feelings of guilt or lack of worth.
Thoughts of death or suicide.
Failing grades at school., The form of action you take will depend upon the gravity of your concerns.


If you’re concerned your child is engaging in destructive behavior short of dangerous anger or depression, approach her with information rather than a challenge. Provide literature and Web links. Doing so demonstrates respect and regard for his ability to make better decisions in the future.If you are concerned your child may be a danger to herself or others, seek help immediately. Contact your doctor, a mental health professional, or your child’s school counselor.

Don't fetch them drinks.,
Still cook them meals, but get them to carry the meal to the table they are eating at, and get their own forks and knives and spoons and drinks (see above if they need a little help).

,
Get them to make their own breakfast.,
If they need a snack, make it clear to them what they can have.

",How to Care for a Preteen Without Being Intrusive1," Let them do it themselves, but make sure there is always a selection of drinks, cups, mugs and glasses in easy reach of them so they can easily get drinks. Most children should be able to get drinks by themselves, but for children who need help:


Ask which drink they want.
Tell them to fetch it.
Ask them to fetch something to drink from.
Pour a little into the receptacle.
Tell them to pour some more if they want any more.
Tell them to put away the drink.
Give them the drink.;
,, A child of 10 or 11 will be able to pour some cereal, or toast some bread (if they eat porridge for breakfast, consider still making it, as you may not be happy letting them cook on a hob).

"
Show empathy to your teenager.,
Listen with an open mind.,
Offer an alternative solution.,
Avoid name-calling or swearing.,
Apologize if necessary.,
Acknowledge adolescence isn’t easy.,
Encourage them to express their feelings.,
Remember your teenager still loves you and wants your approval.",How to Calm a Teenager1," Listen to them and try to understand where they are coming from. Put yourself in their shoes. Use active listening techniques to help further your understanding and help your teenager better communicate their feelings.Reflect your teenager’s feelings. Echo back to them what you hear them saying and feeling. For example, if your teen is complaining about the amount of homework they have, you could say, “You sound really stressed out and overwhelmed by your responsibilities.” If that is not how they feel, they will usually correct you with their true feeling: “No, I just feel like I never have enough free time.” Either way, it helps build further understanding for you both.Ask open-ended questions. Generate more conversation with your teenager by asking questions that don’t require a yes or no answer. You could ask questions like, “How do you think you could solve that problem?” or “How did that make you feel?”;
, You probably want your teenager to talk more about their lives with you. If that’s the case, you need to listen to them with an open mind. Foster open communication by allowing space for their perspective, ideas, and feelings.Keep your cool even if they are telling you about something you disapprove of. For example, if your teenager reveals to you they got a body piercing, don’t say something like, “How on earth could you do something like that?” or “That was a stupid decision!” You’ll probably shut your child down and make them less likely to communicate with you in the future.
Instead, you could say, “If you want to do something like that again in the future, please come talk to me first.”

, If your teenager is telling you about a poor decision they made, help them understand why it was wrong. Help them think of what they could do if faced with a similar situation again.


You could make some suggestions. For example, “If you feel that angry again, you could try excusing yourself for a few minutes and calming down, instead of hitting your sister.”
Ask your teenager to come up with a few ideas as to how they could deal with this problem next time. Have them think of two or three ways to handle it, and have them share their solutions with you., Role model the behavior you want to see your teen adopt. You may be angry at your teenager, do your best to remain calm and keep your behavior in check. Even if their language is inappropriate, do not respond in kind. Be the bigger person.


Do not allow them to be verbally abusive to you. Tell them you will talk to them again when they have calmed down. You could say, “I know you are angry at me right now. You are allowed to express your anger, but I will not allow you to swear at me and call me names. We’ll continue this conversation once I know I will not be attacked.”

, Your teenager may feel like they can trust you more if they know you will admit when you are wrong. Teens know that adults make mistakes, and they hate it when the adult won't acknowledge this.It does not make you lose authority if you apologize to your teenager. Rather, it can help foster a more respectful relationship. If your teenager understands that you will actually treat them respectfully and as an “equal,” they will be more likely to give you respect.
Apologizing also serves as a role modeling behavior and models accountability for your teenager.You could say, “I’m sorry that I lost my temper with you yesterday over you not mowing the lawn. I was disappointed that you broke your promise to me, but I shouldn’t have overreacted like that. I hope you can accept my apology.”

, Think about your own adolescence and remember that it probably wasn’t easy for you. Realize that it is the same for your teenager. Teens have many stresses. Your kid is maturing into an adult and is dealing with pressures from school, homework, friends, popularity, dating, after-school activities, individuality, and hormones. It's a heavy load for him or her to carry.Even though you may think their complaints are silly, especially in comparison to adult concerns, they are very real for your child. Remember that your teenager may be encountering these situations for the first time, and needs non-judgmental help to navigate them successfully.
If your teen seems receptive, you could talk about some of your own, similar experiences as a teenager. It may help your teenager understand that they are not alone in their feelings.
For example, if your daughter is distraught after the breakup of a relationship that lasted less than a month, resist the urge to dismiss her sadness with, “Well, you weren’t together very long, so get over it.” Instead, you could tell her, “I remember how hard it was the first time I got dumped, too. I cried for days. Breakups are always hard, but when you’re younger and don’t have much experience with them, they’re horrible. I’m sorry you’re dealing with this.”

, Talk to them about the benefit of expressing their emotions instead of keeping them in. Otherwise, they may feel resentful. They may also have more emotional outbursts or aggressive, acting-out behavior.


Let them know they can always come to you with a concern, but if they are not comfortable talking to you, encourage them to talk to a trustworthy friend or another valued adult in their lives.You could say, “I would hope that you always feel comfortable coming to me with any important problems, but I know you may not always want to. I know you are close with your soccer coach. If there’s ever anything you don’t want me to know, but perhaps need an adult’s help, I hope you can talk to her or someone else like her.”
Encourage your teen to take up a hobby that allows them to express themselves creatively, such as music, art, or creative writing.

, While it may not seem that way, your teenager does want you to be involved in their life, and they do want you to support them. Keep in mind that they will likely never show gratitude, and in many cases, may complain about your presence, but know that being there for them will make a positive impact.


Understand that teenagers are naturally emotional, and try not to take their outbursts personally.
Try to attend your child’s athletic events or music performances at school. While they may not acknowledge it, it will matter to them that you showed up.
Commend your teenager for their grades, part-time job, kindness, or whatever trait they have that makes you proud of them.

At 10 or 11 a child will want a little privacy, so if going into their bedroom, knock first, and give several seconds to answer.,
If you are going to vacuum or scrub their bedroom, ask them to tidy everything first, one so that it is easier for you and two, it will stop you from seeing anything they don't want you to see.

At 10 or 11, spanking should not be necessary, and in some areas is illegal.,
Grounding, or taking away things like toys, electronics or favourite books is often a good enough punishment.

",How to Care for a Preteen Without Being Intrusive3," At 10 or 11, they should, but good rules are:


No fighting
No swearing
Don't be rude
Don't answer back

,, If you are still going to spank, follow these guidelines:


Don't do it in anger, wait for the next day.
Don't do it bare. Their 'front - bottoms' will have started developing, and it will be embarrassing, humiliating and cruel. To some people this may seem the point of a spanking, but a spanking is to stop a child from doing something. See How to Give a Spanking for more information.
Don't do it to hard.
Don't use an implement. It is abusive and indeed illegal in some places.

When a child of 11 starts Secondary/High school, they will see and hear lots of things about sex, and may want to have a relationship with someone.,
Make sure a child is not being bullied into kissing/relationships/sex, by regularly talking to teachers, and to your child.

",How to Care for a Preteen Without Being Intrusive4," Explain to them about sex, the dangers and everything they will need to know while they are at school, so that they do not get fed wrong information at school.

Decide what values you want to enforce.,
Let them take some responsibility.,
Take a break.,
Give them space.,
Have reasonable expectations.",How to Calm a Teenager2," Your family, like most families, may have behaviors and actions you value. As your teen begins to push back against these values and your expectations, you may wish to decide which values you want to enforce above all others, and perhaps relax on your enforcement of other behaviors.Write down a list of what you value most in your family. It could be actions like being generous, showing kindness, living your faith, or being of service to others. Decide which of these values you will demand your teen to uphold, and decide that you will be more flexible about others.
For example, you may decide to make “showing kindness” an enforced value, but perhaps could be more flexible on “living your faith,” letting your teen skip religious services now and again.
Tell your teen what you expect of them. You could say, “In our house, we value family above everything else. I’m not going to let you off the hook for Sunday dinners with Grandma. I will negotiate with you on other expectations, but not on family activities.”

, Give your teenager a certain amount of freedom to make their own decisions. They are rapidly approaching adulthood when they will need to hold themselves accountable, so give them the opportunity now to learn some skills under your watchful eye.


Consider giving your teenager more financial responsibility. They may have a part-time job, or perhaps you give them an allotted amount of spending money per week. Teens enjoy being able to manage their own savings, and this is a great time for them to learn about managing money. Don't interfere if you think they are making a stupid purchase -- this is all part of learning about money.Let your teenager wear what they want, within reason and their school’s dress code. Back off if they want to dye their hair or shave their head. It’s part of them expressing themselves.

, If your teenager is irate, any attempts to restrict or discipline them will only be counterproductive. Give him or her some time to cool off. If the situation calls for punishment, it can be dealt later.Calmly approach them and continue the discussion after a while, later in the day, after both of you have had time to calm down. You could say, “Now that we’ve both had a chance to cool off, I want to talk to you about what you did.”

, Adolescence is about becoming independent from your parents and determining your identity as an individual. Make sure you are giving them the space they need to grow and figure themselves out, and alone time as necessary. While maintaining a solid connection is important, be sure not to smother them.


Be conscious of the importance of your teenager’s social life right now. Allow them time with their friends. Be aware of who they are hanging out with and where, but give them more freedom if you believe they are trustworthy., Don’t expect your teenager to behave like an adult all of the time. Even though they may look more grown up, they still have a growing brain. Understand they will make mistakes and will sometimes act like a much younger child. If your teenager is working hard, doing their best, and is a kind person, they are doing just fine.Don't compare the teen to others. They are likely already doing this all the time to themselves, they don’t need someone else chiming in! Don’t say things like, “I wish you were more like Mary. She gets such good grades!” Instead, you could say something like, “I’d like to see you put more effort in on your math homework.”

Recognize that your teenager’s brain is still developing.,
Take your teenager to the doctor.,
Make sure your teenager is not using drugs or alcohol.,
Consider counseling.,
Teach your teenager emotional coping strategies.",How to Calm a Teenager3," Emotional outbursts are normal, due in part to the growing and developing brain. While an adolescent’s brain is intellectually on par with an adult’s, they lack the same emotional and impulse regulation management system that an adult brain has. This system is still maturing.Give your teenager some patience, as you understand that their brain, just like their brain as a baby and toddler, is still learning to regulate behavior.
The brain doesn’t finish developing until the early twenties., If you are finding your teenager’s emotional outbursts to be difficult to manage, or they seem abnormal to you, consider making an appointment with their doctor to make sure that everything is okay. Your doctor may suggest getting them evaluated for any mental health concerns. You may wish to get them evaluated if you have noticed:


A decrease in school performance.
Problems with attention, concentration, or memory.
Big changes in appetite, sleeping, or energy levels.
Frequent aggressive behavior or lashing out.
Crying, anxiety, or feelings of hopelessness.
Poor hygiene.
Physical symptoms, such as stomach aches or headaches., If you suspect your teenager is abusing alcohol or drugs, confront them with your suspicions. Even recreational drug or alcohol use can cause serious repercussions for a teen, from legal consequences to lasting effects on the brain.Make note of your child’s suspicious behavior; for example, times they came home smelling like smoke or alcohol, or staying out well past curfew. If you have prescriptions that have potential to be abused, count how many pills you have. Keep track of anything unusual and use this evidence to confront your child.
Bring your teen to the doctor and ask the doctor to do a drug screen. Your doctor can ask your child several questions about drug habits, assess their level of risk, and do a urine or blood screen., You may wish to have your teenager start seeing a counselor to help them understand their behavior, explore their feelings, and develop strategies for handling triggering situations. You could ask your doctor or your local health department for counselor recommendations.


Consider family therapy if you see the issues with your teenager to be problems that stem from family dynamic issues. You and your teenager, along with the rest of your family, may learn better ways to communicate with each other, as well as hash out any family concerns with a professional present., People of every age can benefit from learning calming techniques and learning better ways to take care of themselves when stressed. Consider discussing some strategies with your teen:


Teach some calming techniques to your teen, like meditation or yoga, or show them some favorite calming strategies of your own.
Talk to them about self-care. Self-care are activities that improve your physical, mental, or spiritual health. These activities are different for different people, but often include activities like exercise, taking time to yourself, or spending time in nature. Help your teenager find nourishing activities that help them feel better."

Take your teen daughter places.",How to Be a Good Parent for Your Teenage Daughter," Sometimes it is neglect that can make you distant from your daughter. Hug her (not too much, maybe for 5 seconds) and comfort her. Tell her she is beautiful. Heal small hurts at random times every day. If either of you are sad or stressed comfort each other once again.;
, Teenage girls always have the desire to have relationships with boys, whether it's just friendship or crushing. If your daughter is comfortable with you, she will tell you once she's make a new guy-friend or likes a particular boy.



Get to know her, know her weaknesses and strengths and what makes her happy.
Be interested in what she tells you. Do not look worried or angry. Ask her about the boy, or even ask to meet him. Then decide whether she should hang out with him or not.

, Don't be nosy though, that can really bug your teenage daughter. Also, if she seems like she doesn't want to answer your questions, stop asking and wait for another time, teens can get moody, just like the rest of us. Some examples of questions to ask are:


What is your favorite book?
What is your favorite movie?
What is your favorite color?
What is your favorite song/album/singer/band?
What do you like to do in your spare time?
Where's your favorite place to shop?
What is your favorite animal?
What is your favorite or least favorite food?
Or you can just make up your own questions.

, Get to know the top models, the gossip, the fashion, the makeup, the top singers and actresses. Just don't copy your teen, after all she is trying to find herself!

, That's the most important thing a parent should do.

, If she has a boyfriend, be supportive. Once you've met the boyfriend and gotten to know him, and feel like he's the right sort, you can let her go on dates with him. If you did not feel like the boy is trustworthy, tell your daughter the reasons why without exploding or banning the relationship.

, Give her her own space to grow but also kindly clarify the boundaries. Know that she may sometimes test these boundaries and that is when you need to remind her that she is aware of the boundaries and that they need to restored.


If you disagree with your daughter's choice of clothing, tell her face to face. Be reasonable. Talk to her about the problems with how clothing can be suggestive and the things that certain people may assume of some types of clothing.

, In other words, never be the type of parent whom your daughter would be scared of.

, Even though she may pretend she doesn't like it when you clean her room, she really does. Some random acts you could do are:


Cleaning her room/bathroom
Cooking her an unforgettably tasty meal
Buying her some make up you think she would like
Buying her some clothes/jewelry she would enjoy

, Let your daughter know you trust her. And actually do trust her. Once she sees that you find her trustworthy, she will feel more likely to trust you.

, In this way, you will be respected too.


Make each of her birthdays extra special, by taking trips, or by having amazing parties.

, Take her somewhere she would like, for example to the mall or a music concert. *Take your daughter to places she has never heard of before and see if she finds new hobbies and good new experiences.


Take her shopping at her favorite stores.

Give your teenager a high five.,
Have fun together.,
Talk in the car.,
Be present.,
Sharpen your “asking” skills.,
Write your teen a letter or email.,
Offer time and acceptance.",How to Bond with Your Teenage Son," This basically means to offer your son some kind of physical touch. Every day do something in the form of a high five, fist bump, a squeeze of the hand, hug, pat on the back, or a kiss goodbye when he goes to school or work.;
, This is an easy one. Joke around, shoot some hoops, go to the mall, read, listen to music, and play Xbox. Be creative and enjoy!

, You might have more success doing something while talking with your teen. For example, driving––while driving him to school or practice, ask questions and listen carefully. See how it works out. Keep in mind, asking open ended questions is better!


Cars are a great time for talking because nobody is going anywhere. It's an opportunity for the two of you to be more confidential too, as the enclosed nature of the car feels more intimate and safe. Of course, this is only when it's the two of you. As soon as someone else is in the car, all bets are off!

, This can be hard for you and your son. Try to have moments with no phone distractions or multi-tasking. Try to be fully in the moment, carefree, and available. When your son is telling you something or asking you a question, put down whatever you're doing or stop watching that show, and really focus on your son.


If you don't have time immediately to discuss something, make a time for later. Don't leave it too long, just a half hour or an hour later would be good. You'll know if it's really urgent and needs to be discussed ""right now"".

, One of the reasons teens don’t want to talk to parents is because of those annoying parental questions about homework, college applications, grades, teachers, cleaning the room, etc. These become repetitive and dull topics when constantly asked about. It’s a better idea to create a “pressure free zone”, meaning to leave those questions for another moment. A “pressure free zone” can help you uncover your teen’s deepest experiences and feelings that they haven’t told you.

, Some people do better talking about feelings when they write them down first. For example: ""Hey Jake, I'm realizing we’re both very busy and get caught up in our busy schedules. I feel like I'm missing out on being with you. I would love to find a way to get together and just hang out, relax, watch TV or catch a baseball game, or whatever you felt like doing to unwind and have fun. I would definitely enjoy it. No pressure; just wanted to let you know."" Love you.

, These are two things a lot of young people want and need most from their parents. In return, parents receive the gift of knowing and enjoying their teens more. The bond between parent and son will be stronger.

, Although it's natural to want to constantly dispense advice, encouragement, commentary, and question her, you're more likely to get insights into her by really paying attention to what she is saying (or not saying) and how she says it. She'll also be more likely to listen to you if she feels she's being heard. If she isn't ready to listen to advice and just wants you to be there for her, don't say anything. She will eventually be ready to listen to you, and that is the right time to talk to her.

, She can take the letter to her own space and read it in her own time. Give her a day or two to digest it and to come up with her response.
When you're talking (or writing), address her directly. Don't bring in information about other people or unrelated issues. Listen to what she has to say and create an open environment without judging her.
Don't create comparisons, such as with a sibling. This will make her feel as if she is a lesser person than someone else. That's not fair.
Admit when you're wrong, even if she wasn't right either. A teenager can deal with a parent admitting he or she is imperfect. This gives her the space to reflect on her own contributions and lets her know that you are serious in working things through. Also, it shows her respect.

, Sometimes, Mom or Dad cannot or is not the ideal person for your girl to go to for advice. That does not mean she disrespects your or thinks you don't know anything. Respect your daughter's choice of adviser (as long as that person is capable, safe, and otherwise reasonable).

, She will increasingly be seeing her friends as important figures in her life. This doesn't mean you are not important. It means she is developing an adult social life.


Don't allow her social life to get in the way of her studies. While you shouldn't keep her home from every party, make sure she is doing well in school.

However, avoid telling her she needs to get a certain grade in order to go to a party. This will make her feel stressed and negative because her social life is at risk. As long as she does her best, you should be proud of her and help her in areas that she may not be doing as well in.
Use rewards to help her increase her grades instead. For example: If she gets a B on her next test, you'll take her out to ice cream or her favorite restaurant. Don't make your expectations too high, but don't let her be lazy.



, Be a decent person who is always there for your daughter, ready to listen and advise when needed. If your intent is to treat others with respect and dignity, she will pick this up and emulate it.

, Like it or not, adolescents have a hard time interacting with parents at times. Sometimes they want to pretend they don't have parents. But you can still show your love. Use the power of a mere caring glimpse, a short small smile. It can break down the difficulties between you and let her know that you are receptive to a discussion, or just there for a bear hug should she need it.

, Her feelings are as real as yours. Don't belittle her feelings if she appears to feel something deeply, like a break-up, a letdown at school or other events in her life. Give her examples of what you went through as a teenager and how you managed them to help her realize that there is light at the end of the tunnel and that she can move on. (Although she may act like she cannot believe you were ever her age!)

, Being a teenager is hard, as you are at the mercy of adults. Having some power to choose almost always helps.

, Teenagers need to know their boundaries, right from wrong, and discipline. She will act and say they don't want your attention, but in reality, it's your involvement that helps guide her into being a great woman.

, She does not think like a grown-up. She may make some not-very-well-thought-out choices, she may be impulsive, she may do bizarre things at times. The reason is she isn't using all her brain yet. So be patient; she'll get there.

It requires a lot of courage on your child’s behalf and trust in you. Try to be proud of your child for having so much courage.


Tell your child that you know it was hard for him or her to tell you. For example, you could say, “I know this must have been difficult for you to talk to me about, but I am so glad that you did. It shows me that you trust me and that means so much to me.”
When you feel ready, you could say something to your child to show that you are proud of him or her for being so courageous. For example, you could say, “I am proud of you for having the courage to be so honest.” Or, “You are so courageous! I am so proud of you!”;
, The fact that your child has decided to be open with you about his or her sexuality indicates that your child wants to be honest with you. While you may be struggling with learning that your child is gay, keep in mind that it is really an opportunity to develop a closer, stronger relationship with your child.


You could express this view with your child by saying, “I am looking forward to growing our relationship.”

, Your child may deal with rejection at school, teasing, or even discrimination because of his or her sexuality, so your support will be crucial. You can be a shoulder to cry on, a constant source of love and acceptance, and a source of wisdom for your child during these difficult times.If you notice that your child is struggling, then try saying something like, “I can see that you are going through a lot right now, but remember that I am always here for you.” Or, “I am willing to listen any time you want to talk.”

, Your child is probably worried about being rejected by you for being gay, so it is important to make sure that your child knows that you love him no matter what. Say something to reassure your child and let him know that you still love and care for him.You can simply say, “I love you.” Or, “No matter what, you are still my child and I will always love you.”

, There are plenty of supportive, loving things you can say to your child, but there are also some things that you should not say to your child because it may upset him or her.Don’t say that you “suspected” that your child was gay. Indicating or stating outright that you already knew your child was gay may be extremely upsetting to him or her. Even if this is the case, do not tell your child that you suspected him or her of being gay.
Don’t bring religion into the conversation. Some people have strong religious beliefs that condemn homosexuality. Even if you hold these beliefs, do not bring them up to your child. Bringing this up will only distress your child. It will not change his or her sexual orientation.

, Everyone needs to learn about safe sex practices at some point, so you might consider raising this topic with your child after learning about his or her sexual orientation.


Explain the importance of using condoms to help prevent STDs, such as HIV and gonorrhea.Do your best to answer your child's questions about sex. If your child asks a question, make sure that you acknowledge the question and determine how much your child knows before you respond. For example, you might say something like, ""That's a great question. Do you have any ideas about what the answer might be?""After you answer your child's question, check to see if he or she is satisfied with the answer. For example, you can say something like, ""Does that make sense?""

, Just as you might listen if your child was struggling with a heterosexual relationship, you should also be willing to listen to your child if he or she is struggling in a same-sex relationship. Make sure that your child knows that he or she can talk to you any time.


For example, you might say something like, ""How are things with your boyfriend/girlfriend?"" Or, ""I am always here to listen if you want to talk.""

, Although learning about your child’s sexuality may have changed the way you look at him or her, remember that your child is still the same child you knew before. The only difference is that you now know the truth about your child’s sexuality.


Many parents go through a period of grief when they learn about their child’s sexuality and this is normal. For example, you might feel sad because it seems as though some of the hopes and dreams that you had for your child will not be realized. However, keep in mind that even heterosexual children do not live up to all of their parents expectations, so this is just a part of being a parent.

, It is normal to experience a wide range of feelings when you first learn that your child is gay. These feelings may include self-blame, grief, worry, religious confusion, stigma concerns, or even relief.You might be feeling a combination of different feelings, or your feelings might change from one day to the next.


Give yourself some time to feel what you are feeling. Although you may be anxious to get to the point of being able to accept your child, this can take some time.
Try writing about how you feel to understand your feelings a bit better. Start a journal and use it to keep a daily record of how you are feeling about your child’s news that he or she is gay.

, Talking to a trusted friend, family member, or even an acquaintance about your feelings can help to provide some relief.Make sure that the person is someone who is progressive and who will be sympathetic to your feelings. Steer clear of people who are openly biased about gay people or who have religious beliefs that might cause them to condemn your son or daughter for being gay.


Explain what happened. Tell your friend how you found out that your child is gay, how you reacted, how you are feeling now, and how you are trying to learn how to accept your child.

, If you do not feel comfortable talking to a friend or family member, or if you just need additional support, then you can also see a therapist. A licensed mental health professional can help you to work through your feelings and move towards accepting your child for who he or she is.

, LGBT stands for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered. Since many people have misconceptions about what it means to be gay, it is helpful to learn as much as you can to ensure that you have an accurate understanding of your child’s sexuality.


PFLAG, GLAAD, and the American Psychological Association provide helpful essays and resources that can help you to learn more about LGBT people.

, Spending quality time with your child is important, but it might be even more important after you learn that your child is gay. By making plans with your child, you will be demonstrating that you still enjoy being with her.


Go shopping together, go to the beach, go for bike rides, play board games, or whatever you and your child like to do together.
You can also try making plans that support your child’s coming out. For example, you might help your child to plan and throw a coming out party. Or, you might invite your child and his or her significant other to dinner.

, Your child may encounter some difficult situations as he or she comes out to other people, such as other loved ones, friends, and teachers. Therefore, your child may seek your advice for how to handle negative reactions. You can help your child by listening and helping him or her to solve problems.


Try to listen and respond to your child without judgment. Do not tell your child what he or she “should” or “should not” do.
You might also consider asking a trustworthy adult friend or family member who is gay if he or she would be willing to meet with your child and act as a role model. Having support from an adult who is also gay may be helpful for your child and helpful for you as well.

, It is also helpful to link up with other parents of gay children as you work towards accepting your child for being gay. Support groups such as Parents, Family, and Friends of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG) have local chapters and online forums so you can hear about other people’s experiences, share your experience, and get advice for how to accept your child., Once you have accepted your child for who he or she is, then you may want to help other parents do the same. Consider getting involved with a group like PFLAG and sharing your story. You might also look for opportunities to help others within your social circles, such as among your friends or coworkers.

Help your children to notice and be thankful for all the fun things life has to offer by actively pointing out the wonders around them on a regular basis.,

Tell your children often that they have the power within to turn gloom into happiness simply by changing their attitude.,
Insist that your children acknowledge gifts in an age-appropriate way.",How to Teach Kids to Be More Thankful People," Humans created things such as tooth fairies, clowns, Santa Claus, bubbles, bubble gum, balloons, jump rope and many others are ideal to begin with. Also focus on nature and help children to see the beauty around them daily, from the birdsong and the trees to the mighty mountains and rivers of their country.;
, Whatever it is, when it's their idea to do something for others, show gratitude for it. Occasionally throw in a free hug and a ""Thank you for being you. I love you so much.""


Model the behavior. Thank your spouse or domestic partner for small kindness's. Thank relatives, friends, flatmates in front of the children. Especially don't take your nearest and dearest for granted, they may grow up thinking gratitude is only for strangers and that love is expressed by ignoring their closest loved ones or expecting kindness without reciprocation. Go ahead and prompt the kids to thank others for kindness or gifts too. ""What do you say when someone's nice to you?"" is a good question.
Read them stories about gratitude. This carries a much bigger impact than movies and videos, although sharing kid videos is intimate too. There's nothing like a parent's voice to reach a child's heart.

, Comment on it frequently so that your children find it perfectly normal to seek out the happy, beautiful human sounds and to actively seek laughter. By remarking on such positive emotions in humans around their own age, they will be encouraged to see this as an expected norm.

, If you live in a place like the United States of America, Canada, the UK, Australia, New Zealand, or another democratic society, teach your child about the democratic legacy they have inherited. Many people around the world do not have the same freedom to speak their mind, many cannot expect those in power to listen to them directly, and many are not even able to travel, work or worship freely. Teaching children how important it is to value their freedoms, liberties and responsibilities is a valuable lesson. As they grow, help them also to understand how to be a good citizen.


Help children read stories suitable to their age about the political, cultural and social development of their country. And don't leave it just at your own country; learn about other countries too so that they feel connected. In the age of the internet, this has never been easier nor more important.
When your child is old enough, help them to read such important documents as your country's Constitution, Bill of Rights, human rights documents and international equivalents. They will learn gratitude for the amazing thinkers of the past who have left them with these legacies.

, They and others care about you and it is important for children to grow up knowing this openly and are not afraid to express the same emotions themselves.

, Many in the world go hungry and many of us have stopped respecting the food trail from farmer through to our table. It is important for children to understand how food is grown, how food is transported and sold before it gets to your home. Help them learn about this food trail and understand all the people involved in growing and producing food. Tell your children stories about food you had when you were younger and how it has changed over time. And always say thank you at the table before a meal, whether it is faith-based or a secular recognition, it is an important part of helping children learn gratitude toward what nourishes them.


Get your children to grow some of their own food. From radishes and lettuces through to corn stalks and even a little wheat, having your children learn how to grow their own food will teach them much about the effort of creating food and they will be more grateful toward those who help food reach our tables.
Include children in your cooking. Children are never too young to learn to make food alongside you. It is an important part of understanding nutrition and respecting that food doesn't just simply turn up on the dinner table.

, Tell them how great it feels on your face, how it provides light to us and energy to plants which in turn become our food. Help them to understand how amazing it is that planet Earth is in a ""just right"" position to the Sun, allowing us to thrive and to have forests, oceans, water cycles and more, that sustain us and other living beings.

, Even in the most concrete environment, teach them to look for the trees forcing their way through the steel and cement barriers, adding a little green beauty. In fall, help children appreciate their scarlet and golden leaves––do craft projects together using the leaves, rake them up together or just dive into piles of leaves and have a good laugh. And tell children that trees are special because they house birds, squirrels and many other creatures, they give us oxygen and they also provide wood for cozy fires where children can enjoy hot chocolate and s'mores.

, When the whining begins about it being too wet, too windy or too dull, help children to be grateful for what they do have. They are in a safe, cozy environment away from the rain. They are able to do lots of fun things such as read books, watch a movie, draw pictures, bake, write a story, talk to you, spend time playing with a sibling, etc. Or get them to don their rain boots and raincoat and head on outside for puddle splashing.


Watch in the rain for rainbows––they are free to everyone and can inspire the most amazing ideas in a child's mind.

, We are not here to do it alone. We are each incomplete and while we bring our own strengths to bear when seek to achieve something, it is only when we connect our strengths with those of others that we can truly achieve. Teach children that they are fine as they are and to be grateful that in connecting with others, they have the opportunity to be their very best selves.

, Some parents do this daily but as long as you do it regularly, it will keep your children attuned to gratitude. For example, asking them ""What three things made you grateful today/this week/this month?"" is a good way to begin. At the end of the year, do a ""gratefulness"" round-up together, to allow them to take stock of the things they are grateful for over the past year.


Now and then ask your children to talk about the people in their lives that they're grateful for, and why.

, Tell them that they will be happy if they choose to be thankful, if they are warm and open to others, and if they regularly stop to assess what is good about their life and what they have already by way of relationships, love and personal achievements. Help them by explaining often that money does not buy happiness, but gratitude does.

, Nothing is less welcome in a child than a sense of entitlement. Keep a list of holiday gifts/givers and make sure children thank the donor. No one cares if the note is misspelled or messy. Everyone cares if it is missing.

Stay involved in your teen's life.",How to Remind Teens Not to Drink," Most societies treat drinking alcohol as a part of daily lifestyle and make it legal from a certain age (the age varying according to where you reside). Alcohol is brought out for celebrations, for entertainment, for drowning sorrows and for sheer enjoyment. Besides drinking for its own sake, it has other uses from culinary to medicinal. The role of alcohol permeates all of society, mainly thanks to advertising, which suggests that drinking is a happy activity to be shared with peers, without showing its negative impacts. On the other hand, it's not all in the favor of alcohol. More and more advertisements funded by government and non-government organizations are appearing that point out the hazards of alcohol, there are many excellent materials available through government and professional organization websites about alcohol issues and you have many parents as concerned as you on your side. Just stay open to the fact that you'll need to reason with your teen as to why alcohol gets such a good rap while its dark side tends to be downplayed.


As a parent or guardian, be aware of the stages an alcohol abuser can go through. In a nutshell, there is an experimental stage, in which teens try alcohol with their friends. This can be followed by continuously using it, which may lead to early dependence. If they abuse alcohol, this can turn into full dependence, and finally full blown addiction. If you can discuss the stages with your teen, it can help you to relay how serious alcohol addiction is. Teens tend to just look at drinking as partying, but they should know the direction abusing alcohol can take. Once they understand this, and you are sure that they do, many times than not, they will still think they are invulnerable to such an ill fate. You can lead a horse to the water, but you can't make it drink, or you can lead a human to knowledge, but you can't make them think––and that's another challenge––but you must keep trying.;
, What is your attitude toward alcohol? Are you drinking in moderation? Your teen notices everything and the message you're putting forward needs to be consistent.

, Ensure that it's a time of day when nobody has to be anywhere and that you're all in the mood for spending time together. There is nothing less helpful than forcing your teenager to sit and listen to what may well end up sounding like a lecture when neither of you feels like talking! It is also best to not remind your teenager as a ""one-off"" thing but to discuss the topic regularly, including making off-the-cuff comments and asking for their ideas and questions about alcohol at any time. Your teen's understanding that you're willing to talk about it non-judgmentally and in a helpful way will increase the chances of more open discussions.


Keep reminding your teen that you love him or her, and care for his or her safety and well-being.
Below you will find a list of things you can tell your teen about the dangers of alcohol. It's not recommended that you read this list to your teen or treat it like some sort of mantra. Doing so risks your teen viewing you as being too paranoid or as resorting to scare tactics. Relaying a fact here, and a fact there, now and then, will be most effective.

, Communication expressed with love is essential for establishing good behavior of all kinds, and communicating how drinking can be detrimental to one's health, can help to prevent abuse of alcohol now, and help modify their drinking behavior in their later years.

, Here are a few of them:



Safety: Car accidents, and the risk of injury or death to another or oneself, and the legal repercussions of being caught while drinking and driving. Remind them before prom night or other teen events of the dangers of drinking and driving, as many teens are killed in car accidents when such events are held.

Reproductive health: Impaired judgment causing unplanned teen pregnancy, fights, embarrassment in public, etc.

Legal consequences: Discuss the legal consequences for underage drinking in general, including fines and jail time.

Health in general: There are many reasons why alcohol consumption can be extremely unhealthy, for teens both now and for their future. Help your teen to understand why alcohol is unhealthy by discussing its chemistry (you can find help for that online, start with Wikipedia) and what it does to the human body when it is abused. It's particularly important that you clarify the dangers for younger folk; for example, the AMA (American Medical Association) has determined that the brain is in it's vital state of growth during teen years, and that the brain does not stop growing until the age of twenty five; tell them to consider this now, and before going to college, as it could affect not only their overall health, but their ability to concentrate and study as well. Indeed, alcohol use in teens has been known to cause irreversible brain damage. Other health issues include:

Cirrhosis of the liver: Explain what it is and perhaps show them a picture of a healthy liver opposed to an unhealthy one. Explain that the liver can only handle so much alcohol at a given time, then after the liver is full, then the excess travels through the blood and to the brain, hence overworking the liver and destroying brain cells at the same time.
Depression and anxiety: Explain how people fall into a vicious cycle of using alcohol to feel better when they feel down, only to have the alcohol become an ongoing cause of maintaining their sense of worthlessness and helplessness. Explain to them that alcohol is both a stimulant and a depressant, and the sensation one gets from it, or high, is later replaced by depression at times.
Hypothermia: As soon as the weather is cold enough, there is a risk of dying in the cold when drunk. Teens have lost their lives from falling asleep in the snow on the way home or getting lost or breaking down in a car and either falling asleep or wandering off instead of calling for help and trying to keep warm.



Alcohol poisoning: This is a serious and often underestimated consequence of abusing alcohol. With the social acceptance of alcohol as a social drink, it is rarely thought that over-indulging in alcohol could lead to death on a single occasion. Sadly, it can and it is important to make your teen aware of the facts. For more details, see How to recognize and treat alcohol poisoning. Another problem can be choking on vomit caused by alcohol and dying––a senseless and undignified way to die. And even if one survives alcohol poisoning, it still can lead to irreversible brain damage.

Relationship damage: Remind them that many people have relationship problems due to drinking, as it can affect judgment and cause people to hurt others, even without intending to, because alcohol inhibits the normal restraint.
A few sobering facts can increase attention as long as they're not overdone. For example, alcohol kills 75,000 Americans each year, and shortens the lives of these people by an average of 30 years. An estimate of 34,833 people died in 2001 of cirrhosis of the liver, cancer, and other diseases linked to drinking too much beer, wine and spirits. And alcohol is the third leading cause of death after tobacco use, poor eating and exercise habits.

, The internet is a great source of information that will help your teen to learn


Sit with them and research such studies as Fetal Alcohol Syndrome showing them how alcohol travels through the mothers blood to the infants, thus creating brain damage, or in the worst-case scenario, intellectual disability.
Search for famous people whose lives were damaged or destroyed by alcohol abuse. From lost careers to lost lives, there are many famous people who can provide a salutary example of the dangers of alcohol. It can help to choose famous people in fields of your teen's interest, such as sports, the arts, movies, science, etc. In some cases you might even have examples of colleagues, friends or family, but take care when discussing people you know well, as it might seem hurtful or dishonorable to that person's memory.
Alternatively, if your teen seems squeamish and annoyed with you for hanging around too long, consider setting him or her a home project to research into the effects of alcohol abuse to inform you. Say that you want to know the effects of alcohol on the heart, the liver, the body in general and any other interesting effects of alcohol abuse and that your teen can present it one night in any format he or she likes. Give a fair deadline and try to inject a sense of interest into the project.
Quietly does it too. You can obtain pamphlets, booklets and books about alcohol from various places such as Alcoholics Anonymous, university or medical research centers, your doctor, government sources, etc. and simply give them to your teenager or leave them about the house for general reading.

, If there is a history of alcohol abuse within the family, your teen has been exposed to its ugliness first hand. Whether it is a parent, an aunt or uncle, a grandparent or some other person, there is already an awareness of the bad that it does. There is a risk that your teen might have come to view alcohol as a crutch to fall back on when things go wrong, especially if there hasn't been a strong person around to teach resilience, healthy coping mechanisms and values to the teen. Honesty is the best policy––acknowledge the harm openly while reassuring your teen of his or her worth, noting that your teen is precious and deserves better. It might help to teach your teen ways to be assertive and self-accepting, if you feel that is lacking. If you don't feel capable of doing this alone, there is always help available to you through a doctor, counselor, a trusted friend or family member or a spiritual adviser.

, Often it is peer pressure that leads a teen to drink, even where he or she is well versed in the dangers of it. To this end (and for many other relevant reasons besides alcohol abuse), it is important to spend some time discussing ways of backing down from peer pressure by being assertive and simply saying ""no"". Your teen will probably be concerned about how he or she looks when saying no to peers, especially if your teen is worried about a lack of popularity, so spend time discussing how self worth comes from within and not from external validation (or removal of it). There are good resources online and in the library about helping teens with their self-esteem and to deal with peer pressure.

You might like to start with a few wikiHow examples: How to help your child overcome peer pressure, How to help your teen resist negative peer pressure and How to deal with peer pressure.






Try to remember how it felt when you were subjected to peer pressure as a teen. How did you react? How can your experience inform your teen now––being honest about how you felt and how you reacted can be reassuring for your teen, as it shows both a connection to your teen and understanding about what your teen is now going through.
Help your teen learn as much as possible about recognizing negative thought patterns, and about dealing with his or her emotions and feelings rather than avoiding them or trying to cover them up. Alcoholics tend to be people who want to detach themselves from the pain of their emotions and feelings.

, Remind your teens from time to time, how advertisers make alcohol more appealing than it really is, all without showing the repercussions of what too much drinking can do. Alcohol does not determine whether or not you have decent inter-personal relationships or a good life. But it sure can interfere with these desired outcomes.


Teach your teen to think about the issues involved in drinking alcohol and why people like to portray it as a social lubricant. Ask them to suggest other benign ways to feel better when socializing, such as improving your conversation skills or not caring what others think of them.
Teach your teens to assess marketing claims critically. If your teen has this ability, it will be far harder to fool him or her into buying ""the lifestyle"" message alcohol advertisements try to sell.

, Keeping a friendly eye on things can go a long way to establishing trust and respect both ways with a teen and his or her friends. By choosing to overcome any sense of dislike or fear and having your teen's friends around to your place, you are taking an active role in supervising and influencing. You can also get to know the parents of your teen's friends where appropriate. Treating your teen's friends like extended family can help to both know what's going on and can prove useful for occasional reminders about alcohol. Pick a time to invite their friends over for pizza or the like, then mention some facts of drinking, like local car fatalities and take notice of who seems interested and those that may shun the topic. There is plenty of information on the dangers of drinking, but teens rarely pay attention to these, such as the nightly news or newspapers, so be informed, so you can inform them as well. Again, never overdo it––casual references dropped in here and there are good, while an occasional open discussion on ""how do you feel about alcohol"" might work, depending on the mood and closeness of everyone. Judge the mood and context carefully.

, A teen who is aware of the love, commitment and unconditional acceptance back at home, has a head start in life and will be be more likely to ask for your help. Notice when your teen is stressed, worried or disappointed and ask questions and be ready to talk. Be available when your teen needs you and you may just nip potentially difficult issues in the bud.

Aim to give your teen a toolbox for life. The toolbox must be always full of useful alternatives your teen can reach for, like: a good friend they can rely on that is always reachable in times of need; a hobby that they can enjoy and occupy their time, and that will keep their mind off their troubles, and last but not least, any type of spirituality which has been show by several studies, including one at Columbia University, to be the most effective of all the tools.






Most of all, treat your teen with compassion and love. This is a time of life when everything can be turned around under the guidance of someone willing and caring, a role tailor-made for you according to the values and beliefs of your own family.

If your child seems to be putting the pieces of adulthood together, there is probably nothing wrong.However, if your child seems to struggle in many areas of development, such as school, work, finances, and relationships, you may want to carefully consider whether they are experiencing a ""failure to launch.""
Try talking with friends who also have young adult children to get a better idea of normal versus abnormal behavior. What is normal for young adults now may be very different from what you experienced as a young adult.;
, Ask yourself if your child is working, saving money, and contributing to household expenses. If not, consider the reasons why. Are they spending money recklessly? Or are they acquiring unnecessary debt? Even motivated young adults sometimes struggle to land their first job after finishing school. If your child shows no interest in applying for jobs, though, it may be time to have a talk with them., A common feature of failure to launch syndrome is a poor work ethic and unwillingness to help out around the house. Consider whether your child has – or is actively searching for – a job or internship, and whether they pitch in with household chores., A young adult with failure to launch syndrome will avoid making plans to move out and become independent. They may have only vague goals or they may have big goals with little or no idea how to achieve them. If your child sets goals and takes an active role in planning their future, however, their stay with you will probably be temporary.Instead of putting your child in a corner with an intimidating question like ""What are you gonna do with your life?"" raise the subject gently. You might say, ""I noticed some pamphlets came in the mail for different universities. Did any of them interest you? What major are you considering?""

Communicate your expectations.,
Draw up a plan for household and financial contributions.,
Be firm in your stance on alcohol and drugs.,
Avoid backing down if your child tests your boundaries.,
Consider what circumstances would warrant asking your child to leave.",How to Deal with Failure to Launch Syndrome2," Let your child know how you expect them to behave and contribute while they live with you. Tell them what you expect them to pay for, what household tasks they are responsible for, and what your policies are for guests and curfew.For instance, you might specify that your child can have friends over, but they have to leave before 9 PM.
Have this talk as soon as possible, preferably before your child even moves back home.
Be sure to emphasize that these rules are not meant to control your child. They are meant to make living together easier and more comfortable while also helping them to move forward with their goals.

, Ensure that your house rules are clearly defined by putting them in writing. Talk the agreement over with your child to be sure you’re on the same page.Consider including a time component in your rules. For instance, you might agree to let your child live rent-free for three months, but expect them to find a job during that time and pay rent afterwards.
Include consequences for not respecting the house rules. For example, if your child drives your car but doesn’t fill up the gas tank, they might lose their car privileges.
Make sure to specify that you can change the rules at any time.

, If you don’t want your child drinking or using drugs in your house, make it clear. Decide what you will do if you discover they are using substances behind your back.Alcohol, marijuana, and other drugs often contribute to failure to launch syndrome. These substances can impair motivation and make mental health problems worse.

, Your adult child may try to bend the rules or use your sense of guilt against you. Stay firm, and remember that it’s not your job anymore to keep them comfortable and sheltered. You have a right to make the rules in your own house.Giving in sends the message that you don’t really mean what you say.
For instance, if you told your child that you won’t pay for their cell phone, don’t give them money when they’re broke one month.
Be sure to communicate the rules to other members of the household, such as to your partner, so that everyone is on the same page.

, If your adult child becomes abusive or starts engaging in illegal activities, it’s not a good idea to let them live with you. Decide which behaviors you won’t tolerate, and stick to your guns if you feel like your living situation isn’t healthy or safe.If you decide to evict your adult child from your home, then you would need to provide them with a formal eviction notice. You cannot simply call the police and ask to have them removed.

"
"
Avoid sheltering your child from mistakes and consequences.,
Teach your child good financial skills.,
Help your child prepare for finding a job.,
Encourage your child’s efforts.,
Consider whether therapy could help your child.",How to Deal with Failure to Launch Syndrome3," You might hate to see your child struggling, but slip-ups are part of the learning process. Let your adult child make their own mistakes and then figure out how to fix them. This will improve their resilience and give them a sense of agency.This does not mean that you cannot be there to offer advice and help. It just means that they will have to do the work themselves and that you will not solve your adult child’s problems for them.

, Talk with your child about saving money, living frugally, and avoiding debt. Start doing this as early as possible. It is best to begin talking to your child about these things when they are still young. However, if you did not do this with your adult child, then you can do things to help them now. Help them come up with a weekly or monthly budget so they’ll be prepared to manage their money when they move out.Charging your child a reasonable amount of rent is a good way to prepare them for paying bills later.

, Offer to look over your child’s resume, do mock interviews with them, or help them pick out professional clothes. If you know people who might be able to help with networking, give your child their names and phone numbers.Avoid doing any of the actual work of job hunting. For instance, don’t call your professional contacts yourself – let your child do it.

, If your adult child is working hard to become less dependent on you, cheer them on. Poor self-esteem often contributes to low achievement in young adults, but genuine support and encouragement can help give your child the confidence they need to make it on their own.You might say something like, “I’m so proud of you for getting this big job interview. Even if you don’t get the job, it’s still a great start!”

, Failure to launch syndrome is often caused by underlying problems like mental illness or substance abuse. If you think your child may be struggling with depression, addiction, or a similar issue, help them set up an appointment with a therapist.Seeking help for your child may even be a requirement if they are living with you.

Help your teen develop and work toward future goals.,
Remind your child that a high school diploma is integral in the job market.,
Consider alternative settings for school.",How to Prevent Your Teen from Dropping out of School," Taking the time to listen without judgement for the root cause of this choice is important. You can’t work to fix the problem unless you know what you are dealing with.


The most common reason for a student to drop out is either they have missed too many days already in the school year or they feel hopeless because they are beyond the point of fixing a failing grade. Both of these situations can be addressed, but the student may not understand this.Other reasons students consider dropping out may include being bullied, a teen pregnancy, depression problems with drugs/alcohol or social problems at school. When you probe to get information about why he or she is considering dropping out, you have to be prepared for whatever you find out.





;
, Instead of getting angry or yelling, offer your support. Ask how you can help.


Being supportive does not mean enabling their behavior. If dropping out seems like a good idea because they simply do not like the responsibility, your student needs to know that if he/she drops out you will expect rent and financial contributions to the household via a job.
Some students consider dropping out simply to enjoy their “freedom” by just staying home. This should not be an option; if they drop out they get a job like other adults do. Dropping out of school is an adult choice., Having a trusted adult they can talk to in order to solve the problem will go a long way to give them hope and a view towards the future.


Community resources are available for teen parents, teenagers needing drug/alcohol treatment, or mental health counseling. If their issue is tied to a physical or psychological problem making an appointment for a checkup with their doctor is the first step in getting help.






Schools often have resource centers as well, so checking in with a guidance counselor with your student’s permission can also help. The school will also be able to tell you about alternative learning options if that would help.
For cases where the problem is actually with something or someone at school, a visit to the school is a good first step. You may be able to solve a social problem like bullying by contacting the principal. A problem with a teacher can be solved with a schedule change, while tutoring can help with a failing grade.
In an extreme case you may even consider home schooling options, the opportunity to start college classes early or to finish school on-line. Exploring all the academic option will help you to find the best fit to finish school for your student.

, Children who have good relationships with their parents come to them with problems and listen to their advice.


Children with parents who are actively involved in school and show that they value education are less likely to drop out. Model life-long learning and encourage personal growth beyond the basics at school.
Encourage your student to explore hobbies or volunteer with groups that interest them to explore possible careers. Doing this activity together is a great way to find a common interest and also get your student thinking about the future. A future goal of college makes dropping out less of an option.
Setting aside time to do non-school activities together builds the connection and makes new memories. A student who feels they have talents beyond school may be less likely to be overwhelmed by an occasional failing grade and not look towards dropping out as the only fix., Sometimes, parents are so busy telling kids what to do that they miss small messages that represent a cry for help. Pay attention to your kids and when they talk, engage and listen.


While hearing your child wants to drop out may seem like it came out of nowhere, it usually is the end of a long process. There are often signs and being involved in all stages of their education can give you a good indication if things have changed., Schedule a meeting with teachers and school administrators. Determine if any accommodations need to be made to foster your child’s learning experience.


While problems at home can be a part of the choice to drop out, more times than not there is a problem at school that is the driving cause of this choice. Getting the school involved can get you help., This membership puts you at the school often and the staff will start to recognize you.


In the case of a problem at school, you being there on a regular basis puts you closer to solving the problem. If your student needs your support you are readily available.
Take special care to communicate with school staff in the most efficient way but also respect your student’s privacy. Including him or her in the conversation will help., Other parents may help you spot any problems behaviors that require intervention. Also, staying in the loop keeps you informed on what your teen’s friends are involved in, such as drugs, sex, or other risky activities.


Some students may try to hide problems by lying about where they are or who they are with. Being involved with the other parents can make this nearly impossible., A psychiatrist can offer therapy and prescribe medications for conditions like ADHD or bipolar disorder which may interfere with school functioning. A mental health counselor can help your child sort out issues such as social anxiety or depression.


Having your child evaluated for any psychological conditions could problem-solve his or her desire to drop out and offer needed intervention.

, Sometimes, sports or other activities can help a teen feel involved at school and encourage good grades to stay on the team.


Feeling successful in an area beyond schoolwork can deliver a stimulus for your teen to want to do well in school and to recognize how important staying in school is to his or her future. What’s more, participating in clubs, organizations, and sports will likely expose your teen to other good students who have solid goals for the future. Their motivation just might rub off.

, Openly talk about what happened during the school day, how classes are going, and how he or she is performing in sports or organizations. When your teen feels like you are interested in the small things, he or she is more likely to come to you with the bigger things in the future. Staying in regular contact about school also sets you up to know about problems much sooner.Start a dialogue with your child(ren) about school by making it a daily routine for the whole family. Perhaps at dinnertime everyone can go around and tell their “peaks” and “pits” to the group—that is, something great that happened that day and also something not-so-great.

, Doing so can help him or her stay committed to attending school.


Teens contemplating dropping out or worse often feel like they have no future. Installing a look towards the future and a focus on goals lets them know that even a failing grade or extra time in school is a short term problem., Taking the time to share a realistic view of the job market without a diploma can go a long way for a teen stuck in a dream world.


Including real world data can help with this case. You can take your child on a field-trip to the unemployment office in your area and talk with the staff about the limited options your teen may have if he does not finish high school. You might also watch a documentary or look up some statistics from a website, such as Center for Public Education., The school environment could be contributing to your teen’s trouble. If other methods fail, you may have to look into enrolling your teen in a charter school, alternative school, magnet school, career academy, general educational development (GED) program or some other setting that is more conducive to his or her success.Other options for completing the diploma to consider: home schooling, online classes and programs that combine high school and college classes for highly capable students who may be bored with the standard classroom.

, A teen who refuses to eat broccoli or clean up his bedroom is probably not a big deal. However, smoking and failing grades will require you to get involved.

, If you have a spouse or partner with whom you are raising your teen, get together to discuss what you expect and how you will handle behavior and discipline issues.


Talk this out with a close family member or trusted friend if you are a single parent.

, Sending a teenager to her room is no longer going to have the positive effect it might have on a 10-year-old.


Try limiting cell phone access, driving privileges, computer time and social activities when necessary.

, Some parents write up a ""contract"" that explains rules, privileges and consequences.


Allow for discussion and explanation. While your teen should not be able to control or change what you have already decided, you should allow him to be heard. Explain anything that is unclear, and acknowledge that all parties have heard and understood the expectations.
Talk about risks. Do not simply forbid drinking, drugs and premarital sex. Talk about the risks that come with those behaviors, and discuss the worst case scenarios.

, This is a good opportunity to demonstrate your consistency and commitment to your rules and consequences.


Do not weaken. You might be tempted to give in, but stand your ground, otherwise there will be no consistency.

, If a rule needs to be changed, explain to your teen why you are allowing it. For example, if a curfew on a school night is 8:00 p.m., but swim practice goes until 8:30, allow a later curfew only for the duration of swim season.

, Check in with your teen during the day and when she is out at night.

, In addition to being consistent with discipline and consequences, you must praise your teen on a regular basis as well. Celebrate improved grades, sports accomplishments and volunteer work.

, Your teen needs to know you are there for her no matter what.


Reinforce that she can always call you if her ride home has been drinking, for example.
Get involved with her life without being intrusive. Get to know her friends, ask about her day and offer to help study for tests.

, Having an abortion, putting the child up for adoption or keeping it all have their pros and cons. Help your daughter research her options so she can decide what is best for her, but she has to keep in mind that this is not to be taken lightly.

, If your daughter is going to keep her child, it means a lot of things are going to change for her and everyone in her life - including you. She must understand that having a child is a lifetime commitment, and raising it isn't all fun and games.

, If he is the type of man that could bring your daughter and grandchild into an abusive or otherwise unhappy life, she really should ditch him. If she's reluctant or feels bad about it, remind her that there are far better men in the world.

, Your daughter must look after herself to ensure a healthy pregnancy, especially if she is a younger teen. Make sure she gets proper nutrition and health care, and that she does not engage in harmful behavior (i.e drinking, smoking, drugs, excess caffeine, risky sexual behavior, etc).

, There are plenty of places where you can find decent quality baby furniture and clothing at a very low price, and inexpensive baby supplies can be purchased from any drugstore.

, In fact, it's rewarding,enjoyable and maybe fun. What is important is to set the boundaries on your role early on, to ensure that your daughter takes her child-raising responsibilities seriously and with commitment. Make sure that that she takes time and effort in trying to take care of her baby or offspring.

Help your toddler as necessary.",How to Teach Your Toddler to Eat Independently," Eating with the fingers is the first way that children learn to feed themselves, and you should watch for signs that you son or daughter is ready to try. This may actually begin well before the toddler period, at around eight or nine months of age. You may notice that your older baby will try to grab food (or other items!), at first with the whole hand and then, later on, with the fingers. These are signs that he or she is ready to start learning to eat independently.


The “pincer grasp” (the ability to grab small items with the thumb and forefinger) is especially crucial for effective self-feeding. Most babies develop this skill between about seven and eleven months of age.;
, Start by giving your older baby or younger toddler bite-sized pieces of foods that are easy to chew and swallow. At first, stick to foods that dissolve easily in the mouth; by the toddler years, you can start offering many more foods. Some suggestions include:


low-sugar cereals, especially o-shaped and puffed varieties
small pieces of ripe, soft fruits like bananas, mangos, peaches, or watermelon
small pieces of soft, cooked vegetables like carrots, peas, or sweet potatoes
cubed tofu
cooked pasta
small pieces of bread, bagels, or English muffins
small bites of cheese

, Mealtimes are a chance to interact and help your child learn, so do not simply place food in front of your toddler and walk away. Sit with your child, talk about the new foods, and hold up individual bites to encourage the pincer grasp. Take your child’s hand in yours and demonstrate.

, Always supervise your child when he or she is learning to eat finger foods. You can minimize the risk of choking by keeping the bites small (but not so small that he or she might swallow without chewing at all).

, Babies and toddlers are very messy when they learn to eat. Use bibs, and try to minimize damage by removing rugs or placing a protective cover underneath your child’s high chair.

, Make sure your child knows that self-feeding is a good thing and that he or she has made you proud.

, When your older baby or younger toddler can eat finger foods and has started to grab the spoon from you during meals, he or she is probably ready to learn to eat independently with a spoon.

, Larger spoons will be too big for a toddler’s mouth; you want something teaspoon-sized. Consider purchasing special baby spoons, which are lighter, rounded at the top, and usually made of plastic.

, To begin, use two spoons: one for you and one for your child. You can feed your child as usual, and he or she can also begin trying out the spoon.


Don’t worry if, at first, your child uses the spoon primarily to bang on the plate or high chair tray and dribble food around. Self-feeding takes time; he or she will figure it out.

, Show your toddler how to hold a spoon, and then help by placing your hand over his or her hand to demonstrate. Direct the spoon slowly into your toddler’s mouth.


As your toddler learns, you can also start using two bowls. You can feed your child from one; he or she can use the other, which should just have a small amount of food in it.

, Start with thicker, denser foods; these will stay on the spoon, whereas more liquid foods will drip away before your child manages to get the spoon to his or her mouth. Yogurt, cottage cheese, and pudding work well. As your child progresses, move on to thinner purees and soups.

, Eat when your child eats; family meals are important for teaching self-feeding skills, communication, and manners.

, Let your toddler know you are proud of his or her growing independence.

, In general, it’s best to wait until your son or daughter has developed a strong pincer grasp and can use the spoon relatively well. At that point, you can introduce the fork. Most children are ready by fifteen to eighteen months or so.

, To begin, select a fork made for young children, with rounded tips and a lighter weight. These are both safer and easier for a toddler to use successfully.

, Offer larger pieces of food that are fairly easy to pierce and hold with a fork: cubes of cheese work well, as do some kinds of cooked vegetables, meats, and pastas. Avoid foods that are too small, crumbly, or slippery. You don’t want to frustrate your child unnecessarily.

, In the beginning, you may need to take your child’s hand and demonstrate how to pierce and pick up a piece of food.

, Once your toddler is two or so, it’s fine to encourage fork-eating, but don’t worry if your child continues to prefer using his or her fingers. You can wait until the preschool years to start pushing harder for better table manners.

, Again, let your toddler know that you are impressed with his or her new skills.

, Before the toddler years, you can let an older baby hold a bottle and drink on his or her own. This will prepare your child for using a cup later on.

, Most children can start to drink from a cup by about a year of age. Make life easier for both of you by starting with a lidded cup made for toddlers. This will minimize spills and mimic the “feel” of a bottle.


Understand that even with a lidded cup, your child will probably make a mess. That’s okay; it’s part of the learning process.

, Once your child has mastered drinking from a lidded cup, you can remove the lid. Don’t fill the cup more than halfway – better to refill multiple times than to have your child dump a completely full cup all over the place.

, You can ease your child into drinking from a cup by holding the cup steady during his or her first attempts, placing your hands over your toddler’s hands so that he or she gets the sense of what drinking from a cup should feel like.

Generally speaking, as a positive role model you should strive to:


work towards your own goals and have some sense of purpose
commit to something positive in your own life
show compassion and forgiveness towards others (including those you don't know)
show honesty, humility, and a desire for peace
admit when you're wrong or when you don't have the answers;
, Part of being a positive role model should involve setting a good example of how to be a productive member of society. That extends beyond a hard work ethic (though you should instill that in your teen as well). Try to make a positive impact on your community, and ask your teen if he/she would like to get involved with you.Some positive ways you can improve your community include:


organizing community-building activities like monthly potlucks, book swaps, and musical performanceslearning about the issues that affect your community and your neighborsworking with neighbors to develop short-term and long-term goals
addressing your concerns to your city council
organizing protests/boycotts to draw attention to community polluters, unscrupulous landlords, etc.

, As a positive role model, you'll need to follow your own advice and avoid getting into trouble. This starts with addressing how you handle challenges in life. Do you get angry? Do you tend to scream and swear, or engage in unhealthy coping methods like binge drinking? If so, you may be setting a bad example for your teen.


Explore multiple approaches and solutions to your own problems and focus on finding the solution that works best.
Use physical exercise to stay healthy and release stress. Go for a run, ride your bike, lift weights, or engage in some other form of physical fitness.
Find your own hobbies and interests that are relaxing and fulfilling. You might try meditation, mindfulness, or something more physically engaging like solving puzzles.
Try to focus on the positive aspects of a situation. No matter how frustrating a situation might be, remember that you have a lot to be thankful for in your life that others may not have.
Seek out support from your teen, your partner, and your peers. This can set an excellent example for your teen when he/she experiences problems.

, Your teen should be able to see your accomplishments and recognize that they stemmed from your strong work ethic. If your teen doesn't seem to get the message, drop it into conversation from time to time. Say things like, ""I really love our home, but I wouldn't have been able to provide for our family if I hadn't worked hard and shown determination/dedication.""Teach your teen the importance of hard work, both through your own example and through the lessons you impart on your teen.Teach your teen the value of money and the importance of taking pride in a job well done.
Have your teen get a summer job. This may be easier to start with than having your teen jump into working while he/she is still in school, which can distract from homework and studying.
Be punctual, whether for work or for personal appointments. Teach your teen the importance of being punctual, and try to help him/her get places on time or early.
Maintain a professional demeanor, and teach your teen to do the same. Be polite, respectful, and show integrity of character through honesty and a disdain for gossip.
Be self-disciplined, both for work projects and tasks around the house. Teach your teen that if he/she can't stay motivated and self-disciplined, no one else is going to help.

, Just as it's important to teach your teen a strong work ethic, it's also important to teach your teen that getting an education is important. There are a number of ways you can change your own habits to show your teen that you value an education and to set a good example for him/her.Spend more time reading at home instead of watching TV. You can even try to institute family reading time where everyone in your household turns off the TV, silences their cellphones, and spends an hour or two reading their own books.
Talk about issues surrounding education. If you have any friends who never graduated from school and are struggling with work, try privately bringing it up to your teen in an organic way.
Say something like, ""I'm worried about my friend Joe. He never graduated, and now he's having a really hard time finding work and making ends meet.""
Show your own interest in continuing education by enrolling in a class at your local community college. Your teen will see you taking time from your work and home life to prioritize schoolwork and may realize that he or she needs to do the same.

, As a parent, you obviously want your teen to succeed. However, it's important that you teach your teen that failure happens to the best of us. Show your teen that failure can be an excellent learning tool for figuring out how to do something right the next time, and make yourself open and vulnerable with your teen.Failure is an unavoidable part of life. No one can succeed at everything all the time, and that's okay.
Tell your teen about the times that you've failed. You can address academic failings, problems at work, behavioral problems/poor choices you've made, or difficulties you've had with your peers.
Let your teen know what lessons you learned from your own difficulties, and put a positive spin on it.
Remind your teen that you'll still love him/her, no matter what. Stress that it's okay to have difficulties, as long as you get something positive out of it.
When your teen tells you about his/her difficulties, try to point out some kind of take-away message from the situation.
By learning from a ""failure,"" your teen isn't actually failing at all. He or she is growing and becoming better/stronger/smarter.

, One of the best ways to be a positive role model for your teen is to make yourself available to him/her. Many teens pull away from their parents because they feel that their parents are too controlling, judgmental, or out of touch. By making yourself available, your teen will know that you can be approached for advice in the future.Accept the way your teen feels, as long as those feelings are expressed in respectful ways.
Don't lecture or nag your teen, and never try to make him/her feel guilty.
Stop what you're doing and give your teen your full attention whenever he/she wants to talk to you.
When your teen does want to talk, always be open and honest.

, Communication is important in any relationship, especially between a parent and a teenager. Talking may have come easier when your teen was a child, but you can and should still have meaningful conversations together - it may just have to be on your teen's own terms.Ask how your teen is feeling, how his/her interests and activities are going, and if there's anything you can do to help.
Make time to talk. Even if you have busy schedules, you might be able to find time for a good conversation while you're driving your teen to/from school or extracurricular activities.
Keep your teen's confidences secret. Don't share them with other family members or friends, as this may violate your teen's trust.

, Part of being a positive role model for your teen involves ensuring that your teen has supportive and healthy relationships with his/her peers. You can do this without spying or snooping by simply talking to your teen and taking an active role in interacting with your teen's friends.Make your teen's friends feel welcome in your home. Try to make your house the place where your teen hangs out with friends.
If your teen is spending time outside the house, ask your teen where he/she will be, who else will be there, and when your teen will be home. You can also ask your teen to check in with you by phone.
Make an effort to get to know your teen's friends, and try to get to know their parents as well.
Don't turn your teen's friends away or prohibit your teen from hanging out with someone. Your teen will probably find a way to see that friend, so it's best to have them spend time in a safe, supervised setting.
If you think one of your teen's friends is a bad influence, talk to your teen about it. Have a conversation with your teen about your concerns. For example, you might say, “I have noticed that your friend John yells at his mother a lot. What do you think of that?”
Instead of outright prohibiting your teen to be friends with someone (which probably won't work), set safe limits on the friendship. Establish clear guidelines on acceptable behavior and let your teen know what you will and won't do if your teen gets into trouble.For example, you might say something like, “I am not a fan of yelling, so make sure that that behavior does not rub off on you. Just to be clear, yelling like that will result in no video games for a week.”

, A lot of teens don't like school. This is normal, but the attitude you take towards your teen's studies may help reshape your teen's attitude about school. If your teen sees you taking an interest in his/her work and hears you talk about the value of an education, your teen might realize that his or her education is important to you.Set school as a top priority by making your teen sit out from extracurricular activities until his/her schoolwork is finished and attendance or grades improve.
Make sure your teen attends school everyday. You should also make sure your teen has done all of the necessary homework and studying for that day of class.
Take an interest in your teen's schoolwork by asking questions. It can be as simple as asking your teen, ""How was school today? What did your teacher think of the project you turned in?""
Get involved with your teen's school. Help volunteer at school functions, go to parent/teacher meetings and PTA meetings, and stay in touch with the school to let the teachers know you can be reached if your teen struggles in any subjects.

, Support is important for developing teens. Not only do they need supportive and understanding parents, they need supporting and understanding role models as well.


Remember that most teens go through experimental phases. Let your teen try out different identities/personas, and be supportive rather than critical or disapproving.Don't catastrophize your teen's problems, but by the same token don't be too overly-empathetic. Let your teen talk out his/her problems and offer verbal/emotional support and guidance, not judgment.For example, you might say something like, “I’m sorry to hear that you had a bad day. What do you think you can do to make tomorrow a little better?”

, By being a positive role model, you'll need to live the positive lifestyle that you want for your teen. If your teen sees you saying one thing and doing another, he/she may think you're being hypocritical or unfairly judgmental, which may make communication more difficult in the future.


Never engage in behavior that you teach your teens to avoid.
Never text and drive. Always be sober, awake, and focused on the road when you get behind the wheel.
Avoid drugs and alcohol. You can have an occasional glass of wine or cocktail, but don't overdo it, and never binge drink or get intoxicated in front of your teen.
If you're not married, practice safe and responsible sex. You may also want to limit your sexual partners to set a good example for your teen.
Be respectful, loving, and caring towards your partner (if you have one). It's important for teens to have good examples of healthy, supportive relationships.
Be responsible and follow through on your commitments. That includes work-related commitments as well as personal ones.

, As a role model, your teen will probably come to you seeking advice at some point. This may be a direct request for advice, or a conversation about something frustrating going on in your teen's life. When this happens, it's important to help teach your teen how to make a healthy, informed choice that yields positive results.Let your teen describe the problem in his/her own words. Then ask how your teen feels about the situation using open-ended words like ""how,"" ""what,"" or ""why.""For example, if your teen is trying to make a difficult decision, such as whether or not to confront a friend for talking about him behind his back, you might ask “What is causing you the most concern right now?” or, “How do you feel about confronting your friend?”
Address the choice as a problem that needs to be solved with clear thinking and a level head. For example, you might say, “It’s important to make this decision based on logic rather than emotion. Do you think you are calm enough to talk about it right now?”
Ask your teen about the options available for that choice. If your teen doesn't give realistic options or hasn't considered other possibilities, prompt him/her for more options.For example, you might say, “What else have you considered?” Or, “Have you considered writing your friend a letter?”
Tell your teen what the right thing to do would be, but justify that decision. Don't simply say, ""Because I told you so."" For example, you might say, “I think that telling your friend the truth about how you feel is the best choice because not telling the truth might lead to more problems in the future.”
Weigh out the potential positive outcomes against the potential negative outcomes. For example, you and your teen could make a list of pros and cons of confronting the friend.
Remind your teen that the choices he or she makes today can have lasting implications in the future. For example, you might remind your teen that not confronting the friend may cause the friend to continue to talk about him behind his back.
Ask follow-up questions a few days later to see how the decision worked out for your teen. Ask what your teen learned from the situation, and reinforce that choice as a valuable life lesson. For example, you might ask, “Did you talk to your friend? How did he react? How do you feel?”

, Any time your teen makes a responsible decision that you know about, you should praise your teen and offer some incentive to continue that behavior in the future. Encourage your teen to talk to you about other problems, and continue to give him/her the necessary guidance until your teen can make sound decisions independently.Ultimately, most teens want more independence (and the fun that comes with independence) and less parental oversight.
Don't make positive decision making a fruitless effort for your teen.
Any time your teen makes the right decision for a given situation, try offering him/her a little more independence.
Let your teen stay out an hour or two past his/her usual curfew, or give your teen a little extra spending money for the week to reward good decisions.

, Teens need to be disciplined when they do something they know is wrong, but it's important to use discipline in constructive, positive ways. Remember that most teens want independence and freedom from parental intervention, so losing that freedom might motivate your teen in the future.Talk to your teen about why a given choice is/was a bad idea. Talk about the actual repercussions of poor decision making so that your teen will actually learn a lesson, not just get angry over the punishment.
If your teen makes a bad decision, revoke some of his/her independence.
Explain the reasons why you punish your teen the way you do. Your teen should actually learn a lesson, not just brood through a period of punishment and resentment.
Tell your teen that he/she needs to learn that bad behavior can cost you your independence so that he/she doesn't end up really losing freedom by being arrested some day.
You might try grounding your teen for really bad decisions, or simply withdrawing independence for minor infractions. Make his/her curfew two hours earlier, don't give your teen any allowance for the week, etc.

, You obviously want what's best for your teen. However, holding on too tightly or trying to force too much control over your teen's life will only make him/her more rebellious and resentful of you.That doesn't mean letting your teen do whatever he/she wants; it simply means finding a balance.


Enforce the rules, but don't hover over your teen or snoop through his/her belongings. Your teen will lose respect for you, and he/she will be less likely to see you as a role model.
Give your teen support and guidance, but learn to trust his/her decision-making skills after a certain point. All you can do is teach your teen what makes a choice safe/smart and equip him or her with the necessary tools to make smart, safe decisions in the future.
Once your teen has proven trustworthy, you can probably ease up the control a little bit. Every teen is different, so talk to yours and let it be known that you're always available to talk.

, Using effective communication skills can promote a healthy relationship with your teen. Communicating in a healthy way with your teen will also provide a healthy model of behavior for your teen to follow. While there are lots of ways to model effective communications skills for your teen, showing that you are willing to listen is a great way to start modeling effective communication skills.


Teens may be reluctant to come to their parents with problems, especially if there is not an open invitation to listen when the teen has a problem. That is why it is important to let your teen know that you are available to talk whenever he or she needs you. You may even need to remind your teen that you are willing to listen if she seems like she needs to talk.
For example, you can remind your teen that you are willing to listen if she is having a bad day, by saying, “You seem a little down today. I’m happy to listen if you want to talk about it.”
Avoid lecturing your teen when he or she wants to talk. This is unlikely to have any effect on your teen.Instead, listen actively to your teen by making eye contact, nodding, making neutral statements to encourage your teen to keep talking, such as “Yes,” “Uh-huh,” and “I see.” Shut off any potential distractions as well, such as cell phones, laptops, tablets, TVs.

, Sometimes it can be hard to get your teenager to talk with you, so you may need to work a little bit to get a conversation going. Doing so will model good conversation starting skills for your teen. One good way to get your teen talking is to ask him or her leading questions. These are questions that will result in a broader discussion, rather than a yes or no answer.For example, asking, “Did you have a good day at school?” will result in a yes or no answer. Instead, ask, “What happened at school today?” This question will require your teen to recap his or her day, which will be more likely to lead to a discussion.

, You can also use conversations with your teen to model open mindedness. Now and then, your teen may reach out to you and tell you something that is difficult for you to hear. For example, your teen may tell you that he or she is failing a class, or tried smoking for the first time, or has become sexually active. These are crucial moments in your teen’s development and it is important to be supportive and understanding.When you encounter these situations, try not to judge your teen or make her feel bad for sharing. Instead, acknowledge how hard it must have been for your teen to share something so personal with you and indicate your willingness to support your teen.
For example, you might say something like, “I appreciate your honesty. I know that it must have been hard for you to tell me this. I’d like to help you figure this out. What are you most concerned about right now?”

, Conversations with your teen can also be great ways to model collaboration and problem solving skills. When your teen has a problem, it might be tempting to tell your teen what to do. However, this approach will not help your teen develop the skills that are necessary to think critically about difficult situations and come up with good solutions on his own. Instead, try to help your teen develop solutions by talking them out.For example, you might ask your teen questions such as: What are some of the solutions to this problem? Which solution do you think is best? What advantages does it have over the other solutions? What are the downsides?
Encourage your teen to talk through these solutions and offer your opinion if your teen asks for it. Otherwise, try to guide him or her towards the best solution and support him or her through the process of considering solutions.

, The way you express yourself to your teen can provide your teen with a positive model for expressing his or her feelings. You may get frustrated with your teen sometimes and this can lead you to say things that you do not mean or express yourself in a way that puts your teen on the defensive. One way to ensure that your teen is understanding of your position and that she does not get too upset is to use “I” statements.


For example, if your teen comes home late one night, do not say “You are so inconsiderate!” Instead, say something like, “I was really worried about you.”
If you teen does not clean up her room after you asked her to, do not say, “You are such a slob!” Instead, say “It upsets me when you don’t keep your room clean.”, You can also provide your teen with a model for healthy boundaries when you talk with your teen. Teenagers need more privacy than younger children and this might be hard to understand, but it is important to demonstrate respect for your teen’s privacy. Prying into your teen’s personal life, going into his or her bedroom without knocking, or listening in on phone calls are all invasions of privacy and doing these things will not set a good example for your teen.


Even if it is difficult for you, try not to pry when you are having a conversation with your teen. Allow your teen to share what she feels comfortable sharing and do not demand more details from her.For example, if your teen tells you that she and her boyfriend are fighting about something, don’t demand more details. Offer your support by saying, “Oh, I’m sorry to hear that.” Then, pause to allow her to say more or change the subject. Don’t try to get her to tell you more than she is comfortable sharing.

, Seeking help for yourself and/or for your teen can model good self-care and relationship strategies for your teen. If you and your teen are having a hard time communicating or if you are struggling with personal issues that are making parenting your teen difficult, then you may want to seek the help of a counselor. A counselor can help you with mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety, or anger management. A counselor can also help you with addictions and other serious problems.


You may also consider seeing a counselor with your teen if you are not able to communicate with him or her. A counselor can help you and your teen to develop better communication strategies, which may significantly improve your relationship.
You may also choose to see a counselor on your own. If your teen asks why you are seeing a counselor, then you can say, “I am going to therapy because I get angry a lot, and I am having trouble controlling my anger.” Or, “I am going to therapy so I can learn new skills and communicate better with you."" This will set a good example for your teen by showing that you are facing your problems and dealing with them in a healthy way, rather than hiding from them or using unhealthy coping mechanisms, such as using drugs or alcohol.

Print or buy an alphabet chart.,
Help toddlers understand how letters are written.,
Use a description to help toddlers understand the lines on the paper.,
Describe how to write each letter using easy-to-remember descriptions.,
Expose toddlers to nursery rhymes, songs, and poems.",How to Teach a Toddler Letter Recognition1," The best way for a toddler to start to recognize the various features of different letters is to practice writing those letters. And easy way to practice writing is to use an alphabet chart on a piece of paper. You can either print them off the internet, or buy a book with these charts. These charts will have all the lower and upper case letters and include arrows to show how each letter is to be written.You will likely want to practice writing the alphabet multiple times, so printing off several copies of the alphabet chart will be very helpful.
It is also important that the alphabets used have properly proportioned letters. For example, toddlers need to understand the size difference between an upper case “A"" and a lower case “a."";
, Letters are normally written starting at the top, then going down. And starting at the left and then going to the right. It is important that toddlers understand this when practicing their letters. While it may be tempting to use plain paper, using paper that either already has the letters drawn on it, or using paper with the proper lines, will be easier for toddlers to understand at first.You may want to start with a pencil as the writing instrument, but don’t limit toddlers to only one instrument. While toddlers are learning, use pens, pencils, markers, or even finger paint.
When teaching toddlers to write letters, stick with only one type of font. Avoid mixing different types of fonts (which may be found on different alphabet charts) so as not to confuse them., You will probably remember this type of paper from your own school days, but it consists usually of three horizontal lines, in-between which each letter can be written. The top and bottom lines are solid, while the middle line is dotted. Some letters, like ‘g,’ ‘j,’ ‘p,’ ‘q,’ and ‘y,’ will have a part of the letter that goes beneath the bottom, solid line.In order to help verbally guide toddlers when writing on this type of paper, it is helpful to name each line and each section so they can follow along.
One suggestion is to call the top line the “roof,” the middle dotted line the “fence,” and the bottom line the “sidewalk.” The are under the “sidewalk” might be called the “ditch.""
Another suggestion is to use “ceiling,” “window,” “floor,” and “basement.""

, Ideally, toddlers who are leaning how to write their letters will also remember your verbal descriptions. When they are working on their own, they may even say these verbal descriptions out loud to help guide them. There are no set descriptions to use for all the letters, however, the language used needs to be vivid and concrete.For example, when verbally describing how to write the letter ‘b,’ you might use the following language: “To make a lower-case b, start at the roof, drop straight down to the sidewalk, and then bounce back up to the fence and around.” Eventually this could be shortened to “drop down, bounce up, and back.""
For reference, the URL http://www.auburn.edu/academic/education/reading_genie/letters.html has detailed descriptions for each upper and lower case letter of the alphabet.

, Nursery rhymes, songs, and poems are a great learning experience for toddlers as they help teach how letters and words sound. The more you expose your toddler to these items, the more your toddler will recognize rhyming words and sounds without help.Around the time a child is three years old, sounds and syllables will become recognizable.
Also around the ages of three or four years old, children will begin to recognize when two words begin with the same sound.
This is a great time to teach your toddler the Alphabet Song. And while it may become annoying, try to sing the Alphabet Song every day.
While teaching your toddler about sounds and rhymes, you can also help teach about syllables by clapping each syllable out that is contained within your toddler's name. For example, if your toddler is named “Alexander,” you can teach him to clap four times for each syllable in his name — “Al + ex + an + der.""

Prepare alphabet soup or cereal to eat.,
Make bean bags with letters on them.,
Use magnetic letters.,
Write letters using a toddler’s body.",How to Teach a Toddler Letter Recognition2," Up until now, toddlers have mainly scribbled when drawing or writing on their own. They understand that letters are suppose to mean something that someone can say out loud, but they don’t know how to read those letters on their own. In order to help toddlers recognize and understand letters, teach them how to spell their own names.Toddlers often recite stories based only on visual clues. The same may happen with their name. It may appear like they’re reading their name, but in fact they recognize the visual look of their name and simply know that it means their name.

, Toddlers love story time. And while it’s fun for them and you, it’s also a great learning experience. The best way to use reading to teach letter recognition is to read the words while toddlers can see the words in the book. You may even want to follow along with your finger so they know which written words correspond to which sounds., There are all sorts of neat bath toys out there, including letters that can be stuck to the tiles beside the bath tub. While you’re giving your toddler a bath, play with the letters and help your toddler spell words on the wall. The words don’t have to be ‘real,’ but you can help your toddler say the letters as they’re put on the wall.This is a great opportunity to have your toddler spell their own name.

, Using your driveway or sidewalk, write out several letters of the alphabet. You can use any set of letters, but you might want to consider using the letters in your toddler’s name. Once drawn, ask your toddler to go to a specific letter (and help direct your toddler if necessary). After awhile your toddler should be able to recognize the letters without help.Games like this work best if they’re repeated over and over again. In the case of this game, each time should include slightly different letters put in different places.

, It might seem silly, but the letters of the alphabet that are in cereal or soup can also help your toddler with letter recognition. While your toddler is eating, point out specific letters and ask what it is. Correct your toddler if the letter isn’t know., Another great way to help teach your toddler letter recognition is to use bean bags. Each bean bag should have a different letter of the alphabet on it. You can turn the bean bags into a game by asking your toddler to toss the bean bag with a specific letter on it.These bean bags are also useful for simply displaying the letters when playing at the table or on the carpet.

, You can either buy your own set of magnetic letters, or you can make your own. Either way, they can be used on any flat metal surface, including: the fridge, a metal baking tray, or sometimes even a chalk board. Ask your toddler to find specific letters in the bunch, or isolate a specific letter and ask your toddler what it is., A creative alternative to writing letters out on paper, or seeing them on a specific material, is to actually form each letter with or on a toddler’s body. Toddlers could lie on the floor and write different letters using their body and other props."
"
Ask toddlers to find specific letters in a group of words.,
Start the letter of the day.,
Identify letters while reading.,
Scramble the letters of your toddler’s name.",How to Teach a Toddler Letter Recognition3," Using a piece of paper, write a variety of different, simple words (e.g. box, top, bed, stop, cat, bird, etc.). Then ask your toddler to circle each word that starts with a specific letter, such as the letter ‘b.’Write a variety of these word groups and focus on different letters each time.

, Each day select a different letter that you and your toddler are going to focus on. Write or display that letter somewhere prominent where your toddler will see it all day. Then ask your toddler to go through magazines or newspapers and look for words that start with the letter of the day. Get your toddler to cut that word out and post it near the letter of the day.Another aspect of this game is to also ask your toddler to draw an object that starts with the letter of the day. For example, if the letter of the day was ‘d,’ your toddler might want to draw a dog.

, While reading your toddler a story, ask your toddler to point out words that start with a specific letter. You could do this page-by-page to help your toddler recognize that specific letter in different words., In addition to simply teaching toddlers how to spell their names, you can also play a game where you scramble the letters of their name so they have to put them back in order. This works best with letter cards that can be easily mixed up and put back in order."
"
Consider if your toddler is ready for potty-training.,
Check to see if your toddler’s diaper is soiled.,
Inspect your child’s wardrobe for uncomfortable articles and fabrics.,
Ask yourself if the behavior could be attention-seeking.,
Evaluate your developing child’s motor skills.",How to Stop Toddlers from Taking Off Their Clothes1," One of the main reasons why toddlers frequently take off their clothing is that they’re wanting to go to the bathroom but don’t know how to articulate the urge. In order to figure out if this is the case with your toddler, observe your toddler carefully and see if the undressing behavior is associated with bowel movements or urination.If your toddler seems to go to the bathroom almost every time they undress or almost undress, it’s probably time to start potty-training.;
, If a toddler has just urinated or defecated in their diaper, the sensation of the scratchy or soggy diaper can be unpleasant. If they have the motor skills to do so, they might try to remove the soiled item rather than continue to suffer its burden., Your child’s diligent disrobing might have nothing to do with potty training and everything to do with the clothes themselves. Take note of their specific undressing habits in order to figure out if this is the case. For example, perhaps they always take off a particular sweater or type of fabric, or perhaps they seem averse to pajamas or a certain cut of garment, such as turtlenecks or trousers with big buttons.As a general rule, opt for natural materials, such as cotton, rather than synthetics, as these tend to be less scratchy to the skin and more breathable overall.
Also be sure that you’re not over-layering your toddler’s clothes. After all, if a child is hot and can’t express this discomfort, they’ll simply attempt to shed the offending articles.

, If a toddler is feeling ignored and neglected, they might seek to attract your attention by any means possible. In order to find out if your child’s undressing behavior is attention-seeking, consider how you tend to react when your toddler does it. If you yell, run after them, or generally display excitement, there’s a chance you’re playing right into your crafty kiddo’s designs.


Next time it happens, tone down your response so that you don’t reward their negative behaviors. Remain as calm as possible and make it clear that you wardrobe malfunctions won’t garner any special attention in the future.

, If your child’s undressing behavior has developed only recently and corresponds with newly acquired motor skills, chances are that it’s simply the result of experimentation and exercise. Fortunately, they’ll get bored with their novel buttoning, zipping, and squirming abilities quickly, so they’ll move on to more complex moves and tasks in no time.In the meantime, try to keep your child’s fidgeting hands and fingers occupied by giving them a doll or stuffed animal to practice their skills.

"
"
Stay calm when your child takes off their clothes.,
Provide distractions after putting on clothes.,
Give your toddler a time-out.,
Dress your toddler backwards.",How to Stop Toddlers from Taking Off Their Clothes2," Regardless of why your child is disrobing, it’s never a good idea to overreact when the behavior occurs. Not only will such histrionics fail to address the underlying issue, but they can also produce unwanted emotional and behavioral side-effects. Rather, take your child’s hand, lead them to the bathroom, and supervise as they put their clothing back on.For example, if you laugh or chase the child, they can learn that their misbehavior causes fun scenes and attracts lots of attention. If you reproach the child and act embarrassed, they can learn that bodies are shameful., If your child seems particularly prone to taking off their clothes directly after getting dressed in the morning, you might be able to prevent the behavior by distracting them during this crucial interval. Put on a favorite show, start playing with a loud, shiny toy, or pull out a colorful picture book to get your toddler’s attention away from their recently donned clothing.If distraction doesn’t work, try giving your child a bottle, a healthy snack, or a pacifier.

, Most toddlers learn to stop taking off their clothing once they grow up a bit and realize it doesn’t result in any positive attention. If your child persists in the behavior, though, you can discourage it more strongly by implementing short time-outs. Take them to another room and have them sit alone for five to ten minutes.If your child is refusing to get dressed after disrobing, have the time-out last as long as their refusal does. Make it clear that they can mitigate their punishment by correcting the behavior.

, Many times, a toddler undresses just because they can. In such simple cases, you can prevent the unwanted behavior by making the process more difficult. A measure as simple as putting buttoned shirts and pajamas on backwards can impede their movement to the extent that they either can’t remove the offending article, or they become bored or exhausted by the ordeal.Additionally, you can switch to cloth diapers with more secure clips, apply duct tape to the diaper, or select clothes with zippers or tiny, tedious buttons."
"
Permit naked time at designated times.,
Let your child make some clothing choices.,
Give your child a stuffed toy or doll with corresponding clothing.",How to Stop Toddlers from Taking Off Their Clothes3," Toddlers often simply enjoy the feeling of being naked, so removing clothing is actually a perfectly natural practice. This means that you don’t need to discourage or prohibit this behavior entirely, but should rather allow them to run around naked during allotted periods of time at home.Some good times for this relaxation include 30 minutes after bath time or right before naptime.
Even though your toddler is too young to understand social customs or guidelines of appropriateness, you can make it clear that nakedness is only okay at home through other means. Don’t ever allow naked time in the car, outside, or at another person’s house, and make getting dressed something clearly associated with leaving the house or seeing people from outside of the family.

, Your toddler is more likely to want to keep an outfit on if they had a hand in choosing it. When getting dressed in the morning, lay out two or three options of pants and tops and have them point to the one they want to wear. If they have a tried-and-true favorite in their wardrobe, let them wear it as often as you can clean it. You’ll improve the chances of a fully clothed day, while also encouraging your child to express themselves through sartorial choices.If your toddler needs some new clothes, have them come along with you when shopping. If they see, point to, or otherwise express interest in an item within your budget, purchase it!

, If your toddler enjoys fidgeting with clothing, they’re probably fiddling with their own clothes as the easiest and most accessible option. By giving them a doll and some removable clothing for it, you let them act out this interest on a toy instead of on themselves.If your toddler seems uninterested by this kind of dress-up, gather up a costume chest so that they can play dress-up with friends or siblings.

Consider using orthotics to treat hypotonia.,
Encourage your toddler to walk instead of crawl.,

All children are different, but it’s good to have a rough guideline of when most children make strides toward walking.


Most toddlers begin walking between 12 and 15 months.
Babies will have a step reflex between birth and 2 months. They will move their legs in a walking motion when held upright with their feet on a hard surface. This fades after 2 months.
At 3-4 months, children will begin lifting their upper body when lying on their stomach.
5 months brings bouncing while held in a standing position as well as beginning to support themselves by leaning forward on their arms when seated.
Children learn to sit unsupported between 6 and 9 months, and beginning crawling between 7 and 10 months. They will be able to stand if positioned where they can hold onto something like a table or chair, and begin “cruising,” or scooting their feet as they move along the edge of their support.
Pulling up into a standing position occurs between 9 and 12 months.;
, If your child is already sitting, crawling, pulling up and and cruising, he or she may be ready to walk. If they haven't conquered these skills yet, they will need a little time to work their way up to walking.

, Several muscles are involved in walking, so you can try some exercises to strengthen their core and legs to help prepare your child for walking.


Give your child some “tummy time.” Place your child on the floor on his stomach for about ten minutes at a time. Encourage your child to push up and propel his or herself forward by placing toys or treats just out of the child's reach.Try lying your child on his or her back on a balance ball and assisting the child in sit ups. Lie the child on their back, keeping a good grip so they don't fall. Tickle the baby's tummy and help bend the child back up into a sitting position on the ball.Hold your child in a standing position on a bouncy surface, like a balance ball, trampoline or soft bed. Holding the baby around the rib cage, lift them slightly off the surface and lower them back down, encouraging them to bounce and strengthen their leg muscles.

, If your child is developing in a typical fashion, these milestones will come naturally. Some children may take longer to reach each milestone. Have patience and encourage your child as he or she follows their own timeline.

, There are several reasons why your child may be falling behind, or be a delayed walker. Some children simply take longer than others and you likely have no reason to panic. If you are concerned about your child’s development, it is best to check with your doctor to find the cause of the delay.Hypotonia, sometimes referred to as “floppy infant,” is a decrease in muscle tone. There can be several causes of hypotonia, and it is best to check with your doctor for testing.Hypertonia is a stiffness in the muscles on either one or both sides of the body from increased muscle tone. This tends to appear around 2 to 3 months.Other causes can be related to delayed development. Consult your doctor to determine what may be hindering your toddler.

, Your pediatrician is the doctor who knows your child the best, but no one know your child better than you do. If you feel that your toddler is experiencing a delay, schedule an appointment of at least 30 minutes with your pediatrician to ask questions and request a referral to a specialist who can really explore your child’s development.Bring notes listing your child’s timeline and marking their developmental milestones.
Be prepared to talk about family medical history, anything you have noticed which has caused concern, and play patterns.
Keep a daily record of your child’s activities, diet and behavior for two weeks prior to the visit to see if you can notice any patterns.
Consider sending your daily notes and a letter explaining your concerns prior to the visit and asking your pediatrician to look over them before the appointment to prepare for the conversation.

, If you are a citizen of the United States of America, you could be eligible for Part C of the IDEA Act, which grants services to children up to two years old.Early intervention is more effective and less costly than addressing delays which have persisted.If your child has been diagnosed with a delay, begin intervention early for the most positive outcomes and quick results.

, Orthotics can give your toddler a support system as they are learning to walk. Orthotics can help align the feet as well as give your child the balance they need to begin walking., If your toddler seems to be on track to begin walking, encourage them to try. Your toddler may be tempted to crawl instead of walk, because it may be easier for them. Once your toddler has learned to pull themselves up to a standing position, try to get them to choose walking over crawling.Entice them with games, toys and treats.
Celebrate their attempts at walking.
Don’t try to make them walk when they don’t want to. This could create further resistance to walking.

, It is easiest for a toddler to grip the floor and find their balance when they are barefoot. Socks and shoes can be cumbersome. They can also create a distraction if they are brightly colored, causing the toddler to look down at the shoes instead of straight ahead., Set them down in a standing position. If you have been holding your child, when you set the toddler down, place them on their feet instead of a sitting position on the floor.


Start by supporting the toddler at the ribs as you encourage them to take steps, then move to supporting them at their hips to encourage core strength.
As they become more comfortable, just have a hand stretched toward them, to signify to the toddler that you will catch them if they tumble.

, A toddler may delay learning to walk if they are afraid of falling. Help alleviate this fear to encourage them to take steps on their own.Make a path with furniture. Line chairs along the wall to give the toddler something to hold on to. Make sure that the furniture is steady, can support the toddler and won't slide. Also avoid any furniture with sharp edges.
Eventually you can increase the distance between the pieces of furniture, requiring your toddler to take steps on their own to get from one piece to the next.

, Once your child begins cruising, give them a goal to encourage them to keep moving. Place objects like favorite toys or snacks out of the toddler's reach. Put the items on a chair, or dangle them in your hand to encourage them to stand and walk.


Place the chair with the treat near the furniture they are using for support, but far enough away that they will need to take some steps on their own in order to reach it.
You can also give them another person to walk toward.

, This is a huge success for your little one. Make sure that they know it by cheering and making happy noises.Once your child begins to walk, they may get very excited and move quickly into a run.

, The tide has turned against baby walkers and many people will warn you against using them due to delaying development of motor skills as well as high risk of injury to your toddler.Just 24 hours of using a walker can result in delays in excess of 3 days for walking and standing on their own.Walkers allow the toddler to move at a faster speed than normal, as well as giving them access to things they would not normally be able to reach.
Canada considers the use of walkers so dangerous, that they banned them in 2004.

, This is a product created to assist in supporting your toddler from the ribs rather than pulling up on their arms, which could lead to injuries.Strap the padded vest around the toddler’s ribs.
Hold a loop in each hand above each of the toddler’s shoulders.
Pulling up slightly to give the toddler support, begin moving them forward one step at a time.

, This will give your child something to hold onto as they explore moving around the house on their feet. They will have the support of an object which moves with them.Find a toy which is heavy enough to support your toddler and has a wide base for balance.
Start with a push toy. This will be easier for them to use and encourage them to move forward while looking straight ahead.
Consider a toy which is a miniature version of something your toddler has seen you use, like a mini shopping cart full of toys.
Pull toys, like wagons, are more complicated and can tempt the toddler to look behind them instead of where they are going. Make sure their path is cleared of obstacles.

Ease your toddler into playing alone.,
Let your child play.,
Alternate supervised and free play.,
Ensure that your house is childproofed.,
Create a routine.,
Play to your toddler's interests.,
Swap out your toddler's toys.,
Give your toddler access to entertainment.,
Try something new.,
Give age appropriate toys.,
Schedule a play date.",How to Teach Your Toddler Independent Play," If your toddler always expects you to play with them, they'll probably have trouble if you leave the room when they begin to play. To help your child become more comfortable with playing alone, ease your toddler into it.For example, you might start playing with your toddler. When your toddler is absorbed in playing, step back and let your child play alone. You should stay in the room, just don't engage in play.;
, You'll need to give your toddler space to play and imagine. If your child is playing with something, avoid jumping in and showing them the ""right"" way to play. This can make your child think that they need you to show them how to play and they'll be less likely to play on their own.Instead, just let your toddler play how they like. This might mean that your kitchen scoops become stacking blocks, but it's important for encouraging their imagination.

, Expect a balance between adult-led play time and physical activity with unstructured free play time. The National Association for Sports and Physical Education recommends that your toddler gets at least 30 minutes of structured play and at least 60 minutes of unstructured play every day.If you find that your toddler doesn't spend this much time playing independently, add unstructured play time gradually. You might try encouraging your child to play alone 5 minutes more every day.

, You may feel uncomfortable about letting your child play out of your sight if there are dangers in your home. Take the time to babyproof your house so your toddler can explore and play without fear of getting hurt. Consider creating a designated playroom or an area where your toddler is safe to play independently. Some things you can do to keep your toddler safe include:


Covering electrical outlets.
Latching doors.
Covering sharp corners with padding.
Keeping some doors closed.
Using baby gates.

, If your toddler struggles to play independently, try making a routine that includes small amounts of unstructured play time. You can keep these play times to a minimum at first (around 5 minutes). As you continue the routine, gradually increase the amount of time. Your toddler will be more likely to play alone if they know that that's usually what happens at the designated time.


For example, you might give your toddler lunch, read a story and then play a little. Once your toddler has begun to play, sit aside and let your little one play on their own.

, Your toddler may have a difficult time playing alone if they don't like what you've offered them to play with. Teach your toddler to play alone by giving them something that sparks their curiosity. They'll be more likely to play independently if they're trying to understand it.For example, if your toddler loves watching you put on your makeup or tries to get into your makeup bag, consider making a little toddler kit that contains brushes, small jars to open, and a little mirror.

, Kids can become bored with their toys, even if they loved them when they first got them. If your toddler has become more clingy and plays less with their toys, it might be time to put them away for a while. Bring out toys that your child hasn't played with in a while. Your toddler will probably be excited to see these ""new"" favorites return.


You should also keep toys to a minimum. If your toddler has too many toys out, they may feel overwhelmed and be less likely to play with them.

, Consider how easy it is for your toddler to get to their toys, art supplies, and books. If they're boxed away and stored out of your toddler's reach, it will be a lot harder for your toddler to simply start playing. You may want to keep several baskets with entertaining materials around your house so your toddler can easily play whenever they feel like it.For example, keep a basket of books next to a comfy seat that your child can crawl onto.

, If your toddler seems restless with their toys, it may be time to introduce something new. This doesn't mean you have to go out and buy a new toy. Instead, you could look around your house for an object that your child hasn't played with or experienced. It could be just the thing that your toddler wants to play with.


Look in your kitchen for ideas of objects that could easily entertain your toddler. Toddlers love scoops, plastic cookie cutters, funnels, and measuring spoons.

, Toddlers grow and develop at different rates. You may be surprised when your child learns a new skill almost overnight. To help your child play independently, ensure that they have toys that match their abilities. For example:For 12 to 24 month olds, you might set out push and pull toys, shape sorters and floor toys that they can scoot around.
For 24 to 36 month olds, set out imaginative toys like blocks, figures, cars, and dolls. You could also let your older toddler play in the yard while you supervise.

, Although toddlers don't often play with other children, they do parallel play alongside other toddlers. Meet up with another friend with a toddler so your children get a chance to play near each other. Over time, the toddlers will begin to play together (around age 3).


Make sure there are plenty of imaginative toys for the toddlers to play with. This way, they're less likely to fight over toys and they'll be able to play imaginatively.

Evaluate the situation.,
Don’t try to reason with an angry toddler.,
Try to distract them.,
Do something silly.,
Don’t give in.,
Control your temper.,
Give positive attention to reduce future tantrums.",How to Stop Toddler Temper Tantrums1," Take a few moments to consider the source of your child’s tantrum before reacting. Do you know what they are angry about? Are they scared or injured? The reason a child is upset will dictate how you handle the tantrum.


In some situations, it's best to just let the toddler go through their tantrum without giving them too much attention. This is particularly true when you know your child is throwing a tantrum to try and manipulate you into giving them what they want. If you can see that your child is really losing it, it may be best to just leave them be.
If your child is crying because something frightened them or because they are very overwhelmed by a situation, you shouldn’t ignore them. In this situation, they need your comfort to feel secure.;
, Trying to reason with a toddler in the midst of a major meltdown won’t do any good. They are simply too caught up in their own emotions to listen to you, or understand what you are trying to say. Their reaction may not make sense to you, but keep in mind that toddlers don’t have the same reasoning and coping skills that you have as an adult. They are just reacting in a way that makes sense for them.


Understand that this doesn’t mean you should just walk off and leave your child by themselves if it wouldn’t be safe to do so. For example, you don’t want to leave them sitting on the floor in the middle of a busy grocery store.
On the other hand, if you are in the safety of your home, you might let your child have their meltdown alone in their room. Giving them their space when it is safe to do so is a good way to give you both time to deal with your emotions without engaging in a battle.

, If you catch it before your child goes into total meltdown, distracting them may help avoid the problem altogether. If they are already throwing a tantrum, a distraction could help them calm down more quickly. Use something that you know they will be interested in. If you are going to go somewhere where a tantrum is likely, be sure to throw a few items for distraction into your bag before you leave home.If there are signs that a tantrum is about to begin, pull out one of the items and say, “Look what I have here! Would you like to play with it?” If they nod, then hand it to them. If they shake their head, try a different item.
If your child is already having a tantrum, you can try the same thing, though it may be more difficult to get them to focus on what you are offering.
Small toys and healthy snacks are good items for distraction.

, It isn’t too hard to get a toddler to laugh. Try doing something silly to help your child focus on something other than their anger. Laughter also releases chemicals in the brain that help your child feel better about the situation.For example, if you are at a store, hide for a few seconds behind something, then pop out with a big smile and say, “Boo!” You could also try making silly faces or talking in a funny voice.

, When your child is in the midst of a tantrum, the easiest thing to do will be to give in, especially if you are in a public place and feeling embarrassed. However, you should avoid giving in no matter how embarrassed or frustrated you feel. This is because giving in teaches your child that a tantrum gets them what they want, which means that the next time you tell them they can’t have something they want, they’ll use this technique again.If you are feeling very embarrassed try leaving the situation before it gets worse. For example, if you are at the grocery store and your child throws a tantrum the second you walk in the door, you might consider putting off the shopping until later in the day. It may be frustrating, but it will be less frustrating than dealing with a cranky toddler throughout the shopping trip.

, Parenting is a tough job, and sometimes the best thing you can do is just walk away if the situation permits. If you are feeling like you are about to lose your temper, remove yourself from the situation. If you are at home, let your child have their meltdown in a safe space, and go to another room where you can calm down for a few minutes. If you are in public, take your child to the car, put them in their seat, and spend a few minutes taking deep breaths outside the car while you calm down.Many recommend taking slow, deep breaths while counting to ten in order to calm down.
If at any point you feel like you might harm your child because you are too angry, call someone to come help you. Call your partner or a trusted friend or family member who can come watch your toddler for awhile. Most parents will go through an experience where they lose it at some point or another. Expecting this possibility, and knowing how you will handle it is the best thing you can do.

, If the only way your child can get your attention is by throwing a tantrum, then they will use this as a means to get what they really want from you. Therefore, it is important that you give them attention when they’re behaving well. When you notice that they are behaving well, give them lots of cuddles and love. Don’t reserve your undivided attention for negative behavior.For example, if you go to the store and your child doesn’t throw a tantrum, take them to the park to play for a few minutes or let them pick out a healthy treat. This will show them that good behavior has good consequences.

"
"
Pick your battles.,
Set clear boundaries for behavior.,
Put your child in time out.,
Resist the temptation to spank your child.",How to Stop Toddler Temper Tantrums2," This is an important thing to remember when you have a toddler. If you are constantly telling your child that they can’t do something, can’t have something, or can’t touch something, they are going to feel like they have no control and no autonomy, and they are going to throw a fit. Therefore, before you automatically say “no” to something, think about why you are saying that. If it isn’t that big of a deal to you, then let them have it.One way you can give your child a sense of control is to let them have more choices. For example, you can pick out a few outfits, and then let them choose what they want to wear. At dinner time, give them a couple of options, and then let them choose which one they want to have. These are small things that won’t make too much difference to you but will make your toddler feel like they’ve got some control over what happens to them.

, It is important for your child’s development that you set clear boundaries for what is expected from them. This doesn’t mean that you set boundaries as a dictator, but rather that you show them that you’re setting limits that are there to protect them. When you set a limit for your toddler, think carefully about why you are setting that limit. In some cases, you may find that you are setting limits that aren’t really necessary.Limits related to your toddler’s safety are important, as are limits related to treating other people respectfully. When you set a limit for safety, make sure you do this with empathy.
For example, you can say to your child, “When we are crossing the street together, I expect you to hold my hand the entire time. I know this can be boring for you. You want to run around and play, but there are cars in the street. If you run into the street, you may get hurt. Let's practice looking for cars together.”

, The timeout is a well-known way to discipline a child for negative behavior. For many children, it is also an effective way. If your child is throwing a tantrum, place them in a safe spot that is away from dangerous objects and toys, and within your view. Give your child one warning, and explain what will happen if they don’t comply. If they continue, pick them up and put them in the time out. Turn on a timer for the amount of time you specified. For toddlers, a time out should usually last just a few minutes.


When the time out is over, ask your child if they are ready to talk with you. Don’t force them to do anything if they just want to sit there for a while longer.Be sure that you give one warning. If your child is throwing a tantrum, you can say, “If you don’t stop this tantrum, you’ll have to have a time out for two minutes.” If they continue, put them in the time out immediately. Don’t keep warning them without taking action. The toddler will catch on that you don’t really mean it, and your warnings won’t mean anything.

, When your child is in the middle of a major tantrum, it can be tempting to use spanking as a means of discipline, especially if you were spanked as a child. There is plenty of research demonstrating that not only does spanking not reduce the unwanted behavior, it can also cause more serious issues that can last a lifetime. For example, children who are spanked are more likely to have behavioral problems or experience mental illness.Children who are spanked have similar issues to children who are victims of more “serious” forms of physical abuse such as slapping, punching, and shoving. Though it is not always placed in the same playing field, spanking is as detrimental to your child as any other form of physical abuse, and should not be used for discipline.
Try giving your child a firm hug when they are having a tantrum. This display of your affection for them and the comfort from the hug may be enough to stop the tantrum or at least calm your child down a bit.

"
"
Show your child other ways to communicate.,
Speak to your child calmly.,
Avoid making your child feel bad for having emotions.",How to Stop Toddler Temper Tantrums3," Many toddlers haven’t mastered communication yet so it can be very frustrating for them if they can’t make you understand what they want. For this reason, many parents have taught their children some basic sign language that can help them communicate their wishes. If you don’t want to teach them this, you can also try alternative ways to try and understand what they are asking for.For example, if you can see that your child wants something but you don’t understand what, try asking them to show you. If they point in a direction, look where they’re pointing to see if you can figure it out. If you’re still having a hard time, let them walk in the direction they were pointing to see if they will show you exactly what they’re asking for.
For example, some parents teach their children the signs for things that they often ask for (e.g. milk, water, food, bathroom, a nap, a toy, a movie, etc.).
It can sometimes be helpful to put yourself in their shoes. How would you feel if you wanted or needed something, but couldn’t find the right way to help someone understand?

, If your child senses that you are angry, it will only make the situation worse. Instead of yelling or talking in an angry voice, talk with you child calmly. Put your hands gently on your child’s shoulders, and ask them to tell you what they need from you.Children are greatly influenced by their environment. If you are able to remain calm and collected, they will be more likely to calm down quickly.

, There is value in a temper tantrum if you look for it. A tantrum offers an opportunity for you to help your child understand how they should behave when they are feeling negative emotions. Your child will have many emotions throughout their life. Hopefully the good will outweigh the bad, but they will definitely have negative emotions. Thus, you shouldn’t simply tell your child that they were bad for behaving that way. Instead, of pointing out that their behavior was bad, try helping them see healthier ways to express their frustration.


For example, if your child threw a tantrum because they didn’t get the toy they wanted at the store, try to empathize with them when they have calmed down. For example, you can say, “I understand why you’re mad. It’s hard when we don’t get what we want, but yelling and screaming doesn’t really help, does it? Maybe next time you are feeling angry you can try telling me why you’re mad instead of screaming.”

"
"
Remember that all tantrums occur for one reason.,
Avoid setting the situation up for failure.,
Understand that some children are more sensitive than others.,
Contact your health care provider.",How to Stop Toddler Temper Tantrums4," If a toddler is having a tantrum, it is because they didn’t get something they want or because something happened that they didn’t want to happen. If your child hasn’t mastered communication, they might throw a tantrum out of frustration. For kids who can communicate, a tantrum is their way of trying to gain control over a situation where they aren’t getting the result that they wanted.Keeping this in mind can help keep you from taking a tantrum as a sign that you are doing something wrong. As a parent, it is your responsibility to know what is good for your child and what isn’t. Thus, if they are throwing a tantrum because they aren’t getting what they want all the time, you can remind yourself that you are simply looking out for their best interest, even if they don’t agree.

, A child who is tired, bored, hungry, overstimulated or any combination of these is primed to throw a temper tantrum. This is just the same as adults. You are probably more likely to snap at your partner when you are very hungry or very tired. Thus, try not to maintain a schedule that makes it likely that your child will be in a bad mood.For example, don’t plan a big shopping trip, which is probably very boring for your child, if they haven’t had lunch or a nap. The second your child doesn’t get what they want they are almost definitely going to throw a tantrum.

, Children who are more sensitive are more likely to throw major tantrums. This is because they feel their emotions very deeply, and thus, feel angrier when they don’t get what they want. However, if you teach your child to use their emotions in a healthy way, this sensitivity can work to your toddler’s advantage later on.Keep in mind that many of the things your child does, they do as a means to figure out how the world works. They throw a tantrum out of frustration or anger, but also to see if it will get them what they want out of the situation.

, If your child is throwing tantrums more and more frequently, more intensely, or for longer periods, you should contact your doctor to see if there may be a more serious cause. You can also talk to your doctor about healthy ways to deal with the tantrums.Though tantrums aren’t typically caused by something serious, your child may throw extreme/frequent tantrums if they cannot see or hear properly, or if they have a learning disability.
If you are feeling that you cannot control your own anger, you should also contact your doctor. Don’t feel embarrassed. Instead, feel proud of yourself for accepting your limitations and finding a way to deal with your own emotions more effectively.

, Do not frighten them with this. Just explain so they understand how to do it. Have them show you how they are going to do it so you know they can actually do it. Doing is a better learning tool than listening.

Ask them to stamp particular shapes to help them learn the difference between them.If you already have foam shape blocks lying around, you can use these instead of cutting or purchasing your own sponges.

, Some toddlers might not be ready to use a paintbrush, but their fingers are the perfect tools for learning shapes with paint. Use a heavyweight paper that is glossy on both sides as this will prevent the paper from absorbing the paint. You can purchase this along with nontoxic, kid-friendly finger paint from most discount retailers, online merchants, and even some grocery stores. Ask your child to paint different shapes using their fingers., There’s a good chance you have a chalkboard in your house. This is a great opportunity to help your toddler learn shapes. Take a piece of chalk and draw a circle on the chalkboard. Tell your toddler that the shape is a circle. Ask her to draw her own circle beside yours.

, Use cardboard to make circle cutouts in several different sizes. Help your child trace circles onto different colors of paper using the cardboard cutouts. Punch a hole through the center of each colored paper circle. Create a circle necklace by putting a piece of yarn through the middle of each colored circle to create a rainbow circle necklace., Using construction paper, draw and cut out a large triangle to serve as the base for the triangle tree. Then help your toddler draw lots of small triangles on other pieces of construction paper. Cut out these triangles. Finally, help your toddler paste the small triangles on the larger one to make a triangle tree.

Think about your own involvement in developing a playgroup.,
Meet new families.,
See whether there are any good playgroups in your region.,
Decide where you'll meet.,
Organize the items needed for each meet-up.,
Set up a safe play area for the toddlers.,
Set a time limit.,
Advertise the toddler group once you get it started.",How to Start a Toddler Play Group," If you're going to be in charge of this group, there are some important things to consider:


Are you really ready to do this? Have you thought through whether you are the right person to be in charge of rounding up people, funds and sending out meet-up notices? It's not everyone's cup of tea but for the organizing type of person, it's pure joy.
Do you have enough time? Consider the work, child raising, volunteering, household commitments that you already have. Will the playgroup fit in with all that easily or will it be just one more burden and feel like over-commitment? Be honest with yourself.
Will you be okay with use of your house if needs be, at least to begin with?
Is your spouse happy for you to take on this responsibility? Will your spouse help?
Is your toddler old enough to be sociable with other toddlers (make sure they know not to hit or fight etc).;
, Hold a picnic, barbecue or in-house event to get to know both the parents and their children in your local area. Introduce people to your idea ask them if they think it is a good idea and if they would bring their kids to it. Find out whether they're interested in participating in the formation of a toddler playgroup in your area. If at least four to five sets of parents think it's a good idea, you've got enough to form a group.


Find out which parents would like to be actively involved in setting up the group and which parents would rather just use the services of the playgroup. Don't force people to agree to help; those people will only end up letting you down and it's far better to be realistic and rely on the enthusiastic ones instead. You can ping the non-helpers for finances or other resources later––they'll usually be happy to excuse their non-participation in this way!

, These existing groups will serve as a useful resource and source of information for you to learn from. Ask to see those who run the playgroup and ask plenty of questions on how to run such a playgroup.

, In the warmer months, the local park or botanical gardens will work well. However, for rainy days and cold days, you'll need somewhere indoors and safe. This could include:


Your own homes, and other parent's homes, on a rotating basis.
Cafes or restaurants that are happy for parents and young children to be there.
Community centers or halls, council or municipal rooms, library rooms, etc.
A school room.
Some other suitable venue.


Also consider which places are not suitable. You'll need to have reasons why they're not suitable in case any parent insists they're a great idea, often for reasons of their own convenience or relationships. For example, an office building in the city center might help someone working there but provide great frustration for everyone else; or, a place that needs to be paid for might suit some parents but cause other parents to turn away as they can't afford it.







, This could include a traveling container of toys that everyone has contributed to, a plate of food from each parent attending and something interesting to talk about each time, for the parents.


Ensure that there are drinks and snacks, whether people bring these or the host offers them on a rotating basis.
Suggest things to talk about, such as a latest child raising manual, a story on TV or ideas for child raising in difficult times. Having some ideas to get everyone talking can help make it both enjoyable and useful for the parents.

, The key things to bear in mind include:


It must be safe. Homes of parents with small children are usually already childproofed, but assume nothing and ask first.
It must be viewable by parents. Parents like to keep an eye on young children while playing.
Ideally, have a quiet space for upset or tired toddlers to retreat to for a nap. Have a baby monitor in the space. If out and about, set up a circle of strollers and carry beds just for this purpose, such as under a shady tree or in a quiet corner of a cafe.

, The best time is around one to two hours and no longer. Don't make it so short that everyone sets up and then feels they have to leave again, and don't make it so long that everyone, parents included, gets cranky and can't wait to leave.


Be flexible about arrival and departure times. Insisting everyone be there on time or leave only at the allotted time will lose members of the group. Remember that some parents will be shy, tired, depressed, busy, needing to pick up other kids, get the groceries, whatever. Assume nothing and give people the freedom to come and go as needed. It's not the business of the playgroup to be judgmental.
Avoid choosing a time when the toddlers are likely to be sleepy. Weekday mornings are often best, as the toddlers will be full of energy and no school-aged kids need to be collected. Weekends also offer lots of flexibility but may be constrained by family needs coming first.

, Make flyers, put notices on Facebook and ask friends and family to spread the word."

Ask yourself whether your toddler is fake crying to get attention.,
Think about whether your toddler is fake crying to get their own way.,
Be aware that your toddler may be fake crying as a way to express themselves.,
Consider whether your toddler is fake crying as a reaction to changes in their routine.,
Try to ignore the crying.,
Ask your child what's wrong.,
Distract the child from their fake crying.,
Call them out on their fake crying.,
Discipline your child if the fake crying continues.,
Create a calm environment.,
Don't overreact when your child fake cries.",How to Stop Your Toddler from Fake Crying," Toddlers fake cry for a variety of reasons, but it most often is to get a reaction from their parents. When you understand why they are fake crying, you can tailor your reaction to meet their needs.


Many toddlers fake cry to get attention if they are competing with other siblings. Some toddlers begin fake crying at the birth of a young sibling or if they are often around infants. They see parents attending to the needs of a crying baby and think they have to cry to get attention as well.
If this is the case, make sure to give your toddler some undivided attention at a certain time each day and teach them that they can be rewarded with attention for good behavior, not bad.;
, If a toddler wants something, like a new toy, and a parent isn’t giving in, many toddlers will begin to fake cry and cause a scene.


This often happens in public, where toddlers realize they have other people on their side by creating a stir in front of an audience. Toddlers are at the age where they realize the power their actions have over other people, and they are realizing they can manipulate people with different actions.
By fake crying, they are trying to use their actions to purposefully get what they want.

, Fake crying is also common in less verbal children who have difficult time expressing themselves. Teach your child the importance of words and that you will only respond to their words, not their fake tears.

, Children who have experienced changes, such as divorce, moving to a new house, or getting a new pet, sibling or babysitter, are also more prone to fake crying. In these instances, the fake crying will usually stop once they get back into a routine.

, Fake tears are often a phase which can be eliminated by simply ignoring your child’s crying. Check to make sure they aren’t hurt or in danger, but then leave them alone. Without a reaction, most children will stop fake crying.


Any action that regularly gets a response from parents will be repeated over and over. To nip things in the bud, never respond to your child’s fake tears. Once you respond, the habit is much more difficult for toddlers to break.
If ignoring your child doesn’t work and the crying continues to get worse and worse, it is time to take action. Simple responses to fake crying can teach your child that it doesn’t give them the reaction they want and that there are other ways to get attention.

, Younger toddlers have a hard time expressing their emotions, and fake crying may be an easier way for them to get attention and react to a problem.


If this is the case, try to calm your child down by asking questions like “Are you OK?” and “What’s the matter?”
Simple questions can encourage your child to talk about the issue instead of just faking tears.

, If your child is throwing a fake crying tantrum and can’t be stopped, try distracting him with a question, or a funny song or story.


If you ask the child a riddle or a question or sing their favorite song, most children will stop what they are doing to join in.
Before you know it, you can have a happy and tear-free child.

, Sometimes, you can stop your child's fake crying by calling them out on the fact that they're faking it.


In a calm but stern voice, say things like “I know those aren’t real tears” or “Are you just trying to wake your sister?”.
Done on occasion, calling a toddler out can surprise them enough to snap them out of the fake tears.

, If fake crying becomes a regular problem that isn’t going away, sit your child down and explain to him the proper way to get attention. Tell him that crying is only for emergencies or when they are sad or hurt. Establish clear rules about not fake crying, and then follow through with the consequences.


Use your judgment to determine the right discipline for your child—if could be taking away a favorite toy or limiting the time they can spend with their friends.
When a child sees that fake crying gets them negative attention, they are more likely to stop.

, Fake crying is less likely to occur in a calm and attentive environment. That isn’t to say that parents with calm homes never have toddlers who fake cry, but it can help minimize the occurrence.


Create an environment where your child feels loved and appreciated. Set aside a certain time everyday to have one-on-one time with your child and establish a connection with him.
If he sees he gets your attention for a certain activity or time each day, he may be less likely to fake cry to get your attention.

, Staying calm when your child fake cries will also help them grow out of the phase more quickly.


Even if you ignore the crying and talk to them about something else, a toddler will be able to tell if you are stressed or angry by your face or your voice.
Stay calm and positive to encourage them to move to a different activity.

Take note of their curiosity.,
See if they have an exceptional memory.,
Observe their ability to concentrate.,
Notice a creatively gifted child.,
Notice if they are gifted mathematicians.,
See if your toddler is reading above their grade level.,
Observe their competency with technology.,
Consider their problem solving abilities.",How to Spot a Gifted Toddler1," Your child may be gifted if they are intensely curious about the world around them. If they show curiosity through touch, smell or verbally, they may be gifted. For example, see if they ask a lot of questions about the world. Examples include the following questions:“Why is the sky blue?”
“Where did I come from?”
“Why are there homeless people?”;
, If your toddler can remember information very quickly or after hearing a fact or a word for the first time, they may be gifted. The ability to remember and learn quickly are characteristic traits of gifted children.Observe their memory in comparison to others of the same age:If they remember where a toy is hidden, it could be a sign of a good memory.
If they remember times and places better than other toddlers, they may have an exceptional memory. If you are not familiar with the types of things other toddlers remember, then you can always do some research to find out what is normal for the age.

, You should take notice if your toddler is able to focus on one subject for an extended period of time. If your child is easily absorbed and motivated to learn about a particular subject, they may be gifted.If your toddler stays interested in a story for a long time, they may have exceptional focus. Most babies will lose interest in a story after a short time.
If your toddler gets interested in dogs and becomes very absorbed and focused on the different types of dogs and their characteristics, showing an exceptional knowledge in a short period of time, it could be a sign of exceptional concentration and motivation to learn.

, See if your child shows signs of exceptional creativity. Your child may be absent-minded but intensely creative, which is another trait of a gifted child. See if they exhibit any of the following signs of exceptional creativity:Tells original stories.
Thinks of new solutions to old problems.

If they imagine complex situations during play, they may be creatively gifted.They may have imaginary friends.

, If you see that your toddler notices that “26” and “62” contain the same numbers or has an above-average capacity for multiplication tables for their age, they may be gifted in the math department. Try playing some math games with them to observe their capacities in this area.


If your toddler can count in multiple languages, they may be gifted.For example, you could play a matching game with your toddler and observe their abilities.If your baby can add or subtract numbers, they may well be gifted., If your kid is reading far above their grade level, they may very well be gifted. If your kid is reading a few books a week and actually comprehending the material, they may be gifted., See if your child has an intuitive sense of technology such as radios or computers. If they learn very quickly how to use a new software program or enjoy tinkering with radios, they may have an advanced perceptual and technological capacity., A child who excels at solving problems may also be gifted, especially since this is a frequently used definition of giftedness. Pay attention to your child’s ability to solve puzzles and other types of complex problems.

Watch for signs of leadership.,
Listen for exceptional communication skills.,
Observe their ability to think ahead.",How to Spot a Gifted Toddler2," One of the signs of a gifted child is exceptional leadership, including independent and critical thinking.

Ask for a reference from your child’s preschool or daycare.,
Obtain an IQ test.,
Remember that a high IQ does not equate to other virtues.,
Avoid putting too much pressure on your child.,
Get achievement testing.,
Find out if your toddler meets local giftedness qualifications.",How to Spot a Gifted Toddler3," Your preschool or daycare should be able to give you a reference for a health professional that offers appropriate giftedness testing services.However, keep in mind that IQ or giftedness testing will probably not be covered by insurance unless a developmental delay is expected.


If you cannot get a reference from your child’s daycare, you could ask your pediatrician.

, An IQ test can help you determine the appropriate educational needs of your toddler, as well as confirm your suspicions about their intelligence. IQ testing is less good at identifying creative and leadership abilities.Consider getting an IQ test if you need one for entry into a special program of education. However, if you don’t need one for educational purposes, you may want to just wait and see. In this decision, you should consider their age:If your child is two or three years of age, you should hold off on IQ testing. There are many challenges with IQ testing with younger toddlers, so it may not be worth the trouble.
If your child is over four years old, you may want to get their IQ tested for a specific education program.
Be sure to consider your motive for wanting this test. For example, is it to benefit your child, satisfy your own curiosity, or due to a desire for a gifted child? If it is for the benefit of your child or out of curiosity, then these are appropriate reasons to test. If you are hoping that your child is gifted, then this might not be a good reason to test.

, You should take your child’s IQ score for what it is, rather than thinking that it equates to other virtues such as wisdom or good decision-making skills. If your child has a high IQ, you will need to nurture their decision-making skills and overall cognitive and emotional development. It is important to avoid pressuring them to succeed above and beyond their peers, which often backfires in unexpected ways such as excessive worrying, stress and poor life choices.Be sure to give your child access to tools to help them thrive and excel, but also allow them to be who they are going to be. It is okay to have some expectations, but your child’s mental and emotional health should be equally important.

, If your child has a high IQ, you may develop high expectations for their performance. If this is the case, you want to communicate your support for their success and development with praise, rather than only giving negative feedback when they fail to live up to expectations. If you find yourself giving your child a lot of negative feedback because of your high expectations of their performance, you may be putting too much pressure on them.Keep in mind that failure is an important part of your child’s growth and development.

, Achievement tests determine whether your child is particularly advanced within a particular subject area relative to their peers. These tests include subject specific and standardized tests. There are also achievement tests designed specifically for finding gifted students, such as the Test of Mathematical Abilities for Gifted Students. Ask your child’s school about possible tests.Be sure to ask your child’s school officials what this kind of testing would do for your child and how it would enable you to help them.

, Multiple competing definitions of the term “giftedness” exist. Definitions may differ between countries and regions. So, you should look on your Department of Education website to find out what definition of “gifted” is used in your region. Based on this information, see if your child meets the definition and guidelines for giftedness at their school.You could phone your child’s school to find out how they understand the term.
If your child is in a private school, you should give them a ring to find out how they understand giftedness.

Set up a play room or play area for your child.,
Install a baby gate in your kitchen doorway.,
Give your child safe toys to play with.,
Remove vases and other fragile objects.,
Keep any dangerous chemicals out of reach or locked up.,
Avoid keeping any toxic plants in your home.,
Protect your toddler from the fireplace.,
Don’t allow your toddler to play with your purse.","How to Set Up a Safe, Secure Space for Toddlers1"," Pick a room or area in your house that will be designated as your toddler’s space to play in. Remove all dangerous or sharp objects from the room and fill the space with safe toys.


Set the room or space apart from the rest of the house by securing it with a baby gate.;
, The kitchen can be very dangerous to your child because it is filled with this that can burn, cut or injure your toddler. To prevent your child from getting into the kitchen, put a baby gate in the doorway of the kitchen to keep your child out.


Having a gate can also be useful because you can work in the kitchen and keep an eye on your child in the next room, as baby gates keep you from having to shut the kitchen door.

, Give your child a toy that is adapted to your child’s specific age. In particular, look for soft toys that don’t have any small parts that could break off. The toy should also be free of sharp parts that could cut your child.

, If your child were to knock something over, like a vase, that shatters, your child could get cut. Because of this, it is important to remove breakable objects from the reach of your child.


If you put the breakable objects out of reach of your child, make sure that they are on a stable surface that your child cannot move. For example, if the vase were put on a table that could be moved around easily, your child might lean on the table and accidentally cause the vase to fall and shatter. Instead, put the vase on something sturdy.

, Chemicals can be very dangerous because your child could swallow them, and some can be very toxic. Household products often contain sulfuric and phosphoric acid, chlorine, ammonia, formaldehyde and phenol. To keep these chemicals out of the reach of your child:


Close the door of the room containing the chemicals. If you cannot close the door for some reason, make sure you put all the chemicals out of the reach your children.
Paints and varnishes can also be extremely toxic and should be kept away from children or avoided.

, There are some household plants that can actually be toxic if eaten. Because of this, it is important to make sure that all of your houseplants are not toxic, in case your toddler decides to chew on a leaf. Some of these toxic household plants include:


Aloe Vera, Burn Plant, Chrysanthemums, Cyclamen, Heart leaf philodendron, Philodendron, and Azaleas.
Additionally, do not use stones as decorations because your child could try to eat the stones, or could fall and injure him or herself on the stones.

, Put a fence or grate around the fireplace and put padding on all the sharp edges and corners. If your child tends to play near the fireplace, you may want to consider not using the fireplace until the child has grown up a bit and knows not to go near or try to touch the fire.

, An often overlooked source of poisoning is the over-the-counter medications or prescriptions that some women keep in their purses for when they are away from home. Adult strength medications can be very detrimental to the small body of a toddler.


Toddlers should never be allowed to play with purses, even though it may seem cute, because one person’s purse might be full of safe things for a toddler to play with, but someone else’s might not be.

Purchase special doorknob covers.,
Keep doors locked, particularly if they lead outside.,
Pad the corners and edges of coffee tables.,
Tie up the cords on curtains, shades and blinds.,
Move any furniture away from the window.,
Avoid using light-weight furniture.","How to Set Up a Safe, Secure Space for Toddlers2"," Because toddlers are so inquisitive, they may try to open doors. If your front door is unlocked and your child opens it, he or she could wander out into the world. To prevent this, you can buy special child-proof doorknob covers that will keep your child from opening the door.


These covers usually need to be squeezed from two sides in order to grip the doorknob and allow it to be turned. Toddlers cannot wrap their small hands around the covers and squeeze them sufficiently to turn the knob.
However, these covers should not be the only method used to keep toddlers from getting out of the home. Some ingenious toddlers figure out how to bypass these covers by inserting their finger into the hole in the cover and manipulating the doorknob or actually managing to remove the doorknob cover entirely.

, An added measure of security on doors is to lock them, preferably using two locks. Any doors that could lead to danger for toddlers should be locked. This includes doors to stairs and balconies as well as any other rooms that pose a hazard.

, Although coffee tables are functional and look nice, they are also the cause of many head injuries to toddlers that fall near them. If you would prefer not to remove the coffee table from the room, you can pad the edges and corners with a soft material. This can be done with special soft, plastic corner protectors that you can generally purchase at home furnishing stores. There are also protective strips that can be used along the side edges of the coffee table.

, One strangulation hazard that many people overlook is the pull cords on curtains, shades, and blinds. These long strings are usually hidden from sight, but toddlers are notorious for finding things that they are not supposed to find.


There are special cord holders that wind the cord up short and keep it securely hidden in a plastic case so it stays out of reach. You can purchase these at your local home furnishing store.

, Kids generally love to climb so keep your child from climbing up to the window by moving your furniture around. Move any furniture that is near a window so that your child cannot reach the window and accidentally fall out


Consider getting a lock that does not let you open the window more than a few inches. This way the child will not be able to open the windows and drop through it.

, Sometimes, light-weight furniture that has hard surfaces can cause injuries. Toddlers might try to use the furniture to assist them in standing or try to climb up onto the furniture. Their weight causes the furniture to topple and sometimes fall onto the toddler.

"
"
Secure unused wall outlets with safety plugs.,
Place heavy furniture in front of electrical sockets that are in use.,
Tuck electrical cords out of the way.","How to Set Up a Safe, Secure Space for Toddlers3"," Safety plugs are little plastic pieces with prongs that slide safely into outlets. They work to keep your child from sticking his or her fingers into the outlet and getting electrocuted.These safety plugs should fit rather snugly so they are difficult for little hands to pry out.

, Where electrical outlets are in use, parents can try to rearrange the room so that there are heavy pieces of furniture in front of the outlets. This will prevent the toddlers from getting to the outlets, pulling the cords out, and inserting something else into the outlet, like their fingers.

, One strangulation hazard that isn’t often considered is electrical cords. They should always be kept out of a toddlers reach by tucking them in behind furniture as much as possible. These cords can also cause other harm if the toddler pulls the cord hard enough to make the attached device fall onto them.

Consider introducing your child to cups when she turns six months old.,
Switch your child’s formula when she turns one.,
Pick a time to stop bottle feeding your child.,
Tell your toddler about your plans.",How to Stop Bottle Feeding Toddlers1," While your child might not be able to completely drink from a cup independently, beginning at this age will help her to become familiar with the cup.Consider giving your baby a sippy cup to play with in order to get her familiar with the object.;
, At around one year of age, your child can begin drinking cow’s milk rather than formula. At the same time, you can introduce your child to drinking out of the cup (rather than just playing with it). Giving your child a new cup and a new drink at the same time may help her to make the transition.


If you notice any rash, redness, difficulty breathing, vomiting, or diarrhea when you give your child cow’s milk, consult your doctor right away. Your child may have an allergy to milk.

, If your child is stressed for some reason, such as that you just moved to a new house, you may want to delay taking away the bottles entirely, as this could cause further stress. Instead, wait for a time when your baby is in a good mood and generally stress free.Do not switch your baby entirely to cups if she is sick or just beginning preschool.

, When you include your child in your plans, she will most likely be more receptive to them. Talk to your child about how she will have to start using a cup soon because she is a ‘big girl’ now.Speak positively about the cup, and say that the bottle is only for babies.
If you have an older child, ask him or her to talk to your toddler about how big kids use cups. Your younger child may be more inclined to emulate her older sibling.

"
"
Reduce the frequency that you give your child bottles.,
Figure out what your toddler really wants when she demands her bottle.,
Remove the bottle from view.,
Do not let your child carry around a bottle.,
Help your child to throw a bottle away.,
Change your child’s routine.",How to Stop Bottle Feeding Toddlers2," During the first week of transition, take away one bottle-fed meal. If possible, take away the morning bottle feed and replace the bottle with milk from a cup or a different kind of food.During the next week, take away an afternoon bottle.
The last bottle to go should be the dinner or bedtime bottle. Wait to do this until your child has accepted not receiving bottles in the morning or afternoon.

, If your toddler insists on the bottle, do not give up. Find out what your toddler really wants; often, your toddler will ask for the bottle because she wants comfort, not because she actually wants to drink her formula. If this is the case, soothe and comfort her yourself.If your child is hungry or thirsty, offer her something to eat or drink without the bottle.
If your child refuses both comfort or other food or drink, give her the bottle. Do not force her; weaning your child off the bottle will be a gradual process. Instead, talk to her some more about why you want her to drink from a cup.

, When you decide to start transitioning your child off of using bottles, make sure to hide them completely (or throw them away) so that your child does not get reminded of the bottle and begin demanding it again.

, This is important to enforce as soon as you begin feeding your child with a bottle; the bottle should be used only for feeding during meals. If your child is allowed to carry the bottle around, it may begin to represent something other than feeding.If your child already carries a bottle around, offer her some other comforting object, like a toy or blanket.

, You can make a big deal about this process. Let your child throw the bottle into the trash and say goodbye to it. Doing this will help your child to know that there are no more bottles.


If it is around a holiday, such as Christmas, you can help your child to put all of the bottles into a box to leave for Santa Claus. Tell your child that Santa will replace the bottles with a gift.
Alternatively, you could have your child leave the bottles for the ‘Bottle Fairy’. Have the fairy leave a comforting gift for your child.

, If the bottle was part of your child’s bedtime routine, replace the bottle with something interesting, like reading a picture book, or singing a song. You can also offer your child milk in a cup when she would normally get her bottle.

Choose the right cup.,
Make sure the liquid will be easy to drink out of the cup.,
Be positive about the change.,
Use your child’s drinks to your advantage.,
Be a good role model by drinking from your own cup.",How to Stop Bottle Feeding Toddlers3," Look for a cup that has handles so that your child has an easier time holding it. The cup should be made of a lightweight material like plastic. The cup should have a lid so that spills are avoided (for the most part).


Look for a cup that is made of bright colors, or has a picture of your child’s favorite movie or book character on it. When the cup has something on it that your child likes, your child will be more inclined to use it.

, Try to drink from the cup before you give it to your child. If your child tries to drink out of it, only to find that the liquid doesn’t flow easily out of the cup, then she may become frustrated and ask for her bottle again., Introduce the cup with enthusiasm. Present it as a cool tool that big kids use to drink. Praise your child whenever she uses the cup, and tell her how impressed you are.


Consider rewarding your child when she uses the cup. Give her hugs, take her to the park, or reward her with a healthy snack. Do this only at the beginning when you are trying to help your child accept the cup as a habit. Over time, replace the reward with praise only.

, When your child is still drinking out of both a bottle and a cup, begin diluting the milk in the bottle so that the milk in the cup tastes better. Your child will most likely begin asking for the cup more often than the bottle.Give your child her favorite drinks in a cup, while only sticking to water or drinks she doesn’t like as much from the bottle.

, Children often copy what they see their parents doing. Pour milk into your own cup and show your child how you drink it. Offer a cup of milk to your child at the same time. Show your child how to lift the cup.Help your child by showing your child how to grasp the cup and lift it to her mouth.

Never leave your baby unattended in the playpen.",How to Set Up a Safe Playpen," Playpens are most useful for babies from about six to seven months old, just when they are beginning to crawl. However, you should feel free to buy a playpen before your baby reaches this age, so she can get used to it early.;
, Make a list of the reasons you would need a playpen. Where and when do you intend you use it? Is it just for use on vacation, or do you intend to use it at home too?


If you really feel like you would get use out of a playpen, go ahead and buy one. Otherwise it will just be taking up space in your home.

, Read more about the manufacturers to know if the playpen has passed all of the required safety standards.


Always check for JPMA. The playpen that you are going to buy and use must be JPMA Certified. This acronym stands for Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association.
Look for the JPMA seal which indicates that the product has been sample tested and has passed the standards for safe use., Although you might be able to find a second-hand playpen for considerably cheaper than a new one, it's very important that you inspect it thoroughly to ensure it fits all of the required safety measures.

, This will help you to safely set up the playpen. If you notice any missing parts or damage to the playpen, call the manufacturers immediately. You should also call them if you have questions or concerns.


Another important point is to make sure that the playpen you are using was not subjected for a recall.

, The minimum height requirement for the sides of the playpen is 20 inches (51 centimeters) above the floor. This will keep the baby safe inside.


If, when using the playpen, you notice that your baby can already climb out, discontinue use of playpen. This usually happens when your baby reaches a height of 34 inches (86 centimeters) or a weight of 30 pounds (14 kilograms).

, If the walls of the playpen are made from mesh, the holes or weave should be really small. The openings should not be larger than 1/4 inch (0.6 centimeters). This will prevent your baby from getting his small fingers (or any buttons on clothes or toys) stuck inside the holes.


Be aware that playpens with drop-side mesh must never be left in a lowered position, as the baby could be trapped between the mesh side and the floorboard.
Regularly check the mesh. It must be securely fastened to both the top rail and floor plate and it must not have any loose threads, breaks, holes, or tears to avoid strangulation. Replace or repair the damaged parts.

, The amount of space in between the slats should measure no more than 2 3/8 inches (5.08 centimeters or 60 mm) in width. This prevents the baby's head from becoming trapped, and possible strangulation.


Always check for loose or missing slats and make sure that all slats are securely fastened.

, The top rails of the playpen must be padded and must not have any rotating hinges. Corners, sides, and tops should also be padded. This will prevent your baby from getting possible bumps and bruises from hitting hard surfaces.


Also check for any sharp edges or hinges in the playpen. These can cut, scrape, or pinch your baby’s skin or fingers.
The top rails of the playpen should lock automatically when they are lifted into position.

, The mattress or pad at the bottom of the playpen should be at least 1 inch thick and should be sturdy and stable.


There must not be any gaps between the sides of the mattress and the playpen, as your baby could roll into the space between the mattress and the side of the playpen, which could be dangerous.
Remember that the mattress usually cannot be replaced as it will be very difficult to find a new mattress that fits the playpen correctly.

, Any locks must be securely fastened at all times to prevent them from collapsing while the baby is in the playpen, as this could cause serious injury.

, Ensure that there has been no damage due to wear and tear and make sure that no small parts of the playpen have come loose. Baby's like to explore by putting things in their mouth, so it's important to inspect the playpen regularly for potential choking hazards.

, Don't leave items like soft bedding, mattresses, folded quilts, pillows, and stuffed toys in the playpen with the baby, or at least not while the baby is unattended, as these items pose possible suffocation hazards might cause suffocation for your baby.


Soft bedding can also be a cause of SIDS or Sudden Infant Death Syndrome due to suffocation.Never leave or tie string toys in the playpen, as these pose a strangulation risk for your baby. For the same reason, do not also place the playpen near windows or blinds that have strings or cords.

, There must always be an adult supervising the baby while he is in the playpens. Playpens should only be used for short periods of time to keep the baby in one place (and prevent him from crawling or rolling off) while you are busy with certain tasks, such as preparing his baby food or getting dressed.

Many children’s books now state what ages the book targets (such as “for children ages 2-4”). Choose books that suit your child’s age so that they will be engaged with the book.For toddlers ages 12-24 months, choose sturdy books that show kids doing everyday things. Books about routines (such as mealtimes, going to bed, waking up) are also a good choice. Interactive books that include lifting flaps and exploring textures will keep your child interested. For textures, check out “Pat the Bunny” by Dorothy Kunhardt and “Tails” by Matthew Von Fleet. Books about routines include “Goodnight Moon” by Margaret Wise Brown and “Bath Time!” by Sandra Boynton.
Toddlers ages 24-36 months tend to prefer to follow along with you and turn the pages on their own. Let them guess the next word or explore the pictures on the pages. Some favorites include “Go, Dog, Go!” by Dr. Seuss, “Chicka Chicka Boom Boom” by Bill Martin Jr. and John Archambault, and “Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?” by Bill Martin.
Avoid using iPads and other electronic readers. Having your toddler play with a tablet may seem like a good way to keep them occupied, but this is not healthy for toddlers. Using a tablet decreases a child's opportunity for social interactions and this may lead to higher relational problems in the future.;
, When at the library, tell your child that they can choose 2-3 books to bring home. Your toddler may choose books that have beautiful pictures, or that explore a new interest, such as trains or animals.Include your toddler in the process of choosing books so that your child will be excited to read it together.


Toddlers enjoy exploring books on their own. Your toddler may want to look at a book’s pictures ahead of time, turn the pages, and look through books when playing alone.

, Choose books that have few words on the page so that your toddler can follow along. Toddlers prefer books with repetitive texts so that they can participate in reading, too. Look for books that accompany your toddler’s interests.For example, if your child loves dinosaurs, find books about dinosaurs.

, Keep books in the house, in the car, and on your person. Books can come in handy if you’re in a waiting room or in line for something. At home, store books on a low shelf or basket so that your child can easily access them when wanted.Making books and reading accessible is important to keep children interested and engaged in books from an early age.
Ask your librarian for recommendations and keep a stack of books available to your child.

, Transitioning to reading books can be difficult for toddlers if they are wound up. Allow some time for the transition. Say, “In 5 minutes we will sit down and read a book” and then give 2- and 1-minute warnings. When the time does come, give your child time to relax and be ready to hear the story., Having a routine with reading will help to develop discipline and a sense of consistency in your child. Find a time when your child is relaxed, such as after bathtime or before bed. This can help your child associate books with feeling calm. Have rituals around reading, such as allowing your child to choose a book, then you choose a book.Have a place you read together regularly, such as a reading nook or comfy space. You can also read in your child’s bed.

, Toddlers tend to be squirmy and on the move. If your child only makes it through a few pages, don’t sweat it or push to finish the story. Allow your child to play and close the book.Reading should be fun and not a chore. If your child is disinterested or moving on with his or her interests, let it be.


For example, your child may want to read a book, then move onto playing with stuffed animals.

, While most parents and caretakers love when their child sits calmly on their lap, this may be unrealistic for some toddlers. Toddlers want to move around and be active. If your child does not want to sit but wants to be read to, this is okay. Let your child move around, run, jump, and do somersaults. Your child may be moving, but likely listening.Ask your librarian for recommendations for books that include movement. Check out “Press Here” by Herve Tullet and “Good Night Yoga” by Mariam Gates.

, Toddlers love silliness, and the sillier the story, the more engaged your child may become. Be expressive and act out the story. Make animal noises, read in different accents, and use plenty of emotion. Showing that you are having fun will help to make reading a positive experience and help your child to associate reading with fun. Your child will love it and stay engaged with the book.If your child is interested in animal books, make the noise of each animal when you see it. Encourage your kid to do the same!
For example, say, “What is that? Yes, that’s a truck. A big, yellow truck.”

, Children love to know what happens next in a book. Create anticipation before turning the page. Set a mood for each book and allow your child to feel excited about what happens.Ask questions such as, “What do you think will happen next?”


You can also label your own feelings to help build emotional vocabulary, such as, “Oh, I can’t wait to see what happens! Maybe he will feel happy or sad. What do you think?”

, As your child begins to speak, books can be an important tool to help develop words and phrasing. If your child is familiar with a story, pause before finishing a rhyme or phrase and allow your child to say the word. Ask questions about the book such as, “What does the cow say?” or “Where is your mouth?” Then, expand on your child’s response., Make books interactive by finding details in the illustrations. Point to items and name them. Say, “This is a hat. It goes on your head.” Then, as your child gets older, ask about what’s going on in the pictures. Ask, “How many owls?” and “What color are the cars?”Ask about cause-and-effect and relationships within the pictures.Engage with the text and the illustrations as much as possible.

, Toddlers often want to read the same story over and over again. While this can feel tedious to you, your toddler likely enjoys the consistency and routine of reading the same book. This can help build your child’s attention and enjoyment of reading.Allow your child to have favorite books, even if you dislike them. Remember that your child is learning, even if you are frustrated.

Stick to the same schedule for at least two months.",How to Set a Schedule for Toddlers," Start your toddler’s day by setting a wake up time. Most toddlers get up early in the morning, around 6:30-6:45 am. If your toddler tends to get up later than 6:45 am, do not try to wake them up earlier. Let your toddler decide when they will wake up.You may set aside 15 minutes for your toddler to wake up slowly on their own and play a little in their crib before you get them ready for the day. You may try to wait until 7 am to initiate a start to your toddler’s day.
You may then allow 30 minutes to dress the toddler and get the toddler to brush their teeth. You may also include a time to wash their face and go to the bathroom.;
, Depending on the needs of your toddler, you may actually schedule breakfast time before they brush their teeth and get dressed, as some toddlers wake up hungry. You can decide to feed your toddler first so they are more cooperative when it comes time to get dressed and brush their teeth.Try to keep their breakfast light and easy to make. Allow for 30 minutes for your toddler to eat their breakfast. You want to keep the breakfast time short so your toddler has time to play in the late morning.

, Once your toddler is done with breakfast, you should create a late morning routine. Start with one hour of play time after breakfast where you read books together or allow your toddler to play with siblings or family members.After one hour of playtime, you may schedule another hour of arts and crafts or do another activity together, like listening or dancing to music. Try to include at least two different activities in the late morning so your toddler has some variety and is not doing the same activity for the majority of the morning.
You should try to include activities that are stimulating but also calming, like doing finger painting or drawing. Mixing in active and relaxing activities throughout your toddler’s day can help them get used to pacing themselves., You should stick to an afternoon lunch time, ideally at 12 pm. Allow your toddler 30 minutes to one hour to wash up and eat lunch.After lunch at 12 pm, schedule in a nap. Toddlers between the ages of 1-2 years old need about 11-14 hours of sleep total.Scheduling in a nap after lunch is ideal, as this will ensure your toddler is well rested before dinner but is still tired enough after dinner to go to sleep at night.
Depending on the age of your toddler, you may include two naps a day, one in the late morning and one in the early afternoon, after lunch. Once your toddler reaches 18 months old, they will only need one nap a day, at one to three hours long., After your toddler’s one to three hour nap, you should plan a few activities for the late afternoon. This should include a light afternoon snack and some time outside, if possible. Plan for an activity outdoors like going for a walk to a nearby playground or running around outside in the yard.Doing something physical outdoors in the late afternoon will also allow your toddler to get their energy out before dinner. This could make the preparations for dinner and bed after dinner much smoother.

, You should start getting your toddler ready for dinner about 30 minutes before dinner time. Try to establish a routine of washing their hands and face and changing out of any dirty clothing before dinner time. This will ensure your toddler knows what to expect before they sit down to eat..Have dinner time at the same time every day, usually around 5:30-6pm. You may allow for one hour for dinner, especially if your toddler is eating with the rest of the family. Dinner time can be a good way for your toddler to bond with everyone and also learn how to model good table manners by watching others eat.

, It can be tricky to get your toddler to go to bed. But if you stick to a consistent day schedule and establish a before bed routine, your toddler may be more apt to go to bed. You should try to stick to the same before bed routine and the same bedtime every night. Most toddlers should be in bed by 8 pm to ensure they get enough sleep.Include a brief playtime after dinner and allow your toddler to do something relaxing, like read a book or watch a favorite television show. You can also include a nighttime snack like a warm glass of milk.
You may also include time for a warm bath before bed. Your toddler should also get into their pajamas and brush their teeth.
The final step in your bedtime routine might be singing a quiet song in bed or reading a bedtime story. You may also allow your toddler to get into bed with a favorite toy or a comfort blanket. Having a security object in bed, such as a toy, can help your toddler fall asleep., Once you feel you have a complete schedule set for your toddler, you should write it down and view it as a whole. Make sure you include enough daily activities that are active and also calming. You should also make sure you establish set wake times, nap times, and bed times for your toddler. Your schedule may look like this:6:30-6:45 am: Wake up time, with time set aside for playing in the crib/bed
7:30 am: Breakfast
8:00 am: Get dressed, brush teeth, wash face
8:30 am: Play time
10:30 am: Morning snack
11:00 am: Arts and crafts time
11:30 am: Calming activity
12:00 pm: Lunch time
12:30 pm: Nap time
2:30-3:00 pm: Afternoon snack
3:00 pm: Outdoor play time
5:30 pm: Dinner time
6:00-6:30 pm: Brief playtime
7:00 pm: Bath
7:30 pm: Before bed routine
8:00-8:15 pm: Bedtime

, You can reinforce your toddler’s schedule by creating a poster or image of the schedule and placing it in their room. This way, your child can look at the schedule every day and know exactly what the plan is. You can also refer to the schedule throughout the day to remind your toddler what they should expect.You may also include photographs of your toddler doing each action, such as a photo of your child at play time or a photo of your child eating at the dinner table. This can serve as visual reinforcement of the schedule.
A poster of the schedule can also be useful if you have more than one child in your household. Your children may be on different schedules, depending on their ages and needs. Having posters of each schedule, with visual images of each child, can help make it easier for your children to follow their own individual schedules.

, Though it is important that you maintain a set schedule for your toddler, you should not be too rigid or set about the schedule. You want your toddler to learn consistency and stability but you also want to be sure they can be adaptable in the event of a change.You may introduce small changes to their schedule, like swapping out late morning reading time for a walk outside or having lunch picnic style outside on a nice day. Including small changes can keep your toddler’s days fun and interesting.
You should still maintain a few non-negotiables in the routine so there is still a level of consistency. You may maintain the same wake up times, eating times, and bed times, but vary the activities between these times.

, You should also try to vary up who does what for your toddler throughout the day. Adding variety in terms of who does what role in your toddler’s schedule will ensure they do not become too dependent on one person.Maybe alternate nights where your partner or a family member puts your toddler to bed so they do not too dependent on you always being there at bedtime. You may also change up who serves your toddler lunch so other family members are involved in their routine.
You may also have a babysitter come by a few times a week to give your toddler dinner and put them to bed so they get used to having people outside the family involved in their routine.

, You should make sure your toddler’s schedule includes enough time for them to have fun, explore, learn, and engage with you on an intimate level. You should also make sure your toddler feels they are benefitting from the schedule in tangible ways. Use the routines in their schedule as incentives so your toddler is more interested in the schedule and follows it willingly.For example, you may make sure there is enough one on one time with your toddler throughout their daily routine so they feel they are benefitting from the schedule. You may also include some of their favorite activities in the play time slots of the schedule so they are excited for their routine.

, As your toddler gets older and reaches two years of age, they should start to play with other toddlers regularly. They may play with other children their age in a group or one on one. You should arrange for play dates during your toddler’s play times so they are spending time with other children.You may try to include a variety of activities with other children in your toddler’s schedule. Make time for big group activities, small group activities, and one one one play with other children their age. This will ensure they learn the value of friendship, community, and getting along with others.

, If you decide it is time to change up one aspect of your toddler’s schedule, do so gradually and one aspect at a time. Avoid shifting several routines at once as this can confuse your toddler.You may decide to start by shifting one aspect of your toddler’s schedule in the evenings, as this will give you time to stay organized and on schedule in the mornings. You may decide to move down your toddler’s bedtime as they get older or change dinner times due to a new schedule at school or at work.

, Two months is a good amount of time for your toddler to get used to the schedule. Many toddlers start to maintain the schedule on their own after two months and will come to expect certain routines in their day.If a drastic event occurs, such as family emergency, you should use plain language to explain to your toddler that there is going to be a change to the schedule. You may say, “Grandpa is sick so I am going to take care of her. Dad is going to put you to bed tonight.” This will reassure your toddler everything is fine and that the change is not going to disrupt their schedule.
You should also try to maintain the same schedule when you are on vacation with your toddler or away from home. Maintain the same nap times and bed times can make it easier for your toddler to stay calm during the trip and feel less unsettled by being away from home.

Reduce noise and stress around you.,
Take some deep breaths.,
Practice self-talk.,
Relax your muscles.,
Laugh.,
Speak calmly.,
Start a countdown.",How to Stay Calm During Toddler Temper Tantrums1," One way to keep a positive mindset in the moment is to reduce the noise surrounding you. Turn down the radio if you are in the car. Turn off the television if you are in the house. Silence your phone if it is ringing. Get away from anything that is adding additional loudness to your already loud surroundings.


This is one way to keep a peaceful environment even while your toddler is throwing a fit.;
, A way to feel calmer and more positive almost immediately is to simply breathe deeply. Take a deep breath, inhaling in through your nose, and then exhale slowly through your mouth. This will help release some of the tension in your body and keep you from getting worked up.Practice this deep breathing until you feel completely calm or ready to address your child’s tantrum.

, Avoid thinking negatively about yourself during this tantrum. Remember that toddlers at this age often act out in this way because they do not understand and are unable to handle their emotions. These tantrums are a way of them figuring this out as well as developing coping mechanisms. In your head, try repeating things like:Everything will be okay.
I am a good parent.
This is only temporary. The tantrum will end soon.

, Often times, the stress from these tantrums can affect more than your mind, but your body as well. Tension is likely building in your body, but you can release this and stay calm more easily if you relax your body. Do some simple stretches like reaching up to the ceiling and then down at your feet. Lie flat on your back and completely relax your body into the bed or floor., When you are in the middle of your child’s tantrum, laughter might be the furthest thing from your mind. However, you can inject humor into any situation by taking a moment to revisit a funny text you received recently or to even get on social media searching for funny memes or statuses. Perhaps there is a comedian you find hilarious; search for some short clips from their stand-up and watch them to induce laughter.You should never laugh at your child, however. This will confuse them and likely only intensify the tantrum.

, Know that anger begets more anger. Speaking to them calmly will help reinforce calm behavior in you. Yelling will only intensify the situation and will often escalate your toddler’s tantrum.You might say something like “Jessica, I know you are upset. But I need you to calm down right now so that you can have your dinner.”

, A countdown can not only help your child calm down, it can also help you as well. This will be the signal to your child for them to end their tantrum before being punished. Count slowly and deliberately from 1 to 5 and breathe deeply while doing so.If your child still does not calm down by the end of the countdown, step away for a moment.

"
"
Ignore your child.,
Give your child some space.,
Walk away until you feel calm again.,
Zone out.,
Change your location.,
Ask your partner to step in.",How to Stay Calm During Toddler Temper Tantrums2," Perhaps the easiest and most simple way to remain calm during this tantrum is to ignore it altogether. Avoid getting all worked up and simply disengage from your toddler. Do not try to reason with or bargain with them during this time.Let your toddler know why you are doing this. You can say, ""I am not going to have this talk again until you have calmed down.""
Don’t do this when in public, however. Do so only when you are in private or when you are in the comfort of your own home. If your child is acting out in public, you will want to address the behavior with more immediacy.

, Sometimes, a toddler’s tantrums might be a bit aggressive or even violent. Some toddlers bite, scratch or hit when they are upset. In order to keep yourself calm and injury free, maintain some distance from your child during this period. If you were holding them, put them down and step away until some of their anger has dissipated. You can also go into another room.If you feel that your child could injure themselves, however, you will need to monitor them until that is no longer a risk. Find a safe room where your child can be upset without hurting themselves, and remove any potentially dangerous objects.

, If you feel your child’s tantrum is starting to get the best of you, walk away from the situation. Allowing your anger to increase will only likely result in doing something that you will regret, like giving into your child or yelling at them. Take a few moments to yourself to recenter and calm down.Go outside for a few minutes and sit on your porch until you feel calm.
Call and talk to a friend or family member. You can vent or ask them for advice to help you cool down.
Try splashing some cool water on your face or going to have a glass of water.
Make sure your home is childproof so that you can feel comfortable leaving them to themselves for a few minutes.

, One of the best ways to protect your sanity during this stressful time is simply to zone out. Think of something that you are looking forward to that’s coming up soon. It can be something simple like having an ice cream with a friend later or a vacation to the beach. Whatever it is, take a moment to step away in your mind.If you have the time, writing in a journal or doodling can help provide an escape.

, One other option to alleviate your stress levels during tantrums is to change your physical location. If your toddler is throwing a tantrum in the middle of a store, you might feel stressed because you are embarrassed. Alleviate these negative feelings by removing yourself and your toddler from the public place until both of you have calmed down.Go sit in your car until the tantrum has ended. You can also step into a bathroom for a moment with your child.

, If you are feel extremely overwhelmed and feel that you have done all that you can to calm down, consider asking for some outside help occasionally. It’s okay to admit that you don’t have all the answers or fixes all of the time. Allow your partner to step in and soothe or address the child while you take a break from the situation.


You might say something like “Hey honey, can you come in here for a bit. John is having another tantrum and I need a moment.”
Give your partner a break when they need it, as well.

"
"
Give your child choices.,
Pick your battles.,
Use distractions.,
Hug your child.,
Give them a timeout.,
Talk to them about the tantrum.,
Assess why the tantrums occur.",How to Stay Calm During Toddler Temper Tantrums3," One way to help minimize tantrums to let your toddler make choices in their routine. This can be as simple as asking which fruit they want to eat with lunch or which shirt they want to wear that day. This will give them a little control in their life.

Choose acceptable choices ahead of time. Do not give your toddler a choice if you cannot give it to them.

, One way to feel more at peace during or prior to tantrums is to simply pick your battles. Prioritize important lessons or corrections to make with your toddler and let go of the smaller things. For instance, if your child regularly cries when they can’t have a treat, consider letting that go and correcting them only on more serious offenses., Distract yourself and them from the tantrum so that the both of you can get some peace. Hand them a favorite toy or give them a small snack. Put your headphones in and listen to some music or go into another room to call a friend.Distractions work best before a tantrum has fully erupted. Be alert for the signs of an oncoming tantrum, and distract your child before they are completely distraught.

, Though this may be the last thing that you want to do in the moment, hugs are very effective in stopping tantrums in their tracks. A hug can provide your child the physical soothing that they need in the moment to calm down.As you hug them, practice deep and rhythmic breathing to help soothe them.


Once they have calmed down a little, ask them gently how they are feeling. Is there anything they need? Do they want some space or quiet time to themselves?

, A timeout is a great way to help your child gain control of themselves and their emotions. It is not meant to be a punishment, so do not allow your child to stay in timeout for too long. Keep them in 1 minute for every year of their age. For instance, your two year old should stay in for no more than two minutes., If your child is able to talk and express themselves, you may be able to discuss their tantrum with them. Once they have calmed down, sit with them. Ask them why they were so upset. Coach them through better ways of expressing their feelings.

You can say, ""Why were you crying earlier?""
Encourage them to express their feelings. You might say, ""How did that make you feel?""
Ask them to think about more appropriate responses. You can say, ""What do you think is a better way to ask for what you want?""

, If you can identify the source of your child’s tantrums, then you will be better equipped at preventing them. For instance, if your child often throws a tantrum at around noon when it is time for lunch, then perhaps their anger is sparked by hunger. Consider giving them a mid morning snack to curtail tantrums.If your child has frequent tantrums, you may want to keep a record of when they occur and what causes them. You may notice patterns that can help you get to the root of the problem.
Lack of sleep or an irregular sleep schedule are common causes of tantrums. Make sure that your child keeps to a consistent sleep and nap schedule.
Boredom and overstimulation can also contribute to tantrums.

"
"
Establish a routine.,
Determine your regular work hours and stick to them.,
Work during down times.,
Plan frequent breaks.,
Set aside time for yourself.,
Remain flexible.",How to Work from Home With a Toddler1," Children need structured scheduling as they grow up. Though every day does not have to be exactly the same, there should be a routine or regular schedule that you follow throughout the week. Let your work schedule be dictated by your toddler's schedule, not the other way around., If your work phone rings during your set ""non-business"" hours, let it go to voicemail. Limit checking your work email to your set office hours, too., There are natural times throughout the day when you can focus on your work, such as when your toddler is resting. In order to stay healthy, a toddler must take daily naps, so use this to your advantage by making progress in the afternoon., In order to maintain attention on your child, take breaks from your work. Tell your toddler when your next break will be and how you plan to spend that time with them, so that they can look forward to it.Taking a walk with your child can be a fun and healthy way both to spend quality time together and to stay energized during the workday.

, Allowing for some “you” time is important so that you don’t become overworked and exhausted. Schedule free time for relaxing and rejuvenating yourself.

, Although you may have a plan in place as to when you are going to tackle work assignments, be flexible in order to meet your toddler's needs. Something unexpected could come up that requires your full attention, such as your child falling and getting a cut on their knee. Be ready to stop working at a moment’s notice.Understand that your toddler takes priority. If you are on a phone call and your child is screaming, apologize and ask if you can call back later.
Save your work frequently if working online or in a document, since you never know when you will have to move away from your computer to attend to your child’s needs.

"
"
Create a workspace from which you can watch your child.,
Distract your child with a television show or movie.,
Get creative.,
Create a tiny workstation for your toddler.,
Keep your workspace safely organized.",How to Work from Home With a Toddler2," You should be able to observe your toddler at all times, as a young child should never be left unattended. If your child likes to play in a certain room, set up a table and chair in a place where you have a good view of the entire room., Allow for 30 minutes to an hour of TV time for your toddler while you get some work done. Educational television can help your child learn, as well as providing a short time of rest for him or her between meals. However, never leave your child unattended. Take your work with you into the TV room so you can keep an eye on them., Encourage your toddler to complete crafts or color with crayons while you work. Keep craft materials on hand so that there is always something for them to work on., Children love to imitate adults. Setting up a tiny table with paper, crayons, toy phone, and stickers will stimulate their imagination by allowing them to pretend to be working at the office with you.

, Be sure to keep your home work environment safe so that you can protect your toddler from potential dangers. Store letter openers, thumbtacks, and other sharp objects in closed containers that your toddler cannot reach. A locked desk drawer also works for safe storage.Secure heavy furniture so it does not tip over. Attach it to the wall with brackets or anchors.
Protect cords and outlets. Make sure your toddler cannot reach electrical cords, and that they are not lying on the floor for the toddler to trip on. Put covers onto outlets.
Keep computer ink, correction fluid, markers, and other potentially toxic liquids locked away so that your toddler cannot reach them.

Arrange for periodic childcare.,
Contact a babysitter.,
Interview and hire a babysitter.",How to Work from Home With a Toddler3," Creating social time for your child is important. Schedule times when your toddler can play with others. When your child is being properly supervised by someone else, you can use the free time to work more effectively.


Use a local daycare center once or twice a week. Many offer drop-in care for an hour or daily rate.
Start a group with other parents in which you take turns watching the kids in order to give each person a turn to take a break.

, You can opt either to leave the house or stay at home while the babysitter is there. This allows your child to receive the fully focused attention and care that they need while you get work finished.Scan the newspaper for local babysitters, place a wanted ad in your newspaper, or look for babysitters online. You can also ask a neighbor or friend whether their teenage kids would be interested in making some extra cash babysitting for you.

, Schedule a time to meet any prospective babysitters, and introduce them to your toddler. Ask them about their previous babysitting experiences to learn if they are a good fit for your family. Tell the babysitter about your expectations for them, and make your house rules clear.

Read your toddler books about colors and shapes.,
Connect learning with everyday activities.,
Sing nursery rhymes about shapes and colors.,
Play games about colors and shapes.",How to Show Your Toddler Activities to Teach Colors and Shapes1," Books can come in very handy when trying to explain the basics of colors and shapes to your child. There are different types of books you can use to teach these concepts, from touch and feel books, to pop-up books. Try a selection of books, or stick to the one that your child reacts to best.Make sure to establish routines at home when teaching these basics to your toddler. If your child pays more attention when you read to her before she goes to bed, then make it a habit to read to your child each night.





;
, Make everyday an opportunity to reinforce what you have read to your toddler. Tell her “Look at your dress! Isn’t it a lovely shade of RED?” or “Look at your book! It’s shaped like a rectangle (or a square!)”.


Make sure to point out everyday objects to your toddler and say what shape and color they are, whether you’re inside the vehicle passing by tall buildings (rectangular in shape) or walking in the park and see a balloon (oval in shape).






Take every opportunity you have to mention the colors to your toddler and connect them with whatever activity she’s doing such as “Wow! Those are really beautiful RED berries you got in your yogurt” or “Would you like to wear your pink shoes or yellow sandals”?







, Nursery rhymes may help your child memorize the basic shapes and the many different hues of the color wheel.



Life without Colors, All in Red, What is Pink and the ever popular ditty Roses are Red, Violets are Blue are just some of the nursery rhyme books you can read to your toddler about colors.






Consider creating your own song about shapes or colors by using a familiar tune, such as “Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star” and simply making up your own words.







, Incorporate your lessons about colors and shapes into games that you make up, or games that your child is already familiar with. For example, ask your child to point out objects that are red, or find objects that are oval in shape.


Consider playing I-Spy, with an emphasis on colors and shapes.






When your child does well at a game, make sure to give her positive reinforcement by giving her a reward, such as some extra time to play before bed.

Exercise in the morning.,
Reserve the time.,
Do three 10-minute sessions.,
Stick to basic work out gear.,
Invite a friend over.,
Ask others to hold you accountable.",How to Work out With a Toddler1," Anyone with a toddler knows that the mid to late afternoon can be a bit challenging. If you expect to work out at that point you may delay or avoid it entirely. Instead, try to get at least one short work out session completed in the morning. This will give you a much needed boost of energy., You are probably already following a routine closely, as toddlers tend to do best with a scheduled daily plan. So, simply modify your plan to include a bit of time here and there for your work out sessions. Decide that you will spend 10 minutes right before breakfast, 10 minutes after their nap, and 10 minutes post-bath for work outs.As you plan out your day, make the best use of your toddler’s nap times. Experiment with working out for a part of that time., Instead of working out for an hour or 30 minutes, break down your exercises into short intervals spread throughout the day. For these 10 minute periods push yourself hard and make sure that you break a sweat. If you happen to add in a fourth session, all the better.For example, spend the short interval alternating between lunges and squats. You can do this type of exercise right in front of your toddler as they play with toys.

, Don’t waste a great deal of time worrying about what you should wear. Instead, pick up a few work out outfits that you are comfortable in and rotate them throughout the week. This way you can simply throw something on and get right to work., Find a friend with a toddler or younger child and get them to cover over to your place or meet you elsewhere for a work out. Do this at least a few times a week. If you don’t know anyone, you might try connecting with a parents group in your area via social media.You could also rotate childcare duties with a friend. They hit the gym while you watch their child and vice versa.

, Let your friends and family know about your plans to work out with your toddler. Encourage them to ask you how it is going. They might even offer to help out and babysit. For a bit of extra support, you can join an online community devoted to parents trying to achieve work out goals."

Make edible finger paints.,
Make shapes with different colored play-doughs.,
Play with chalk on the sidewalk.,
Use different colored jelly beans to teach colors.,
Test your toddler with silhouette flash cards.,
Encourage your toddler to sort shapes.,
Feed an imaginary pet with different shaped foods.",How to Show Your Toddler Activities to Teach Colors and Shapes2," You can whip up icing (or use a store bought variety) to make edible finger paint; simply add a few drops of food coloring to each bowl of icing so that your child has several colors to work with. Once you have several colorful icings to work with, have your child decorate cookies, or use the icing on paper. Give her an assignment, such as using only two specific colors to draw a specific thing.


For instance, you could ask your child to make a picture of the ocean and sun, using the correct colors (blue and yellow respectively).







, You can also make homemade colorful edible play doughs. Try mixing a cup of flour with half a cup of water. Add a pinch of salt and a teaspoon of baking powder. Knead into a dough.


If the dough is still too soft, just add a bit more flour to it until you get your desired consistency. Wrap the dough in a plastic wrap and keep it in the fridge for half an hour. Afterwards, separate the dough into as many colors as you want to use, and add a few drops of food coloring to each ball of dough. Knead the dough to incorporate the color.






Once your dough is ready, have your child work with the colorful dough to create shapes. Ask your child to make a purple triangle, or a blue circle.







, Let your toddler scribble and doodle on the sidewalk with sidewalk chalk. Guide her drawings to help her learn her shapes and colors. Ask her to draw a scene with a pink balloon, or a yellow flower.


You can also ask your child to draw certain shapes in different colors.







, Place an assortment of colored jelly beans in a bowl. Give your child five or more empty cups. Ask your child to sort the jelly beans into groups of colors.


When she does this correctly, let her reward be that she can eat one cup of the jelly beans, or one of each kind of jelly bean, depending on what she likes.







, You can purchase these flashcards from bookstores or learning stores. Give your child the cut out shapes, and ask her to match them to the cards that have the same shapes on them. Ask her, “look at the shape you are holding; which card has the same shape on it?”.

, Give your child a collection of items that are distinctly shaped like the shapes that you are trying to teach your child. Have your child sort these items into groups that are all the same shape.


For example, give your child three balls (all in different sizes), a round plastic plate, square boxes in different sizes, a piece of paper cut into the shape of a square, and several different rectangular shoe boxes. Ask your child to sort these items into circles, squares, and rectangles.






You can also make a batch of cookies and cut them so that there are five circles, five triangles, and five squares. Mix the cookies up and ask your child to sort them into circles, triangles and squares. As a reward, she can eat one of the cookies.







, Get your child a stuffed animal, or use one that she already has. Draw images of food that have distinct shapes, such as a circular apple, or a triangle pear, and cut them out (the shapes should be exaggerated so that your child can tell the difference; the foods don’t need to look like they normally do).


Have your child feed the stuffed animal different shaped foods each day. Tell your child that today, the stuffed cat can only eat oval shaped foods.

Flex your tummy.,
Watch a work out video.,
Dance!,
Create work out games.,
Use your toddler as weight resistance.,
Lunge around the house.,
Do a plank crawl.,
Create an obstacle course.,
Provide side-activities.",How to Work out With a Toddler2," Envision everything from your toes upwards being pulled toward your ribs. Tighten your abdominal muscles to help with the pulling process. This will help your deep muscles to engage and burn off surface fat, even with very little outward effort on your part., Choose a video that breaks down into short segments that cover all of your muscle groups, such as legs and arms. If you have a free moment, complete a set of exercises. Try to select a video that includes lots of movement and interesting music to gain the attention of your toddler too. Encourage them to move along with you or just dance to the music.If your toddler distracts you for a portion of the exercise, don’t worry. Just double-up on the final few movements so that you reach your intended work out time.

, Download a wide variety of dance music onto your phone or a home stereo system. Announce to your toddler that it is time to dance and then crank up the tunes! Jump around on your own and try some new dance moves with your toddler. Switch up the music types to keep the party going.To make the dancing even more interactive, play a number of songs for your toddler and let them select which ones get to be included on the final dance mix.

, Give your toddler a treat, like a sticker, if they help you complete a work out. Or, agree to read them one book for each five minutes you spend working out. You can even place your child underneath you while doing push-ups and give them a kiss each time you press down.Toddlers love to mimic their parents and other people. When you start a work out at home, ask your toddler to stand next to you and repeat your moves. You may be surprised how quickly they catch on., Instead of buying and storing hand weights, just use your child instead. Hold your child firmly in your arms when doing squats or lunges. Use your child’s weight as resistance in abdominal exercises, too.For example, lay on your back and hold your calves parallel to the floor. Position your toddler laying down on your calves facing you. Then, roll up from the ground and back doing, doing modified sit-ups.

, Whenever you need to move from one room to another, lunge instead of just walking. You can complete a lunge by taking a step forward and then dropping your back knee to the ground. Rotate legs as you move forward. This is a great way to sneak in some extra work out time., If you are a toddler parent, you are likely spending a great deal of time on the ground already. Go ahead and do some planks while you are down there. Position yourself on all fours. Tighten your abs and pull your knees slightly off the ground. Try to hold your hips steady.If you feel comfortable, slowly move your hands forward until you are in an extended plank position.
Practice counting with your toddler while you hold your plank. Go down or up from 60 seconds.

, Get out in your backyard and place some toys in a zig-zag pattern that you can run around or chase your toddler through. In the house, position chairs, couch cushions, or toys into an obstacle course that you must maneuver around to make it from one side of the room to another.You can also create a varied movement course where you must do a different type of activity for each section, such as frog jumps or crab crawls.

, If you are trying to work out at home (whether inside or outside), create a bin of unusual toys and games that you only pull out at that time. Set the bin close enough so that you can observe your toddler without them being directly underfoot. When you are finished working out, put away the bin and continue on with your day.For example, an outside activity bin might include sidewalk chalk and a squirt gun or two.

Hit the pavement with a jogging stroller.,
Take a bike ride.,
Use class time as work out time.,
Make the jungle gym your gym.",How to Work out With a Toddler3," Look for one with three sturdy wheels with rubber tires that can be inflated. Load your toddler into this stroller and go for a quick, or long, run in the park. You can even hit some of the smoother nature trails with certain off-road joggers.Choose a stroller where the seat can be slightly inclined as well. This gives your toddler the option of taking a nap while you burn some calories.

, Let your toddler practice their tricycle riding as you walk along next to them. Or, attach a trailer to the back of your bike so that your toddler can ride long as you pedal around town. Throw a picnic lunch into the trailer as well and you can head off to a local park for a nice lunch.Make sure to carefully observe all traffic laws when biking with your toddler.
Before you start biking with your toddler find a helmet that fits them correctly. It should fit snugly on their head, strap under their chin, and be level at the top.

, Enroll your child in a local music, dance, or gym class. This will give them a chance to be active and make new friends while providing you with a free window of time to work out. If you take them to a local rec center, you might be able to just walk across the hallway to hit the gym., When you take your toddler to the park look around to see how you can make the space work for you. Do repeated stair climbs up to the tops of the towers. Lean against a part of the playground wall and do a few incline push-ups. See how many pull-ups you can finish on the monkey bars.#Join a kid-friendly gym. Look for a gym that offers safe, reliable childcare. In many cases, you can drop your toddler off at the center and watch them through your phone or a glass partition as you work out. Or, find a gym that offers parent-child classes. You might bring your child along to do yoga, for example.Make sure to check out the childcare area closely before dropping your toddler off. Check for any safety violations and talk with management about how their childcare workers are screened for safety.

Check the labels on the clothing.,
Sort clothes into ‘colors’ and ‘whites or lights’ piles.,
Pre-treat any stains you find.,
Use hydrogen peroxide to get blood out of clothes.,
Use a detergent rub or stain stick for mud, dirt, grass, food, or juice stains.",How to Wash a Toddler's Clothes1," On both children and adult clothing, there is generally a label that explains how the item should best be washed. You may find that aside from saying that it’s ok to wash this article of clothing in the washer and dryer, there might also be specific instructions, like ‘wash with like colors’ or ‘turn inside out before washing’. Following these instructions can help to help your child’s clothes to look new for a longer period of time.


Some of your toddler’s clothes may say ‘hand wash only’. If you find that this is the case, you can either wash your child’s clothes by hand, or take them to the dry cleaners.;
, In order to keep the clothes from bleeding on each other in the wash, they have to be sorted by colors. All the white clothes (like undershirts and underwear) can be washed together. Some colors are fine to be washed together.


Navy blue and black can be washed together as they are very similar.
If there are pastel colors that will not bleed onto other colors, they can all be washed together.
Denim should be washed alone. Most of the time, denim is the most likely to bleed onto other items, so all denim items can go in one load together.

, Toddlers have a tendency to stain their clothes. If this happens, you will most likely need to pre-treat the stain to make sure that it actually comes out of the clothes. There are different ways to pre-treat different stains which are described in the following steps.

, If the toddler has blood on his/her clothes, treat it with hydrogen peroxide. Pour some hydrogen peroxide into a small cup (or the lid of the peroxide container). Dip a cotton swab into the peroxide. Use the cotton swab to rub the peroxide into the blood stain.


Doing this will help to release the blood from the fabric before it is put into the main wash.

, A detergent rub can be made with a little detergent and some water. It should be about the consistency of a paste so that the detergent is not completely dissolved in the water. Rub it into the stain and let it set for a short period of time before you wash the clothes.


A stain stick, which can be purchased from the store, is used the same way. Rub it in and let it set for a few minutes (or an hour) before washing it in the laundry.

Use an approved restraint if possible.,
Purchase a giant diaper/nappy bag.,
Bring enough baby milk/ food and snacks.Most airlines will warm bottles or formula.,
Consider dressing your child in a one piece, footed Babygro if you're worried about losing clothes.,
Pack the diaper/nappy bag as if you're going on a trip for a day.,
Consider buying some new toys to surprise your child; they will keep his or her attention longer.,
Try to avoid handing out sweets and sugary snacks to your child for obvious reasons.,
Bring earplugs not for your baby, but for yourself and the people around you.,
Arrive early at your gate.,
While at the gate, ask the attendant if families with small children will board first.,
Serve your toddler juice or water by bringing a ""reuse or toss"" cup with lid & straw so that neighbors, your toddler, and you are not soaked by his or her inevitable bumping it off the tray table; attendants will provide drinks but not straws or lids on most flights.,
Bring a blanket to cover your baby and request extra pillows & blankets as soon as you sit.,
Carry aboard only the essentials.,
Travel during nap time.",How to Travel by Plane with an Infant or Toddler," Lap travel, while legal for children under 2 years of age, is much less safe than traveling in an approved seat.The FAA recommends that all children use a restraint on board from birth to 40 pounds. It also comes in handy because you can attach toys or pictures to the top, a mirror to the side, and a pillow to the back for comfort while sleeping.

However, in Europe, Australia, Asia, the use of a lap belt onboard is normal and approved by their safety regulations. These are provided by the airline and attach to your seatbelt.
From the FAA: Did you know the safest place for your little one during turbulence or an emergency is in a government-approved child restraint system (CRS) or device, not on your lap? http://www.faa.gov/passengers/fly_children/crs/
;
, Some (non American) airlines allow a piece of hold luggage, usually 10kg and a nappy bag. Always check with your airline their particular baggage allowances as these do vary greatly

, Many large airlines allow you to request a baby meal for infants. This must be pre-booked at least 24 hours in advance, and is usually a puréed jar

, Also consider layers in case the cabin temperature is too hot or cold. Always pack at least one spare change of clothes for baby and spare too for you - just in case of any spills or accidents.

, Include a change of clothes or two outfits, bind, diapers/nappies, toys (stickers, crayons, and paper for toddlers) changing pad, baby wipes, and utensils.


You must declare baby food, formula, medicines. Babies and toddlers ARE exempt from the 3-1-1 and 100ml liquid rule.

, Wrapping them individually helps to keep them entertained. You may choose to hold onto these toys until your child becomes antsy or angry. If the flight goes well, then save the toys for the flight home.

, Instead pack plenty of snacks incase the inflight service is delayed. Raisins, bananas, crackers, are all good ideas.

, If your child cries uncontrollably, then you can show your concern by handing your neighbors an inexpensive pair of foam earplugs with a kind smile.

, Ask the attendant for a ""Gate Check Tag"" for your stroller. They will stow your stroller with the luggage in the belly of the plane. You can also check in your stroller with your bags if you prefer and then use a baby carrier. You rarely will collect your stroller as you exit the plane, but will find it with the normal baggage reclaim, or in the excess baggage area. Some airports provide complimentary strollers for use when in transit or on arrival.

, He or she will likely say 'yes'. You may want to do this or not, if you get on early, you have more time to get ready. If you don't get on until the last minute, there is less time on the cramped plane spaces.

, Consider buying a cup, straw & lid from a concession stand before boarding your flight in a pinch.

, Pillows are too bulky to pack. If you don't like the idea of your child's face on the airline pillow, then cover it with your blanket from home. If your child wants to sleep in your arms, then they will need extra cushioning.

, You cannot quickly or easily reach things under your seat or in the overhead: they will go unused and be a useless burden.

, Some children fall asleep in a plane as they would while riding in a car.

Determine what temperature of water you will use.,
Choose a detergent.,
Figure out how you should dry the clothes.,
Add dryer sheets if so desired.",How to Wash a Toddler's Clothes2," Most washing machines have three or four temperature settings: hot, warm, cool, and cold. White and off-white clothing can be washed on a hot setting. This hot setting helps to remove germs from the clothing.


The warm setting is great for darks and permanent press clothing. It helps reduce color bleeding in the wash.
Try to use the cold water setting for delicate items.
Keep in mind that cool and cold water can be used in the rinse cycle for almost every load of laundry.

, There are some detergents that are made just for children. They clean clothes well and are designed not to irritate a child’s sensitive skin when they next wear the article of clothing. However, if you would prefer not to buy an entirely separate detergent for your child, choose a detergent that will work well for your toddler’s skin and the rest of the family’s clothes.


Some children have delicate and sensitive skin; pick a detergent that is made for sensitive skin. Many children (and adults) have allergies and are not able to use anything that has a scent; decide if using scented or unscented is best for the family.

, Read the tag again to determine the best way to dry certain articles of clothing. You might find that a tag says to air dry or line dry the item. This means that the clothes have to be put somewhere so that they can dry without having extra heat added to them. You may also choose to line dry your toddler’s clothes if you are afraid that the clothing will shrink in the dryer.


Toddler clothing tags often say to tumble dry on low or medium heat. Put these clothes in the dryer.

, If you are putting clothing into the dryer, consider adding dryer sheets. Dryer sheets help to remove some of the static electricity that builds up when the fabrics rub together in the dryer.


Consider whether or not your child’s skin will react badly to the dryer sheet. If your child doesn’t have allergies or sensitive skin, you should be fine adding dryer sheets to your laundry.

Recognize frustration.,
Notice if the child becomes clingy.,
Recognize whining and screaming.,
Interpret increased misbehavior and acting out.,
Be aware of tantrums.,
Understand hypersensitivity.,
Know why they are inconsolable.",How to Recognize an Overtired Toddler1," Toddlers that are overtired will get irritated quickly when things are not happening as they think they should. Although this can sometimes be marked up as a toddler temper tantrum, it is usually due to exhaustion when it occurs along with the other signs listed here.


For example, a toddler that normally enjoys putting together simple puzzles might get frustrated or angry when they can’t get a piece to fit. Instead of calmly asking for help or signaling for an aid, the toddler might scream or throw the puzzle.;
, Overtired children become clingy and seek every second of your attention. If your child is usually clingy, this sign may be more difficult notice, but if he or she is not, this could be one of the signs that your child needs a rest.

, When you notice that your child is screaming and whining more than normal, this is an indication of fatigue. Lack of sleep and fatigue lead to impatience and nervousness in children. Many children who are overtired become stressed and emotionally temperamental.

, Some children may go a bit crazy when they are too tired. They may ignore their parents, be loud, hit, spit, bite, yell ""no"" to each question, and become selfish. If you notice that your child is acting like this, it does not necessarily mean that they are trying to be rude and nasty. Perhaps they are just too tired and need some rest.

, Tantrums are a very common manifestation of fatigue in children. They may cry, scream, and throw things on the floor if something is not the way they want. If the tantrums occur in the evening, it is a sure sign that the child is too tired.

, If you notice your child frequently cries about little things, he or she is probably overtired. The lack of rest makes children very sensitive, and they may cry over small incidents.

, Once an overtired child starts whining about something, it is very difficult to soothe and comfort him or her. They actually do not know why they're crying, and when they start it is hard to stop, because the crying is originating from a source that they do not understand.

"
Assess whether or not the toddler is moving slowly.,
Listen to the speech of the toddler.,
See if they are sleeping at improper times.,
Observe hyperactivity.,
See if they are becoming picky with food or refusing to eat.,
Know why your toddler is staring into space.",How to Recognize an Overtired Toddler2," Most toddlers are bundles of energy when they are well rested. Their attention span is rather short and they tend to move from one thing to the next very quickly. However, when they are overtired, they will move more slowly.


They might sit in the same spot and stare blankly into space.
This is especially noticeable when they are eating, because they will often pause with their spoon or fork halfway to their mouth.
They will also walk more slowly, shuffling their feet as they go.
If they have to walk for a long distance, they will insist on being carried. If they are not carried, they will often sit down on the spot and refuse to walk any further.

, When some toddlers get overtired, they tend to whine, with their voice getting higher in pitch and their words extending in length, especially those ending in the “ee” sound. Other toddlers will talk very quietly, as if it takes all of their effort to speak.


In addition, most toddlers will not enunciate properly when they are tired. Their words will seem to run together, and if there are any breaks in their speech it is not likely that they will occur at syllables or ends of words.
These things make it very difficult for anyone to understand what the toddler is saying.
This, in turn, adds to their irritability, because the toddler cannot express their wants or needs clearly.

, Overtired children are often able to fall asleep when it's not bedtime, perhaps while being driven in a car or while watching cartoons. Conversely, they may refuse to to sleep when it's bedtime. Although sleep is what an overtired toddler needs the most, they will tend to resist taking a nap or going to bed.


Often they will have a temper tantrum or a meltdown at nap time.
Once the toddler is finally laying down for a nap, it might be difficult for them to actually fall asleep. It is likely that they are having trouble relaxing and settling down because their minds are on overdrive processing all that they have seen and done so far that day.

, Too much jumping, climbing, or running may seem confusingly energy-intensive. However, although it seems that kids are full of energy, this kind of hyperactivity suggests that is their time for rest and sleep. Very often, this hyperactivity results in long repetition of a single action.


For example, jumping or running around the table over and over again.

, Toddlers might also refuse to eat, even their favorite foods, when they are very tired. They might just poke at the food or sit and stare at it. Sometimes, they might push the whole bowl or plate across the table or onto the floor. When your child refuses to eat or is picky with food, it gives you a sign that the time for a meal has passed, and that it is time for him or her to sleep.

, If you notice that your child is staring blankly during play or when you talk about something, it's a sign that he or she is overtired. This is because the child cannot focus on what you are saying because he or she is mentally fatigued.

"
"
Observe the child's behavior.,
Make a predictable routine.,
Set limits on demands.,
Reduce the intensity of the before bed hours.,
Pay attention to the child's daily nap.",How to Recognize an Overtired Toddler3," When you notice the first signs of fatigue react promptly. Try to reduce the intensity of the events and games they are participating in as soon as possible. This will allow the child to be quiet and prompt them to go to bed.

, Schedule your obligations and make a routine to get the child accustomed to sleeping at a certain time. Creating a regular sleep schedule will ensure that they are ready to go to bed on time and get enough rest. This routine should include a meal, calming activities before bed, such as a bath and perhaps reading a picture book or storytelling.


If the overtired scene repeats itself every day, you probably need to change the child’s schedule, and give him dinner earlier and put him to bed earlier.

, Toddlers can seem tireless, and when they are overtired they can be very demanding regarding their bedtime routine. Perhaps they need water, they need to go to the toilet, they want one more story, one more kiss. Set limits on these demands to avoid the infinite prolonging of nighttime rituals.

, If your child is too tired, he or she will probably refuse to sleep. Calm him or her down before bed by reducing the intensity of what is happening around him or her.


Reduce the light by hanging window shades and turn on the lamp instead, because it emits less light. Lack of light increases the levels of melatonin and sends the child a signal that it is time to sleep.
Remove toys and replace them with other games like puzzles, which do not require a lot of physical involvement. Toys can frustrate tired kids, so it's best to not play with them directly prior to sleep.
Talk quietly to calm your child. He or she will probably begin to imitate you and will calm down.
Play slow and soothing music that has a calming effect.

, Toddlers need 12-14 hours of sleep at night and 1-2 hours sleep during the day. Be sure to put your child to sleep during the day even when he or she refuses, to avoid tiredness.

Try to react neutrally.,
Ask your child where he learned that word if he repeats the word on another occasion.,
Distract your child.,
Understand why avoiding punishment can help to keep your child from swearing further.,
Employ small forms of punishment if swearing becomes a regular problem.",How to React when Your Toddler Swears1," Many toddlers who say a swear word are just trying out a new word and want to get a reaction from their parents. If you have a dramatic reaction to your child using a swear word, chances are they will do it again when they want to get your attention. The first time your child swears, try to ignore it—don’t laugh, snicker, or discipline. They want a big reaction from you, either good or bad, so don’t give them one.Swearing for most toddlers is simply an experiment to see what you’ll do. If you don’t respond, most toddlers will naturally stop swearing.;
, Again, do not react passionately to your child swearing. Instead, react neutrally. Calmly ask your child where he learned that word. Knowing where your child picked up the word can help you to limit the number of other swear words he picks up from the same place.


For example, if your child watches a certain TV show that has swear words in it, consider blocking that show on your TV.

, If your child keeps repeating the word as they wait for your reaction, distract them with a story, song, or another activity. They most often will forget about the swear word and trying to get your attention if you give them positive attention in a different way.


Put on your child’s favorite song and sing along, or change the setting by telling your child that it is time to go play outside.

, It may seem counterintuitive, but try not to discipline your toddler too much for swearing. Toddlers don’t understand what the word means and are simply doing it to get a reaction.


When you punish your child for swearing, he will remember how you respond to swearing and may do it again if he wants to get another reaction out of you.

, This isn’t to say that small forms of punishment aren’t effective if swearing becomes a long-term problem for your child. Consider putting your child in a time out whenever he swears. This is especially useful if your child is swearing out of anger, as a time out gives him time to calm down.


Most children naturally outgrow their swearing experimentation if you simply ignore their behavior. For other children it takes more rules and work. Setting rules will be covered in the next section.

Explain to your child why swear words are bad.,
Set rules for the whole family.,
Understand that you don’t necessarily need to explain what the word means.,
Give your child alternatives.,
Reinforce positive language.",How to React when Your Toddler Swears2," If swearing becomes a bigger problem and your child is repeatedly swearing even though you aren’t giving him a reaction, it may be time to set some family rules about swearing. Calmly explain to your child that swear words aren’t nice words and that he needs to use nice words in his conversation. There are books that you can read to your child to help him understand why swearing his bad.


Read books to your toddler about using kinds words, such as “The Berenstain Bears and the Big Blooper” or “Elbert’s Bad Word” to help him understand the importance of nice words.

, Part of teaching your child to use nice words is getting your entire family to use those same nice words. As toddlers grow, they begin to learn what other “bad” words mean. These words might not be swear words, but can include potty humor and derogatory terms. Set rules as a family to always say nice things and set the example yourself.Come up with a minor punishment for anyone in the family who uses a swear word, even yourself. This minor punishment could be sitting in the ‘time out’ chair for a couple of minutes, or giving up a favorite toy (such as your child’s favorite stuffed animal, or your cell phone) for five to ten minutes.

, If your child questions you about why he can’t say that word or refuses to stop saying it, simply tell your toddler, “That’s not a word you can say here” and tell him that it isn’t a nice word. You don’t have to explain what the word means to help your child realize it isn’t a nice thing to say.


Explaining what the word means to your child could inadvertently give your child more reason to say the word.

, When you come up with your house rules, you don’t need to set out every word your child can’t say. However, you can teach him some words that he can say when he gets angry or frustrated. Come up with fun alternatives to swear words, like “shoes” rather than the ‘S-word’.Creating alternative words can help your child to let out his frustration without having to say a bad word.

, Reinforce this positive language by rewarding your child with praise or a small prize when you hear them saying nice or positive things. You can also praise or reward your child when you hear him using the alternative word you created, rather than the swear word.


This reward could be a sticker, or some other small trinket that your child can collect.

"
"
Keep your own language in check.,
Talk to your child’s friend’s parents if your child is learning swear words from his friends.,
Inform your child’s daycare about your family rules concerning swearing.",How to React when Your Toddler Swears3," Children model what they see and hear from others, so take a look at your own language. Clean up your language when your toddler is around, and encourage family members and friends to do the same. Save your adult TV shows and movies for a time when your child isn’t around—if they hear a character swear they are likely to repeat it because they know it will get your attention.Some family members or friends might think it’s cute that your toddler swears and may egg him on. Doing so just reinforces the bad behavior and teaches the child that he can get a big reaction with a bad word.

, If your child has friends who swear and he picks up the language from them on a regular basis, consider talking to the other child’s parents to see if they can encourage their child to use nice words around your toddler.

, If your toddler attends daycare, let his teacher know of your family rules about swearing and how you hope to handle the situation. Create an open relationship with the daycare instructor so she can tell you if your child swears.


If it happens repeatedly while you aren’t around, reiterate the swearing rules and remind your child of nice words he can say instead. You can also give the daycare instructor permission to take away privileges for swearing.

To start, have your toddler sit in your lap for one full minute. Challenge your child to sit as still as possible. Gradually lengthen the time until your child can sit still for longer stretches.


Do not entertain your toddler too much during these practice sessions. Playing, tickling, singing, and the like defeat the purpose: you’re trying to get your child to tolerate peaceful stretches of time without entertainment.
As your toddler improves at this exercise, you can switch from your lap to a chair. Sit next to your child and continue to challenge him to sit still.;
, Reading aloud engages your toddler in a quiet, attentive activity, building his or her ability to focus and sit peacefully. Teach your toddler to pay attention to details: ask questions and point out interesting things in the pictures.

, Make sure your toddler has access to paper, crayons, pencils, and/or paint. These activities are also engaging and encourage a longer attention span. Challenge your child to finish a picture before moving on to something else.


At first, it may help to participate in these activities alongside your child. Having your attention may encourage your child to focus on an artistic endeavor for a longer period of time. As he or she learns to be more focused and attentive, you can begin to sit back and watch.

, Try to get your toddler to play with blocks, puzzles, and other games that don’t involve physical activity. These games help toddlers develop memory skills, fine motor coordination, and the ability to sit still.

, Choose some regular times to sit quietly together as a family, perhaps at the beginning of a meal or at some designated time for quiet reading. If your toddler sees his or her parents and siblings modeling appropriate activity, he or she will catch on more quickly.

, Young children should learn to sit quietly at the table during meals. Make sure your child understands that running around during meals is unacceptable; he or she needs to sit still and finish eating before getting up to play. Because mealtimes occur so regularly, they offer a great opportunity for practicing your toddler’s skills.


Set a good example during mealtimes. When you sit down to dinner with your family, do not get up to answer the phone or see what’s on television.
Consider letting your child bring a doll or teddy bear to the table as a dining companion. Point out that the doll or teddy does not jump around at the table.

, When your toddler does a good job sitting still or paying attention, offer lots of specific praise. Consider offering a small treat – a piece of chocolate, a trip to the park – for particularly good behavior.

, If you are going to be in a situation where your toddler will have to sit still, start preparing early. Let your toddler know what the situation will be and what kind of behavior you expect. Typical situations include:


Restaurant meals. Even more than meals eaten at home, meals eaten at restaurants demand good behavior. Don’t expect miracles – choose family-friendly restaurants – but let your toddler know that he or she needs to sit still and behave.
Haircuts. If your toddler wiggles, fidgets, and jumps around, it will be very difficult to manage a good haircut. Explain this to your child in advance, and suggest that he or she sit as still as possible and watch the haircut in the mirror.
Medical examinations. Children do need to sit still during medical exams, especially for blood tests and other lab work. Prepare your child in advance. During the exam, try to occupy your child as best you can. Distract by pointing out colorful paintings or drawings, and use your imagination: a drop of blood can be a ladybug or raspberry juice.
Church, concerts, and theater performances. Again, prepare your child in advance. Understand, though, that your child may not be able to sit still for something as lengthy as a church service or a concert. Plan to take quick breaks, taking your child outside to burn off some energy.

, You cannot expect a hungry, thirsty, exhausted, or otherwise uncomfortable toddler to sit still and behave; it will not happen. Don’t attempt any event that requires sitting still without feeding your toddler and making sure his or her other needs are met.

, When your child needs to sit still, whether it’s during a meal or at a doctor’s appointment, it helps to offer a distraction. Have your child focus on a painting on the wall, his or her image in the mirror, a silly song or story – anything that works. If necessary, bring favorite toys, picture books, and snacks.


In rare cases, you may want to break out a cartoon or electronic device. This can work when you really need your child to stay still – as at the doctor’s office or barber shop. But don’t use this strategy very often; you’ll only teach your child to zone out in front of a screen.

, When your toddler is running around, you can dress him or her in play clothes and sneakers. When you are doing something that will require “best behavior,” change clothing to reflect your expectations. Teach your child to recognize the difference.


Do not, however, dress your child in anything too stiff, uncomfortable, or confining. This could backfire, making your child more fidgety than ever.

, Children have the right to play and enjoy a carefree childhood, but you still have to keep things under control. Remember that you set the rules, and you need to expect your toddler to respect them.


At the same time, keep your expectations in check. Don’t punish a toddler for failing to sit quietly through an hour-long church service; that’s not fair. But do consider mild, age-appropriate punishments for bad behavior.

, Although you are the authority, you can still give your child some control. Let your toddler make some decisions. Will he or she sit in your lap or in a chair? Does he or she want apple slices or cheese cubes? Permitting your toddler to make some choices will allow a sense of independence and control.

, Let your toddler know that you are proud when he or she sits quietly and behaves well.

Hitting or spanking your toddler, especially combined with an outburst of anger toward your child, teaches that hitting is a way to solve problems.
Try to take advantage of breaks from your child so that you are able to relax and get a fresh perspective. Taking care of a toddler can be exhausting. Find a parent group or ask a relative or friend to fill in occasionally. Even going for a quick walk or trip to the store while your partner watches the child can help.;
,


The average toddler needs between 10 and 13 hours of sleep daily. Most benefit from a two-hour afternoon nap. Overly tired children will act out and become difficult to handle.
Establish a bedtime routine and try not to deviate from it. Children will find numerous ways to postpone going to sleep. Stick to your established routine as much as possible.

,


Try to make following the rules fun for you both. Make a game of it and praise your toddler excessively when he does something positive.
Reinforce the idea that good behavior gets positive consequences while poor behavior does not. If he behaves well at the store, he gets a small toy and lots of praise. If he misbehaves, he doesn't. Make positive consequences for good behavior more significant than punishment for bad behavior.

,


Use music or play to redirect his behavior. Lead him into another type of activity.
If this does not work, remove the toddler from the situation, firmly telling him ""no."" Take away objects that could harm him or get broken.

,


Don't change nap times or reward or ignore poor behavior. You cannot be perfect, but consistency is the key to establishing good behavior in your toddler.

,


You cannot expect a 2-year-old to behave like a 10-year-old. Know what is considered normal behavior for toddlers. Demanding that your toddler remains quiet during a 2-hour concert, for instance, is unreasonable.

,


Assure him with your words and actions that you love him even when he is behaving badly. Never tell him he is ""bad"" or use abusive language. Remain firm and in control when disciplining him, but let your toddler know he is safe and loved at all times.

,


When you are off your normal routine, look for ways to keep your child from becoming too tired or anxious. If your child is ill or hungry, he may act out. Be prepared and find ways to keep the situation from getting out of hand.

, Discuss discipline, nap time and daily routines with your daycare or babysitter.


You may build your home schedule around that of the daycare, for instance, since it is easier for you to adapt to their routine rather than expecting them to conform to yours. If children are given naps from 1-3 p.m., for example, attempt to continue this nap time at home.
Be sure that the childcare workers who deal with your child share your methods of discipline and have similar goals and expectations for your toddler's behavior. Communicate frequently with them so you know what is going on when you are not there.

,


Children are exceptional imitators. Be sure the rest of the family observes polite behavior such as saying ""please"" and ""thank-you"". Expect your toddler to use those phrases as well.

, Share items with your toddler to teach him that sharing is an important social skill.


While having the occasional squabble over toys is a natural part of growing up, try to teach your child that it's more satisfying to give and share than to get and keep everything you see.

"
"
Determine a good time schedule.,
On average, a two-year-old sleeps about 11 hours at night and two hours during the day, although this is not a solid rule.

,
Be sure your child has enough physical exercise.,
Agree on a consistent word (preferably one word) that he/she can associate with sleeping.,
Plan out a routine for the child to wind him or her down with.,
Make your home quiet and dim lights an hour before bedtime to allow your child to transition from daytime to nighttime.

,
Prepare everything: the crib or bed, the child, and you.,
Instead of reading consider singing the same song every night or repeating the same poem every night as a sleep cue.,
Children love a schedule, so follow the exact same routine daily and soon they'll know exactly what to expect.,
Teach your children to stay in bed and lie quietly.,
You can also try rubbing his or her back.",How to Put a Two Year Old to Sleep," Allow plenty of hours between nap time and bedtime. If they are too close together, your child is unlikely to sleep.;
,, Two year olds have a lot of energy, and if it's not burned off, it may interfere with sleep later on.

, Examples would be ""night"", ""nappy"", or ""la-la"". If your child understands what's going on, there's a better chance of cooperation.

, Typical routines include a bath, a sippy cup, pacifier (if he or she still uses one), story time, or a lullaby.

,, This is the time when you change their diaper, pull anything out of the bed/crib, and grab a book to read to him or her.

, This will streamline the routine to make it always the same and not having an extra-long book to read some nights.

, They'll know that first comes a bath, then a story and song, then it's time to sleep.

, You can practice this during the day.

, Many children find physical touch very soothing and reassuring. Even two year olds like a nice back rub once in a while.

Be patient.",How to Teach Your Toddler to Share," Sharing requires a certain degree of empathy, which infants and very young toddlers are not capable of. You can teach a toddler in the right age range to share, but it will come through conditioning, not a desire to share. You will have a very difficult time if you try to force your toddler to share at too young an age.Most toddlers cannot be taught to share until around two or two-and-a-half years of age.
Toddlers younger than two years of age will play alongside other children but usually will not play with them. This type of play will not be conducive to teaching how to share.
Don't force toddlers to share if they're highly resistant. If your toddler gets temperamental, distract them with another toy.;
, Sharing does not come naturally to toddlers. They tend to want things for themselves, and your efforts at teaching them to share will initially be met with resistance. Be patient and keep showing your toddler how to share.You may want to start by having your toddler playfully share something with you. Say, ""Can mommy/daddy play with that toy?""
Ask to play with a toy your toddler isn't currently using so it will be easier for them to give it up.
Gradually move towards asking your toddler to share with others, such as siblings or other family members.

, One reason toddlers are reluctant to share is that they often mistakenly think losing possession of a toy means they've lost permanent ownership of it. You can help teach your toddler that sharing is safe by returning the toy you ""borrowed"" back to your toddler.


Point out that you're returning the toy. Say something like, ""See? Mommy/daddy promised you'd get your toy back, and here it is.""

, If your toddler isn't ready to share with other people yet, they might be willing to share with a favorite doll, stuffed animal, or action figure. For example, if your toddler is playing with a car and you notice their favorite stuffed animal isn't being used, take a car that isn't being used and put it by the stuffed animal, saying, ""Can teddy bear play with this car until you need it?""You can encourage your toddler to directly share with dolls during nap time. Tell your toddler that there is only one blanket and one pillow, so your toddler and their favorite doll (or stuffed animal) must share it and nap together.

, If your toddler is having a hard time learning to share at home, you can try making a game out of it. Set up a situation in which your toddler will be given multiple objects that must then be given away to other members of the family. Be sure your toddler gets one of whatever is being passed around so that they don't feel excluded from the sharing.Hand your toddler something that can be distributed, like a bundle of fresh flowers.
Instruct your toddler to share the objects (in this case flowers) with everyone in the room. Say, ""Make sure mommy, daddy, and your big sister all get flowers.""
Praise your toddler for distributing the flowers instead of trying to keep them all.

, When you set up a playdate for your toddler, it's important to let them know in advance that you'll expect them to share. They may not be expecting it if they're new to sharing, so reinforce your sharing expectations the first few times you institute sharing, and be sure to give your toddler at least a full day (or a few) to prepare.If you arrange a playdate or take your toddler to daycare, reinforce that sharing is expected. You can start conveying these expectations a few days in advance to prepare your child.
If giving multiple days' notice, remind your toddler each day. Say something like, ""When your friend comes over, you're going to have to share your toys.""

, If you try to teach sharing by making your toddler part with their favorite toy, it will not end well. Toddlers may begrudgingly share some toys if you force them to, but they will not willingly give up a special toy that is one of their favorites.Ask your toddler for input as you decide which toys are too special to share. This will make your toddler feel like they have a say in the matter., Give the toddlers two of each toy. Make sure they're all of the same type of theme so that both toddlers are playing the same types of games and will want the same types of toys. This may not prevent conflicts, but it can certainly reduce the likelihood of them happening.Encourage your toddler and their playmate to exchange toys of the same type and share for a while. Do this in small doses, especially if they're reluctant or resistant.
Only provide two of each toy type if there are two toddlers. If there are three sets of toys among two toddlers, for example, one toddler may want to have two and will only give the other toddler one.
Be sure the toys are similar to prevent squabbles. For example, you might provide two balls of Playdough and two boxes of dolls or cars (or whatever your toddlers play with), or if they'll be playing in a sandbox, leave two buckets and shovels out., Your toddler may have a hard time jumping right into sharing desirable toys, especially if they're new to the concept of sharing. One way to ease your toddler into sharing is to create situations where your toddler won't realize that they're sharing.Have your toddler and their playmate share a couch, chair, beanbag, or floor space.
Encourage sharing by giving both toddlers bubble wands and making them share the bottle or cup full of bubble soap. This is best done outdoors to prevent spills and stains.
If using bubbles, you can gradually work towards sharing the same wand and bottle. Hold the wand, dip it in the bottle, and have the two toddlers take turns blowing bubbles while you continue to hold everything.
Point out that your toddler and their playmate are sharing the bubbles, the wands, and the couch or chair.

, If your toddler is reluctant to share a toy, frame it as an issue of waiting their turn rather than giving something up. Say something like, ""I promise you will get your doll back. Right now your friend is playing with it, but you will have a turn after her.""Try setting a timer for two to five minutes.Tell your toddler, ""When the timer goes off, you have to give the toy up. But when it goes off after that, you'll get it back.""Take away any toy your toddler refuses to share. Leave it on a shelf out of reach and tell your toddler, ""The toy will stay there until you can share it.""

, Real, altruistic sharing will take several years and a lot of practice; however, any time your toddler successfully shares something, even for short periods of time, you should offer praise.Tell your toddler, ""You did a great job sharing your toy today!""
Consider using gold stars on a chart that leads up to a reward if your toddler successfully shares a certain number of times. For example, you might say that after the tenth gold star sticker, your toddler some extra special play time, such as a movie or a trip to the park.

, Even if things are off to a good start, there's a chance one toddler may refuse to share or snatch a toy away from the other toddler. If this happens, you'll need to step in to defuse the situation.If one toddler refuses to share a toy, try distracting them with a different toy. If this doesn't work, you can try distracting the toddler with a game, or try moving the entire playdate to another room to disrupt their social dynamic.
If the toddlers are snatching a particular toy or fighting over it, you can either take the toy away and hide it, offer a duplicate (or something similar to it) to one of the toddlers, or end the playdate early.

, Your child may be young, but they will still recognize when you're saying one thing and doing another. You obviously share countless things each day, but it's important that you point these things out to your toddler so that they understand what you're doing.Every time you lend something to someone else, even for a few minutes' use, explain to your toddler that you're sharing.
Say something like, ""Did you see that? Mommy/daddy is sharing the newspaper because it's nice to share.""

, Your toddler may be afraid of sharing because they think that they won't get a turn, or that they'll never see that toy again. You can help calm some of these fears by talking to your toddler about their feelings and identifying the roots of them.Ask your toddler, ""Why don't you want to share? Are you afraid you won't get to play with it?""
Remind your toddler that they and their playmates can both use the same toy. Then ask your toddler if they can think of any ways to make that easier., Some books are designed for toddlers ages one to three years old. These books cover a number of subjects, including sharing. These types of books can help reinforce what you teach your toddler by covering a variety of sharing scenarios.Get your toddler involved in reading the book by having them turn the pages and ask or answer questions about what's happening on each page.
Read the book for several days in a row, especially in a lead-up to a playdate with another toddler.
If your toddler refuses to share while playing with another child, remind your toddler of the lessons from the book. Say something like, ""What happened in your book when the bear wouldn't share with anyone?""

, Sharing, even at home with a parent, will take time and work on your part. It will likely take much longer to teach your toddler to share with others outside the family. Your toddler may share begrudgingly if you instill these lessons, but don't expect your child to share out of generosity until at least three to five years of age."

Start a routine which they know precedes bedtime.,
Brush their teeth.,

",How to Put a Toddler to Bed," Kids thrive on routine. Usually things that start to slow them down will help get them sleepy and prepare them for bedtime. Some nighttime routines include:


Giving the kid a bath. This will not only clean them up, but the warm water will comfort them and hopefully induce sleep.
Read a book to them.
Settle down by doing something calming like doodling or playing with Play-Dough, simple meditation, or water play.
Sing the child a lullaby.;
, If it helps, you may brush your teeth along with your toddler to keep it fun and interesting for them.

Recognize that children are always learning to control their environment.,
Learn to recognize an oncoming tantrum.,
Choose a tantrum rug.,
When a child begins tantrum behaviours, tell the child (WITHOUT raising or changing your voice or expression) that the way they are behaving is unacceptable Do NOT tell the child THEY are naughty or bad.,
Tell the child (again WITHOUT raising your voice or changing your expression) ""You are not allowed to throw tantrums here."",
When telling the child that they cannot throw the tantrum 'here', pull out the ""tantrum rug"".,
Tell the child WHILE picking them up (this obviously only works with small children), that they may only throw tantrums on the tantrum rug.

,
Take them to the rug and gently put them on the rug.,
Because the adult has made a choice about the tantrum and is now controlling the environment, the tantrum usually loses appeal.

,
Do this whole process with as much calm as possible.,
When the child has stopped the tantrum (often this happens the instance they touch the rug) ask if they are done or if they want to stay on the rug a bit longer?

,
AS SOON AS the tantrum is over, pick the child up and give them a hug, tell them you are proud of them for learning to act nicely and ask if they want to put the rug away…then put the rug away.

,
If they again begin showing signs of throwing a tantrum, put the rug back out and repeat the process.",How to Quickly Defuse a Toddler Tantrum with the Tantrum Rug," This also includes learning to control the adults in their environment.;
, When a toddler begins to throw a tantrum, it will be indicated by yelling, thrashing, kicking, holding their breath, flailing arms, etc. The tantrum may include any or all of these behaviours.

, This can be a mat or towel or something, that has a well defined area. It should be readily accessible to the child during the anti-tantrum training period. Preferably it should be an object you do not want to keep long term or that will be kept in a cupboard or out of sight most of the time.

, You could say, ""When you act this way, people do not know you are nice.""or ""when you throw a tantrum, it makes everything that is nice about you hide"". Children are much more sophisticated in their understanding than most give them credit for.


They should be told the truth about how their behaviour affects other's opinions of them, even if they are very young. They may appear not to hear or understand what you are saying, but say it anyway.

, This is the key. The tantrum is the child controlling their environment in an inappropriate way. The adults in the child's life need to teach the child that tantrums are an unacceptable way to control their environment.

,


Place the 'rug' in an area less central to the room, (usually toddlers tantrum are thrown centre stage). Lay the rug in a safe place away from heaters, stairs, doors, sharp objects or heavy things that can be toppled like bookshelves.

,, Sit beside them and without raising your voice explain calmly that this is the only place they can throw the tantrum. If they try to roll off the rug, calmly roll them back on and tell them repeatedly that until the tantrum is over that this is the only place they can kick and scream like that. If the child is striking at you, stand and step away, only moving in to put the child back on the rug.

,, Even if you are certain that the child has no idea what you are saying or can even hear your words, still speak them in a controlled manner.

,,, Most children only need a few 'tantrum rug tantrums' to accept that they are not in control of the adult or their environment.

, Do all you can to make the baby a reality for the child. Have him talk or sing to your belly. Let him feel the baby moving around in there. If possible, bring him to your prenatal checkups, and ask the doctor to let him listen to the baby's heartbeat.

, Ask him for baby name ideas, or let him pick out something special for the nursery.

,, Tell him what he was like as a newborn. Explain that, just like him, the baby will be a big kid someday.

, Choose one that is about the size of a newborn and is as lifelike as possible. Show him how to take care of it so that he'll understand what you're doing when the new baby comes along. It'll help him to realize that his new brother or sister will be very fragile and will need lots of care.

, When friends come to visit the new baby and bring gifts, they will probably bring gifts for your toddler, too. If not, you can keep your toddler from becoming jealous by pulling out a gift from your secret stash.

, When the new baby comes, put your toddler in charge of making sure that visitors are gentle with the baby. This will, he'll behave well, too.

, Read to your child while nursing your infant, or play make-believe with him while changing the baby's diaper. It's important that your toddler doesn't feel left out when the new baby seems to be getting all the attention and care.

You can’t supervise your toddler every minute, but watch them as closely as possible when they are up and about.

Take extra care to watch your toddler in hazardous areas, like around windows and stairs, in the kitchen, or in the bathtub.
Watch your toddler closely around furniture that they might be able to climb, like chairs, tables, and dressers.;
, A lot of falls and other accidents can be prevented simply by keeping your toddler away from stairs and other hazards in the home. Put safety gates at the tops and bottoms of stairs, or in the entrances to rooms that contain other potential dangers. You can also use a safety gate to keep your child in their room or play area.Do not use accordion-style gates, since these can trap your child’s head or limbs.
Use hardware-mounted gates (as opposed to gates that are held in place by pressure) for greater security.
Many toddlers are excellent climbers, and can easily master the art of climbing over a safety gate. Always keep a close eye on your toddler, even if you have gates in place.

, Falls from windows are a common cause of injury or fatality in toddlers and young children. Prevent accidents by installing child-safety window guards around any windows that your toddler can easily reach.Child window guards should be attached securely to the window frame with screws, and should have bars no greater than four inches (10.16 cm) apart.
Look for window guards that can be easily opened by adults or older children. You may need to use the windows as an escape route during a fire or other emergency.

Observe closely to make sure that your child does not put anything hazardous in their mouth (like potentially poisonous plants or small rocks).

, Use a locked fence around any swimming pools, ponds, or bodies of water on your property to avert drowning. If you take your toddler swimming, always keep them within arm’s reach.Always carefully supervise your toddler in or near the water, even if they’re wearing a life vest or other flotation device.

, Your toddler should always wear a helmet when riding a tricycle, bicycle, or scooter. If your child plays sports, make sure to get appropriate safety equipment (e.g., helmets, knee pads, or wrist guards)., It’s easy for toddlers to get dehydrated and overheated when they are playing outside. Their delicate skin is also prone to sun damage. Keep your toddler safe in the sun by following a few basic precautions:Apply sunscreen with an SPF of 15 or greater to your toddler’s exposed skin, even if it’s cloudy out. Reapply every 2 hours.

“Okay, time to cross the street! Remember, always hold Mama’s hand.”
“Let’s look both ways now. Watch out for cars!”
“We never run into the street.”

, Put your toddler in an age-appropriate car seat in the back seat of the car. Make sure your toddler is strapped in at all times when driving, and activate the child safety locks to keep your toddler from opening the car door.

Look for something to do near your home.,
Take your toddler to something they're interested in.,
Find an activity or event that's kid friendly.,
Pick something that's interactive.",How to Plan an Outing for Your Toddler1," Read local newspapers or join parenting groups to find out about activities or events that are happening in your area. Doing things in the area means that you won't have to travel far with your toddler, which can make an event stressful. If you have to return home, you're only a short trip away.


Planning an event nearby also means that you have more flexibility. If your child is sick or the weather is poor, you have more control over rescheduling than if you had planned on driving out of town and staying somewhere.;
, Consider what your toddler is curious about and try to foster that interest. For example, if your toddler is really active, think about taking them to an entry-level gymnastics class. Or if your toddler really loves animals, you could take them to the zoo for a few hours.


Ask your toddler if there's something they've always wanted to do. Your toddler may have some helpful suggestions, even if they just want to run around at the mall's kiddie area.

, You don't have to feel limited on where you take your toddler, but you should ask yourself if toddlers would be welcome. For example, while you could take your toddler to a large art festival, the crowds, lack of space for your toddler to walk around, and potential to break things might make you reconsider.


Similarly, if you want to take your child out to eat, think about if the restaurant usually accommodates children. You'll all be happier if you choose somewhere that's welcoming to families., You might find a place that's kid friendly, but if it isn't interactive, your toddler may tire of it easily. For example, your child might enjoy reading stories in the kids' section of the library, but may soon want to run around and play. Consider taking your child to a museum or exhibit that lets your toddler build or create things.Kids love to touch things, so be prepared to spend time monitoring your child regardless of where you go.

Know where to look for mold.,
Wash after use.,
Take apart all removable pieces.,
Wash in hot water.,
Pre-rinse the parts liquid goes through.,
Clean the cap separately.,
Dry completely.",How to Prevent Sippy Cup Mold1," Mold can end up anywhere in your child’s sippy cup, but there are a few places it is more prone to grow. Straw valves are prone to mold since moisture and food can get stuck in them.Travel valves also can grow mold. Since they slide over cup holes, they can pick up food or moisture that may cause mold.
Any edge that is hard to clean or dry can grow mold. This is why it’s so important to take the sippy cup apart to clean.;
, After your child is finished with the sippy cup, wash it immediately. Leaving liquids in the cup encourages the growth of mold.After your child is done with her drink, take it from her and go wash it. You may want to have multiple sippy cups to use while the other is being washed.

, The first thing to do to properly clean a sippy cup is to take it completely apart. This includes removing tops, straws, spouts, rubber rings, coverings, openings, or anything else that is removable.Food, moisture, and therefore mold can end up between the different parts.


If the sippy cup has a stopper that doesn’t detach, make sure the stopper is open before you wash it.To properly disassemble your sippy cup, make sure to refer to the manufacturer’s instructions included with the cup.
Due to the problem with mold in sippy cups, many companies also now have videos online that show parents exactly how to properly remove all the cup parts.

, When you have disassembled your cup, you can wash it in hot water. You can either do this by placing it on the top shelf of your dishwasher or by washing it by hand.When you wash each part, use a small brush to get into the hard to reach places, like inside the straw. You can also use a toothpick to clean inside valves.

, Pre-rinse parts of the cup that liquid or food may get into, like straws, valves, or other parts that may touch your child’s mouth. Pre-rinsing helps remove food or other particles.Many valves will open if you pinch them with your fingers.
Some sippy cup valves come with their own cleaning instructions, like the Tommee Tippee anti-leak valve. Read the instructions for your cup carefully to see if the valve has any special cleaning instructions., One way you can help prevent mold on the cap of the sippy cup is to clean it separately. After removing the cap and ensuring the pieces are separate or the stopper is popped up, drop the top into boiling water.Let the cap stay in the boiling water for 30 seconds.
Remove from water using tongs or a spoon so as not to burn your hand.
Run the cap through the dishwasher or wash it by hand afterwards.

, Making sure the parts of the sippy cup are completely dry is very important. This ensures that mold won’t grow in any of the moist parts. Don’t put the cup back together until you are positive that it is dry.Make sure you shake all the water from the cup before putting it up to dry. This includes straws and any valves you may have to press open.
You may want to keep the cup parts separate until you are ready to use it instead of storing it back fully assembled.

Choose according to your child's age.,
Be aware of how many hours of TV your child has watched every week, as well as what she is watching.,
Learn about what current TV programs, videos and DVDs are available.,
Find the classics as well.,
Use online resources to help you make good choices for your children.,
Help your child to make good choices about what to watch.,
Follow-up TV viewing with activities or games.,
Allow for creative time without TV.",How to Monitor Your Preschooler's TV Viewing," Choose the shows that provide activities and values that you want your child to see, learn and imitate. To this end, it is important to look for TV shows that:


teach your child something
hold his interest

encourage him to listen and question
help him learn more words
make him feel good about himself; and
introduce him to new ideas and things.;
,


Either note down or keep a record in your head of each week's viewing hours.
Some experts recommend that children limit their TV watching to no more than 2 hours a day. However, it's up to you to decide how much TV and what kinds of programs your child should watch.

, It is important that you help your child to select good ones. Some current good choices for preschoolers include:


""Sesame Street"", ""Mister Rogers' Neighborhood"", ""Blue's Clues"", ""Between the Lions"", ""Reading Rainbow"", ""Barney & Friends"", ""Zoom"", and ""Zoboomafoo"", are some shows that you may want to try.
Many other good children's programs are available on public television stations and on cable channels such as the Disney Channel and Nickelodeon.

, You may remember enjoying certain series when you were young and want your child to enjoy these too. If you have a VCR or DVD player, look for video or DVD versions of classic children's stories and books, such as the Babar stories and the Children's Circle series, ""Stories for the Very Young"" and ""More Stories for the Very Young.""


For your very young child, try the ""Baby Einstein"" series.

, Do some research with reputable sites that are concerned with the quality and content of children's programming.


Parents' Choice, a quarterly review of children's media, including TV programs and home video materials, can help you to choose titles that are suitable for your child.Common Sense Media is a non-profit organization keen to ensure that parents have access to quality information about media products aimed at children, including TV.You can also read about programs in TV columns in newspapers and magazines. Cable subscribers and public broadcasting contributors can check monthly program guides for information.

, After selecting programs that are appropriate for your child, help her decide which ones she wants to watch.


Turn on the TV when one of these programs starts and turn it off when the program ends.
Watch TV with your child. This will help you answer questions and talk about what he sees. Pay special attention to how he responds, so that you can help him to understand what he's seeing.
Read Have Fun Watching TV Shows for Small Children for some ideas on coping yourself!

, Have your child tell you a new word that she learned from a TV program. Together, look up the word in a dictionary and talk about its meaning. Or have her make up her own story about one of her favorite characters from a TV program.


Include the whole family in discussion and activities or games that relate to TV programs.

Visit the library to find books that explore the themes of the TV shows that your child watches. Or help your child to use her drawings or pictures cut from magazines to make a book based on a TV show.

, Make certain that TV isn't used as a babysitter. Instead, balance good television with other enjoyable activities for your child. You don't need to be present or directing everything that your child does when playing with toys, reading, enjoying the mud in the backyard, etc. – it is just as important that he learns to find out about things for himself, including how to bust boredom using his imagination!

Pick a good time of day.,
Pack everything your toddler needs.,
Limit the number of outings you do in one day.,
Research the outing.,
Have a backup plan.",How to Plan an Outing for Your Toddler2," If you can, plan to go out when your toddler isn't hungry, tired or overstimulated. Feeling this way can make your toddler cranky or temperamental during your outing. You might plan on taking your toddler out after they've woken from a nap and had a snack.If you can't avoid taking your toddler out when they're hungry or tired, bring along a few snacks and try to let them rest on the way to the event or activity.

, You never know when your toddler might become ill, you'll have to wait in line, or the weather will change. Be prepared to handle challenges by packing things like snacks, extra diapers and wipes (if your toddler uses them), and distractions to keep your toddler occupied.Small books, puzzles, entertainment, or toys are good distractions for toddlers. Keep these in your bag or car and pull them out just during outings. This will keep your toddler interested in them.
Remember to bring seasonal clothing and other items like extra jackets, sunscreen, or mittens.

, Some toddlers handle a lot of activity well while others become overwhelmed by doing too many things. Think about how much activity your toddler can handle and avoid planning too much for one outing. This can prevent meltdowns.For example, if your toddler easily tires, avoid taking them to the store, the library, and clothes shopping. Instead, break the errands into several different trips so your toddler can nap in between them.

, If you'll be taking your child to an activity or event, try to find out the least crowded time to go and learn about any event rules or policies. Research the cost of the outing too, so you can be fully prepared.


For instance, you might find that there's a discount for taking your toddler to an art class one morning, but you should realize that it may be busier because of the discounted rate.

, While planning for your outing can prevent a number of problems, it's also a good idea to have a backup plan if the outing doesn't turn out the way you wanted. You should bring along a change of clothes for your toddler and have a different outing idea in case your original one doesn't work out.


You might find that a change in the weather means you can't take your toddler to an outdoor event. Have an indoor activity in mind when you take your toddler out.

"
"
Keep your toddler informed.,
Discuss your behavior expectations.,
Ask for your toddler's help.,
Reward good behavior.",How to Plan an Outing for Your Toddler3," Toddlers enjoy routines, so it's important to talk with them about where you're going on your outing ahead of time. This will give you a chance to discuss rules and expectations you have for their behavior. It will also get your toddler excited about the outing.For example, you could say, ""We'll be going to the grocery store this afternoon to get things for dinner. I want you to sit in the cart while we're there and if you behave, you can pick out a snack.""

, Talk with your toddler about the behavior you expect from them during the outing. Don't wait until you're already at the event or activity since your child will probably be paying more attention to their new surroundings instead of you. Let them know any consequences that bad behavior would have and encourage them to behave.You might say something like, ""While we're birthday shopping, I expect you to not whine for toys of your own. If you do, we'll have to leave the store. If you behave, we can have a snack once we've finished.""

, It's also a good idea to ask for your toddler's assistance and opinion. This can make them more cooperative during your outing since they feel like they have some say in what's happening. Try giving your child a few options and letting them pick one.For example, if you're out shopping for new toddler clothes, ask your child which shirt they prefer. Giving your toddler a couple of choices will prevent them from feeling overwhelmed.

, Avoid only responding to poor behavior. Instead, catch your toddler being good. If you see your child following your directions or not getting upset during a challenging situation, tell them they're being really well behaved. You could also give them a small reward for their behavior.For example, you could say, ""I know we had to wait a while to get a table at the restaurant. Thank you for playing and being so patient.""

Sterilize your sippy cups.,
Make a diluted bleach solution.,
Try a vinegar bath.",How to Prevent Sippy Cup Mold2," You can sterilize your child’s sippy cups to help reduce mold growth. You can do this once a week or a few times a month.If your dishwasher has an extremely hot setting, that may sterilize the cups.
You can also try a steam sterilizer.

, A diluted bleach solution can sterilize the sippy cup and help remove mold. To make the solution, add one teaspoon of bleach to a gallon of water.Soak the sippy cup parts for two minutes.
Remember, don’t mix bleach with any other household cleaners. That can cause toxic fumes.
Rinse the cup very well after you soak it in a bleach solution. Let the cup dry completely before you reassemble it.

, Vinegar baths can help reduce mold growth. However, vinegar will probably only kill about 70 percent of mold.To give the cup a vinegar bath, add one part vinegar to three parts hot water. Let it soak for a couple of minutes.Rinse the vinegar off and let it dry completely.

Buy sippy cups with fewer parts.,
Replace sippy cups often.,
Consider using disposable sippy cups.,
Use alternatives to sippy cups.",How to Prevent Sippy Cup Mold3," One way to ensure mold won’t grow in a sippy cup is to buy a cup with fewer parts. These fewer parts make the cleaning process easier. Fewer parts also help you make sure you clean everything.This means there are fewer valves, crevices, and other places for moisture and food to get trapped so mold can grow.
Check the way the cup is made before buying it. Because of the issues with mold growing, some companies like Tommee Tippee are developing sippy cups with easier to clean parts.

, Another way you can help prevent mold from growing in sippy cups is to replace them on a regular basis. Some people use sippy cups for months, even years. This allows more time for mold to grow from skipped cleanings or liquids remaining in them for too long.Think about replacing your child’s sippy cup every two to four months.

, Using disposable sippy cups might be an easy solution to preventing mold. Many disposable sippy cups are cheap enough to replace regularly. Also, many of these disposable sippy cups are made with valve-free lids that are easier to clean and less likely to grow mold.You can find these disposable cups through online or major retailers.
Some of the disposable sippy cups are as cheap as $3 for a 6-pack of BPA-free sippy cups.

, Another way to prevent sippy cup mold is to get rid of them completely. Instead of sippy cups, use alternatives.Cups with straws may be better for speech development.
Try letting your child use a regular cup with some supervision. While it may be messier, it may be healthier and better for her speech and teeth development.

Let your child pick out what’s for dinner.,
Bring your child shopping with you.,
Let your child help in the kitchen.,
Grow your own vegetables.,
Have your child set the table.",How to Make Mealtimes Fun for Toddlers1," Let the child choose a meal to eat. Offer options that you can make from selected foods and let him choose what he wants to eat or how to prepare the food you've chosen. Set limits on time and offer only two choices.;
, Let your child help with choosing the food in the grocery store. This can be a good opportunity to find out exactly what your toddler likes and to teach them the names of different foods.

, Involve your toddler in the preparation of food. Give your child an apron and chef hat and call them your assistant. Let them hand you the food you need to wash or chop, allow them to mix ingredients or give them a piece of dough to knead. Children prefer to eat food that they created themselves.

, If you have the means, let your child help you to grow vegetables in your garden. Watering together and picking the fruits, vegetables and herbs together will help to get the child more invested in the food they are eating before you even begin to prepare it.

, Let your toddler put the plates and cutlery on the table. Provide the child with his own special cutlery, in a unique color or shape, or adorned with the child's favorite cartoon character.


Allowing the child to pick flowers for a centerpiece may also be helpful in making the meal feel “special”, which in turn will make your toddler feel more invested in the meal.

Cut your child’s food into fun shapes.,
Add some fun dipping sauces to your child’s meal.,
Rename foods to make them more interesting.,
Present foods in different ways.,
Turn utensils into airplanes or birds.,
Use your child’s food to teach a lesson.,
Incorporate your child’s name into the food.,
Color your child’s food.,
Play pretend while eating.",How to Make Mealtimes Fun for Toddlers2," One of the easiest ways to get a toddler to eat well and enjoy mealtimes is with creative foods. Even something as simple as a pancake or a sandwich can be fun if it is cut into a unique shape. A few simple cookie cutters and a sharp knife is all that you need to get started.

, To make their meal even more fun, add creative dipping sauces in plastic, toddler friendly bowls and let them experiment. Some toddlers like ketchup and some will be more adventurous- so try a few different dips and let them try them out. This is also a great way to sneak some more fruits and vegetables into their diet.


Make creations with sauces. Sprinkle them over the food in an interesting format. Draw a star, heart, write something, or make a smile. It's easier to do this if you put the sauce in a bottle with a narrow opening.
Pureed carrots are great for dipping. The bright color is alluring and the simple act of dipping the food is fun enough to encourage the toddler to at least try it for a bite or two.
Other dip suggestions include: unsweetened applesauce, hummus, thinned peanut butter and mild salsa.

, Another simple idea is to give the foods different names. A child who is very interested in dinosaurs might eat broccoli if you call it “dino-trees”.


Round out the meal with dinosaur shaped chicken nuggets and the child may be the first one to the table. It is alright if they play with their food, at least a little bit, as long as they eventually eat some of it.

, Make a mountain of grated food. In addition to giving the food a different and interesting shape, it will be easier for the child to pick up and chew.

, If children do not want to open their mouths to eat, you can make them more willing by turning the spoon into an aircraft or bird and the child's mouth into an airport or nest.

, For example, you could arrange carrot pieces on the plate to show the time, so their plate looks like a clock face. Ask them to show you three o' clock, six o' clock, etc.


Create a variety of facial expressions with the food to teach your child what emotions like sadness, happiness, and anger look like. Use sauces and pieces of food for the eyes and mouth. The plate or the piece of bread can be the face.
Teach your child to count by getting them to count how many pieces of food are in a dish and by asking them how many more bites are left until the end.
Teach colors by asking your child the color of a certain food is.

, Write the child's name on the food using some kind of sauce. Tell your child that you have made a special meal for a special child, intended only for him.

, Although a lot of toddler food comes in boring white and beige colors you can make things more interesting by adding a splash of color. Try to use natural colorings where possible, for example:


Pancakes can be turned green by adding spinach. Carrots can turn food orange, for example, you could add pureed carrots into some mashed potatoes. Beetroot can turn food into purple, etc.

, Play at being in a restaurant. Be the waiter and serve your toddler. Offer him a menu and explain what the specialty of the day is (which is whatever you've already prepared, of course).


Make a picnic. If you have a yard, you can set out a meal on the lawn. If you do not have a garden or the weather doesn't permit eating outdoors, why not make a picnic on the living room floor?

Try to present a happy attitude during mealtimes.,
Don't force your toddler to eat more than they want.,
Try not to rush your child and stay at the table until he is done.,
Eat together.,
Stick to a routine.,
Invite one of your child’s friends over for dinner.,
Allow a little mess.",How to Make Mealtimes Fun for Toddlers3," Mealtimes should be a time where each family member can enjoy themselves, even the littlest ones. Stay relaxed and your toddler will be relaxed too.

, Start your toddler out with very small servings so they do not feel overwhelmed and try to keep from berating them into eating just “one more bite”. Fun mealtimes should encourage a lifetime of healthy attitudes about food.

, Do not rush your child. Give him enough time to eat a meal and do not put added pressure on him.

, Eating together is a nice family activity. Be the example for your child. Turn off the TV and enjoy some fun conversation along with your meal.

, Routine is important. The meal should always be at the same time, so eating becomes a habit and the child is always hungry enough to eat when the food is served.

, Invite a friend to join for dinner. The meal may seem more interesting to the child when they have company. Choose a child who loves to eat so that your child has a good example to follow.

, Worrying about neatness during meals may be an additional stress for your child. Expect some mess and accept it, at least until your child is a little older.

Use the USDA MyPlate customized food plan, http://www.choosemyplate.gov/myplate/index.aspx .,
Create a list of your toddler's favorite foods or what they prefer to eat.,

Prioritize the list by nutritional value.,
Integrate fruits or vegetables into every meal, on the side or in the meal itself.,

Make sure that each meal has its own ""weight"".,

Keep healthy snacks as a go-getter throughout the day.,

Treat all new introduced foods as baby food rules.,
Keep the food list as a guide.",How to Make a Feeding Plan for a Toddler," This will give you a list of the food pyramid groups and how much servings should be ideally given to a toddler on a daily and weekly scale.
, You can break it down into meal categories, such as breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack, and dessert or food groups, such as cereal, fruits, vegetables, meats, dairy, etc., See what is healthy and unhealthy and try to substitute foods. Cross out any cookies and put graham or animal crackers in its place.,

Breakfast: blueberry pancakes or waffles, fresh sliced strawberries, small fruit salad, sliced bananas, etc.
Lunch: grapes, Mandarin orange slices, fresh sliced carrots, etc.
Snack: watermelon bites, grapes, etc.
Dinner: sliced carrots, corn, broccoli, eggplant, yam, zucchini, etc.

, Many toddlers aren't up to par in having a big breakfast after waking up, so it's best to keep things very light. Food such as yogurt, a bagel, or fresh chopped fruit are excellent choices without filling them up more than needed., Kids need energy to play and fulfill their physical needs all the time, so it's always good to have granola bars or a healthy trail mix at hand. It can also keep you as a parent healthy by snacking alongside with them., If they don't like it, never force it. Either take a break from the food and attempt later on, or find another food with similar nutrition or in the same food group. See if they'll try it in a different form. Instead of giving them sliced strawberries, see if they like a homemade strawberry smoothie., Monitor your child as you start the feeding plan. It'll start as a ""trial and error"" of nutrition, but as time goes on, the list will be more structured and stabilized with more healthier choices."

Have your toddler to stand up for the most accurate feet measurements.,
Using a ruler, measure both of your toddler's feet from the heel to the top of their big toe.,
Use your thumb to determine if your toddler's big toe is bumping against the end of the inside of the shoe.,
Tell your toddler to walk in the shoes away from you and watch the heel.,
Select the ideal pair of shoes for your toddler.",How to Measure a Toddler for Shoes," Make sure that their feet are flat and their toes are extended straight out, since some toddlers tend to curl their toes.

Make sure your toddler is wearing socks. This will provide a more realistic measurement considering your toddler will always be wearing socks with their shoes.



 

;
,


Since each foot usually varies in size, select the larger of the two foot sizes and add either 1/4 inch (6.35 mm) to 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) to the measurement to account for growth spurts. Then use that specific measurement to determine the correct shoe size.

, Always allow for about 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) between their toe and the end of the shoe.

, If the heel is loose and slips up and down, the shoes may cause blisters.

,

Make sure your toddler's shoes are flexible. Buying stiff shoes will prevent your toddler from being able to bend their feet and is not healthy or comfortable. Also keep in mind that arch support isn't necessary since toddlers will usually outgrow shoes before they are able to wear out the soles.






Choose shoes with a large width. Your toddler's bones are softest before the age of 4, so wide shoes will allow room for their feet to develop properly.






Select shoes made of porous, breathable material such as canvas, cloth or leather. Not only are these shoes more flexible, but they will also allow the air to circulate around your toddler's feet.






Look for shoes with good tread and avoid shoes with slick or smooth treads to prevent your toddler from falling, slipping and sliding.

Use the booster seat swings.,
Do not let your child stand in the swing.,
Swing one child at a time.,
Stop the swing completely.",How to Keep Your Toddler Safe in a Swing1," These swings are specifically designed for toddlers. If the booster swing has straps, make sure to strap your child in place before you begin swinging them.Strapping your child in place will prevent them from slipping or climbing out of the swing.;
, Teach your child that sitting in the swing at all times is appropriate swing set behavior. If your child tries to stand in the swing, stop the swing immediately and redirect them to the correct position. Let them know that standing in the swing is not appropriate.You can say for example, “Donnie, I can only swing you if you are sitting in the swing. You cannot stand while I swing you.”

, Swings are made to carry only one child at a time. If you swing two toddlers in one swing, one of them may fall out and be injured.You can avoid this by letting your children take turns on the swing., It is much more difficult to safely remove a child from a swing in motion. Therefore, once your child is ready to leave the swing, make sure to stop the swing completely before helping them out of it."

Buy an age-appropriate swing set.,
Read the instructions carefully.,
Place your set on a soft, even surface.,
Space the swings safely apart.,
Anchor the swing set.",How to Keep Your Toddler Safe in a Swing2," Make sure the swing set you purchase has booster seats with straps for your toddler.

Additionally, make sure to read, follow and enforce the swing set’s safety tips.

, Try to avoid placing your set on hard surfaces such as gravel, dirt, grass, concrete, and/or asphalt. Instead, set the swing set on loose-fill materials like mulch, sand, wood fiber or chips, shredded rubber or rubber mats.Additionally, make sure to place the set on even, level ground to ensure that it is stable.

, The swings should be placed at least 22 inches (56 cm) apart. This way you can avoid entanglements and collisions while you are swinging your toddler.Additionally, make sure the toddler swings are installed high enough to prevent your toddler from climbing into the swing on their own. CPSC recommends that you place toddler swings at least 24 inches (61 cm) above the ground.

, Make sure to anchor the swing set to the ground per the instruction manual. This way you can ensure that the swing set is stable and will not upend while a group of children are playing on it."
"
Make sure the area is clear.,
Teach your toddler to hold onto the swing's straps at all times.,
Supervise your toddler at all times.",How to Keep Your Toddler Safe in a Swing3," Before you begin swinging your toddler, make sure the area is clear of other children. Additionally, make sure older children know not to start swinging until the front and back area of the swing set is clear of children.While your toddler is young, help them become aware of moving swings and the dangers of standing too close. Let them know that if they stand too close to a moving swing they may get hurt.

, When you place your child in the swing, also place their hands around the swing's straps. Tell them to hold onto the straps tightly at all times.If you see your toddler let go of the straps while you are swinging them, then stop the swing immediately and place their hands around the straps again. Let them know that you cannot resume swinging until they are holding onto the straps.

, While your child is a toddler, you should always be nearby when they are swinging or playing on the swing set. This way you can prevent accidents from happening, as well as socialize them on the appropriate swing set behavior.

Try to place the swing set in an area that it is visible from your living room or kitchen window. This way, you can supervise your children from afar once they are old enough to play on the swing set by themselves.

Make a list of all the things your child likes to do.,
Pick up one activity at a time for short span of 15-20 minutes as a child loses interest very soon if the activity stretches for long time.,
Music is another alternative if your child is fond of, provided you get involved as well.

Role Play: Pick up any story character that your child likes the best and with few pretend characters perform the act with your child. Example: Rabbit and tortoise had a coloring competition and one of them wins the prize (a fruit, nut or anything).
Craft or play-dough: Pick up any used corn-flakes boxes, clear water bottles or any kitchen tissue paper roll. Kids have lots of fun doing such activities. You can make loads of things with these home used things.
A doll bed with the cornflakes box: Just have to cover the box with any coloured paper or even color can be used and just cut one portion from top for the doll’s head.
A clear bottle can be real fun: Put some glitter, any pieces of petals, flowers, strings, coloured yarn, and some water. Pop the cap on it and stick the sticky tape nicely to close it tight.
Play-dough: Your child knows more than enough things that you could help him/her in making with it.

,, You could be longing for a short nap or a talk on the phone with some dear friend, so could be your child. Try to involve your child in most of the activities. Saying ‘Hello’ to one of his/her friend on the phone could be a wonderful idea if you have to speak to your friend as well. Remember: Don’t ignore your child’s need. His self-respect is hurt when you turn down his need.

, So, remember to smile and pat or hug every time your child expects one. A game with a doll, toys, or even hide-n-seek could bring joy to your child.

, In spite of the bed-time story, a story –session or a rhyme-session with your child would refresh both of you for the evening.

, Make sure you are spending a quality time and also making your child enjoy every moment when you are there. Though, at times it’s inevitable to say ‘No’ to your child for some wrong thing or behaviour. Be firm in what you say and mean it. Example: While in kitchen your child wants a knife. You have to give a reasonable answer that its sharp and he could hurt himself. Say ‘No’ firmly and mean it.

,, So, why not to do that.

Try different walking paths.",How to Keep a Toddler Busy in a Stroller3," Interact with your toddler during stroller walks so they feel engaged and excited to be in the stroller. Chat with them about the day and the things they are seeing outside. Do singalongs with them to keep them busy and engaged.For example, you may ask your toddler to describe what they see from inside the stroller. Or you may sing their favorite song to them to keep them occupied.

, Start off the game by saying, “I spy with my little eye something…”. Then, let your toddler guess. Once they get it right, it becomes their turn to spy something based on a color around them.If your toddler knows their shapes, you can also play “I Spy” with shapes, where they have to spot items based on their shape.

, Keep the stroller walks or jogs interesting for your toddler by switching up your walking routine. Go for different walking paths or trails.

Play music throughout the day.,
Sing lullabies at night.,
Teach them to whistle.,
Use books that have songs.,
Watch TV that relies on music.",How to Introduce Toddlers to Music1," Many people use TVs as a way of calming down or entertaining a child, but you can use music for the same purpose instead.Whether you're at home or in the car, chances are you have access to music. Simply let it play in the background while you two go about your daily business and your child will be automatically immersed.


You do not necessarily need to purchase any new music in order to introduce your child to music. Take advantage of your own music collection, free services like YouTube and BandCamp, and commercial radio.;
, Although lullabies are often thought of as being for babies, there's no reason you can't continue to use them for your toddler. After reading them a bedtime story, try singing a lullaby to them every night as part of your daily routine. Research suggests that music with a slow beat may help people sleep; coming from a caregiver it can be especially soothing., Whistling is a skill that many grown ups take for granted but is one that we need to learn in order to be able to use.It's a fun and free way to pass the time, and another activity you and your child can experience together. It's also a great way to help teach them the first basics of notes, range, and beat lengths.To whistle, simply purse your lips and blow air through them.

, Certain children's books have been written in such a way to have or be songs themselves, like ""Puff the Magic Dragon"" and ""Baby Beluga."" Between the musical element and the pictures in these books, young children find them captivating. They usually come with a cd so that you can both learn the song's melody and lyrics to sing together.

, While it's better in general for young children to not watch too much TV, most people have at least one set in their households and use them on a daily basis. Choose programming that incorporates songs for educational purposes, like ""Sesame Street"" or ""Dora the Explorer,"" or shows and movies with minimal talking and classical music such as ""Tom and Jerry,"" ""Looney Tunes,"" or ""Fantasia.""


Educational songs have obvious benefit, but classical music has been scientifically linked to boosted physical performance, eased chronic pain, better sleep, improved moods, reduced stress, and even heightened intelligence."
"
Teach them active songs and games.,
Give them musical instruments and musical toys.,
Play music while playing a puzzle.,
Play video games.",How to Introduce Toddlers to Music2," Kids have a lot of energy and trouble sitting still, and music often makes us want to get up and move anyway. Children show they respond best to music they can actually experience through clapping, running, snapping, and other activities.There are hand motion games like ""The Itsy Bitsy Spider,"" ""Patty Cake,"" and ""Miss Mary Mack,"" which often help children to learn about rhythm and beats.
Try music with dances, activities, or games associated with them like ""The Hokey Pokey,"" ""London Bridge,"" ""The Chicken Dance,"" and ""Twist and Shout.""
Some games like ""Musical Chairs"" don't use any specific song to play but instead any music you choose can be used for a fun time.
Imagination games that utilize toy figures from popular shows like ""The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"", ""Batman,"" or ""Transformers"" usually have memorable theme songs associated with them that could be sung or hummed during play.

, Certain books and toys will play music at the touch of a button or a squeeze. This can be a stimulating option for very young children. Although we usually think of musical instruments as being expensive, too fragile, or too complicated for toddlers, there are definitely cheaper, easy options for youngsters that will let them experiment with creating their own music.


Toy xylophones, toy guitars, and plastic electronic keyboards are a great way to introduce your child to the shape and use of an instrument before giving them the actual thing.

, In the same way that you can put music on in the background for everyday enjoyment, you can play music, especially classical music, while helping your child solve a jigsaw puzzle. Kids enjoy solving puzzles, but they quickly grow tired of any activity that lasts too long. Having music playing in the background may help them to solve the puzzle more quickly in addition to providing enough of a change of atmosphere to keep them interested longer.

, Although many parents generally feel opposed to very young children playing video games, kids are often innately attracted to devices like touch screen phones, tablets, and computers. In addition to helping them learn how to use electronic devices, there are a wide variety of educational games available to help your children learn all kinds of skills, from problem solving to numbers to social skills and empathy.


These games usually have music playing in the background to make them more enjoyable, and especially for games that involve a story, they can help your child to understand and empathize with feelings."
"
Take singing lessons.,
Take musical instrument lessons.,
Try a religious camp or school.",How to Introduce Toddlers to Music3," Both in and outside of school, children can learn to sing. One-on-one lessons with an instructor can help to teach them how to obey instructions from strangers other than their parents, lessons in pre-school may promote socialization with children their own age, and parent-child classes can strengthen familial bonds. Any music class will help promote math, memorization, motor and social skills, as well as patience among many other things., Although parents might think that toddlers are too young to start learning to play a musical instrument, if your child shows an interest, why not indulge it? Instruments like the piano, xylophone, bells, or the recorder are not too difficult to learn to play even for young children. Some places will even allow children to try multiple different kinds of instruments until they find one they especially like.

, If you have a particular faith you believe strongly in, chances are you will want your children to participate too. Many parents will find it a challenge to get their young kids to sit through a lengthy service which requires them to stay still, pay attention, and be silent. There are however other options: some religious institutions offer special classes and camps specifically designed for children that incorporate song and dance. This allows them to express their energy and learn more about your chosen faith in an environment more suited to them.

Go to children's concerts.,
Sing during family road trips.,
Introduce your child to holiday music.",How to Introduce Toddlers to Music4," Although concerts for adults are not generally recommendable for toddlers, there has in recent years been a rise in what are known as children's concerts. These allow children to dance, jump, and sing-along, and no one will give you dirty looks should your child suddenly start to cry or need to leave to go to the bathroom. Some of these can be cheap or free if they are sponsored by your local government, and other productions may be more expensive.


Ice skating shows for kids incorporate similar ideas but may include copyrighted characters and songs that children know and love from movies and TV shows in addition to being on an ice rink. Most likely there may be less room for movement and dancing.

, Trips that are an hour or longer are very difficult for children to sit through due to their high energy levels. You can help to keep your and your child's stress levels down by incorporating songs like ""Old MacDonald"" and ""The Wheels on the Bus,"" as they'll help to keep your child entertained and happy for longer. If it's too much for you to be involved in the singing, though, children's cds or radio stations that cater specifically to children can be an excellent way to compromise between your child's enjoyment and your ability to keep your attention on the road.


Music has a very special relationship to memory; hearing a song can bring back in very vivid details special, happy memories years, even decades, later.You can help to ensure that your child will be able to recall special memories from vacations by associating them with music.

, Most if not all mainstream and major holidays will have music associated with them. This music is not only a way of teaching kids about the themes and stories associated with the holiday but it's also a lot of fun, especially since the music returns every year. It's a great way to help build a sense of community within your family as well as a sense of tradition.

Stay on schedule.,

Pack some surprises.,
Know your limits and your toddler's.,
Pack patience and humor in your suitcase.,
Avoid teaching new things on vacation.,
Make some calls.,
Be extra prepared.,
Prepare your toddler.,
Love and provide extra comfort and attention during vacation.",How to Keep Toddlers Happy While on Vacation," Yes, it gets hard, but being off eating and sleeping times is one of the top reasons why your toddler gets unhappy during vacation. Do your best to avoid off-scheduled bedtime routines and bedtimes, naptime routines and naptimes, eating times, wake up routines and times, etc. It's okay to turn down one outing during vacation for the sake of the rest of your party's ears and heads the next day.;
, Have the adults in your party babysit your child and others (if this is a vacation with more than two willing adults and your toddler won't resent staying with them.) Make sure that you leave your toddler in good hands (not with someone under 13) that has had experience with children before. A grandparent or close friend that your child is happy to stay with and knows well works out best.

, Most of the time, your toddler will miss the security of home. Try packing a few of your toddler's favorite toys in your luggage that weren't used to entertain during traveling. Your toddler will stay entertained during the week and will feel more secure. Always remember to pack your child's comfort item and perhaps borrow a couple of books or toys from your toddler's preschool, daycare, babysitter's house, or playgroup.

, Going on more than two outings each day with your toddler is asking for trouble. Planning an outing in the morning (such as a museum) and an outing in the afternoon (such as the zoo) is plenty. Spend the rest of the day in your hotel room or house, and by the pool.

, You're going to need it. If you're faced with a situation such as your child won't put on their shoes, summon up the patience and say something like: ""Oh, these silly shoes just won't go on. Do you want me to get these silly shoes on or do you want to put them on yourself?""

, If you're on vacation and your toddler finally shows all of the potty training readiness signs, it's best to keep them in diapers until you return home (unless your toddler is begging to use the toilet or is furious about wearing diapers.) Avoid starting weaning from a bottle or pacifier, changing from a crib to a bed, or potty training 2 weeks before leaving for vacation. Your toddler is going to have enough change in his/her life during vacation.

, If your toddler misses their babysitter or friends back home, try making a call. Your toddler will be delighted to hear their voice and talk with them! Another idea is to Skype. Your toddler will see and hear them.

, Make sure that the car seat and stroller are ready for outings. Install a head cushion in the appropriate place on the car seat and stroller for resting and comfy ness. Attach 2-3 small toys to the sides of the car seat and stroller with Velcro, string (no longer than 6 inches), or snaps.


Pack more than you think that you will need. For example, if your toddler normally goes in their diaper 6 times a day and you think that you will need 36 diapers altogether, pack 42 instead. An extra day's worth is sufficient. Pack 2 packages of baby wipes, not 1. If your child just switched to training pants, pack diapers and training pants in case they switch their mind or want the security of similarity on vacation. The same goes for underwear, pack training pants or whatever they were in before underwear. Pack a couple extra outfits for vacation, in case of accidents, dirty days at the park, etc.

, Read age-appropriate books about where you are going, and show them pictures of your room or house where you will be staying, and any other exciting places that you will be visiting. Tell your toddler something to get them excited such as: ""You are going to get to see Grandma and Grandpa on vacation!"" Excite and entice them!

, Hug your child, kiss your child, praise your child, comfort your child, and spend time away from everyone else to relax and enjoy some quality time: just you the parent, and your toddler.


If you are a grandparent that brought the toddler on vacation, you will have to be the person to spend quality time, away from everyone else, for 30-60 minutes each day with the toddler.
Know when to tell the aunts and uncles, grandparents, and preteen cousins who think your toddler is just adorable, that your toddler has had enough. If your toddler has a temper tantrum, cries because of everyone around them, or become otherwise upset, retreat to a quiet room and spend quality time with your toddler for 5-30 minutes.

These new skills go hand and hand with a developing sense of self: the idea that they are independent beings who can control their own actions. These are normal and exciting developments, but for parents and teachers, the toddler stage is a tricky one. Toddlers will engage in many behaviors that are not appropriate or acceptable (including fighting over toys), and adults have to respect their developmental stage while teaching them to respect reasonable limits.


According to Erik Erikson, the psychologist who developed a widely-used theory of psychosocial development, toddlers are in the midst of resolving a particular developmental crisis: “Autonomy (Independence) vs. Doubt (or Shame).” In other words, they are working to resolve the tensions between self confidence and self control.;
, Emotions tend to run high during the toddler years. They feel tremendous excitement about all of the new and different things they are able to do, but, at the same time, they have to deal with “separateness.” Parents may leave them to play independently or expect them to occupy themselves temporarily, and this separation can be scary.

, The concept of independence, of course, hinges on the basic understanding of “me.” Once toddlers understand the distinction between themselves and others, they also begin to focus on the concept of ownership: “mine” as opposed to “not mine.” Fighting over toys is a completely normal manifestation of this emerging knowledge. Sharing threatens toddlers’ perceived ownership of particular items.

, Emphasize that sharing is temporary: another child may take a turn with his or her toy, but eventually, it will be returned.


Note that sharing does not take away ownership. It’s fine to make this explicit for toddlers. Say, “that is your truck. You can let someone else play with your truck, but it is still yours.”

, Before you expect toddlers to share their toys with other children, they can practice sharing with you. Ask toddlers, from time to time, to hand you their favorite toys. Let them learn to be patient. Return their toys after a designated interval, and praise them for sharing. This will help toddlers distinguish between borrowing and taking.

, Point out that sharing a toy is generous and kind. In addition, point out that other children will also share their toys. Everyone will get to play with new and different items.

, Talk to children about what will be expected during play dates and at preschool. Let them know ahead of time that they will be sharing toys.

, Explain what friendship is, and teach toddlers that friendships involve sharing toys and playing together without fighting.

, It helps to be aware of what a particular toddler is struggling with. Does the toddler tend to grab toys away from other children, or does he or she struggle with other children taking toys? Teach toddlers to deal with these issues as best they can.

, Let toddlers see you sharing your possessions with others. If they ask to play with something of yours (assuming that it is safe and not easily damaged), let them. Emphasize the fact that sharing is temporary, and you know you will get the item back soon.

, Once you have observed situations involving sharing, you should be able to determine which issues seem to cause trouble for particular toddlers. Is one child especially protective of a particular toy? Consider letting him or her put that toy away somewhere, off limits, during a play date.

, Plan to let toddlers play together when they are rested and when they have been fed. Hungry, tired, cranky toddlers are guaranteed to fight over toys. Limit play time to one to two hours for toddlers; anything longer is expecting too much from a young child.

, Whenever toddlers are playing together, it is best to have clear, simple rules in place. Any toys that are not meant to be shared should be put away elsewhere. All remaining toys should then be shared, with no exceptions. Consider setting a timer for popular toys, and enforce consistent limits.

, When a child has to give up his or her favorite toy temporarily, offer interesting replacements. If you give a toddler something fun to do, he or she may be too distracted to argue about the original toy.


Generally, it’s best to have lots of choices available. Have enough options around to have multiple alternatives for each toddler.

, Instead of grabbing toys from other children, toddlers should be taught to ask for them. Model appropriate language for toddlers: “may I have a turn, please?”

, If toddlers play a game that requires more than one person, whether it’s a ball game or a board game, they will be less likely to fight.

, When squabbles break out between toddlers, it’s tempting to step in immediately. It’s better, however, to give toddlers the chance to learn and grow. Let them try to resolve the conflict themselves.

, If the toddlers cannot resolve the conflict themselves – as will often be the case – try to keep these three basic concepts in mind. Have compassion for what toddlers are experiencing and struggling with. Respect their convictions, but emphasize the fact that their actions have consequences.

, When toddlers continue to fight over toys, it’s best to separate them and give them time to cool down. Do not allow them to continue snatching toys back and forth. Wait until everyone is calm, and then try to piece together what happened – not so much to determine who is “guilty” but to find an acceptable solution to the problem.


To separate children, simply hold their hands firmly and lead them to separate areas. Ask them to stay put, and insist that they obey. Make sure everyone is calm before you allow them to leave their separate corners.

, If you cannot find a suitable solution, or if the toddlers involved are too upset to discuss the issue, remove the toy. Take it from them as gently and politely as possible, and then put it out of their reach. Ignore any shrieking or crying that results.

, When you step in to resolve arguments, you should give reasons for your actions. Allow toddlers to express themselves, and listen to them. Try to involve them in the decision-making process.

, In general, it’s best to approach fights over toys with compassion and understanding. Let toddlers know that their feelings are valid. It’s fine to say, “I know it makes you sad and angry to share this truck, and that’s okay. It’s fine to be sad and angry. But you need to be a good friend and let Johnny have a turn.”

, If one or more of the toddlers is very upset, you need to take time to calm that child down and validate his or her feelings before you attempt to teach a lesson about sharing. When children are upset, they cannot focus well on learning; they will just get more upset if you try to scold or lecture them.

, Remain neutral, and don’t pay too much attention to which child started the argument. Even if one toddler is clearly wrong, it’s not going to help much to discuss it. Focus on finding a solution.

, Even if one particular toddler is frequently the cause of fights over toys, it helps nothing to label him or her as a “bully” or “meanie.” You should not call children “selfish” or “greedy,” and you should never call them names. Doing so may affect their self esteem and confidence. Furthermore, if you call a child a bully, he or she may start believing it; this will only lead to more of the behavior that you are trying to stop.

, Depending on the situation, you can try enforcing ten to fifteen minutes of quiet time (placing toddlers in their cribs works well for this) or removing the toy in question.

, When toddlers are calm and cooperative again, offer lots of praise. Give them hugs and congratulate them for learning to calm themselves down and work together.

Introduce the sippy cup at the right time.,
Choose the proper cup.,
Get your child familiar with the sippy cup.,
Eliminate the bottle from the feeding schedule gradually.,
Praise your child for using the sippy cup.,
Talk about the cup frequently.,
Figure out what your child really wants when they ask for a bottle.,
Try adding a small amount of breast milk to the spout if your child refuses the sippy cup.,
Experiment with different beverages.,
Show your child how to use the sippy cup.,
Be upfront about the transition.,
Deal with setbacks calmly.",How to Introduce Your Child to Sippy Cups," You want to make sure you don't introduce the sippy cup before your child has the motor skills to handle it. Introducing the sippy cup at the right time will help with a smooth transition.For the most part, doctors recommend starting the sippy cup around six months old. At this point, your baby will be old enough to manage the cup. However, the six month mark is a general rule. It will not necessarily be right for all children. Look for developmental signs your child is ready for the sippy cup, such as a strong grasp and the ability to easily move things from the hand to the mouth.If you're unsure whether your child is ready, talk to your pediatrician.;
, This is especially important when your child is still under a year old. You want to pick a sippy cup your child can easily handle.It's important to get a lightweight cup that is not easily breakable. When your child first starts handling the sippy cup, they will likely drop it a lot.
Look for cups with sturdy handles and those that are leak and spill resistant, as your child will probably have a lot of spills when first using the sippy cup. Try testing a few cups yourself to make sure they're leak and spill resistant.
You may have to try a few different cups. Toddlers and babies will take differently to different colors, shapes, and sizes. Try buying a few different types of lightweight cups that are not easily breakable. See which one your baby likes.

, As a sippy cup is a new item, your child needs time to get used to it. It may be a bad idea to simply introduce the sippy cup only during meal times or when your child is hungry or thirsty.Allow your child to hold and play with the sippy cup outside of meal and feeding times. Your child can, for example, play with the sippy cup in their playpen or when playing with their regular toys.
In stores, there are some sippy cups designed to look like toys. Try opting for this type of sippy cup if you're worried about your child taking to the sippy cup.

, You don't want to make the switch straight from the bottle to the sippy cup. You should transition gradually, as this will make the process less stressful for your child.Say your child usually drinks about three bottles a day. Start the transition by switching the morning bottle with a sippy cup.
For about a week, stick with only using the sippy cup for one feeding a day. The next week, switch out another bottle.
You should switch out the nighttime bottle last, especially if you're transitioning to the sippy cup when your child is at an older age. This way, if your child asks about a sippy cup during the morning or afternoon, you can assure them a bottle is coming later.

, You want your child to feel a sense of accomplishment when they use the sippy cup. Whenever you see your child using the cup, make sure to praise them.Children often like to feel like they're getting older and becoming adults. Try saying something like, ""Look how big you are! You're using a sippy cup all by yourself.""

, You want your child to be aware of the sippy cup throughout the process. If your child is surprised by the sippy cup, they may be reluctant to use it. Therefore, work on reminding your child they will be using the sippy cup on occasion.Talk about the sippy cup before meal times and try to frame things in the positive. For example, ""Aren't you lucky that you're a big girl and get to use your sippy cup today?""

, Oftentimes, a child will ask for a bottle when they really want something else. A bottle can represent routine and comfort. A child may also ask for a bottle when they're hungry. Try to identify the precise need your child has when they ask for a bottle in order to help the transition go smoothly.Ask your child how they are feeling when they ask for the bottle. They may be hungry, scared, sad, or anxious.
If your child does not talk yet, look for non-verbal cues when your child gestures for the bottle. For example, maybe your child heard a loud noise or is in a new environment and is gesturing for a bottle. This may indicate your child is scared.
Provide what your child needs instead of the bottle. For example, give hugs if your child is scared. Provide a small snack if your child is hungry.

, If you're using the sippy cup to transition from breast milk, a child may dislike the taste of cow's milk, formula, or whatever you're putting in the sippy cup. If taste is an issue, try dipping the spout of the cup in breast milk. This may make the transition less jarring for your child., Your child may resist the sippy cup if it's a transition from breast milk. Some children may also dislike drinking breast milk out of a sippy cup. If your child dislikes the beverage being served in the sippy cup, they're less likely to drink from it. Therefore, you may want to experiment with different beverages to encourage your child to use the sippy cup.Try things like juice, cow's milk, water, and other beverages. See what your child takes to.
If your child has dietary restrictions, talk with your pediatrician about safe beverages.

, Your child may get confused on occasion, especially when starting out with the sippy cup. If your child forgets how to use the cup, or is simply having a hard time figuring it out, take a drink out of the cup yourself. Modeling proper behavior can help your child learn., You do not want to spring a sippy cup on your child. If you moved too fast, take a few steps back. Wait a week, and begin showing your child the cup while letting them know they will soon be drinking from it. If your child has some time to mentally prepare, they may take to the cup better., Your child may refuse the cup, throw it, or otherwise act out during the early steps of the transition. Deal with such moments calmly and continue to instruct the child to use the cup. Have patience. Some children will need more time than others to take to the sippy cup, and getting frustrated yourself will only make the situation more difficult. Try to remain calm and collected if your child initially rejects the cup.

Start slow.,
Pick the most appropriate time of day.,
Schedule playdates.,
Consider daycare or preschool.,
Expand your child’s network of potential friends.,
Encourage the children to play by joining them.,
Vary the ages of those they play with.",How to Help Your Toddler Make Friends1," If your child has not had much interaction with other children, consider having just one playmate at a time. This will allow them to acclimate to playing with others before you introduce more children to the mix. Once your child has demonstrated that they can play well, you can have up to four playmates at a time., You will want to ensure that your child has the most positive experience possible while at play. Avoid scheduling a playdate during your child’s regular nap time. Schedule it after they have had their nap and a snack so they will be at their best., The easiest way to ensure that your toddler begins building friendships is to schedule playdates for them. Reach out to your friends with children to set up times to play. If any of your neighbors have children, set up playdates with them. This will give you an opportunity to make new friends, too.Consider scheduling at least one playdate per week for your child.

, Daycare or preschool is also a great option to ensure that your child is getting lots of social interaction with other kids. Some daycares will allow you to sign up for part-time care if you are not open to your child being there full-time.


This is also a way for your child to meet friends who they can have playdates with.

, If you don’t know many others who have children, you can join some parent-child classes in order to meet other parents in the area. Take your baby to the park to see if you can make any connections with other parents there. See if your coworkers have children, too., If your child is shy, it might take a while for them to become comfortable about playing with another child. However, you can encourage play by joining the children on the floor with another parent. Chat with that parent so your child sees how you are interacting, and perhaps they will mimic you and your tone.By modeling positive social behavior, you can show your toddler that interacting with other people can be fun.

, Though you will want your toddler to make friends with other toddlers as well, know that it is okay and even healthy for them to interact with those who are younger and older than them. Interacting with younger children will give them more opportunities to show empathy and caretaking skills. Older children can help them learn new skills and can serve as role models for them."
"
Be authoritative, not authoritarian.,
Speak to them politely.,
Teach empathy.,
Model conflict resolution when they are at play.,
Call your friends “friends”.",How to Help Your Toddler Make Friends2," Children with authoritative parents fare better in making friends than those with a more aggressive parenting style. Do not attempt to control your child’s every move, or else they will look to you for approval for even the smallest of tasks and they will have a hard time trusting themselves. Set limits with your children and have rational discussions with them. Avoid harsh punishments.An example of a rational discussion might be “Ben, do not throw your food on the floor. This makes a mess and mommy has to clean it. If you do it again, I will put you in timeout.”
Explain things to your toddler so they can understand and correct their behavior, rather than just getting immediately punished.

, Sometimes, your children might frustrate you, but you do not want to teach them bad habits that they could carry into their adult lives. Speak kindly to them so they will know how to speak to their potential friends.An example of speaking kindly would be to say “Josie, I know you are frustrated because you can’t have a cookie, but you cannot hit me, no matter how mad you are.” Keep an even, gentle tone when saying this.
An example of how NOT to speak in this instance would be “JOSIE! YOU ARE SUCH A BAD LITTLE GIRL! Never hit me again or I will hit you back!”
Avoid criticizing your child at all costs because they will not understand that the behavior was bad, they will just think that they are bad.
Avoid yelling or raising your voice often. Do not curse at your children.

, Children who are more empathetic find it easier to make friends than those who are more self-centered. Help your child develop a more people-focused approach and teach them that not everything is always about them. A few ways that you can teach them empathy are:Caring for their emotional needs; help soothe them when they are upset, but also allow them to soothe themselves occasionally
Showing sympathy and concern for others
Showing them physical affection
Showing positive interactions with others around you, including your partner or spouse

, Begin showing your toddler how to manage conflicts on their own by giving them the tools to do so. Helping them to build friendships won’t mean much to them unless you show them how to manage any issues that arise. Don’t force them to apologize, but do apologize for them so they learn that this is the right thing to do when they have hurt someone.For instance, if your child has made another child cry, say “Angela is crying because you took the toy from her. Angela, I’m sorry that Michael took the toy from you.”
Allow the toddlers to work out things on their own if the situation is minor and no one is getting hurt.

, In order to help your child develop friendships, you will want them to understand what a friend is. When you are with your friends, call them your friends so your child can begin to understand that concept. When your toddler is with a friend of theirs, they should call them their friend.For instance, you might say “Monica is mommy’s friend, and Joanie is your friend.”

Don’t force them to play.,
Double up on toys.,
Find group activities, instead of toys they play with individually.,
Go to the park or on a walk.",How to Help Your Toddler Make Friends3," You'll want to ensure that you are establishing an environment that is ideal for your toddler to feel comfortable and happy. Even if you have set up a playdate and the other child is friendly, don’t force your child to play. You can try to encourage them by playing with them or addressing any of their immediate concerns like having to go potty, but don’t make them play if they are not in the mood., Though your toddler may be very social, remember that a lot of children have difficulty sharing. If possible, put out two of each toy so that each child can have the same item to play with. This can cut down on a lot of potential arguments or tantrums.You can also provide large toys. Your toddler will be able to share this toy with another toddler. This might be a set of building blocks or a swing set in your backyard.
Consider mixing the toys altogether. Allow your children to freely play without much structure.
Avoid introducing your child’s favorite toy to the mix unless they are typically a good sharer.

, Group activities will give your child a chance to interact with other children. You can also help your toddler make friends by providing activities during their playdates. Perhaps you'll want to set up a mini soccer arena for them in your house or backyard, or a painting studio for them to create art.This will help even the shyest child interact more.

, Most children benefit from having some outdoor time each day. Schedule your child’s playdate at a park, or consider going on a walk with the children. Your toddler will have fun and you will be able to get a bit of exercise in."

Get down to their level.,
Slow down and enunciate.,
Wait for your toddler to respond.,
Listen.,
Respond using a simple method, Repeat-Expand-Repeat.,
Praise your child often.,
If you have concerns, contact a speech language pathologist for a consultation.

",How to Improve a Toddler's Speech," Squat or sit on the floor. This will get their attention. You will talk with your child instead of at her. Also, she will be able to see your mouth and get visual cues on how to say certain sounds.;
, Make sure you slow down your rate of speech and simplify your sentences. Use short phrases with a clear voice. Your child will pick up on how you say words and learn new vocabulary at the same time.

, Many parents do not wait for their child to respond before asking another question or offering another comment. Your toddler takes longer to process speech and language. Give him or her some time and let him or her respond. If your toddler doesn't get to talk, how will he or she learn?

, Make sure you hear all the great things your child says so you can respond appropriately. If not, a great communication opportunity will be lost. Also, children do become frustrated and give up if no one is paying attention to them.

, Repeat what your child says and then expand on it. If your child repeats your expanded phrase, say good job and repeat again! For example, your child says ""car."" You say ""yes, car, it is a fast car."" Your child says ""fast car?"" You say, ""yes! It is a fast car.""

, Offer lots of praise for all communication attempts.

The first place to start is to examine your own feelings about preschool.,
Take the time to visit the preschools in your area.,
Let your child know the night before that he's going to preschool the next day.,
Arrive early.,
If it's your child's first time, ask to stay in the preschool room until your child is comfortable with you leaving.,
When you feel your child is adjusting and is ready for you to leave her, discuss it with her ahead of time.,
Once she's comfortable with her teachers and the preschool room, it will be easier for you to leave.,
Greet your child happily at pickup time and give her a hug.,
Be observant and flexible.,
Be proud of your ""big boy"" or ""big girl"".",How to Help a Toddler Adjust to Preschool," What do you want your child to get out of preschool? What's important to you in a preschool program? Are you finding the thought of your child going to preschool difficult at all? Be aware that if you feel ambivalent about your child going then they will certainly pick up on those feelings and are likely to express anxiety about being separated from you. You need to ensure your own feelings are positive in order for the experience for your child to be positive to resolve any doubts you may have.;
, They often will let you visit them while they are in session, ask questions, and let your child play. Do this well in advance. Many preschools have waiting lists. You may need to register anywhere from 1 week to 1 year in advance! Ask questions such as:


What are the backgrounds of the teachers? What type of experience and training do they have? Will they let you stay in the preschool room until your child is comfortable with you leaving? How do they comfort upset children?
What portion of the program is teacher-directed, if any? What choices do the children get to make?
Will they serve snacks or does your child need to bring food? Are any foods, such as peanuts, not allowed?
Do children need to be potty-trained to attend?
Will there be any special needs children in the class?

, Joyfully say, ""Guess what tomorrow is? Preschool!"" Pack a lunch or snack together. Let your child help decide what to put in it. ""Would you like an orange or an apple for your preschool snack?"" Be excited about preschool. Say things like, ""I bet you're looking forward to playing with the cars."" or ""Hey, you get to see Michelle tomorrow.""

, Be sure to leave lots of time to get there so you're not rushing. Rushing can make you and your child anxious! When you get to preschool, hang his coat up and put his snack away. Then take him to pee, if you didn't before you left home. This will save the teachers time and will reduce accidents. Leave your cell phone number with the teachers in case they need to contact you.

, Plan to stay for at least 1 class. Get cozy; bring a book or magazine! Choose a spot to sit where your child can see you most of the time. Sit back and let your child bond with the preschool teacher(s). Try not to move around; stay in 1 spot so she feels secure, but be willing to get up and help her if requested. How long you need to stay will depend on your child. Children who are very confident and have a lot of experience interacting with strangers will need less time. Children who are more timid will need you to stay longer. Expect to stay anywhere from 1 day to 1 month or more.

, You can start by leaving for short times and see how she reacts. Never sneak off, always let your child know you're going and that you will come back. You can say ""Mommy's going to go buy some ice cream while you're in preschool. Do you want me to buy strawberry or vanilla?"" If she is concerned, you can say ""Mommy will be really quick. Michelle will take good care of you. We can have the ice cream after preschool's over."" Give her a kiss and a hug and say ""Can you make a craft for me while I'm gone?"" Some parents will give their child a special toy to take care of for them. ""Will you take good care of Fluffy while I'm gone?""

, Anytime your child expresses concerns, listen to her and reassure her, ""You are going to have lots of fun with Jody while Mamma goes and gets some library books."" Hug. If your child feels nervous about you driving off, you can tell her you're going to go out to the parking lot to vacuum the Cheerios off her car seat.

, At pickup time, ask questions such as, ""Did you have fun?"" or ""What toys did you play with today?"" or ""Did the teacher read you a book?""

, Watch to see how your child is adjusting. Do you feel he's making a good connection with his teachers? Does he get excited talking about all the fun he's having? Be sure to listen to him about how he feels and be prepared to make changes if necessary. If you find your child is starting to act out at home, consider reducing the number of days he attends or changing to a preschool with a smaller class size. If you feel he needs you more, you can offer to volunteer. The teachers might really appreciate the extra help.

, They are growing up!

Establish a routine.,
Adjust the routine when daylight savings time begins.,
Adjust the routine when daylight savings time ends.",How to Help Toddlers Adjust to Daylight Saving Time1," If you don’t already have a nighttime routine established for your toddler, take the time to set one up. Having a routine helps your child prepare for the evening and gives them a sense of security. They know what to expect next and can prepare better.Once you have a routine in place it will be easier to help your toddler adjust to daylight savings time.


Set bed, nap, and waking times that allow your toddler to get about 10 total hours of sleep each day. For example, your toddler may take a two hour nap during the day and then get eight hours of sleep at night.
Pick meal times that allow your toddler to enjoy their meal or snack without feeling rushed.
Stick to these same times every day and incorporate other activities into your daily routine.
Establish routines for things like preparing for bed or meal time. For example, your toddler might have a bath, brush their teeth, read a book, and then lie down for the night.;
, The week before daylight savings time begins, gradually start moving your toddlers schedule up 10 to 15 minutes or so. The gradual adjustment will make the “spring forward in time” easier for your toddler to handle.Each day move your toddler’s bedtime forward 10 minutes or so. For example, if your toddler normally goes to bed at 8 pm, then move it to 7:50 the first night, 7:40 the next night, and so.
Move it up 10 minutes each night or so until the night that daylight savings time begins. Your toddler will go to bed at 7 pm, which will become 8 pm – their normal bedtime.
Adjust meal, snack, and other times accordingly. For example, you may want to serve dinner a little earlier each night or give them a bath earlier.
If it’s possible, adjust your whole evening routine so that everything happens a few minutes earlier each day. Also, if you generally wake your child in the morning, you can try to wake them a little earlier each day.

, Similar to when daylight savings time begins, moving your toddler’s schedule back a bit during the fall may help them manage daylight savings time ending.It takes about a week to adjust to the change, so adjusting the routine about one week in advance will help your toddler manage the change.


In the fall, move your toddler’s schedule back by 10 minutes each night. For example, if they normally have an 8 pm bedtime, then you can move it to 8:10 the first night.
Each night, push their schedule back by 10 more minutes. The night that daylight savings time ends they will go to bed at 9 pm, which, when the time changes, will be 8 pm. You may also allow your child to sleep a little longer in the morning each day.

"
"
Control the lights.,
Choose the right foods.,
Monitor activity.",How to Help Toddlers Adjust to Daylight Saving Time2," Our bodies respond to light. Sunlight and brightness signal that it is time for us to be up and active. Night and darkness, on the other hand, indicate that it is time for us to rest. One way to help your toddlers adjust to daylight savings time is to adjust the lights accordingly.It may be still be light outside at your toddlers’ bedtime in the spring. Try dimming the lights and closing the curtains at bedtime when daylight savings time is beginning.
Try turning the lights on or trying a brighter light in the mornings, when it may still be dark outside.
During the fall, when daylight savings time is ending, you may want to leave the lights on bright in the early evening.
When daylight savings time is ending you may also want to invest in some blackout curtains or shades to keep the morning sun out.

, Providing your toddler with nutritious foods that support their varying levels of activity and rest during the day is one way to help them adjust to daylight savings time.During the day, especially in the morning, you want your toddler to have energy and focus. Meals and snacks that promote their active day time lifestyle is a great way to help them maintain their energy throughout the day. At night, try to give your toddlers foods that promote sleep.


Give your toddler unrefined grains and foods with unprocessed sugar, like fruit, for breakfast. For example, you might prepare oatmeal topped with blueberries and strawberries.
Avoid sugars and spicy foods at night. Sweets, soft drinks, and spicy chips may have your toddler fighting sleep well after bedtime.
Try complex carbohydrates or meats that contain tryptophan to help children feel tired. For example, you might have roasted chicken for dinner.

, Playing and interacting with their environment is how toddlers learn. Sometimes extra activity at the right time can use up just enough energy to get toddlers ready to relax. Some sources, suggest, however, that extra activity before bedtime can actually make young children too tired to go to bed.Instead, they may become cranky, fidgety, or even get a burst of energy.


During the daylight savings time changes, make sure your toddler is getting enough activity during the day to engage and tire them, but provide them quiet activities in the evening so they can calm down.
As daylight savings time approaches, you may want to end high-energy activities earlier in the evening and start calming and relaxing activities earlier.
As daylight savings time comes to an end, consider extending moderate-energy activities a little later into the night. For example, physical activity like practicing martial arts forms, yoga, or a leisurely stroll might be good activities.
You may not want to do high-energy activities early in the evening like playing outside. Toddlers may become too tired to stay up the extra few minutes.

"
"
Plan ahead.,
Take it slowly.,
Be understanding.",How to Help Toddlers Adjust to Daylight Saving Time3," One of the best ways that you can help toddlers adjust to daylight savings time is to prepare in advance for the change. Planning ahead helps you in several ways.For example, it helps you adjust your own schedule, make any environmental changes, and make other preparations for the time change.


Make a list of any materials you need to purchase. For example, high wattage light bulbs, blackout curtains or shades, or an alarm.
Set reminders on your agenda or calendar to help you remember the changes you need to make to your own schedule. For example, you might set a reminder to start dinner earlier.
Plan ways to make the transition easier for your toddler. For example, pick a few books that are a bit longer than usual to read during the week before daylight savings time ends.

, Change of any kind is hard for young children. You can help make the adjustment to daylight savings time easier by making it a gradual change.Adjust toddlers’ schedule forward or back a little each day rather than have them adjust to the time change all at once.


Try not to adjust their schedule more than 15 to 20 minutes each day.
Start the week or so before time changes so that if one of the nights doesn’t go well, you can try again at the same time the next night. For example, if your toddler was supposed to go to bed at 7:50 pm on Monday night, but didn’t until 8:10 pm, you can try for 7:50 pm again on Tuesday.

, Adjusting to time change can be difficult for everyone, including adults. Even with the changes that you put in place, adjusting to daylight savings time may be challenging for your toddler.Be patient and understanding with toddlers during the days immediately after a time change. Toddlers may still need a little time and support adjusting to the change.


Try saying things like, “This time change is difficult for everyone. We’ll get used to it!”
Or, you might say, “I know you feel grumpy. You’re still getting used to waking up at this time. Don’t worry, it’ll get easier.”

Consider attaching a child's bike seat to your own bike.,
Attach the bike seat to either the front or back of the bike.,
Consider any state laws.,
Install a rear bike seat.,

Think about the pros of using a bike trailer.,

Decide whether to purchase a tandem bike or make your own.,
Understand that your toddler must wear a helmet at all times.,
Explain the safety rules to your toddler.,
Offer a reward for good behavior.,
Stick to the path when biking with toddlers.,
Let your toddler dictate the duration of the bike ride.,
Allow your toddler to choose a destination.,
Build up to longer bike rides as your toddler adjusts.",How to Include Your Toddler on Family Bike Outings," As a starter, it would be best to let your child feel the excitement that comes from biking by letting them be your little passenger.


While installing a bike seat would seem simple enough, it is important to keep in mind that there will be added weight on your bicycle and hence for starters, you should practice taking them around for a shorter period of time so you will get used to it.
This would be a good start as these seats are well equipped with straps not only to keep their bodies in place but even for their feet so that they would not get injured by getting into contact with the bike chains.;
, Bike seats are installed either at the front of the bike and are attached to its “stem” or headset, or it could be attached at the rear, sitting on top of a bike rack.


Front bike seats are connected to the stem, which connects your handlebars to the front fork of your bike.There should be at least a distance of 20 inches (50.8 cm) from your seat tube to the handlebars of the bike to allow sufficient space for the bike seat and the biker’s legs.
You must also have ample space in your bike’s head tube for the installation of the seat. The seat is often recommended for threaded headsets but if your bike has an adjustable thread-less one, it would do as well.
Due to the nature of the attachment of the seat, you can place lighter children – preferably between 9 months and 3 years – in front bike seats.

, You should also take into consideration whether your state laws allow this type of child bike seats to be installed. There are some states in the US that do not allow children to be seated at the front of a bike.

, Rear child bike seats on the other hand are installed either directly on to the seat tube or at the top of a bike rack.


Most of these bike seats come with their own installation instructions which can be easily done by a parent. This type of seat is recommended for children older than 3 years who are still light enough for the seat.
Various companies have additional features to their bike seats such as windshields, foot straps, handlebars, seat buckles, head support, and seat buckles to provide comfort and safety to your child.

, If your child has a fear of being seated up on the bike due to the height, a bike trailer is a great idea to get them on board and involved in your outing. Being able to pull along the two wheeler which is not only more comfortable for your child but also many of the trailers are able to remain upright should the bicycle tip over, giving a less risk of injury as compared to the seat, where your child would fall with you.

, Bike trailers resemble a stroller that is connected to the back of the bike. They are more comfortable and safer for children due to their wider and enclosed seating space.


They can also often accommodate up to two children, which is a great advantage if you have two younger tots. Although they are attached at the back of the bike, they can protect children from mud or stones that are thrown up by the rear wheels because of their front and side mesh screens.
They also protect from mosquitoes and other bugs which are very common when you are biking in forested areas. Bike trailers are often attached to your bike using an aluminum tow-bar which is angled to keep the trailer centered at the rear of the bike.

, Another viable option to consider, especially for a confident and adventurous toddler, is to have a tandem bike.


Installing a tandem bike will let your little one pedal along with your bicycle, letting them learn the appropriate bike riding skills and get comfortable with cycling, before they graduate on to having a bike of their own.

, You can either buy a pre-fabricated tandem bike or make one on your own using your own child’s bike.


If you opt for the pre-fab tandem bike, the way for you to do this would be to attach a kidback at the stoker side of the bike or the one at the rear. A kidback is a mechanism that provides a higher pedal at the back which allows your kid to “stoke” the bike while you maneuver it at the front.
If you want to create your own tandem bike, you can choose from the various types of braces and connecting rods that are available at bike stores to connect the front wheel of your kid’s bike to the rear wheel of your bike.

, With your toddler still being physically weak, it is important to remind yourself to never omit a helmet at any stage or time when you are out on the bike outing, be it even for a short ride in the house or playground. This should never be taken lightly as omitting the use of a helmet could lead to serious brain injuries.

, Before heading out to bike, you should also explain to your child that riding a bike comes with its own risks if they do things wrong.


It is important to instruct your children to not to try to get out of the straps or buckles of the bike seat or trailer. If you find your child to be trying to move around a lot and is somewhat distracting you, help them stay focused on their surroundings by pointing out important landmarks or beautiful plants along the way.
Tell them to keep their hands on the handlebars or sleep rolls and to try not to snatch things along the way. A good and snug harness or seat belt can often eliminate this from happening.

, You can also encourage your child to behave during the bike ride by promising them a reward. This can either be a treat or extra TV time if they do well along the way.


However, this may not be necessary as your child gets used to riding a bike and begins to appreciate the beautiful views that he comes across during the travel.

, As a final thought, it is important to note that your bike outings should be limited to a bike path instead of any other terrain when you have a little one with you. This minimizes the risk of accidents and helps to keep your toddler safe.

, Sure, the bike outing is a family activity but at this moment, your toddler is the biggest concern. To keep the outing fun for everyone, let the toddler help decide where you are going or how long you will be riding.


Know your child’s limits and honor them. There will always be time for other bike rides. No one is going to enjoy biking with a sobbing toddler who just wants to get out of the seat he is stuck in.

, Some toddlers are happy with an open ended bike ride that just meanders around a quiet park or the neighborhood. Some are happier when there is a destination in mind.


You could ride your bike to the park to see the ducks in the little pond. You could ride to the little ice cream place for treats after dinner.
These could quickly become specific requests from your toddler.

, Start with short trips, letting your child get used to the seat or trailer and the sensation of wearing the helmet and then work up to slightly longer trips as your child gets more comfortable with the idea.


Accept that some children will never love the bike seat or the trailer if that is the case.
Eventually your toddler will become an older child who can ride his own bike with the family and you can plan these outings then.

Observe your child’s behavior.,
Identify challenging behaviors.,
Teach behavioral skills.,
Remain calm.,
Recognize a meltdown.,
Label their feelings.,
Use a safe place to calm down.,
See acting out as expressing a need.,
Show empathy and understanding.,
Use timeouts if your child is destructive or violent.",How to Handle Tantrums from Your Blind or Visually Impaired Toddler1," As your child gets older, you will see and observe new behaviors that were not there before. These behaviors may not fit into what you would identify as developing skills. It is important to note that all children will go through these phases, and this is a normal part of growing up. However, many of these “problem behaviors” may be unfamiliar or unexpected, and they can change quickly.

As children age, they may become frustrated with situations or parental figures because of their desire to want to do things on their own. They will also begin to experience bigger and more complex emotions that can fluctuate and change quickly. Just remember that your child is learning how to communicate. It is up to you to guide them into learning more helpful, safe and appropriate response patterns.
If strategies that you’ve used before are not working, call on your support team for help and advice. This could be your spouse, extended relatives, neighbors, friends, medical provider, therapist, church group members, or community parenting group. They can offer you support as you work through things with your child, but remember that you are the expert where your own child is concerned.;
, Regardless of the behavior you may be witnessing in your child, remember that you are the expert and the positive role model and guide for your child. You will need to develop interventions that will model appropriate behavior for your child. Also, keep in mind that your child’s limited or lack of vision is not the main reason for such behaviors. Challenging behaviors (tantrums) with visually impaired or blind children are categorized and they can be identified as follows:


Physical. This may include either dropping to the floor while screaming and/or crying, leaving the area, hitting, biting, scratching, pulling hair, head butting, kicking, punching, and slapping. The child may direct these behaviors toward the caregiver, other children or people, an object in the room, or the child himself.

Verbal. This may include yelling, screaming, using verbally aggressive words or profanity, and speaking loudly.

Emotional. This may include crying, screaming in anger, or any other emotional changes in body language or facial expressions.

, Understand that the child who is having the “tantrum” or displaying challenging behavior has learned to do this to get what he or she wants. This behavior must have worked for the child at some point in the past for the child to continue the behavior. This means that child may not have the appropriate social skills or not know how to use them. These skills may include:


Language and speech. This may include learning and accumulating appropriate vocabulary as a toddler, using single or combination of words clearly, and the ability to associate and apply concepts with language.

Social. This is the ability to communicate their needs and wants both using words and using nonverbal means. They can also communicate in a way that is assertive, healthy, appropriate and respectful of others.

Self- or mutual-regulation. This is the ability to play with other children and develop friendships through sharing or pretend playtime, as well as to be able to relate to others and express empathy.

, If your child’s tantrum makes you instantly frustrated, upset, angry, or enraged, take a step back before responding. Take a few deep breaths and find your center. Manage your own emotions before stepping in to handle your toddler’s emotions. If your toddler is screaming or yelling at you, don’t yell back. This can escalate the tantrum and make both you and your child feel worse. Staying calm shows your toddler that big emotions can be dealt with and managed without escalation.If you feel too overwhelmed to handle the situation, ask another available adult to step in while you cool down.

, A meltdown might occur if your child feels overwhelmed by their surroundings. This might mean that music is too loud, there’s indistinct chatter, or they can’t figure out where they are or what’s happening in their environment. Their sensory input may be too great for them to handle, which can lead to a meltdown. If your child’s senses are on overload, remove them and take them to a quieter, less stimulating place.Not being able to see the world around them can be scary. If your child fears noisy or echo-y places, have a plan for when you go to loud events.

, Get down on your child’s level by kneeling or sitting next to them. Let them know you notice how they are feeling. They need help managing their emotions, so start first by labeling the feeling. Say, “You have an angry face on, does that mean you’re feeling angry?” This shows them that you’re tuned into their feelings.You can also say, “It’s hard not to get what you want. You wanted to eat crackers, but I said, “No” and that made you upset.”
Help your child to learn to label their own feelings by asking them to use their words. Blind children may rely more on verbal communication, so teach them to express themselves and how they feel., You might want to go to a quiet place to help them settle down. Continue speaking to them in a calm voice.If you’re at home, have a safe place your child can go that feels comfortable and familiar to them. Put on some gentle music or give them something soft to hold. If you are somewhere out in public, consider going outside, in a hallway or to the bathroom as a way to get away from people and loud noises.

Being somewhere that’s safe can help your child feel more secure and lower their fears. Especially if they feel unsafe because they cannot see what’s going on, having a safe, familiar place can be comforting.

, Toddlers aren’t fully capable of expressing their wants and needs, so their frustration can express as a tantrum. Think about what event or events preceded the tantrum. Was your child trying to express or communicate something that wasn’t received? Did they feel ignored or not important? Communicating with you and participating socially are important parts of your toddler’s developing world, so think about what need their tantrum might express.A tantrum might indicate a bid for attention that was glossed over or a child who needs a nap. Use some investigative skills to see if there’s a need your child is asking you to fill. It can be as simple as giving them your attention, offering help, or feeding them a snack.

, Visually impaired children differ from their peers and may struggle more with their emerging abilities as toddlers. They might notice that tasks are more difficult or that others are faster or get more positive praise. Your child might not know how to express that they need help or assistance or that they feel left behind. While tantrums can be frustrating to parents, have empathy for your child and the upset they feel due to their limitations.Address their concerns by saying, “Not being able to see can be scary, especially in a new place.” or, “I know it’s hard when you feel left out from other kids.”
Show care and concern for your child. However, do not use this as an excuse to ignore misbehavior.

, If your child’s tantrums are dangerous, destructive, or violent, enforce a timeout. Have a timeout chair or area away from distractions and stimuli. Seat your child in timeout and give them one minute per year of their life in timeout, or wait for them to calm down. If your child screams, yells, or gets up, return them to the timeout spot and don’t engage in any arguments or pleas for attention. When the child is calm, discuss why they went to timeout, what behaviors were inappropriate, and what they can do for next time they feel upset or violent.If you’re outside the home and your child becomes violent, you can hold your child until they calm down. You may also find a quiet area to have them sit down for a timeout.

Have fun with your child by playing active games.,
Play with your child to help her learn new language skills.,
Teach your child cause and effect while having fun.,
Try some other fun games during playtime.,
Understand what is going on with your child at this stage in her life.,
Expect your child to start developing new qualities.",How to Have Fun with Your Toddler1," At this stage, you need to first provide a safe play environment for exploration. Incorporate activities that give your child the opportunity to choose between things.You should also try to incorporate physical activities such as throwing and catching a ball, chasing after bubbles, skipping and hopping while singing to her favorite song.


One creative thing you can do is give your child an empty box. The box should be small enough that she can push it around the house easily. She can pretend that the box is a grocery cart or a car that needs to carry stuff around. Chances are, you’ll find her inside the box too.
Because toddlers lose interest in things quickly, if she doesn’t want to play with her “cart” anymore, turn it into a basketball game where she can throw and shoot her balls inside the box.;
, Incorporate play that will let your child practice their language skills, such as playing with sock puppets, or pretend playing that she’s the “mommy” and you are the “baby”. Of course, at this time, your child is still learning how to talk so if she makes a mistake, avoid openly correcting her; instead, just reply with the correct grammar or usage of the word. Always speak slowly and clearly when talking to her.Other ideas include:


Playing that she’s a doctor and you are the sick patient. Let her try to introduce herself through her puppet or through her role as a doctor.
Let her sing songs on her own and pretend that you are the baby asking her “mommy” to sing or tell her a story.
If you have a puppet of your own, encourage her to speak to your puppet; this will practice her language skills instead of just parroting everyone around the house.

, You can also engage in activities that involve cause and effect; for example, if you stack the blocks too high, it will topple over or if you throw everything out of the house, there won’t be toys left inside anymore. Cause and effect teaches your toddler how to make choices. It will make her choose the best course of action based on what she wants at that time. Instead of telling her not to stack the blocks too high, let her experience what will happen if she does.


Of course, don’t let her experience what will happen if she climbs the stairs on her own; teaching cause and effect should not jeopardize your child’s safety.

, While playing and teaching your child at the same time is very important, it is also fun to just be silly with your child and let her imagination run wild. Other fun things to do with your toddler include:


Playing with drums or other musical toys like a toy guitar.
Pretend play with dolls or stuffed animals.
Ball throwing or other easy ‘sports’.
Singing and dancing.
Block or ring stacking.

, At this stage, your toddler will begin stacking, banging, and placing objects inside anything that it can fit into (including their mouths, noses and ears, so be watchful!). Your toddler’s pincer grip (holding objects with the forefinger and thumb) will become more developed. She will pretend play more often by playing and talking to her stuffed animals and she will be walking and running in a more coordinated fashion.Social interaction starts at this stage and continues as she grows and matures. Functional and representational play such as pretending that a shoe is a phone to call daddy at work, helps your child to develop her imagination skills., Expect children at this age to be more energetic, self-interested and full of activity. Your toddler will begin to emulate sounds and actions of others (which is called parroting), become more clingy and sensitive. Your child may also have a relatively short attention span.


Expect that your child will have more words in their vocabulary and will start to understand what people tell them."

Give your toddler your love, affection, support, and attention, and offer praise for new accomplishments and good behavior.


Let your toddler know that you think he or she is a good, kind, kid. Children worry, even from the toddler years, that other children may not like them. Building your child’s confidence and praising his or her abilities will help with this issue.
Avoid chastising toddlers severely; try to rely on natural consequences instead, and tell your child what kind of behavior you expect.;
, Children can learn to be generous from an early age. Help your toddler make and give a gift to someone, and talk about the results: “Look how happy your sister is! She loves this picture you colored so much! It was so kind and generous of you to give it to her.”

, For young toddlers, learning to share can be very difficult. It’s completely normal, developmentally, for children under two years old to refuse to share altogether, and even after that, learning to share can be a gradual process, frustrating for both you and your child. With some attention, though, you can make this a bit easier.


If you have other children, encourage sharing between siblings. Ask your child to lend a toy or give part of a treat to a sibling, and offer praise for any attempts at sharing; similarly, ask older children to share with your toddler, and then point out how kind the act of sharing is.
If your toddler does not have siblings, you can share with him yourself. Practice sharing food, toys, or other items, and again, praise any attempts your child makes to share.

, Buy or borrow some children’s books that deal with sharing, cooperation, and friendship, and read them with your toddler. Take the time to talk with your child about the books, comparing them to situations your child encounters in real life.

, If your toddler has siblings, they can serve as “practice play dates.” Even if your toddler is an only child, you and your partner can serve as play partners, modeling appropriate behavior and interacting with your toddler as other children would.

, Even when it’s just you and your child, you can teach the basics of cooperation, showing your child that you value his or her contributions. This process helps develop a toddler’s social skills.


For example, you could have your child help you when you set the dinner table. Ask which plates and cutlery to use, and show that you value his or her opinion. Emphasize the fact that the finished product – the nicely arranged dinner table – resulted from the two of you working together.
You can also ask your toddler to help you sort dirty clothes when you are doing laundry and/or help you fold and put laundry away. Be sure to thank your child for the help.

, You are a role model for your child. Playing with other children will seem more natural if he or she sees you socializing with friends and relatives and treating others well.

, Your child will feel most comfortable in a familiar space, so arrange his or her first play dates at home.


This is also a good opportunity to teach your toddler about the role of a host. Explain that it’s important to be kind and generous to guests.

, Talk to your toddler about having a play date with a friend. Ask who he or she might like to invite and which activities he or she might like to do. Discuss possible situations that might occur – there is an argument, for example, or the other child refuses to play – and talk about possible responses.

, In the beginning, groups can be overwhelming. Start by inviting one friend, preferably someone your child already knows and likes, and encouraging the two to play together. As your child gets more comfortable in these situations, you can expand his or her social circle.

, Select activities that both children will like, and then make sure there are enough toys available. If, for example, the children are going to play with cars, try to have several available; it’s even better if some of these are similar or identical. Arguing over toys is one of the most common problems toddlers have when socializing.


Consider putting away your child’s special favorites before the play date. For toddlers, it may simply be too much to expect them to politely share their favorite things.

, Most young toddlers engage mostly in “parallel play” – they sit and play alone, even in the presence of other children. It can take some direct help and encouragement to get toddlers to play together. Suggest board games aimed at very young children, or social games based on imaginary play.

, Do not simply leave toddlers alone to play, especially if one of them seems to be struggling. Play with the children. Your presence will make your child feel more confident, and you can model appropriate forms of socializing and cooperative play.

, Once your child begins to warm up to the idea of socializing with other children, try to schedule these play dates as often as possible. As time goes on, you can participate in them less and less, leaving your child to play with his friends without you.

, Your child may struggle in public places because the other children are strangers. Teaching a simple “Hi, my name is . Do you want to play together?” will go a long way.

, Once your child feels comfortable with play dates at home, you can begin encouraging socialization at places like parks and playgrounds. This can be a bit more stressful for some children, though, so let your toddler approach groups of children at his or her own pace.

, Suggest that your toddler play with other children who are present. Emphasize the fact that playing in a group will be much more fun than simply sitting next to you. If your child resists, though, do not force the issue.

, If your child seems willing to join a group of children, you should allow it. Keep a close eye on your toddler, but try not to get involved unless it becomes necessary.

, If your child gets in an argument, gets upset about something, or feels tired and cranky, it’s fine to call it quits and go home.

, Try to recognize your child’s attempts to be social, even if they are rather timid and short-lived at first. He or she will build confidence and social skills over time.

, When you are in public places with your child, you can be a good social role model by chatting with other parents. Let your child see that it’s possible to make new acquaintances.

, When your child starts making new friends, react with enthusiasm. Plan fun new trips to different places, and start enlarging his or her social circle.

, When a child is able to climb out of their own crib, or at least lean over the sides, it's a sure sign that he needs to be transferred to a bed. A crib can actually become dangerous for a toddler, as they may fall when trying to climb out.

, If your toddler is currently potty training, it will be easier for them to quickly climb out of a bed to reach the potty when they need to go. Most toddlers will not have enough bladder control to call for you and wait to be lifted out of a crib before going.

, If mom is pregnant and there is a new baby on the way, it's a good idea to move your toddler out of the crib (which you'll soon need for the new baby) a couple of months before the baby arrives.


You want your toddler to be happy and settled in their new bed by the time you have a new baby to deal with, and ensure that the toddler isn't jealous of the baby for taking ""his"" crib.

, If your child is old enough to actually express his desire to sleep in a bed, you should listen to him and do your best to transfer him to a bed as quickly as possible.


Maybe he's observed an older sibling sleeping in a proper bed, or heard that a friend from daycare is no longer sleeping in a crib, and he wants to be like them.
At a certain age, toddlers want to feel grown up and moving to a ""big boy bed"" is part of this.

, Things like the arrival of a new baby, starting kindergarten or moving house can all be stressful for your child. Therefore, you should avoid switching your toddler to a new bed at this time, as it can simply add to their stress and make them resent their new sleeping arrangement, which is the last thing you want.

, Before you do anything else, it's a good idea to sit down with your child and explain exactly what's happening. Explain that he is a big boy now so he needs to sleep in a big boy bed - cribs are just for babies.


Gauge your child's reaction to what you're telling him and react accordingly. If he seems enthusiastic about the idea, help him to get excited about it.
If he seems upset by the idea, comfort him and gently explain why it's necessary.

, There are plenty of toddler-friendly picture books on the topic of moving from a crib to a big bed. Find some at your local bookstore or library.


As you read them to your child, encourage your toddler to identify with the main character of the books, as this will make it easier for him to accept the transition to a new bed, just like the main character.

, Another way to get your child excited about moving to a bed is to turn it into a big event. Set a date in advance, and talk about the ""big day"" in the days running up to it - almost as if you were celebrating a birthday. This will help the child to look forward to sleeping in their new bed.

, If you think it would help the child to accept the transition, you could consider saying goodbye to the crib in a special way.


This might be something as simply as getting the toddler to actually say ""goodbye"" or ""I love you"" to the crib, or to draw it a picture.
You could make it seem more final by allowing the toddler to ""help"" in dismantling the crib, or dropping it off to family member or friends house.

, Simply buying a new bed for the child and setting it up in their room without their knowledge might come as too much of a shock. It's better to talk to him about getting a new bed in advance, or even to bring him to the store with you when you collect it.

, Your child may find it easier to adjust to his new bed if he has some input into the process. While it can be risky to allow the child to pick out the actual bed by himself, you could easily allow him to choose his own bed sheets.


There are many attractive bed sheet designs available for kids nowadays, featuring cartoon characters and fun themes.
If your child tends to be indecisive and you want to limit his choices somewhat, pick out two or three designs yourself (perhaps ones that match with the décor in his bathroom) and just allow him to choose between those.

, For the first few nights after moving into the ""big boy bed"", you child might by very taken with his new-found ability to get in and out of bed as he pleases. This can result in some difficulties at bedtime.


Your child may insist on getting out of bed every five minutes, to ask a question, get a drink of water, go to the potty, etc. Although this can be frustrating at first, it's important that you are patient.
Allow your child to do this once or twice, then firmly explain to them that they need to stay in their new bed and go to sleep, otherwise they'll have to go back in the crib. Over time, the novelty of the new bed will wear off.

, For some children, moving from a crib to a new bed can be a scary experience. They may feel less safe in the new bed or be afraid of falling out.


When this happens, it's important that you go to them and comfort them. Try to alleviate any fears they have regarding the new bed early on, otherwise going to bed every night might become an ordeal.
If necessary, put a night light in the child's room, check for monsters under the bed, or even put up a railing along the side of the bed to prevent the child from falling out.

, If the child is afraid of separation and keeps hopping into bed to come visit you, you'll have to train them to stay in bed til they fall asleep.


This may require you lying down beside the child for the first few nights until they fall asleep.
However, it's important that you don't make a habit of this, as it can become very inconvenient over time. After a few nights, switch to sitting in a chair beside the child's bed - holding their hand if necessary - until they fall asleep.
You can move further away from the child over time, until they can fall asleep in the bed without you.

, If the child is used to sleeping with certain toys or a specific blanket or pillow in his crib, then you can help the transition by switching these familiar items to the new bed.


These familiar items can be very comforting for the child and make the experience seem less overwhelming.

, If possible, place the new bed in the exact same position as the crib in the child's room. This will make the change feel less obvious, helping the child to adjust more quickly.

, If the child refuses to sleep through the night in his new bed, then a good way to help him adjust is to allow him to just take his afternoon nap in the new bed.


Once he realizes that the new bed is not so scary (and actually quite comfortable!) he will be more willing to try sleeping there at night.

, Just because your child has moved to a bigger bed does not mean that their bedtime routine has to change.


You should not allow them to stay up any later or change any other aspects of their routine - in fact, keeping everything else exactly the same as before will probably help your toddler to adjust more quickly.
So just like before, your toddler should have a set time for taking their bath, changing into their pajamas, brushing their teeth, reading a bedtime story, etc.

, If the child sleeps through the night in their new bed (or at least makes an effort to) you should congratulate him and praise him on the his accomplishment.


Mention what a big boy he is now, how proud of him you are and what nice dreams he must be having.
Only speak of the new bed in positive terms, and your toddler will quickly adjust to their new sleeping situation.

Prepare your child for new experiences.,
Give your child choices.,
See a counselor.,
Ask for advice.",How to Handle Tantrums from Your Blind or Visually Impaired Toddler2," Predictability can be an important part of creating structure and stability for your toddler. Following a routine can help a special needs child to practice and master skills and anticipate difficult transitions, like staying with a nanny or going to bed. Have regular times to wake-up, eat, nap, play, and go to bed. Use these opportunities to increase their confidence and learning.Tantrums commonly occur around mealtimes, bedtime, when asked to start or stop an activity, or in interactions with other children.Prepare for any potential tantrums by working the schedule around preventing these events.

, Sometimes, new things can be scary, like going to the pediatrician or dentist. Prepare your toddler for these changes by announcing them in advance. For example, if your child will get an immunization, rehearse it with a medical kit the day before so that your child knows what to expect. Describe the instruments and what the expert might do. Have verbal cues to help them anticipate what will come.Say, “The dentist will call your name, and you’ll walk back into another room with them. They will ask you to open your mouth and that’s most of what you will do. They might poke some tools into your mouth to make sure everything is okay. All you have to do is listen and follow directions.”

, Look out for tantrum warning signs and learn to anticipate them. If your toddler is starting to get fussy, redirect them to another activity or offer a snack. If your child is sick, tired, or hungry, avoid situations that might trigger a tantrum.For example, if your child tends to take an afternoon nap and missed their nap, avoid activities that might upset them or that may be new to them.

, Let your child know if they are going to meet someone new, go to a new place, or encounter a new situation. Let them know what they can expect and how to prepare for it. Because visually-impaired children are often sensitive to loud noises or crowded places, communicate ahead of time that they will be somewhere loud. Tell them how they can navigate problems ahead of time so that they can anticipate difficulties.For example, say, “We are going to the train station today, and it will be very busy. If you have a hard time navigating with me, we can use the stroller.”
Say, “Today we are going to a new playground and you will meet new friends. We can walk around the playground before you play so that you can become familiar with it.”

, As toddlers start to seek independence, allow them to make small choices for themselves. For example, say, “Do you want to eat grapes or carrots?” or, “Shall we read this book or that one?” Don’t overwhelm them with choices, as this might upset them. Keep them simple and let the child choose.Your toddler can feel in control by picking out which shoes to wear, what foods to eat, and what songs they can listen to. Help them feel in control of areas that are important to them.

, Choose a therapist or counselor who specializes in working with children and families with visual impairments. Your therapist may offer suggestions in how to speak to your toddler or modify their environment. Often, child therapists use behavior therapy with young children. They may use play to teach skills or learn better communication. Your therapist may also collaborate with you on creating a behavior plan for your child so that consequences are predictable and enforced.Find a behavior therapist by calling your insurance provider or local mental health clinic. You can also get a recommendation from a physician, friend, or family member.

, Seek out other parents who have a visually impaired child that you can consult. Join a support group, pose a question on an online forum, or ask friends for some advice. Talk to other parents about how they’ve gotten through their toddler’s temper tantrums and how they’ve handled specific problems related to their toddler being visually impaired. While every child is different, they might have some valuable advice for you to try.

Find an online support group or look for a support group for families of visually-impaired children in your community.

Role play with your child.,
Foster your child’s creativity through fun.,
Read books to your toddler.,
Have fun with your child by doing art projects.,
Take your child out into the great outdoors.,
Try out other fun games.,
Be prepared for you child to be interested in exploration.",How to Have Fun with Your Toddler2," When your toddler reaches the ages of two and three, she will most likely begin to start role playing. She may be a princess one day, a pirate the next, and an astronaut or ballerina the following day. Encourage her to act out these roles by engaging in her role playing.


For example, if she is a ballerina one day, create a simple ‘stage’ for her to perform her dances on. Put on music and pretend you are the audience. You could even set up her toys so that they are also ‘watching’ her performance.

, To develop your toddler’s listening skills and creativity, continue singing songs, reading rhymes and making up funny names for every member of the family. These activities foster creativity. Action games can also be a fun pastime; re-telling or re-enacting a story by pretending that she is the hero or heroine can be a great way to have fun with your toddler..Since your toddler most likely tags along with you almost everywhere, make shopping time fun by asking for your child’s opinion on what to buy; when she chooses something, ask her why she chose that object. You can also make the supermarket into a fortress where you have to collect items on a list to win a prize, like a healthy snack.

, Make it a habit to spend quiet time reading books with your toddler. Books with interesting pictures or pop up art can be a fun way to engage your child while you read.


Reading also helps to develop your child’s cognitive and language skills.

, Because your child’s hands are more dexterous now, start playing with clay, drawing on canvas or paper, or drawing on the sidewalk with colored chalk. Making projects together can be fun and can also stimulate your child’s creativity.You can also consider doing finger painting or doing face painting.

, Taking your kid out for an outdoor adventure can improve her awareness of her surroundings. Here are some activities that you can try:


Stroll around the park and play at the local playground.
Go on a hike (but be sure to bring a backpack carrier you can put her in if she gets tired).
Going to a petting zoo or fair.

, On top of teaching your child through fun activities, there are also games you can play that are just pure fun. Some activities might need more than two participants, so get siblings or other children involved. Fun games include:


Following the leader, tag, hide and seek, jumping, hopping, skipping, hula-hoop, and dancing.
Crafting, drawing and puzzles.
Charades or miming.
Ball games, blowing bubbles, swimming and horseback riding, walking in the park and playing with other kids.

, At this stage, your toddler’s language is continually developing so she will begin interacting with other children. She will be more interested in exploration as she grows. Her body will become stronger and sturdier so she will be more likely to climb and participate in other physical activities.Your toddler may begin to engage in symbolic play, which is similar to pretend play but more descriptive and intricate.

"
"
Try to have fun while playing.,
Exert caution when playing with toys.,
Avoid giving your child toxic things to play with.,
Pick age-appropriate toys.,
Pick out toys that will allow your one to one-and-a-half year old to play pretend.,
Pick out larger toys as your child grows.",How to Have Fun with Your Toddler3," There are a myriad of activities and games that you can engage your toddler in. Make these games count and be sure that these activities are fun for her. Equally important is that you have fun too. Despite the fact that you have a lot going on, make sure that you are genuine when playing with your child; if you are bored, you child will be able to sense it.Remember that you are the ultimate playmate; your child will find any activity more fun and enjoyable when you are playing with her.
While playing, talk to your child about what she likes, her interests, and what she finds fun.

, Until your child is old enough to understand that toys are not for eating, make sure to buy toys that are larger than her mouth to prevent her from choking. Don’t pick toys with cords or strings that are longer than 12 inches (30.5 cm). These strings or cords could strangle your toddler.


Always supervise your child when she is playing with a new toy for the first time.

, You may not even realize that something, like a paintbrush, could pose a hazard. If that paint brush had come into contact with lead paint however, it could be a health threat. Read labels on toys and keep safety in mind when letting your child roam around you house and pick things up.


Generally steer clear of items with lead, mercury, arsenic and other chemicals.

, As a parent, you should try to be realistic about your child’s age and maturity; follow the “recommended age” sign written on the toy’s box. Toys with little parts cannot be given to children less than 8 or 10 years old because they might put these parts in their mouth, nose or ears.., Some of the toys that are well suited for toddlers 13 to 18 months of age are those that imitate life because kids love to pretend play. These toys might include:


Push and pull toys like wagons or cardboard boxes.
Stuffed animals.
Boxes and rings to stack.
Bouncy balls.

, Toddlers 19 to 24 months of age will show a bit more independence in their actions. Toys for your toddler at this time are basically still the same as when she was 18 months old, but can be bigger; this includes bigger blocks and bricks, or bigger balls alongside the smaller ones. These larger toys provide the opportunity to develop her perception skills. Other toys for this age group include:

Toy instruments.
Puzzles.
Art supplies.
Toys like train sets that can be linked together.

,
Think of interesting ways to involve vegetables in your toddler's meals.",How to Get Toddlers to Eat Vegetables," Toddlers can get all the vitamins and minerals they need from other foods besides vegetable. Healthy toddlers offered a variety of foods will choose a balanced diet over time.;
, Toddlers have small stomachs. If their tummies are full of pretzels or fruit juice, they won't have room for vegetables at dinner time.

, Steaming preserves the natural flavor of the vegetable, and preserves the nutrients too.

, Children can be resistant to new things, so don't worry if they reject peas at first. It can take ten or more offers before they accept a new food.

, Toddlers like to serve themselves, not be fed with a spoon. Also, putting several foods on their plate means they can choose what they feel like at the moment.

, Parents often have unrealistic expectations about how much their toddlers actually need. If the child is growing well and meeting developmental milestones, he's probably fine.

, Vegetables are low in calories, so kids don't want to fill up their stomachs with them. Kids are smart, and won't choose vegetables over carbohydrates if they are really hungry.

,, If your child likes pigs-in-a-blanket, make vegetables in croissant rolls.

Ask the doctor for an antibiotic that is taken less frequently.,
Request an antibiotic with a more appealing taste.,
See if the doctor can prescribe a more concentrated version of the medicine.,
Give your child something sweet immediately after she takes the medicine.,
Talk to your doctor about potentially giving the antibiotic with food.",How to Get a Toddler to Take Antibiotics1," This includes giving medicines that are taken once or twice a day as opposed to four times a day. There are different brands of antibiotics that act in a similar fashion, but some of them have to be taken more frequently than others.Talk to your doctor about the situation if your child won’t take her medication, and see if there is another pill that your child can switch to.;
, Some antibiotics will also taste better than others, though this will partly rely on your toddler’s preferences. However, if your child has already been started on an antibiotic course, she might not be able to switch., When medications are more concentrated, your child has to take less of the medication to get the same effect as a more diluted medication. When your child has to take less, you may find that she has an easier time swallowing the antibiotic.


For example, if your child was prescribed 200 mg of amoxicillin (which is the equivalent of a full teaspoon), your doctor could instead prescribe a higher dose of 400 mg amoxicillin (which is equivalent to half of a teaspoon)., To chase away the bad taste of the medicine, you can also give your child something tasty immediately after. Most antibiotics have a bitter flavor, so giving your child something sweet could help her to keep from vomiting after taking her medication.


One example could be giving your child a spoonful of chocolate syrup after taking her medication. In this situation, the old Mary Poppin’s saying “a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down”, really is true.

, You are generally not supposed to do this, but certain antibiotics may be able to be mixed with food. However, it is very important that your first talk to your doctor about doing this.


If your doctor gives the go-ahead, crush the tablet up, or open the capsule, and add the contents to applesauce or pudding.

Create a game that reinforces good habits.,
Let your child take the lead.,
Give surprise rewards.",How to Give Your Toddler Rewards Instead of Bribes1," Think of a fun game your toddler can enjoy while performing the task instead of offering a bribe. Creating a game takes the focus off of the result and teaches them the behaviors they need to learn to get to that result. A game also creates the incentive of a challenge, which most kids enjoy.


For example, play a game of who can use the potty the most during the day, you or your toddler. Or, who can pick up the most toys off of the floor in a certain amount of time. Games make the task fun and teach them how to engage in the behaviors.Make sure you are not simply letting your child win, though, as this is no better than a bribe. Foster gracious losing, and encourage them to do better by challenging them to beat their own records.;
, Encourage your child to make the right decision instead of bribing them to do so. Creating an environment that allows them to ultimately come up with the appropriate choice makes it easier on you and helps them with problem-solving skills.


For instance, if your child refuses to change out of their Halloween costume before going to bed, allow them to try to sleep in it. Eventually, they will likely realize that the costume is uncomfortable and will ask to change into their pajamas. They learn to make the right decisions on their own and you don’t have to bribe them to do it.Follow up with your child after they've made a decision. Talk to them about how they worked out their choices to help them learn.

, The difference between bribing and rewarding is bribes are talked about beforehand, whereas rewards are mentioned after the fact. Giving your child a reward for good behavior or performing a good deed is essentially a surprise, as it’s not usually known until afterwards. Surprise rewards teach children that if they behave, good things are coming down the pipe for them at some point, though maybe not on demand or all the time.


Avoid giving your child rewards each time they do something, as it may make them expect it. Instead, offer rewards occasionally, especially if they complete a task or perform a behavior that is special. This can change the thinking that bad behavior earns what they want, like bribes can do."

Explain to your child why she needs to take her medicine.,
Offer your child choices.,
Make taking her medication fun for her.,
Immobilize your child if necessary.,
Use a syringe to give your child the medicine.,
Ensure that the child swallows the antibiotic.,
Stay calm and explain again why the child needs the medicine .,
Be patient.,
Reward the child after she takes the medicine.",How to Get a Toddler to Take Antibiotics2," Sit your child down and tell her that even though the medication may taste bad, it will help her to get better. Explain that it will help to make her feel more comfortable.


Some toddlers will take the antibiotics immediately if they will know what the medicine is for.

, Toddlers often love to say ‘no’ to things. They like to feel that they are in control of the situation. To combat this, give them choices where they are allowed to say no to one choice, but must say yes to the other. These choices could include:


If they want to take the medication themselves or if you should assist them.
If they want to use a spoon, syringe or dropper to take the medication.
If they want to take the antibiotic in the dining room, bathroom or in their bedroom.
If they want to take the antibiotic standing or laying in your lap.

, Toddlers will often not fully understand the importance of taking an antibiotic, even if you explain it to them. Therefore, helping your child to understand by doing something she will like, like acting out your explanation with the help of your child’s favorite doll, stuffed animal, or robot.You can start by telling your child that her toy is sick and that it needs to take medicine to get better. Act like you are giving the toy the medicine, and then have the toy ‘tell’ your child that he is starting to feel better already.

, Some children will fight back rather than take their antibiotics. If this is the case with your child:


Sit down and hold your child across your lap. Hold your child’s head in the crook of your left elbow (if you are right handed). Have your child place her right arm behind your back, while the left arm gets held against her body by your arm. Tuck your child’s legs in between your own. You can then give your child her medication.

, A syringe ensures that all of the antibiotic is swallowed by your child, so that she gets the right dose. You should use a syringe, rather than a regular spoon.


Avoid aiming at the back of your child’s throat; instead aim for it to go into the side of your child’s mouth so that she is less likely to gag.

, Give your child time to swallow the antibiotic. If your child’s teeth are clenched against the syringe, put the antibiotic in the side of your child’s mouth and wait for her to swallow.

, While giving your child medication, make sure to speak in a calm voice. When she swallows the medicine, make sure to reward her with hugs and praise. Remind her again why she needed the medication., Giving a toddler antibiotics is rarely successful if you are in a hurry. Try not to rush your child through the process of taking the medication, as taking antibiotics can be nerve wracking for a child.


If your child refuses the first time, wait for a few minutes or so, and then try giving your child the antibiotic again.

, Once she has taken the medicine, give your child a reward, like hugs or a prize, like a sticker or a lollipop.


Praise your child’s bravery and make sure that she knows that you are proud of her.

Set an example.,
Take a closer look at behavior.,
Remove and prepare for the bad behavior triggers when you can.,

Do everything you can to protect your child's nap times.,
Be patient.",How to Give Your Toddler Rewards Instead of Bribes2," Exhibit the same behavior you want your child to display, instead of bribing them to do it. Children watch your each and every move and take in both the good and the bad. If you only do certain things because you expect to receive something after, they will too. Instead, do what you’re supposed to because you should.


Talk to your children about what you’re doing so they understand. For example, you could say “I’m bringing our neighbor some soup because they don’t feel good and it may make them feel better.” Or, “I’m returning this wallet I found because it doesn’t belong to me and the owner really needs it.”, Try to figure out why your toddler is behaving particularly badly, instead of bribing them to stop acting that way. Your child may exhibit out-of-character behavior if they are upset or sick. Take this into consideration before you think about bribing.


For example, ask your child if they want to take a nap or if they want food. Being tired and hungry are major triggers of temper tantrums. Acknowledging these needs can stop the temper tantrum and prevent you from rewarding bad behavior.If tantrums or defiance have become a chronic problem, consider consulting a mental health professional to look for a larger problem.

, Your child may consistently react badly to certain situations. Sometimes these situations are avoidable, and sometimes they aren’t. Do what you can to remove these triggers, or at least prepare yourself for them. Doing so can stop you and your toddler from losing control.


For instance, if you know that getting up and going to preschool usually causes a temper tantrum, do what you can to remove as much stress as possible. This could mean your child going to sleep in what they will wear the next day, or having them eat breakfast on the way to school. Preparation can stop you from bribing them to get dressed or eat their food.

, Compromising on naps is one of the leading causes of misbehavior.

, Understand you’re going to hit bumps in the road. Parenting isn’t one-size-fits-all. Unfortunately, talking to your toddler isn’t always going to work in the midst of a full-blown temper tantrum. You may need to resort to bribing sometimes, and that’s OK. Doing your best is all you can do.


Explain to your child why you had to do what you did, and that it’s not always going to happen. Putting this out there teaches them that they won’t always get a reward when they throw a fit and that next time, perhaps they will be punished for their behavior."

Question whether bribes give your child the wrong impression.,
Realize that good behavior built on bribing won't last.,
See that bribes send the message that bad behavior is rewarded.,
Notice that bribes rob your child of self-satisfaction.",How to Give Your Toddler Rewards Instead of Bribes3," Bribing a child to do something puts out a message that what you are asking is going to be unenjoyable and unbearable. They may think they aren’t going to like it if they have to be bribed to do it. Bribing also puts out the notion that they have a choice in the matter, when they don’t.


Talk to your child about why what you’re asking them to do is important, instead of offering a bribe. You could say, “I understand you don’t want to go to the dentist, but keeping your teeth clean and healthy can stop them from hurting.” Avoid using words like “must” and “should,” as they will likely feel like they are being pushed around., Every parent has bribed their children at some point in their lives. Some may have even made a habit of it. Creating a pattern like this, however, can make your children think they have power in this situation. They may get to the point where they refuse to do anything unless there is a bribe involved. For example, you might promise your toddler that you will buy them candy, if they behave appropriately at the doctor's office. If you decide not to give them candy, or you forget to offer the bride on one occasion, they may misbehave in the waiting room. They no longer have any reason to be on their best behavior.
This only contributes to their bad behavior as you create inconsistent standards.

, Bribes are typically given out in moments of stress. You offer your child something to stop them from behaving badly, like if they are throwing a temper tantrum at a grocery store. Over time, they will learn that they can get what they want if they scream and have a fit.


The best way to break this habit is to stop bribing them during these moments of duress. They will eventually learn that having a hissy fit won’t bring them a reward., Children won’t experience the joy of simply feeling good about themselves for doing what they should if they are given bribes for doing it. The sheer act of getting an “A” on a report card or completing a book by themselves boosts their self-confidence when they do it on their own. Doing a good job only because of a bribe robs them of this confidence boost.


You can still celebrate a job well done. Taking your kids out for ice cream is perfectly fine when they’ve done something worth celebrating. However, don’t bribe your children with it: reward them as a surprise.If your child asks for a certain object or privilege, have a conversation with them about their behavior. Let them know whether their behavior over the last few hours or days is worthy of this treat.

, Give choices (""Would you like applesauce or yogurt?"") to make him or her feel more involved and in control of the process. Don't make anything that takes too long to prepare, as a child's patience is limited.

, Count how many strawberries your child has on his or her plate or how many green items are being served. Ask questions involving the child's favorite people or characters (""Does Spiderman like eating sandwiches as much as you do?"")

, Put a little on their plate and eat some yourself. After they've seen it a few times (or several times), they'll try it.

, Give them a washcloth to wipe down the table, or have them throw their napkin away. This will benefit the child's self-esteem and help you in the process!

Developmentally, toddlers have limited ways to express their anger, and so they sometimes start hitting and kicking when they don’t get what they want. It’s this behavior that needs to be modified – not the anger itself.;
, Toddlers still have fairly small vocabularies, and their language skills simply don’t allow them to describe their feelings accurately. They sometimes lash out physically because they can’t express their frustration verbally.

, Toddlers have so little control over their lives: for the most part, they follow a schedule set by adults and eat, drink, wear, and play with items adults select for them. Hitting gives some toddlers a sense of control, and it can feel fun and empowering.

, Most toddlers hit for developmental reasons, but if yours witnesses you, an older sibling, or another adult lashing out angrily or violently, he or she is likely to imitate that behavior.

, If your child hits you or anyone else, you need to address the situation right away; do not leave it for a more convenient time. Toddlers have a somewhat fuzzy sense of cause and effect, and if you scold or punish them later, they may not connect your words with their previous actions. You want to be as clear as possible.

, Say that hitting hurts other people and that you will not allow it. If they hit another child, let them watch you comfort and help the child that was hit. Encourage saying sorry, but don't force it. Toddlers do not yet know the meaning of ""I'm sorry.""

, If your toddler continues to hit, you will need to implement a clear consequence, and you’ll need to do it consistently – if you let your toddler slide once, he or she will feel free to behave badly in the future. Don’t bother trying to lecture your toddler when he or she is out of control; it won’t work. Simply implement the punishment calmly.


Time-outs are a popular punishment. If you choose to use time-outs for episodes of hitting, simply place your child in a quiet (and ideally boring) place, and require that he or she stay there until the time-out is over. You will probably have to stay there, too, to make sure your toddler stays put. In general, time-outs should last one minute for each year of your child’s life (so, if your child is 3, he or she should sit in time-out for 3 minutes).

, Don’t just say, “time-out is over!” and send your toddler to play. You need to remind your child what happened (“you got punished because you hit your brother/sister”) and make sure he or she knows you will be consistent (“whenever you hit, I’ll have to punish you”).


If possible, you can use this time to suggest that your toddler apologize to the person he hit.
You can also use this as an opportunity to start teaching the difference between an emotion, which is healthy and normal, and a behavior, which can be unacceptable. You can tell your toddler that “It’s okay to be angry, but it’s not okay to hit.”

, If you pay attention, you will probably find that your toddler’s hitting is somewhat predictable: it happens in certain circumstances (such as when your toddler is hungry or tired) or at certain times (such as bath time or bedtime).


You may be able to minimize your child’s bad behavior by making sure he or she does not get too hungry or too tired. Stick to a regular eating schedule and bedtime routine.
If the hitting happens at certain times, it can help to prepare your toddler in advance: “It’s almost bedtime. Soon we’ll have to put your toys away. I expect you to listen and keep your hands to yourself.”

, When you notice your child is getting angry, say something right away – don’t wait for it to escalate. Recognize the emotion, validate it, and give your child words to describe it. Over time, this may prevent bouts of hitting, and he or she will begin to express anger verbally.


You could say, for example, “I see that you’re feeling really angry right now, and that’s okay. It’s okay to be mad sometimes. Want to tell me why you’re so upset?” If you stay calm and use these kinds of statements when you notice your child getting angry, you will teach your toddler that he or she has options other than hitting.

, Lecturing a toddler who is in the middle of a violent tantrum is unlikely to yield any discernible results; instead, talk about the issue when he or she feels calm and happy. Reiterate that hitting is not okay.

, Too much time in front of a television or computer means that your toddler is expending precious little physical energy; later, when angry, he or she will be less able to exercise self-control and more likely to hit. Content matters too – if your toddler sees violence (even silly cartoon violence) on TV, he or she may imitate that behavior.

, Include your toddler in your daily activities, and spend quality time talking and playing together. Your toddler will then be less likely to lash out in an effort to get you to pay attention.

, Toddlers imitate the behavior of the adults in their lives, so don’t become a negative role model. Refrain from any kind of violent behavior.


Many experts believe that spanking can fall into this category. It can teach children that hitting is acceptable, especially if you do it in anger, and it confuses them: parents say not to hit even as they hit themselves.

, Whenever your toddler manages anger or frustration without hitting, give lots of praise and positive reinforcement.

Your child may be struggling with a fear of food.
Some toddlers, usually around the age of two, are caught in this dilemma.
It is called food neophobia, which is the fear of trying new food.
This is normal and most toddlers experience this at some point.
Sometimes, it takes around 10-15 times before your child becomes familiar with a certain food.
Be patient enough to understand that their taste buds will adjust to it in time.;
, Let your child become familiar with what you want him to eat by broadening his culinary horizons.


Allowing him to try various types of food will let him choose the foods he likes, and give you more insight as to his tastes.
Most parents make the mistake of introducing new foods too fast and if the toddler pushes the food away, they give up easily.
When introducing new foods to a toddler, you should be ready to reintroduce it at least a minimum of 10 times.
You have to keep at it, because toddlers have the resilience to refuse food they don’t want.

, Think of ways to make food more enjoyable, to allow your child to have fun trying new things.


Try decorating the food in a way that your child will enjoy.
You can make food more colorful, but still keep it healthy. For example, try adding toppings like melted cheese, tomato sauce, or applesauce.
Cut pancakes, pizzas, and sandwiches into interesting shapes and patterns. You can use a cookie cutter for a more precise cut.
Try planting vegetable in your garden and let your child be involved in growing the vegetables. He might be more interested to eat them after taking care of these veggies.

, In order to work up an appetite, your child needs to be exercising and using up energy throughout the day.


Make sure your child is involved in a daily exercise routine.
Play sports with your child during the day.
Try swimming classes or peewee football.
However, keep in mind that you shouldn't let your child become too tired to eat.

, Do not give your child large drinks right before eating, to avoid loss of appetite.


If your child is thirsty, give him water.
Remember, a child who drinks a lot of milk throughout the day may be less hungry than a child who is limited to water.

, Decide on how many times you plan to feed your toddler throughout the day.


Ideally, you can have three main meals and two snacks in between them.
Give your child a heads-up 10-15 minutes before mealtime.
This works well as your child will begin to anticipate mealtime.

, Let him eat his fill during that span of time.


If he is not done eating after 30 minutes, take away his food and wait for the next scheduled mealtime.
In between, you can give your child a healthy snack if they are very hungry.
However, do not offer snacks directly before or after a schedule mealtime, as this will break down the schedule you have set up.
Do not spend too much time pressing your child to eat. This will only make him anxious and frightened.

, Getting your child involved in food preparation is a great way to have them feel more connected to their food.


Your child could do basic food handling, like mixing ingredients or spreading fruit jam on crackers.
He also could participate by helping you do the plating, which could be appealing to him.
These simple tasks will encourage your child to eat their own creations.

, Bring your child with you as you shop for the ingredients that you need to cook.


This way he will be able to be more familiarized with the food that you are preparing.
While in the supermarket, give him a little background about the food and its nutrients.
Make a list of the food that he has eaten during the past week. You can try making a new menu, which should include the four main food groups (starchy foods, protein, dairy products, fruits and vegetables).
Do not include soda and junk food on your grocery list, because these products can have a very detrimental effect on your child's health.
Take note of your child’s allergies and make sure that you do not include these ingredients in your menu.
Be aware of dangerous foods that might cause poisoning or choking, like raw or partially cooked eggs, raw carrots, whole nuts, popcorn, tea and coffee, or fish that might contain mercury.

, Strong-willed kids as young as 2 or 3 know when and how to make parents cave in. They will refuse and refuse until you give in to their whims.


However, giving in is a surefire way for them to get what they want.
Often, your child is refusing to eat not because they don’t want to, but because there is another food more enticing to them than what you have prepared.
If your toddler adamantly refuses to eat his meal, you can tell him he has an alternative; give two healthy choices only and make him prepare his alternative meal.
This way he realizes that there’s “work” involved in making his meal and it’s not a “fast food” thing where he gets to demand what he wants from you and you immediately obey.
Making him prepare his alternative food each time he refuses to eat teaches your toddler responsibility.

, Reading books about food could encourage your toddler to eat.


Books like The Berenstain Bears and Too Much Junk Food by Stan and Jan Berenstain, and Gregory the Terrible Eater by Mitchell Sharmat are some toddler books that your little one will enjoy reading with you.

The Very Hungry Caterpillar is another popular favorite where the caterpillar eats a variety of foods while getting ready to become a butterfly.
It sets a good precedent, in that it teaches your child that in order to grow healthy and beautiful, eating nutritious food is a must.

This is especially helpful to ensure that your child will not get bored of eating the same thing.
However, do not mix your child’s food with sweets like candies or chocolate. This will just create a craving for sweets and discourage them from eating normal foods.

, You may include at least one nutritious food that your child likes with every meal.

Is he or she feeling scared or bothered by some particular aspect of the bath, or are bath time battles just a manifestation of your toddler’s increasing sense of independence? If you can pinpoint a cause, it will be much easier to address it.


Some toddlers feel insecure or frightened if the water feels too deep, or if water gets in their eyes, ears, or noses. Occasionally, this fear becomes very intense, and your reassurances that bath time is safe will not necessarily help.
Other toddlers dislike bath time because they associate it with something they perceive as negative, like the end of play time or the start of a bedtime routine.
If you don’t have interesting toys or distractions available, your toddler may simply find bath time boring.
Some toddlers fight bath time just because they are learning to assert themselves and testing your boundaries. This is definitely frustrating, but it’s also developmentally appropriate.;
, Sometimes it helps to buy or borrow a book or two about bath time. You can look for one tailored to your toddler’s needs – something about how baths don’t have to be scary, for example, or something about how bath time can be fun.

, Consider buying towels and washcloths in your child’s favorite color or sponges shaped like animals and cartoon characters. And buy some toys! There are so many options now – rubber ducks, water guns, plastic toys, bath books, washable tub crayons – that it’s pretty easy to make bath time feel like play time.

, In general, toddlers handle transitions more smoothly when they know what’s coming, so warn your child five or ten minutes in advance. You can tailor this warning to suit your toddler’s particular reasons for avoiding bath time.


For a toddler who is genuinely frightened, you can offer reassurance: “We have to take a quick bath in a few minutes, but I will stay with you the whole time.”
For a child who would rather keep playing or finds bath time boring, you can offer to make the bath more enjoyable: “We have to take a quick bath in a few minutes, but let’s make it fun! We can pretend you’re a mermaid or try your new tub crayons.”
For toddlers who are testing boundaries, you can emphasize that baths are non-negotiable: “We have to a take a bath in a few minutes. It’s okay that you don’t like bath time, but staying clean is important, so we don’t have a choice.” This validates your child’s feelings but makes bath time something he or she knows you can’t be talked out of.

, Your toddler can help you decide how deep and how warm the water should be, how much bubble bath you should add, and which towel and washcloth you should use. This strategy might help combat fears about water that’s too deep or too hot; it also helps an independence-seeking toddler feel more “in charge.”

, To whatever extent your child is able, let him or her take charge of washing. Offer to “help” with hair washing and back scrubbing. This also gives your toddler more control.


Hair washing, in particular, is probably something you should try to handle yourself. It’s best to carefully avoid getting soap or shampoo in your toddler’s eyes – this will only aggravate any negative feelings about bath time.

, If you approach bath time as a grim, annoying chore, then your toddler will be unlikely to think of bathing as enjoyable. Smile! Talk and sing with your child.

, Use bath toys or crayons, read bath books, or pretend to be mermaids or pirates or fish. Play with the soap bubbles, making beards and hats.

, Otherwise, you or your partner can certainly bathe with your toddler. Either way, your child may feel more secure and more entertained if he or she has company in the bath.

, If all else fails, you can always offer to use the shower. Some toddlers find showers less objectionable than baths.


For young toddlers, you will probably need to get in the shower too, for safety’s sake. You don’t want your child to slip and fall.

, Let your toddler help dry his body and hair, and apply lotion. Praise your child if he or she has bathed without a fuss.


If you bathe your toddler in the evenings, try using lavender-scented lotion. Some people think lavender relaxes children and makes it easier for them to fall asleep.

This may prevent trauma or other problems with your child unless his or her thumb sucking is causing other issues. Weigh out which option may be best for your child by considering his or her personality and other factors such as social pressure or your personal feelings.


Remember that sucking fingers is a natural reflex for children and may provide more comfort than harm, especially if you try and forcibly stop your child from sucking his or her fingers.;
, Your child may be sucking his or her fingers in response to stress or anxiety or it could be a natural reflex that’s become a habit. Pay attention to your child’s behaviors before and after sucking his or her fingers to help identify specific triggers for sucking.Track specific situations that cause your child to suck his or her fingers. Does the child do it when he or she has done something bad or is scared? Does your child suck his or her fingers only at night as a way to fall asleep? This can help you find the most effective strategies for eliminating triggers and breaking the sucking habit.
Ask your child why he or she sucks her thumb. In some cases, open communication is a good step towards dealing with the problem. Your child may also help you realize that you can provide comfort or activity in alternative ways., Once you’ve had a chance to identify any triggers that cause your child to suck his or her thumbs, you can slowly begin to get rid of them. Giving your child the comfort or activity he or she needs and/ or desires can be an important step to breaking the habit.Relieve your child’s stress or anxiety that provokes sucking his or her fingers. This could be something like a fear of the dark. In this case, you may want to put a nightlight in your child’s room and give her an activity to do, like reading a book, as she falls asleep. Likewise, if your child gets scared when you go away, make a small video to remind him or her that you will be home soon.

, In addition to children feeling anxiety or stress, bored children often suck their fingers.Providing your child ample activities and diversions can help distract the child from sucking on his or her fingers. Make sure your distractions are appropriate to day- or nighttime sucking habits.


Give your child plenty of toys with which to play during the day. Keeping your child busy is the easiest way to distract from sucking his or her fingers.
Have a hands-on activity or toy ready for your child if you notice him or her putting a hand or fingers toward the mouth. Inserting a toy into his or her hands will keep the fingers busy.

, Offering your child a substitute activity for his or her fingers can also help break the habit. It can be something as simple as giving the child a toy or having the child try a different movement with his or her fingers.Tell your child to try squeezing his or her thumb if he or she feels the need to suck the fingers.
Show your child how to play “hide the finger” game. For example, if your child wants to suck his or her thumb, tell him or her to “wrap your finger with another finger to hide it.”
Try sleep-inducing props to substitute finger sucking at night. For example, play lullabies or white noise for your child throughout the night. A teddy bear can also help reinforce other props.
Older children can try special anti-stress finger toys, like stress balls or fidget spinners as a distraction.

, If other tactics don’t work, try covering your child’s hands with bandages or a sock. The texture or even size of the covered hand can help get the child out of the habit of sucking on fingers in any situation.


Remember that you don’t want to embarrass your child. Consider bandaging the child’s hands only if he or she is not in school and not out in public. This may work best at home or when the child is sleeping., Having a simple conversation with your child may be enough to help him or her get on the right path to stopping the habit. Stay positive and offer gentle reminders to stop sucking his or her fingers may provide enough reinforcement to curtail his or her problem.Ask your child, “Did you know that sometimes you suck your thumb?” If your child says “no,” then it’s a good sign that the habit is a natural reflex that can easily be forgotten with gentle reminders. However, you may find that your child sucks his or her fingers as a way to get your attention. In this case, ignoring your child is sometimes the best way to break the habit.
Spare your child any embarrassment about his or her habit. If your child starts sucking his or her fingers in public out of habit, then have a special hand signal or private cue to alert him or her to stop. You could also use a code word such as “bubbles” to let your child know to stop.

, Breaking a habit is hard for a child to do, so it’s very important to encourage your child every step of the way. Remind your child how good it will feel to be a ""big girl” or a “big boy.""


Make sure to offer reassurance often, especially if the child makes a mistake. You can say, “I know this is really hard Sara, but you’re doing a great job at not sucking your fingers.”
Play a game of show and tell with your child to help encourage him or her. For example, stand with your child in front of a mirror and have her look at your and his or her teeth. If your child has a small gap, you can say, “If you keep sucking your fingers, you’ll end up looking like that wascally wabbit Bugs Bunny. Do you want to have big teeth like Bugs?”

, Part of encouraging your child is providing praise. Whenever your child has a milestone or does something that shows he or she is learning to not suck his or her fingers, remember to offer heaping praise. Not only does this make your child feel great, but can also reinforce the lessons you are teaching about not sucking on his or her fingers.Tell your child, “I haven’t seen you suck your thumbs at all today. Wait to go! Why don’t we put a sticker on the calendar?” Likewise, you could say, “Christopher, I noticed that you started to put your fingers in your mouth and then stopped and got a book. That was awesome and I am so proud of you!”
Offer verbal and other forms of praise. For example, put stickers on a calendar towards a reward or other goal. You could also make a sign for your child that says, “Way to go, Sam!” and decorate it with stars and other designs.

, If your child is meeting goals or has stopped sucking his or her fingers, reward him or her! You don’t have to do anything elaborate, just a small gesture such as an extra bedtime story, a trip to the park, or a small toy can help show your child you are proud of his or her accomplishment. In addition, it will help reinforce the lessons you are teaching your child about not sucking his or her fingers., In some cases, friends and acquaintances or some doctors may recommend covering your child’s nail with a bitter substance such as vinegar or a harmless polish. Be aware that these may backfire and cause your child significant stress and anxiety, which can lead to further finger sucking.Be aware that polishes or varnishes formulated to discourage finger sucking are not harmful to your child. They simply taste bad. Pay close attention and see how this approach affects your child. If it seems to be causing them more harm than good, try something else.

, Whatever you do, never scold, ridicule, or criticize your child’s finger sucking habit. This can cause your child significant trauma and may cause him or her to more fervently continue the habit. Use only positive words and remove yourself from a situation if you feel you cannot control your reaction to your child.Remind yourself that your child is a child. You might also want to remind yourself how hard it is for you to break bad habits and that is can be especially difficult for a child.

, Many children will stop sucking their fingers as toddlers. This may happen between the ages of 2 and 4, but could happen later as a result of peer pressure from school.Thumb sucking generally only becomes a problem for you if it either is a social issue for your child or his or her permanent teeth have started to develop. Reminding yourself that thumb sucking is a normal part of a childhood that eventually disappears may help you and your child avoid a traumatic experience.


Ask yourself if your child’s thumb sucking is harming him or her—or more you. This may help you figure out if this is the right time to break your child’s habit. Be aware that the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends treatment only for children who suck their fingers after the age of 5.

, If you are very worried about your child’s finger sucking habit and nothing is working to stop it, schedule an appointment with the dentist. Often a dentist can give you tips or tricks that may get your child to stop sucking his or her fingers. Even letting your dentist talk to your child may be enough to curtail the habit.Inform your dentist’s office why you are coming for the visit. Make sure to let the dentist know your concerns in private where your child cannot hear you, which may cause her trauma. Ask your dentist what he or she thinks is the best way to get your child to stop sucking his or her fingers.
A mouth guard or other special appliance may be recommended if the finger sucking is causing any problems.

Talk to your toddler.,
Refocus your child's attention.,
Make a brief goodbye ritual.,
Remind your toddler that you'll come back.,
Help your toddler adjust to the caregiver.,
Plan your absences.,
Avoid sneaking out.,
Create consistency.,
Consider what your toddler needs.,
Pay attention to mild signs of Separation Anxiety Disorder (SAD) in your toddler.,
Get a medical diagnosis.,
Follow the doctor's treatment plan.",How to Ease Toddler Separation Anxiety," It can be difficult to get out the door quickly if you have a toddler. But you should take the time to talk to your child before heading out. Let your child know where you're going, what you'll be doing, and when you're coming back. Avoid giving exact times since your toddler probably doesn't understand what 3pm or 5pm really means. This can remove a lot of fear and uncertainty that causes toddler anxiety.For example, say, ""I'm going to go to the grocery store to get food for dinner. I'll come back after your nap and before dinner time."";
, If your child focuses on you leaving, give a distraction. Ask your toddler to do something for you. This will help refocus its energy and attention away from you. It will also help your toddler feel independent and give your child a sense of accomplishment. For younger toddlers, try showing your child a new object or toy to distract them.For example, you could ask your toddler to hand you your bag or go give the caregiver a hug.

, Create a consistent goodbye ritual that will signal to your child that you're leaving. This will help your toddler feel secure and prepared. Over time, your toddler will understand that your ritual just means that you're about to leave. Good examples of goodbye rituals include:Kisses
High fives
A hug or a cuddle

, Your toddler might pay so much attention to you leaving that they forget you'll be coming back. Remind your toddler that you always come back. When you do come back, give your toddler a hug and state that you're back.Try to come back when you say you will. If you say you'll be home after the toddler's nap and before dinner, try to do it. This will help your toddler adjust to your absence and learn to trust you., Reduce your child's separation anxiety by helping your child feel comfortable with the caregiver. You might hang a picture of the caregiver on the fridge. You should also spend a few minutes talking with the caregiver in front of your child so they feel familiar.Talk about the caregiver when you're home with your toddler. Ask your toddler what they like about the caregiver or offer suggestions like ""Ms. Sarah is really nice, don't you think, Thomas?""

, You shouldn't feel like you can never leave your toddler if they're showing signs of separation anxiety. Instead, plan on keeping your absences short in the beginning. As your toddler gets used to these you can stretch the amount of time you're gone.For example, plan a quick trip or errand where you'll only be gone for about 5 minutes. If your toddler is fine with this length, gradually extend it.

, Many parents think that if their toddler doesn't see them leave, the toddler won't get upset. Unfortunately, this can actually be more distressing for your toddler once they realize you're gone. Instead, let your child know you'll be going, say a fast goodbye and then leave.Once you're out the door, stay gone. Don't run back in for another goodbye or because you forgot something. This can confuse your child and make them more upset.

, Change can be scary for toddlers. To ease your toddler's anxiety try to create a safe and secure environment for them while you're gone. Your child may be comforted by their favorite books or toys. You should also leave your toddler with the same caregiver, if you can. Your child will gradually become familiar with this person and will feel more comfortable.For example, ask the caregiver to come to your house to watch your toddler. Set aside a few special books that only the caregiver gets to read to your toddler. This will become a familiar routine for your toddler.

, If you can plan your schedule, try to choose drop off times when your child isn't stressed. Try to avoid dropping off or leaving your child when your toddler is tired (right before nap time) or hungry. Your child will be more likely to throw a tantrum if they feel that their needs aren't being met.For example, you might try to run an errand after lunch but well before your toddler needs their nap.

, While most children will show some anxiety when a parent leaves, children with SAD will fear a parent leaving to the point that the child will cling to the parent around the house. The toddler may also show signs of sickness. For example, your toddler may have a headache or stomach ache. If your toddler has SAD, they might also refuse:To go to school or leave you
To go to sleep
To be alone

, If you've tried to comfort your toddler and adjust your goodbye routine, but your toddler is still anxious, they might have a more severe form of Separation Anxiety Disorder. If your toddler has any of these signs, consider taking them to a mental health professional for a diagnosis and help:Tantrums when you leave (yelling, screaming, crying)
Withdrawing from friends or family (staying away from people or wanting to be alone even when in a group of familiar people)
Fear of leaving the house (not wanting to go anywhere outside for fear that something bad will happen)
Showing actual physical signs of distress (stomachaches, nightmares, or bed wetting)

, Your child will probably need to frequently meet with a child psychologist or psychiatrist. The doctor may treat your child's SAD with a combination of treatments. These can include:Talk or play therapy: A therapist will encourage your toddler to talk so your toddler is able to share their feelings. This can help the therapist tailor further therapies or medications. If your child is too young to speak, the therapist may recommend play therapy to help your child work on their anxiety.
Family counseling: In addition to talk therapy for your toddler, the therapist may recommend working with your toddler in family counseling. Family counseling can help you understand what your toddler fears and teach you ways to respond to your toddler's anxiety.
Medication: If your toddler isn't responding to therapy or counseling, your psychiatrist may recommend adding medication to the treatment. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are commonly prescribed to help your toddler manage severe anxiety."

Set up a rewards program.,
Leave the pacifier in the bed, as it is an aid to sleep.,
Never let the baby walk around with a pacifier in his mouth -- the baby is in the beginning stages of speech when they are walking and a pacifier can interfere with their ability to communicate.

,
Another trick is to cut the nipple of the pacifier and the baby won't like it as much.,
Simply take it away.,
Use an older child as an example.,
Inform the child that there are other children that need binkies that are just being born.,
Propose a trade of a toy for a pacifier.",How to Get a Child to Quit Using a Pacifier," Give your child a star each day they go without, and after they have (x) number of stars consistently, they can get a treat, like a Popsicle, or even going to the movies.;
, This should be started when the baby is under one.

,, Cut a little more every few days.

, This will upset the child for a few days, and they may dislike you for about a week. But after that, they won't remember. And you can have a huge sigh of relief because you don't have to deal with it anymore. This is most effective for younger children, who can't understand a reward system like a 3-5 year-old could.


, Even a cartoon character, like Dora the Explorer would work. You just have to say, ""You don't see your cousin Sam with a Binky, do you? That's because he's a big boy. And you want to be a big boy don't you?"" often works. Using a model can help them begin understanding comparisons earlier than say, preschool.

, Send him out to hang them on a tree,or to hide them throughout the house, so that the Binky fairy can pick them up. Keep a close watch to see where he hid them, and then get them that night. Leave a small gift, something cheap and plastic but that the child will like, in each child's place.

, Say, ""Well, (child's name), I don't know... That's a toy for big kids. How about we trade? You give me your pacifier, and I'll buy you the toy."" It really works, especially on girls."
"
Recognize stages of play.,
Offer enough of the same toy.,
Engage kids in activities.,
Avoid isolating the kids.,
Give the kids verbal encouragement.",How to Encourage Parallel Play1," Young children go through several distinct stages when learning how to play and interact with others. Although kids go through these stages in order, they still use each type of play as they grow. So, a preschooler may engage in parallel play for a while before going off to play by themselves or join a group game. These are the stages you can expect to see in young children:Independent or solitary play: This is when babies and one year olds play by themselves. They're usually interested in exploring how an object works.
Parallel play: Two to three year olds begin to interact or play with the same toys while near each other, but they don't play with each other.
Cooperative or reciprocal play: By age three most kids start to play with one another. This may be part of playing a game or sharing toys with each other.;
, Set out several toys or activities that are the same. This will encourage the kids to play near each other without grabbing or fighting over the toys. For example, set out two of the same dolls or a handful of the same toy blocks. Give them toys that stimulate their imaginations or allow them to build and create. Good toys for parallel play include:Playdough
Sandbox and toys
Paints
Blocks
Coloring books and crayons
Water tables

, Kids don't have to be playing with toys or objects in order to play next to each other. Get their attention and tell them that you're going to play a game. The kids can stand or sit next to each other while they follow a listening game or sing songs. The kids will all be playing the same game or activity, but will only be controlling their own movements and play.


For example, you could lead the kids in yoga positions or have them play Simon Says. Both require the kids to focus on you while they complete the same action.

, Keep the kids together in the same room when they're playing, even if they're not directly playing with each other. Playing near or next to each other will eventually encourage them to move on to cooperative or reciprocal play. Try to keep play areas close to each other so the kids can watch each other play if they wish.Kids learn how to play and even copy each other while they're engaged in parallel play. This is why it's important to keep them near each other.

, You might notice kids watching you or clinging to you instead of playing. They might just be frightened or anxious of social interaction with kids their own age. Gently get the kids interested in playing by saying something like ""What toy is that little girl playing with? That game looks interesting.""


Avoid simply telling the kids to go play with another child. They'll be more likely to play next to another child if they're curious.

"
"
Choose a calm environment.,
Limit the playdate.,
Get one child to begin an activity.,
Keep the playdate short.",How to Encourage Parallel Play2," Playdates for small children who are learning how to interact with others should be in a location that's free from distractions. This will prevent them from feeling anxious or overwhelmed. Consider having the playdate at a calm place that one or both of the children are already familiar with.


For example, you might meet up at a cozy corner of the library or choose a park in the neighborhood. Just ensure that you go when the location isn't popular or busy.

, Keep the playdate small so the kids don't become overwhelmed. Only have two kids around the same age at the playdate. It may help if one of the kids is already engaging in parallel play. This way, one child can model the behavior to the other kid.If you have three or more kids at the playdate, one of them will probably feel left out. It will also make it more difficult for the kids to share their toys.

, Have the children sit near each other and give one child an activity to do. This could be any activity or object that both kids can eventually interact with together or on their own. For example, have one child start playing in a sand box, with play doh, or paint. The other child will become interested by watching the kid play. Both kids should soon begin playing next to each other.


Ensure that you set out enough of the objects or activities so the kids don't start fighting over the items. For example, avoid only setting out a couple of blocks which only one child could play with.

, Don't expect the kids to play well for an extended period of time. Cut the playdate off around one hour if it's the kids' first time playing near each other. As they get older and more comfortable playing around each other, you could extend the playdate to two hours.If the kids become cranky, bored, or aggressive, they might just be done with the playdate.

"
"
Teach solitary play skills.,
Play next to the kid.,
Let kids play next to each other.,
Give physical cues to play.,
Monitor and encourage the kids.",How to Encourage Parallel Play3," Kids learn how to play by themselves when they examine how toys work. You can teach a child with autism how to play independently by teaching them basic play skills. Start small, with one-step toy manipulation. For example, teach the kid how to bang a toy hammer or drum or brush a doll's hair. Once they've learned basic play, you can teach two-step toy manipulation, like:""Feeding"" the doll or putting it to bed
Pressing buttons on a phone or musical toy
Placing a spoon into a bowl and stirring with the spoon

, Children with autism might feel overwhelmed if they're immediately exposed to other kids during play time. Other kids can be unpredictable which can make it harder to teach play skills. Start by playing next to the kid with autism. For example, get out a couple of coloring books and sets of crayons. Begin coloring and the child with autism can begin coloring when they feel comfortable.Follow the kid's lead when it comes to playing. Some kids with autism might like having someone sit near them as they play. You may be able to directly play games or engage in cooperative play.
You should also model a playful expression. Sing, laugh, smile, clap, and make funny voices when teaching play skills.

, Once the child with autism has become comfortable playing around adults, expose them to a play group or other kids in a playful space. This will let the kid with autism become familiar with other kids. Try to choose kids who will cooperate and play easily. If the child with autism has motor delays, try to get them to play with slightly younger kids. This way, they'll easily be able to physically interact when they play.Set out motivating toys like balls, blocks, beads or puzzles for the kids to interact with.
If the child with autism show signs that they don't want to play near the kids (showing signs of aggression like hitting or biting), don't force the play time. Work on letting the child become more comfortable by playing around adults.

, While you can encourage a child with autism to play by instructing them, it's better to use small physical prompts. For example, instead of saying, ""Put the puzzle together,"" show the child how the pieces connect. The kid can continue putting together the puzzle on their own. Cut back on the number of cues or prompts you use to get the child to play.Limit the number of verbal prompts you give. This will prevent the child from relying on it and will help them play more independently.

, Kids with autism have different preferences when it comes to personal space. If the kids are far apart when they play, you might need to scoot them a little closer together. As you do this, you should encourage the kids. For example, say, ""Good job playing together!"" and give them a reward (like a sticker or treat).Consider setting out small squares of carpet or place mats with activities to encourage the kids to play near each other.
Pay attention to how both kids are interacting. If one is struggling with the play time, you may need to move them apart a little and offer more encouragement.

Choose clothes your toddler will be comfortable in.,
Choose clothes made from cotton where possible.,
Consider layering your toddler's clothes.,
Opt for clothes in bright colors and patterns.,
Play around with denims.,
Choose sturdy, good quality shoes.,
Pick out some hats and caps.,
Choose a light, easy-to-use toddler carrier.,
Protect any exposed skin from mosquito bites.,
Use sunblock to prevent your toddler's skin from burning.",How to Dress Your Toddler in Spring," Make sure to consider your toddler’s comfort when dressing her up for spring. Spring days are longer and tend to alternate between cold, warm and wet.


Making sure to check the day’s weather report will help you decide how best to dress your toddler. Make sure clothes are lightweight and cool, but that they can still protect your toddler from the direct exposure to sunlight when outdoors.
Toddlers may develop rashes if their clothes are too restrictive or warm for the weather. However, they may also develop sunburn if they are not protected by appropriate clothing.
You’ve no use for fleece fabrics during this time of the year, so it’s best to just store them in the closet until the next winter season.;
, Cotton should be your fabric of choice because it is a breathable fabric. Here are some cotton fabrics that are suitable for babies and toddlers:



Supima Cotton: This is 100% American, extra long, stable cotton whose textile strength is generally more durable than the usual upland cottons. It has fine-textured fibers which enhances the softness and drape-ability of the fabric as well as the vividness of the color.

Seersucker or gingham cotton: This is a thin fabric made of cotton commonly used for spring and summer wardrobes. Seersucker cotton is made in a such way that some threads are intentionally bunched together so the whole fabric gets a wrinkled appearance which prevents the fabric from sticking to the skin.

Gingham cotton: This a medium weight, plain woven fabric made of yarn blended with cotton. Gingham cotton is generally a more affordable fabric and is mostly woven with a checked pattern.

, Layering allows you to easily remove a part of your toddler’s outfit or add and extra layer when the weather suddenly shifts from cold to warm to wet and back to cold again.


You may dress your toddler in a cotton onesie , then layer on cotton pants and a long sleeved shirt or a cotton jacket. If it gets too warm, you may remove the pants and the jacket or if it suddenly gets too cold you can easily drape a cotton blanket over your toddler.
If you find yourself suddenly caught in a rain shower with your little toddler while out for a walk, make sure you have a raincoat for her that’s made of waterproof material such as nylon.

, Spring is the time of the year when you are free to dress your toddler in lively colors. Bright colors such as yellow, pink and orange or pastel colors like baby pink or baby blue and purple are all fun colors for spring.


Patterns with flowers or simple fun prints are also good for girls. Blue checkered or striped clothing are acceptable options for little boys or you may go for greys or dark blues.
Easily, the best patterns for spring are nautical or sailor patterns, cute dinosaur characters or animal patterns for boys while princesses, fairies, floral patterns and cute graphic designs in soft hues of pink, yellow or brown for girls.

, Spring is the perfect season for denims. Of course, when shopping for your toddler choose cotton denims designed for breathability and fabric softness. You can buy denim jackets for your little one or denim pants perfect for an outdoor walk or trip to the mall.

, Sturdy shoes are a good option for your child to perform outdoor activities more comfortably. Choose shoes that are suitable for running, climbing, skateboarding, and other kids’ shenanigans.


Make sure that you purchase high quality shoes which can withstand all sorts of impacts and pressure.
If you choose wisely, your child can even use this pair of shoes for her summer camps and other activities.

, Hats are great for when a toddler has to rapidly transition from a warm environment to a cold environment. For example:


When you toddler has to enter a mall or grocery store that is air conditioned from walking outside when it is warm and sunny, or when she has to leave a heated house on a frosty morning. This helps your toddler regulate her body temperature.
Caps on the other hand are great for shielding your toddler from the sun’s rays when it is especially sunny outside. Choose caps that will reflect sunlight such as white or yellow ones. Choose caps made with woven fibers to allow for breathability.

, Some parents fail to consider the type of toddler carriers they are using when thinking about dressing their toddler for spring.


However, some toddler carriers used during winter are too thick and cumbersome for toddlers when used during spring. So, it is best to choose another type of toddler carrier that is lighter and more suitable for spring.
For example, consider buying an Ergo or Moby wrap – they are a bit pricey but since they are made from breathable, durable and soft materials, they are quickly becoming favorites among both parents and their toddlers.

, Parents sometimes allow their toddlers to wear shorts and t-shirts in springtime when it’s warm enough to play outside.


However, if you do dress your toddler in these clothes, make sure to protect their skin against mosquito bites. You may use a citronella based lotion that works to repel mosquitoes.
Also make sure not to let your child play near puddles of water that might have mosquito larvae or mosquitoes flying around.

, Summer is not the only season to bring out sunscreen or sunblocks. Protect your toddler against the harmful rays of the sun by using a pediatrician recommended sunscreen on your toddler when she's playing outside.


The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends the use of sunblock with an SPF level above 30 and whose main ingredient is zinc oxide or titanium oxide. Banana Boat is one brand widely used for children.
Make sure to ask your pediatrician first before buying sunblock for your toddler.

Encourage the use of blocks.,
Avoid managing their play.,
Encourage pretend play.,
Get them out of the house.,
Schedule playdates.,
Purchase imaginative toys.,
Read to them before bed.,
Reinvent everyday household items.,
Explore new things as a family.,
Unplug from TV and other electronics.,
Be silly.,
Accept their imaginary friend.,
Carefully select their preschool.,
Expose them to the arts.,
Be flexible with their attire.",How to Encourage Your Toddler's Imagination," Toy blocks and other construction toys help with creativity, and sharpen crucial skills like motor and spatial skills. The purpose of a block is to build and create something larger than the block itself and is a great metaphor for life as a whole. Give your child a set of blocks and play with them, watching and helping as they create various structures.Try to find blocks of all different colors, shapes and sizes.
Don’t make assumptions. Instead of saying “Are you building a house?” say “What are you making?”
Begin incorporating blocks at around the age that your child can sit up and hold things alone, perhaps around 9 months of age.;
, Though you should play with your toddler often, you should still allow them to do so on their own most of the time. As the adult, you might tend to take over or direct their play more than you might realize, which can stifle their creativity since they will rely on you for directives. Instead, set time where they can play on their own terms apart from you.This could be while you are cooking or cleaning or enjoying some time to yourself.
Keep them safe, however. Childproof your home to give yourself peace of mind while they are playing alone. Check on them every few minutes or allow them to play in the room that you are in.

, Though you should not always manage their play, you can give them certain ideas to help spark their own creativity. Encourage your child to ‘pretend play’ by assigning them a role like “doctor” and you serving as the “patient” or by allowing them to choose the scenario. This will allow them expand their imagination by imagining themselves to be a different person.This is a also a good way to encourage cooperative play and help develop social skills.


They can pretend play with their siblings or friends, as well.
Allow them to use props for the pretending like costumes, pots, blocks, etc.

, Though playing indoors can be fun, there is a whole world outside that will offer them far more to explore. Allow them to go outside for at least 30 minutes daily when the weather is nice. You can even take them for a walk in the neighborhood., Though it is nice for your toddler to play with you or to play alone, playing with other children their age can really help to spark their imagination. They will also learn to develop interpersonal and conflict resolution skills, as well. Contact your friends who have children around the same age or other parents at the daycare/school your child attends.You might say “Hey, I was wondering if you wanted to let Isaiah come over on Saturday for a couple of hours to play with Frederick?”
You can also schedule playdates online through Meetup groups and by registering for local community toddler activity classes.

, In addition to blocks, there are several others toys that you can get for your child to spark their imagination including:


Art kits
Dress up clothes
Small instruments
A magnifying glass
Clay or Play Doh
Legos

, Another way to spark your child’s imagination is by reading stories to them. These stories allow your child to think about a reality beyond their own and also to visualize the story as you read it. Encouraging a love for reading at a young age can help to foster a lifelong development of imagination and creativity. Choose stories that they can relate to as well as those very different or out of the ordinary.Allow them to select the book every other night.
Tell them stories. You can even try trading off lines or allowing them to fill in the blank. For instance say “Once upon a time there was a beautiful girl named ___ who lived in a ___.”

, Teach them to think outside of the box by using everyday items to create something new and unexpected. Use chair cushions and blankets to make a fort. Use pots and pans to make music. Doing so will encourage them to employ similar inventive ideas., In order to encourage your child to explore, you must model that for them. Try new foods as a family, go to a new park, or try a different route going home from their school. Foster a culture of exploration in them at a young age and they will develop an inquisitive personality and imaginative brain.Make sure to maintain a regular structure so that they can integrate the new experiences. Too much inconsistency and newness can be disorienting and unhealthy for a toddler.

, Though technology can be helpful at times in fostering imagination, it can also take up too much mental space and prevent you from thinking creatively. Limit and monitor the amount of TV your child is watching and avoid providing them with games on a tablet.Letting your toddler play with others and physical objects has been proven to be better for development.Allow electronic use for a maximum of two hours per day.
Model good behavior by limiting your own cellphone and TV use while they are awake.

, To encourage your toddler’s imagination, step outside of always being the “serious adult.” Wear a tiara while you do chores to make your toddler laugh. Get into character during random moments like dinner time. Use a different voice sometimes. This will teach your child about how flexible their own personality is., Children with imaginary friends tend to be better at tasks that involve imagining how someone else might think and also tend to engage more with peers socially.If your toddler should have an imaginary friend, don’t shun or discourage them. Instead, accept this and allow them to explore their imagination fully.Imaginary friends are seen most often in only children.

, When you are selecting a daycare or preschool for your child, be as peculiar as possible. Many schools offer art classes or even teach a second language, so you should try to choose programs like this to foster your child’s creative mind.Read reviews online or talk to your friends who have older children about what they did.

, At an early age, expose your child to different cultures and experiences. Take them to museums and art galleries. Take them to festivals in your area. Learn about other cultures and encourage your child to do the same.Expose them to different activities, such as music and dance. The more they experience, the more you can see which activities pique their curiosity and interest to pursue further.


Look in your local newspaper or on social media to find upcoming cultural events that are kid-friendly.

, Though it is important to teach your child about proper dress, you should give your child some choice in what they put on their bodies. Doing so reinforces the idea that their opinion matters and can be used to shift how they look and what they do, which encourages imagination. If they want to wear an outfit that is a bit strange or mismatched, allow them to do so every so often.Allow them to dress as they like while at home, as well.

Wait for the child’s parents to speak up.,
Don’t single anyone out.,
Remove your own child from the situation.,
Speak to your child.,
Talk to the parents of the problem child.,
Treat kids like people.,
Find out their interests.,
Get down to the kid's level.,
Ask the right questions.,
Refer kids back to their parents.,
Talk to an adult.,
See things from the perspective of the child or his parents.",How to Deal With Annoying Kids1," Parenting is a very personal thing so avoid disciplining someone else’s child without the permission of his parents. Your actions may seem inappropriate if you don’t have similar parenting techniques. For example, some parents may not yell or scold their children publicly.Discipline is not your job and neither is seeing if the child’s parents discipline their child. Children may work out their bad behaviour amongst themselves so there may not even be a need to interfere. Try to stay out of day-to-day stuff so that children learn to play with others.For less severe behaviour you can distract a child without disciplining them. Offer them to get a drink or play at a new area.;
, Use “we” instead of “you” to create a more communal or team oriented approach. You don’t want a child to feel like he is being picked on for being a problem. For example, say something like “we don’t say that, that’s not nice.”, If another child has become uncontrollable and violent, immediately take your child away. Whether you make an excuse to leave or inform the child’s parent’s that it’s time for a break, your child’s safety is your number one concern.If it is happening at your home, simply separate the children into different rooms and call their parents.

, Do not allow another child’s bad behaviour to influence your child. Let your child know what is expected of her beforehand and check in afterwards for affirmation or discipline if she hasn’t followed your rules., Be careful not to offend as you may come across as judgemental and they may accuse you of your own parenting shortcomings. Ease into the conversation with a compliment and come to a satisfactory solution together.For example, say something like “Simon is a great boy and our son loves when he can stay and play but sometimes Simon is a bit too rough.” Make sure only to let the parents know as the kids or other parents may make them become defensive if present.

, Try not to use a different tone or down down your vocabulary when talking to children. You just want to have a conversation so don’t build it up to something more especially if you’re already anxious around kids., Make a connection by listening to what these children talk about and asking questions. This is easy as kids often will start a conversation without being prompted if comfortable. If you are dealing with shy children, engage them by talking about toys that they enjoy.If you are finding it difficult, think of yourself as a sportscaster and simply narrate the action that you see. “Oh, you’re playing with blocks. Looks like a castle. Is it a castle?” Let the child feel that you are interested and she will become engaged in a conversation., Get down to eye level and make eye contact. Sit on a chair, get down on one knee, or just lower yourself down to make yourself less intimidating to a child. Also, don’t talk too fast or loud.Do not touch any child. Avoid touching other children , even in an innocent or non-threatening way because it could be misinterpreted by the child or someone watching you.

, Ask questions about games, toys, movies, etc. Don’t ask private questions that may make them uncomfortable like “Do you have a girlfriend?” You want to ask questions that make them happy and want to interact with you in a positive way., Kids tend not to have a filter so if they ask something that you feel is inappropriate for you to answer, defer them back to their parents. You may also ask them to answer it. “What do you think?”For example, “That’s an awesome question! I bet your mom and dad know the answer better than me.”

, If you are in a place of business like a restaurant or office you can talk to a manager if a child’s behaviour is bothering you. You can asked to be moved or for them to speak to the parents. However, make sure the situation warrants you speaking up. If you can simply tune the child out, do it.If you’re in a restaurant and a child’s parents are allowing their child to be obnoxious and over the top, chances are other customers will also speak up. Be careful not to bother staff or parents with petty requests.

, Kids are allowed to have fun and laugh. They may be oblivious to social etiquette but they have rights to be themselves. Kids will especially be rambunctious if they are in a new place and have been bored the entire day. Also, remember parents have a right to take out their kids and relieve some stress of being at home.Empathise with parents and the stress that comes with having to entertain children. If you approach a parent in a confrontational way you may be adding to her stress. A better approach is to be helpful and to keep calm.

Reassure clinginess.,
Set the tone and don’t reinforce whining.,
Set rules for tattling.,
Get your child involved in food preparation to avoid picky eating.,
Don’t let your kids avoid chores.,
Get your child to cuss alone.",How to Deal With Annoying Kids2," While some kids are more sociable than others, your child can become clingy when she is uneasy about a new situation. Kids can read body language and look to you for reassurance. Don’t forcibly pry your child off you but allow her to stay close for about ten minutes and slowly separate yourself.Sit close by, play with her, and talk to her but don’t hold your child. Stay in the the same room as you slowly move away. Make sure to always say goodbye to let your child know that you will be returning.

, Kids whine because they want something but don’t know how to get it. Don’t give in to your child but rather model the tone you would like your child to use. Say things like, “use your words” or “does daddy like whining? How do you ask for something?”Make sure to praise your child when he uses the correct tone and asks for something politely. Show her what you mean if she doesn’t remember how to ask.

, Kids tell on each other because they are developing their sense of right and wrong and get upset when they see a rule being broken. Tell your child that it’s your job to find out who’s breaking the rules as long as no one is getting hurt or doing something dangerous. Cut down on siblings squabbling by giving them their separate space.If you are short on space, even assigning a corner to each sibling can suffice. Let them be able to put their stuff down and and know that they are in charge of that area.

, Children are naturally picky eaters as they want familiar food to comfort them. It is also one of the only times when they can have control. Get your child involved in choosing and preparing her own food. For example, allow her to wash the potatoes or sprinkle cheese on pasta.You may also set a timer so your child doesn’t dilly dally during a meal. If your child is hungry, keep healthy snacks available on low shelves. Snacks like whole-grain cereal and granola.

, Kids avoid chores because they obviously don’t enjoy doing them. Place a large box somewhere inconvenient, like the garage, and place any toys in for a few days if your kids don’t put it away when you ask. This teaches them to not only put their toys away but also that there is a consequence for not following rules., Children enjoy cursing once they see the reaction it gets from others. They may want to get attention or may think it’s appropriate if they see adults repeating it. Don’t make a big deal of a curse word but tell your boy to go upstairs and curse all he wants in his room. Not having an audience makes it less entertaining.Let other family know that it’s not okay to laugh when your child curses. Also, let your child know that curse words can hurt people’s feelings. Find replacement words with your child so they don’t use more vulgar language.

Remain calm.,

Teach them to do it in private.,
Answer their questions.,
Remind them not to touch others.,
Help them cope in other ways.,
Spot signs of abuse.,
Get professional help.",How to Deal with Toddlers Who Touch Themselves," Children may delight in outrageous acts in order to get a rise. For example, your child might jump out of their room fully naked and feel proud of themselves. If your child tends to be an exhibitionist, don’t give a reaction, as this takes the fun out of it.Respond calmly without giving them a rise.

For example, say, “Who took your clothes from you?” or, “I didn’t realize it was naked day.”;
, Especially if your child touches themselves absent-mindedly, redirect their attention. This can be helpful when your child is in public and you don’t want to talk about their touching or turn it into a discussion. One of the best things to do it to put something in their hands to touch instead. This gives them an activity and keeps them focused on something else.

Say, “Will you hold this for me?” or, “Let’s play with this instead.”

, Never slap your child’s hand when they are touching themselves. This can send a negative message about their body, sexuality, and their normal curiosity. Do not use force of any kind, and instead, use your words. It might take time for your child to remember not to touch themselves, so be patient.Say, “Hands out of your pants,” or, “It’s not an appropriate time to do that.”

, Let your child know that you understand that it feels good when they touch themselves. Avoid shaming them or acting very embarrassed yourself.You want your child to have a healthy relationship with their body and their own sexuality. Be gentle in how you talk about it and how you ask your child to stop.

Avoid saying things that might embarrass them or make them see their curiosity as wrong or bad.
For example, say, “I know it feels good to touch yourself, but this is not an appropriate time.”

, Let your child know that it’s normal to be curious about their body and want to explore it. When they find something that feels good, it’s normal to want to do it again.Remember that toddlers are curious and experimental.

Allowing your toddler to experiment with age-appropriate behaviors will make them more likely to develop healthy attitudes toward sexuality and their body.

, Let your child know that it’s not okay to show their private parts to other people, especially in public. Make it clear that touching and exploring behaviors are acceptable only at home.If they tend to show their private parts or touch themselves while out of the house, set a clear boundary.

For example, say, “That’s something that’s okay at home, but it’s not okay with other people around.”

, Without showing judgment or disapproval, gently encourage your child to explore their body in private. This is a good time to discuss what privacy is and why it’s important.Keep discussion of privacy ongoing and age-appropriate. If your child asks why they need to do it in private, say that it’s similar to using the restroom.

, Toddlers are becoming aware of their bodies and their gender identity. They will likely ask you questions about their bodies, other people’s bodies, and perhaps even be curious to talk about masturbation. They might be curious about gender identity and differences between boys and girls. If they raise questions, answer them in an age-appropriate way. Be calm and straightforward and try not to be embarrassed as you answer.You may not want to have the sex talk quite yet, but feel free to talk about what they’re curious about. For example, say, “Yes, it feels good when you touch your private parts. They were made to feel good.”

, While it’s normal to explore their own body, teach your child not to touch other children or adults, especially near their private parts. This can also help them learn about privacy and how to respect other people.If you see your child touching another child inappropriately, gently redirect them and say, “Please don’t touch Riley like that.”

Tell your toddler that no one should touch them in a way that makes them feel uncomfortable, either.

, If your child constantly masturbates and doesn’t seem to be comforted by anything else, consider whether they are stressed, anxious, lonely, or bored.If masturbation appears to be a stress relief method, help your child find other ways of dealing with their emotions. For example, practice labeling their emotions and talking about their feelings. If your child is anxious, take some deep breaths together to help calm down.

If they see masturbation as a stress-relief, let them know that it’s okay to touch themselves but that there are other ways of dealing with their feelings.

, Children may act out their experiences when they don’t have the words to say what’s going on. If they suddenly start playing out experiences or situations that are strongly sexual beyond exploring their body parts, take note of the signs they’re exhibiting. Some toddlers may become extra clingy or refuse to separate from their caretaker. Others may regress developmentally and revert to stages they passed long ago. Look out for aggressive play with their toys, other children, or the caretaker.If you suspect your child is being abused, take it seriously. Remove them from any suspected perpetrators and seek help from the authorities.

, If your child is touching themselves inappropriately and does not seem to want to or be able to stop, it might be time to bring it up to their pediatrician or perhaps even a therapist. Especially if your toddler is very interested in other sexual activities or touching other children, it’s important to consult with a professional and seek their advice.

A professional may be able to help you talk to your child about their behavior or how to approach the action in a positive way. They can also help you assess if abuse is occurring and help you seek intervention and support."

Determine the cause of your child’s fears.,
Help your child overcome her fears of water.,
Take a bath with your child.,
Change the temperature.,
Do away with the drain.",How to Deal with a Toddler Who Is Afraid of Baths1," Some toddlers have genuine fear and anxiety about bath time. Your toddler won’t necessarily tell you outright what it is that worries her, so you have to observe her actions. Sometimes the cause of the fear is the water (is it too cold for her? Or too hot for her?).


Sometimes it’s the bathtub (is it too “empty” or too crowded with toys?).
Other times it’s the drain in the tub, which some toddlers think is a small black hole that will swallow them alive.
It may also be the whole set up during bathtime (is it too quiet, or too noisy and hurried?).;
, Once you have figured out what her fear or fears are, find creative ways to help her overcome her fear(s). For water, one way to help your child overcome her fears is to make the water more enticing.


Add a drop of food coloring to make the water seem magical, or run a bath full of bubbles for your child.
If your child is afraid of getting into a full tub, try putting your child into the tub and then filling the tub with water. Let her turn on the water faucet so that she feels like she can control the situation.

, If your toddler is terrified of the tub, help her get clean by taking a bath with her. Having you there to support her in the tub will help to make your toddler feel safe.


Tell her that being clean is important, that’s why mommy/daddy is going to get clean with her.

, If you observe that your toddler is afraid of the water temperature, try to see if she responds better to a warmer or cooler water temperature.


Make sure to keep the temperature of the bathroom warm so that she does not get the shivers when she is drying off.

, Some kids are terrified of the drain; to be fair, it is a scary black hole under the water. Try to explain to your toddler that the drain is really just a small hole for taking dirty water away, but that the drain won’t take her away because she is clean.


Show your child that the drain will not suck her away by putting a toy over the drain. Point out that if the toy can’t get sucked down the drain, then she definitely can’t get taken down the drain.

"
Understand that timing is everything.,
Be aware that a switch in routines can trigger your child’s unhappiness about having to take a bath.,
Explain the change in routine to your child.,
Set clear expectations.,
Prepare for bath time.",How to Deal with a Toddler Who Is Afraid of Baths2," You most likely won’t win a battle with a toddler who is at the height of enjoying her playtime if you start telling her its bath time. Instead, create a routine for your toddler so that she develops an understanding of when bath time will occur.


Stick to this schedule and have bath time at the same time each day. For example, your toddler’s routine could involve playing outside, eating dinner, and then taking a bath. If you were to have your toddler take a bath before eating dinner, she will be less inclined to do it because it will disrupt the regular schedule.

, Once you have created a routine for your toddler, try to stick to it as much as possible. Toddlers rely heavily on routines, which means that if something gets done out of order, your toddler is more likely to feel uncomfortable with the activities she has to do, like taking a bath.


Of course, there are days where a change in routine is unavoidable. What to do in these situations is discussed in the next step.

, If there is no way to avoid a change in the schedule, sit your child down when she is in her best possible mood. Calmly explain to her the reason that the schedule is being changed and what will happen (ie. she needs to take a bath right after dinner so there’s a chance she will have to miss playing with her doll after dinner, and before going to bed).


However, you should also remind her that if she takes a bath quickly and does not put up a fight, there still may be time to play with her doll before bed.

, Tell your toddler that you expect her to be clean all that time, and that in order to be clean she has to take a bath. Explaining your expectations to your child will help her to understand the importance of bathtime.

, To make bath time run as efficiently as possible, prepare for it before bathtime actually begins. Have the tub ready and waiting for your toddler. Other ways to prepare include:


Fill the tub with warm water that is the right temperature for your toddler
Have a washcloth nearby, as well as your toddler’s body wash and shampoo. Keep these last two items out of your toddler’s reach.
Hang your toddler’s towel near by so that you can be ready to rub her down when she gets out of the tub.
Make sure that her diapers and pajamas or day clothes are set and ready so that you can help her get dressed immediately.
Place a mat that you can kneel on next to the tub. This will help keep your knees from getting hurt.






Place a no-slip grip on the bottom of the bathtub so that your child cannot slip while standing in the tub.

"
"
Keep baths short but enjoyable.,
Add some toys to the bathtub to help distract your child from her bathtime fears.,
Distract your child with bubbles.,
Keep your child occupied with a song or story.,
Buy skin-sensitive products for your child’s bathtime.,
Try taking a bath or shower with your child.,
Explain what is going to happen while you rinse her off.",How to Deal with a Toddler Who Is Afraid of Baths3," Your aim is to get your child to bathe and enjoy the experience, not to let her play during bath time. Play is incorporated as a way to make the experience enjoyable but your toddler needs to understand she’s not in the bathroom to play.


Allow her to play for a little while, but make sure that she understands that the reason she is taking a bath is because you want her to be clean.

, Adding a few toys to the tub can help your child to feel safer and more relaxed during bathtime. The toys will also distract your child while you wash her. Some bathtime toy ideas include:


A rubber ducky.
Bathtub letters and numbers that can stick to the wall.
Balls that float.
Plastic animal toys that will not be destroyed by the water.

, If your child is wary about the water, try to make the water engaging by adding bubbles. Your child will have fun playing in the bubble bath while you scrub her clean. Make sure to get bubble bath that will not irritate your toddler’s skin.


If you don’t have bubble bath, you can also consider blowing bubbles while your child is in the bath. The bubbles may help to distract her from her fear of the bath.

, While your child is in the bath, sing her a song or tell her a story that will distract her while you bathe her. You could even incorporate the bath into the song or story to help your child engage with bathtime.


You could come up with a story about a girl who set out on the high seas to find treasure. On the high seas she discovers that the only way she will be able to access the treasure is if she makes herself as clean as possible. (Consider purchasing some fake treasure for your child to play with after bathtime if you use a story like this).

, One reason that toddlers develop a fear of the bath is because they have had a bad experience where soap got in their eyes, or shampoo irritated their skin. To keep this from happening, make sure to purchase products that are designed for sensitive toddler skin.


Do not scrub your child’s skin too intensely with the loofah or washcloth.

, If your toddler absolutely refuses to take a bath, suggest that you take one together. If you are in the water with your child, she will be less likely to feel afraid.


Do not punish your child for outright refusing to take a bath; punishing your child could lead your child to develop an even deeper fear of bathtime.

, A lot of children find being rinsed off to be the scariest part of bathtime. This is because they have to close their eyes and have water poured over them, which could be scary for anyone, let alone a toddler. Explain each step of the rinsing process so that your child understands what is happening.


Tell her that she needs to close her eyes, but that mommy or daddy will be right beside her the whole time.
Assure your toddler that the water won’t get into her eyes if she keeps them closed. You should also mention that water won’t get into her nose, ears, or mouth if she doesn’t squirm around too much.

"
"
Applaud your child for a job well done.,
Get her out of the tub slowly and carefully.,
Ask your child what worries her if she is still putting up a fight during bathtime.",How to Deal with a Toddler Who Is Afraid of Baths4," Praise can go a long way, even for as mundane a task as taking a bath. Tell her that she was brave and was so grown up during the bath. Your toddler will be proud of herself and, with a routine in place, will be much happier to take a bath next time.

, Make sure that she doesn’t slip while she is trying to get out of the tub. Continue to praise her while you dry her off and then tell her what is going to happen next (be it some playtime, dinner, or bedtime).

, When your child explains what worries her, work around that worry. Don’t judge your child for the worry, even if it silly; instead show support and demonstrate that you understand her feelings.


Make her understand that you will always be there to guide her during bathtime until she’s ready to bathe on her own

Know when to redirect.,
Explain when you can.,
Change their line of thinking.,
Create empathy.,
Provide alternatives.,
Relocate the child.",How to Discipline Toddlers1," Toddlers move very quickly from one feeling to the next, so if one can distract them long enough for them to forget what they’re upset about, you’ll be set. This is called redirection. Of course, the goal is not to distract them so that they never learn, but rather to help them move on from one thing to the next without getting caught in an emotional loop. However, there are some situations where redirecting is less productive. If your child has done something really bad, a strong scolding may be better.


For example, hitting or biting another child may require a scolding, while simply not wanting to share is certainly a good opportunity for redirection.;
, Always explain that and why a toddler shouldn’t do something. When they do something wrong, they need to know that it’s wrong so that they don’t do it again. Don’t make a big production about explaining to them, as this can make it more difficult to redirect them. Just state it simply and help them move on.


For example, if your child is arguing with their sibling about sharing a toy, say: “Oh, we don’t fight with our brothers. We have to share so that everyone gets a turn. You can play with that toy later. How about you and I go play with the bubbles instead?”

, If the tantrum is related to something that they think or feel, it may be possible to redirect the child by forcing them to think about something else. Manually guide their thought process by asking them questions and slowly move the questions away from what they were upset about, until eventually they forget what the original problem was.


For example, if you see your child hit their elbow and a meltdown is on the way, ask if they hurt their toe. Their foot. Their hand. Their belly. Move from body part to body part that you know is not hurt, forcing them to think about the “not in pain” sensations in other parts of their body.

, Another redirection method is to create empathy while moving the child away from an action. This is helpful as a life skill, as it will help them become more considerate of the consequences of their actions for others. The empathy they have does not, necessarily, have to be for a real, living creature either.


“Oh, don’t draw on the couch. That gets the couch dirty and the couch HATES to take a bath. You don’t want to take a bath, do you?”
“Aww, why are you hitting the table. That hurts the table. You don’t like it when your brother hits you, so why would you hit the table? How about we find a pot for you to hit instead?”
“Don’t pull the kitty’s tail, that gives him an owie. We pet the kitty gently, like this. Oh, see, the kitty loves being pet gently. Look at how happy he is. Aw, he’s so happy.”

, When you redirect a child, you need to always give them something else to do. This teaches them to find other things that make them happy, rather than learning to simply sit around being upset about things they can’t have or do. This can be tricky, as sometimes toddlers can be very stubborn, so you’ll just have to know what works best for your child.


Save some activities that your child really enjoys for when they need to be redirected. For example, playing with playdough or blowing bubbles.

, If they’re having a really hard time finding something else to do, try relocating the child so that they have an easier time. Take them out of the room where the thing they want is when you give them something else to do. This way they have fewer visual reminders of what they were focused on.

"
Know when consequences are appropriate.,
Warn children of consequences.,
Match consequences to actions.,
Get everyone on board.",How to Discipline Toddlers2," Generally, it’s a good idea to establish for your child that consequences exist, but you need to do so within reason. If your child has done a particular thing wrong for the first time, or they did something that was okay in one situation but wrong in this one, you should only give them a warning. They’re learning and can’t be expected to read your mind. However, if they repeat a behavior that they know isn’t allowed, consequences should be put in place.

, Before imposing consequences, warn the child that consequences are about to happen. Counting to three is less ideal, since it teaches your child that they do not need to respond to your requests immediately. Instead, tell them that consequences will happen if they do that action and if they don’t immediately stop, it’s time to put those consequences into action.

, The consequences for an action should be proportionate, appropriate and logically related to the action your child took. You do not want your child to become confused about what they did wrong or why it’s wrong. Match the consequences to their actions to help your child learn and keep you from over-reacting in frustration.


For example, if your child throws their dinner when they’re done eating, make them clean it up. However, if they refuse to eat their dinner, then just take it away and give them nothing (or a simple meal of whole grain or other healthy bread and a glass of water).
If they are fighting over a toy, take the toy away for a period of time.
If they refuse to put on a coat, simply let them be cold for a little while.

, Mom, Dad, Grandma, Grandpa, brothers, sisters. All family members need to know that consequences need to be put in place if the child does something wrong. You don’t want your toddler to become used to bad behaviors that they then bring back home or to other environments. This can be tough, but explain that it’s better for everyone and help give them the tools they need to put consequences in place.

"
"
Use time-outs sparingly.,
Have a time-out spot.,
Set a reasonable amount of time.,
Use a timer.,
Give explicit instructions.,
Give yourself a timeout.",How to Discipline Toddlers3," Time-outs can work, especially for children who have a difficult time being redirected, but you should always default to helping them find a better behavior first. You should also be sure that your child is old enough to understand the concept. 2.5 or 3 is when timeouts can generally start, and an especially mature child may be able to start at 2. If they can't sit in timeout without constant supervision, they're probably too young.

, Your child should be doing timeout in a single spot that meets a number of conditions. This spot should not be a place that is used for other things, as your child with end up with negative associations with this place (so don't use their bed). The child should be alone and have nothing to play with so that the experience is negative. The final thing is subject to two schools of thought, so you'll have to experiment to see what is best for you:


Have your child in a room alone, where they cannot see anyone, including you.
Have your child where they can see others playing but where they are not allowed to participate.

, Different ages perceive time differently, so you'll need to leave your child in timeout for a length of time proportionate to their age. The rule varies between 1 minute per year of age, or 1 minute + another for each year of their age (so 3 min for a 2-year-old). Decide which you think is best.

, Having a timer so your child can tell how long they've been in timeout can help them relax (the goal of timeout) and start to behave better. You can get a cute kitchen timer, get a Time Out Pad, or make a ""timer"" by mixing glitter, water, and clear glue in a bottle (shake and when the glitter settles, the time-out is done).

, If you plan on telling your child to apologize or have other requirements for getting out of time out, then you need to be as explicit as you can be in your instructions. If a child thinks they are doing what needs to be done by only doing the minimum, then you will rightfully anger them by ""changing the rules"".


For example, if you tell a child to apologize, you need to tell them how to apologize. Say, ""You need to look at me and tell me that you're sorry"". If you just tell them to apologize and they say sorry to the wall, especially if this is a fairly new concept for them, they are in the right for being angry if you put them back in time out. Remember, they can't read your mind.

, Let the rules apply to you too. This helps model good behavior. If you do something that you've told them not to do and they see you, let them put you in time out. This teaches them about fairness, and will make them better about sitting in time-out themselves.


Ask if you can be done with time-out after 30 seconds. Kids have an iffy perception of time and they'll probably relent.

"
"
Set priorities.,
Avoid empty threats.,
Stand by your punishments.,
Don’t negotiate.,
Establish specific times for different behaviors.",How to Discipline Toddlers4," It's easy to get really frustrated and take it out of your kids, making punishments much harsher than is perhaps appropriate. Avoid this by setting priorities, deciding ahead of time which behaviors get punished most harshly and which only result in a time-out.


Hitting and biting, as well as anything which could cause them serious injury are usually worthy of the more serious punishments, but you will have to decide what is best for you.

, Do not threaten your child with a punishment and then not deliver. This teaches your child not to take you or the possibility of consequences seriously. It is better not to react at all than to threaten and then not do anything.

, Don't feel bad for you child partway in to a punishment and then relent. It can be hard, because you love them and you want them to be happy, but it is important for them to fully experience the punishment and not come to expect that they can manipulate your emotions into getting them out of trouble.

, Negotiating is the quick route to a habitually misbehaving and disobedient child. Just don't. They get what you give them or they get nothing. They'll learn eventually. Be strong.

, Small children will not be able to understand subtleties so try to create a consistent environment by keeping rules the same across basic situations. It is also a good idea to show them that there is a place and time for certain behaviors, so that they don't feel flat-out banned. For example, establish that it is okay to yell but only outside. Try not to add modifiers to rules such as these, since it only confuses them. Wait until they reach around age 4 before adding conditions.

Use physical contact, but not spanking.",How to Discipline Toddlers5," When your child does something bad, don't reward them by giving in or paying a lot of attention to them (even if that attention means yelling at them). They are trying to get your attention, so ""reward"" their behavior by completely ignoring them. If you can, put them where they can't see you, and at a minimum don't make eye contact with them and avoid touching them., When your child does anything right, tell them how happy you are. Children naturally want to please you, so let it show when they do that so that they are more inclined to do that good behavior in the future.

, Or at least, be specific about what you’re praising. Telling your child ""good job"" for everything they do tends to devalue good behavior. Save really serious praise for when they've really earned it. Plus, ""good girl"" or ""good job"" mean little to children. Say it specifically, describing exactly what you love about what the child did. it.Notice that telling them ""Wow, you did a great job!"" is very different from saying ""Oh, Mommy loves it when you do that. That makes Mommy so happy.""

, Sometimes rewards or other positive reinforcement may be in order. It should be used sparingly, saved mainly for occasions where it is easy or especially warranted. For example, sharing toys is worth a reward, such as a piece of candy (because this is something that is very hard for them). The same can be said of potty training.


Toddlers don't need much. An M&M or Smartie should do the trick.

, Absolutely under no circumstances should you bribe a child into appropriate behavior. Negotiations are frowned upon, as this just teaches your child to ignore you until they get what they want, or that if they hold out long enough they can get their way. Once you let it start, it's a very difficult behavior to stop, for both of you. Stay vigilant!

, If you're struggling to get your child's attention, don't resort to spanking. This is a very ineffective technique. Instead, firmly grab an arm or take their face in your hands and make them look at you. The second is especially uncomfortable for toddlers and is much more effective than spanking (without teaching them negative lessons, like ""solve problems with violence"").

Teach toddlers and babies sign language.,
Create a predictable environment.,
Give toddlers choices.,
Give them an outlet for frustration.,
Understand that they are children.",How to Discipline Toddlers6," The main reason why toddlers act out is because they think crying and screaming is the best way to communicate. This is leftover from infancy, when that information was probably accurate. If you want your child to feel like there are better ways to communicate, but they possibly don't have great spoken language, (learn and then) teach them baby sign language. Start as young as you possibly can, and keep it in mind for future children. Signing teaches your child to use ""words"", rather than crying to get what they want.


Sign language does not hinder your child's ability to learn speech normally, so long as you sign and speak at the same time, but it has been proven to aid development of the language center of their brain. This will make them better with language later on in life.

, Another reason why children throw tantrums is because they are confused and can't cope with the negative feeling of disorientation. Avoid this understandable upset by creating an environment in which your toddler encounters relatively little surprise. Keep sleeping and eating schedules regular, as well as schedules relating to daycare or pre-school.

, One of the best ways to prevent behavior problems in toddlers is to give them choices. This allows them to feel independent without having to assert that independence. Give them a limited number of choices in situations where you can, and make negotiating out of those choices not an option.For example, let them choose between peas and noodles for dinner, or rice and broccoli. If they don't want either, then just let them be hungry.
Give them a choice between two shirts when they get dressed in the morning.
Always make choosing sound exciting.

, When they are clearly getting upset, give them healthy ways to release those feelings. Like adults, simply making those feelings stop is very difficult. Teach them early on to do something productive with negative feelings.


For example, let them make angry art. Give them crayon disks and paper and tell them to make an angry picture for you.
You can also let them kick a beanbag.
Another option would be to play a yelling game. Help your child yell, but do so in a silly way so that they just end up laughing.
Singing a song can also be a good option for toddlers. ""If You're Happy and You Know It"" (specifically the verse about feet stomping) is a great option for a frustrated kid.

, At the end of the day, you just have to understand that small children do not have the ability to cope with emotions like you can, and some concessions may have to be made. For example, let your child have a toy while you are running errands, because he or she can't cope with boredom like you can. "
"
Give your child choices when you ask a question.,
Count down if your child resists making a decision.,
Tell your child what you want, rather than what you don’t want.,
Aim for alternative responses.,
Provide a basis for your requests.,
Try to relax.",How to Deal with a Toddler Saying 'No'1," If you don’t give your child a yes or no answer, it will be very hard for her to say ‘no’. Offering your child two choices will help her to feel like she is in control, so she won’t feel as inclined to try to resist.For example:


You can say, “Do you want to brush your teeth now or do you want to brush your teeth after two more minutes of play?” Either way, she will brush her teeth. You can make it funny like “Do you want to take a bath now so you smell good or do you want to take a bath later and smell like Oscar the Grouch?”.;
, If you give your child a choice between two things, but she says no to making the decision, employ the countdown technique. Tell her that you will count to five and then she will need to make a choice or you will make the choice for her.


This might not always work, but it is worth it to give it a try to make your life easier.

, When you use the word ‘no’ all the time, your child is more likely to persist in refusing to do things. When she hears ‘No you can’t eat candy” or “No you can’t run in the house”, it creates an impression that saying no gives the person saying it a voice of authority. Instead, try to be positive and tell your child what you do want her to do.


Instead of saying “Don’t play in the sandbox, you’ll ruin your shirt!” say, “I would really like you to stay inside until I am done so that you don’t get dirt on your nice shirt”.
Keep your tone in mind. If it is not an emergency, stay calm and use a firm tone of voice.

, Try to expand your child’s responses so that she realizes there are other responses besides ‘no’. When she is in a good mood, introduce your child to words like ‘perhaps’, ‘maybe’, and ‘possibly’. Teach your child what these words mean and how to use them. Giving your child other options will at the very least give you a reprieve from the relentless sound of ‘no’.

, Reasoning with your child is possible at this stage. If you give reasons for your requests that are direct, to the point, and short, your child will be more inclined to listen to you. For example:


If you say “Please don’t eat your candy before you go to sleep. You can get a tummy ache later in the night if you do” instead of saying “Don’t eat candy right now! You know it’s time for bed!”. Your toddler is more likely to respond positively to the first statement., Apart from the fact that this phase will eventually wear off, you do have a few tricks up your sleeve to even the playing field. Solving the conflicts that can arise when your child says no all the time can be tricky and tiring. However, it is a normal part of your child growing up, so try to meet this refusal stage head on but with a relaxed manner.


Being too exacting in response to your child’s refusal to do something may make your child feel helpless or more resistant, and may lead to extreme defiant behavior. Instead, try to relax and pick your battles.

Use imitation to your advantage.,
Make your child think that you need her help to do something.,
Hold off tantrums by staying ahead of the game.,
Reward good behavior with affection.,
Try using reverse psychology.",How to Deal with a Toddler Saying 'No'2," Toddlers emulate the adults around them. You can use this to your advantage when your toddler is in the refusal phase. Instead of asking her to do the thing that she has refused to do before, simply do the action in front of her. To add a touch of drama, you can even say something like “It’s the grown up thing to do” while doing the action. For example:


If she doesn’t want to wear her jacket when it’s freezing outside, show her that you are using your jacket because you don’t want to get cold and get sick later on.

, If you pretend like you don’t know what you’re doing and need your child’s help, your child may be more inclined to do the thing that you want her to do. There are three ways that you can do this: being forgetful, being wrong, and being incompetent:


Be forgetful. For example, if your child refuses to put her toys away, pick some of them up yourself and—making sure that she is watching—put them away in weird places, like the laundry bin, cupboard, or under pillows. Your child will likely reprimand you for forgetting where her toys go, and will pick up some of her toys and place them in their proper places.
Be wrong. For example, the next time you foresee a war ensuing during mealtime, start eating her cereal from her plate or bowl and use her utensils. You will most likely hear her say “That’s mine!” and she will then want to eat the remaining cereal so that it does not end up in the wrong tummy. Almost immediately, you will hear another one of their favorite words “That’s mine!” and she’ll get the bowl of cereal from you and eat all of it lest it ends in the wrong tummy – yours.
Be incompetent. For example, wear your shoes on the wrong feet, and make sure that she notices. Say something like, “I’m ready to go to school! Are you?”. Chances are, when your child sees you doing something wrong, she will laugh and correct you. She will then show you what you should have done by putting on her own shoes correctly.

, Most tantrums are caused by hunger, fatigue, or frustration. To avoid these things, set reasonable expectations when it comes to your toddler. Outlining goals for your toddler gives her a clear picture of what the day will be like, instead of letting her assume that after a certain activity, there will be time for ice cream or some other treat. For example:


Before going to the grocery store, set expectations. Tell your child, when she is still in a good mood, that you are just going to buy milk, cereal, fruit, some things for mommy or daddy. Then ask her what she wants (but only give her two choices) and explain what you will both do at the store before you head home. Just before arriving at the store, remind her of what you are getting and what you will get for her based on the choice she made back at home.

, Rewarding toddlers can be tricky because they learn quickly; if they act a certain way and are rewarded with candy, they will assume that they will always get candy when they do that certain behavior. Instead, reward good behavior with hugs, kisses, and cuddles—items that are always readily available.

, Reverse psychology is when you pretend that you don’t want your toddler to do something that you actually really want her to do.This can work in instances where no other option seems obvious and you are getting tired of being refused. For example:


If you want your child to take some medicine and she refuses say something like “But I’m not sure you can drink this medicine to make you better because usually only grownups are brave enough to drink this medicine…” Chances are, she will say she’s old enough and brave enough. Remember to praise her and reward her with affection after she does what you want.

Communicate.,
Be the problem solver.,
Encourage your children, especially when they are having trouble with something.,
Embrace your children often.,
Keep them busy.,
Display model behavior.,
Try deep breathing stimulation.,
Set a healthy sleep routine.,
Seek assistance when needed.",How to Deal with Toddler Worries and Stress," Every day, ask your child to open up to you about his feelings, concerns and worries without any inhibitions. Reassure him constantly and repeat positive affirmations to calm him down.;
, Once your child has communicated the reason for his discomfort to you, try as much as possible to make required amends. Guide him to find possible solutions to minimize the impact of trouble makers!

, Kids can lose their morale very easily. That’s why you must constantly encourage them and praise their efforts. Teach them that failures are a part of learning and growth. Try to build on your child’s positives and avoid picking on his negatives.

, Children love a comforting embrace, especially coming from their parent. Hugging and cuddling makes children feel secure and loved. Physical touch can almost immediately bring down the degree of anxiety your child is experiencing.

, Involve your kids in physically and mentally stimulating activities like sports and crafts. Physical and mental exercises release endorphins which help fight stress and keep your kid happy.

, Parents are role models for kids. They must set an ideal example for kids to follow. Always make sure that whenever you are around your child, you are at your best behavior. Be as composed as possible and you will be surprised to see that your child will stay calm, too.

, Meditation and deep breathing will soothe your child’s senses and put him in a state of tranquility. Teach your kid the simple drill of slow, in and out breathing. Ask him to close his eyes and visualize a serene and peaceful set-up while doing so.

, Bad sleeping patterns can cause irritability and mood swings among children. Fix a bedtime for your child and keep it consistent, with very rare disruptions. Start preparing him for bedtime an hour earlier as this will help him slip into the sleep mode easily.

, There’s no need to shy from seeking assistance of a counselor or pediatrician in case your child seems to be very troubled. Experts will provide you some great insights about the do’s and don’ts to keep in mind while approaching sensitive issues with your child.

Prevent the unwanted behavior.,
Remove your toddler.,
Trade with your older toddler.,
Give them something else to do.,
Offer a new toy, object or person to interact with.,
Choose toys that stimulate your toddler.",How to Discipline Toddlers Using Distraction1," Preventing the unwanted behavior before it starts avoids the problem in the first place. Distract your toddler when you notice them heading for something that's out of bounds For example, if your toddler is walking over towards the cords behind your mother's entertainment center, get your toddler to play with you in another room.
Living spaces with young children need to be designed with safety in mind. This means things like safeguarding electrical outlets, securing furniture and screens on walls, and keeping potentially hazardous objects (lamps, medications, scissors) out of the reach (and climbing ability) of young children.;
, Your toddler may not stop handling the item or stop the unwanted behavior on their own. You will need to step in and remove your toddler from the situation or take the item away. At this point, your toddler will probably be very upset, but better upset than in danger. They will get over it quickly too.


Tell your child no firmly but gently and immediately remove the item. In time, your child will recognize what no in this situation means. It is OK to add a short explanation, (""Hot!"" ""That's not food!"" ""Ouchie!""). Do not expect the toddler to always respond to ""no"" but it is a start.
Do not get upset at the young child while removing them from the situation. The youngster is simply being a curious child, as he or she is supposed to. He or she does not understand why it is OK one moment to explore and not OK the next and that is frustrating.

, This is a technique that can distract and redirect your child. Older toddlers often love exchanging one item for another, especially for something that seems intrinsically better. The child needs to have some experience with what ""trade"" means (I give you something and you give me something) for this to work.Example: Alonzo (aged 2 1/2) finds a pair of scissors. His father gets a strawberry, comes up to him, and asks, ""Trade?"" Alonzo nods happily and hands his father the scissors.

, Older toddlers can be easily redirected by asking them to do something for you. Have a simple task they can do easily. It can be a make work task and not something that actually needs done. Good tasks include: ""Get daddy's cell phone,"" ""Find my purse,"" and ""Let's feed the cat.""You can have them bring you a book, stack blocks, or put clothes into a hamper.
Try modelling the behavior physically, so your child knows what you are asking them to do. Remember that just words alone are not as effective as words and actions.
For example: Sonya (aged 18 months) is throwing toys out of frustration. Her sitter says, ""Hey Sonya, let's get your coat and go outside. I'm going to the door to get my coat. See me put on my coat? Now you get on your coat."" Sonya sees her sitter and follows her on this more interesting thing to do.

, Set out baskets or containers full of items to distract your toddler. This way, you can quickly grab a toy or object to hand to your toddler, if they begin to play with something that's off limits. Try to offer toys that your child doesn't always have access to.


You can also rotate out toys, so your child can play with a familiar toy that they haven't seen in a while.
Try distracting your toddler by doing something unexpected. You can sing, do a puppet show, or anything that's not startling or scary.

, Try to have several items or toys that your toddler could be curious about. These don't need to be toys. You could offer items that have different textures, items that stack, or materials they can use to create something. Keep a few of these items on hand to distract:


Beads in a variety of sizes
Cloths with different textures
Pom poms and pipe cleaners
A small jar filled with dry noodles to shake
Measuring cups or spoons to stack

Remain calm if it is not a real emergency.,
Be consistent.,
Interact with your toddler.,
Avoid punishing or shaming the toddler.,
Use positive reinforcement.",How to Discipline Toddlers Using Distraction2," If your toddler is reaching for something that's off limits, it's easy to over-react by yelling to get their attention. Avoid yelling or overreacting, since this may frighten your toddler and make them focus on you rather than what you're saying. Instead, react with calmness.For example, you could firmly, but gently, say, ""No! Don't pull the cat's tail.That hurts Fluffy."" And separate the child from Fluffy, and demonstrate how to pet gently.
In a real emergency it is OK to react accordingly.

, Instead of expecting an instant change in behavior, plan on guiding their behavior as it develops. Young children are still learning cause and effect, so you'll need to consistently respond to unwanted behaviors. For example, if you don't want your child to pull the cat's whiskers, you'll need to separate them every time you see the toddler going near the cat's face.Remember to set an example for your toddler. If you tell them not to play with electrical cords, try not to handle the electrical cords in your child's presence.

, Engaging right away with your toddler is a great way to distract them. Get down on their level and play a silly game (like peekaboo), start dancing with them, or just tickle them. You could encourage your child to chase you or play with toys together.


Try to do an activity that your child enjoys. For example, your toddler might want to cuddle and read a story with you.

, Young children are constantly learning about their surroundings. Never punish your toddler for exploring their environment. Since your toddler won't understand why you're yelling or shaming them, this behavior will only make them frightened of you. Instead, gently, but firmly, remove them and immediately distract them.If you're concerned about your child getting into something dangerous, ensure that all harmful materials and items are stored out of your child's reach.

, Praise your toddler for good behavior. Be specific in your praise, so they learn what kind of behavior you expect. For example, you could say, ""Those were nice pets you gave the cat,"" instead of just saying, ""Good job.""Be in the habit of catching good behavior, instead of waiting to discipline them for unwanted behavior.
Pay attention to good behavior. Young children learn quickly what sort of actions gather attention. Whether it is good or bad attention is of secondary concern. If you pay more attention to your child when being good than bad, they will act out less often to get your attention.

Realize that very young children do not have impulse control.,
Recognize that very young children can really have only one thing in mind at a time.,
Use distraction for young children; it will not work forever.,
Do not rely too much on language.,
Keep in mind that toddlers mostly react to the immediate environment.",How to Discipline Toddlers Using Distraction3," A young toddler has little to no ability to control urges, impulses, and behavior. While they may demonstrate some it will be inconsistent at best. Expecting your very young children to have self-control when it is not age appropriate sets parents up for frustration when it is, in fact, completely normal and natural., The attention span of a toddler is very short, only a few minutes. Although a child can be very persistent in achieving an objective, once sidetracked a toddler is unlikely to remember their original goal.


By the time they're two years old, most toddlers can pay attention to an activity for 3 to 6 minutes., As a child grows older, they will be less able to be distracted. As a child develops, they need to have limits, consequences for negative behavior, and so on.


Eventually, you'll need to guide your child's behavior directly. Try to directly confront their desires and curiosity. This may mean exploring a similar (but safer) item together., A toddler generally understands more language than they can verbalize, but toddlers vary a lot in verbal comprehension. Too much reliance on language by adults will often lead to frustration on everyone's part. Keep in mind that small children will pick up on the rhythm and tone of your words, so be firm when speaking to your toddler.The younger the child, the simpler the language. A very young child will understand ""No! Ouchie!"" better than ""Sharp knife! That's dangerous!""
Use simple language first, then follow up with a short explanation for older toddlers: ""No! Ouchie! Knives are sharp and dangerous!"" This builds vocabulary and the idea there is a reason behind the ""no""-- you are not just saying no without a reason.

, Whatever is present in front of them has attention. Although toddlers can hold a ""mental image"" in memory it is not as strong as whatever is going on in front of them. As your toddler grows, they may become irritated or upset when the object is removed.""Out of sight, out of mind"" is extremely true of toddlers. The cookie package on the counter will draw the interest of a young child, while the cookies put away in the cabinet will not--even if he or she was at the store when the cookies were purchased.
